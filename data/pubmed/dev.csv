"The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is estimated to be about 13.4% worldwide. Studies have shown that CKD accounts for up to 2% of the health cost burden. Various factors, such as genetic polymorphisms, metabolic disorders, and unhealthy lifestyles, can contribute to the occurrence of CKD. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the relationship between renal function and cardiometabolic risk factors, anthropometric characteristics, and the dietary inflammatory index (DII) in an Iranian population."
"Most of the evidence on risk factors for COVID-19 complications comes from North America or Europe with very little research from Latin-America. We aimed to evaluate the association between sociodemographic, clinical factors and the risk of COVID-19 complications among adults in Chile, the fifth Latin-American country with more COVID-19 reported cases since de beginning of the Pandemic."
"Emulating the vast inclusion of advanced technology in everyday practice, the medical world is no exception to its implementation, in particular, virtual reality (VR). Initially, its introduction as a therapy was accompanied by high aspirations and expectations for its growth and potential. Motivation is said to be the most associated benefit; although it is imperative to note that there exists a paucity of research that specifically quantifies its tangible impact on cerebral palsy (CP). There has yet to be a systematic review of the instruments used to precisely measure motivation and examine its association with the benefits of VR for children with cerebral palsy."
"Robotic joint surgery (RJS) has demonstrated high precision and reproducibility in total hip and knee arthroplasty,the integration of artificial intelligence(AI) has further enhanced the intelligence level of key processes,including surgical planning,registration,surgical manipulator control,and robot autonomy. AI-powered surgical planning improves implant positioning accuracy through deep learning,while AI-powered registration overcomes the limitations of traditional methods in precision and efficiency. Additionally,reinforcement learning and neural networks have optimized surgical manipulator control,improving operational accuracy and human-robot interaction. As AI continues to advance,RJS is expected to make significant strides in automation,multimodal sensing,and human-robot collaboration,driving arthroplasty surgeries toward higher levels of intelligence and individual treatment."

"Education for patients with type 2 diabetes is an essential part of the treatment and control process. This study aimed to determine the effect of education based on health literacy strategies on adherence to treatment and quality of life in type 2 diabetic patients. This classic experimental study was performed on 94 patients with type 2 diabetes selected by convenient sampling method and then randomly allocated to intervention and control groups. The research instruments were a demographic information questionnaire, a Diabetes Quality of Life Brief Clinical Inventory, and an adherence to treatment questionnaire in patients with chronic disease. The educational intervention was five sessions of the virtual class of 80-90 min. All respondents completed the tools again two months after the intervention. Independent t-tests and paired t-tests were used for data analysis. The difference in the mean score of quality of life in the intervention group between the time before (53.21 ± 7.6) the intervention and two months after (55.28 ± 6.87) was statistically significant (p˂0.05). Comparison of the mean score of quality of life between the control and intervention groups, before the intervention (p > 0.05) and two months after (p > 0.05), neither showed a statistically significant difference. A comparison of the mean scores of adherence to treatment before (69.31 ± 5.32) and after the intervention (70.59 ± 5.21) showed that there was a statistically significant difference in the intervention group (p˂0.001). Comparison of the mean scores of adherence two months after the intervention revealed that, there is a significant statistical difference between the scores of the two groups (p˂ 0.001). Based on the findings of this study, it seems that providing training sessions based on health literacy strategies can improve the quality of life and adherence to treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes."

"Paired single-cell and spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) data supplement each other, providing in-depth insights into biological processes and disease mechanisms. Previous SRT databases have limitations in curating sufficient single-cell and SRT pairs (SC-SP pairs) and providing real-time heuristic analysis, which hinder the effort to uncover potential biological insights. Here, we developed Pairpot (http://pairpot.bioxai.cn), a database tailored for paired single-cell and SRT data with real-time heuristic analysis. Pairpot curates 99 high-quality pairs including 1,425,656 spots from 299 datasets, and creates the association networks. It constructs the curated pairs by integrating multiple slices and establishing potential associations between single-cell and SRT data. On this basis, Pairpot adopts semi-supervised learning that enables real-time heuristic analysis for SC-SP pairs where Lasso-View refines the user-selected SRT domains within milliseconds, Pair-View infers cell proportions of spots based on user-selected cell types in real-time and Layer-View displays SRT slices using a 3D hierarchical layout. Experiments demonstrated Pairpot's efficiency in identifying heterogeneous domains and cell proportions."

"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are membrane-spanning transducers mediating the actions of numerous physiological ligands and drugs. The GPCR database GPCRdb supports a large global research community with reference data, analysis, visualization, experiment design and dissemination. Here, we describe our sixth major GPCRdb release starting with an overview of all resources for receptors and ligands. As a major addition, all ∼400 human odorant receptors and their orthologs in major model organisms can now be studied across the various data and tool resources. For the first time, a Data mapper page enables users to map their own data onto receptors visualized as a GPCRome wheel, tree, clusters, list or heatmap. The structure model data have been expanded with models of physiological ligand complexes and updated with new state-specific structure models of all human GPCRs (built using AlphaFold, RoseTTAFold and AlphaFold-Multistate). Furthermore, a structure or model (pdb file) can now be queried against GPCRdb's entire structure/model collection through a Structuresimilarity search page implementing FoldSeek. Finally, for ligands, new search tools can query names, database identifiers, similarities or substructures against integrated entries from the ChEMBL, Guide to Pharmacology, PDSP Ki, PubChem, DrugCentral and DrugBank databases. GPCRdb is available at https://gpcrdb.org."
"Inhibition of CD95/Fas activation is currently under clinical investigation as a therapy for glioblastoma multiforme and preclinical studies suggest that disruption of the CD95-CD95L interaction could also be a strategy to treat inflammatory and neurodegenerative disorders. Besides neutralizing anti-CD95L/FasL antibodies, mainly CD95ed-Fc, a dimeric Fc fusion protein of the extracellular domain of CD95 (CD95ed), is used to prevent CD95 activation. In view of the fact that full CD95 activation requires CD95L-induced CD95 trimerization and clustering of the resulting liganded CD95 trimers, we investigated whether fusion proteins of the extracellular domain of CD95 with a higher valency than CD95ed-Fc have an improved CD95L-neutralization capacity. We evaluated an IgG1(N297A)-based tetravalent CD95ed fusion protein which was obtained by replacing the variable domains of IgG1(N297A) with CD95ed (CD95ed-IgG1(N297A)) and a hexavalent variant obtained by fusion of CD95ed with a TNC-Fc(DANA) scaffold (CD95ed-TNC-Fc(DANA)) promoting hexamerization. The established N297A and DANA mutations were used to minimize FcγR binding of the constructs under maintenance of neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) binding. Size exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography indicated effective assembly of CD95ed-IgG1(N297A). More important, CD95ed-IgG1(N297A) was much more efficient than CD95ed-Fc in protecting cells from cell death induction by human and murine CD95L. Surprisingly, despite its hexavalent structure, CD95ed-TNC-Fc(DANA) displayed an at best minor improvement of the capacity to neutralize CD95L suggesting that besides valency, other factors, such as spatial organization and agility of the CD95ed domains, play also a role in neutralization of CD95L trimers by CD95ed fusion proteins. More studies are now required to evaluate the superior CD95L-neutralizing capacity of CD95ed-IgG1(N297A) in vivo."

"Post-translational modifications (PTMs) alter protein conformation by covalently attaching functional groups to substrates, influencing their biological activity, mechanisms of action, and functional performance. PTMs and their interactions are essential to many critical signal transduction processes, including tumor transformation, cancer progression, and metastasis in pancreatic cancer. Additionally, advancements in tumor immunotherapy indicate that PTMs are essential in immune cell activation, transport, and energy metabolism. This study aimed to investigate the effects of different PTMs on immunotherapy for pancreatic cancer, providing new perspectives and suggesting directions for future research."
"Hemodynamics is important in the initiation, growth, and rupture of intracranial aneurysms. Since intracranial aneurysms are small, a high-field MR system with high spatial resolution and high SNR is desirable for this hemodynamic analysis. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the accuracy of MR fluid dynamic (MRFD) results based on 3D phase-contrast MR (3D PC MR, non-electrocardiogram[ECG]-gated 4D Flow MRI) data from a human cerebrovascular phantom and human healthy subjects obtained by a 7T MR system was superior to those by a 3T MR system."
"India is undergoing a significant demographic shift with a growing older population, leading to an anticipated increase in people with dementia. Family caregivers, who are predominantly informal, carry the burden of care within households, facing numerous challenges that impact their well-being. Despite the cultural emphasis on family support, there is a lack of targeted interventions for caregivers in India. The WHO emphasises the importance of caregiver support, and recent advancements in information and communication technology, particularly mobile health (mHealth), offer promising avenues to address this need. This study protocol outlines an Indo-Sweden collaborative effort, funded by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) Forte, to develop and assess the effectiveness of a mHealth application designed to improve caregiving skills, reduce caregiver burden and support family caregivers of persons with dementia."
"Selenium (Se) exists in a dispersed state with low abundance in the environment, of which nutritional supply is generally inadequate globally. Cultivating Se-enriched crops using limited natural Se resources may be a feasible solution to mitigate this inadequacy. Herein, maize grain and Chinese cabbage harvested from a representative area with localized Se enrichment were selected. Concentration level and enrichment mechanism of Se were investigated. Results indicated that Se concentrations in the crops cultivated in the subareas influenced by Se-enriched bedrock weathering or industrial contamination can reach the enrichment level. Gray relation analysis results suggested that Se concentrations were mainly controlled by bioavailable fraction of Se in soil. The subordinate factors included chemical weathering degree and pH condition of cultivated soil, redox potential of irrigation water and atmospheric deposition. A Monte Carlo simulation-based health risk assessment verified the feasibility of cultivating Se-enriched crops without substantial health risk under regional Se-deficient background."
"Physical exercise has been shown to induce epigenetic modifications with various health implications, directly affect DNA methylation (DNAm), as well as reverse the epigenetic age. Hence, we aimed to identify differential methylation changes and assess the epigenetic age in the saliva of 7-9-year-old school children following a 3-month integrated neuromuscular training (INT), as well as to explore if any of the methylation changes are in core genes. Core genes are defined as genes of high relevance and essential importance within the human genome. Forty children (17 boys and 23 girls) were recruited from schools in Girona, Spain, and allocated into control (N = 20) or INT (N = 20) group. The INT group performed a 3-month INT as a warm-up during the physical education (PE) classes, encompassing strength, coordination, dynamic stabilization, plyometrics, speed, and agility exercises, whereas the control group performed traditional warm-up activities, encompassing aerobic exercises that will prepare the cardiovascular system and increase the joint mobility for the upcoming effort during the class. Genome-wide DNAm analysis was performed with the Illumina 900 K microarray. Core genes were recognized based on the accomplishment of a rigorous and widely accepted 3-point criteria: participation in the enriched pathways, high connectivity (≥ 10), and target genes of key transcription factors. There were 1200 differentially methylated positions (DMPs) in the control group and 414 DMPs in the INT group (FDR < 0.05, p < 0.05, Aβ < |0.1|), suggesting a non-significant trend of epigenetic age acceleration in the control group (1.18 months, p > 0.05) and a non-significant 1-month decrease of the epigenetic age in the INT group (p > 0.05). The genes with DMPs in the control group showed low similarity between enriched pathways and low interconnectivity, encompassing distinct pathways, mostly development and growth-related. Additionally, no core genes were identified in the control group. Interestingly, the genes with DMPs in the INT group showed high similarity between enriched pathways and high interconnectivity, encompassing related pathways involving signaling mechanisms, as well as hormone and protein metabolism pathways. Moreover, 17 DMPs in the children from the INT group were in core genes. The main findings of the present study are suggesting an integrated response to the training stimulus in 7-9-year-old school children that performed a 3-month INT, including epigenetic modifications in 17 genes considered as core genes. Trial Registration: The study protocol was registered in the ISRCTN registry (ISRCTN16744821)."
"Dysregulation of copper metabolism is intricately associated with the occurrence and therapeutic management of colorectal cancer. Previous studies have attempted to induce cuproptosis by delivering lethal doses of copper ions into tumor cells, often with systemic safety risks. In vivo, transformable peptide is modular and designed for various tumor-related proteins, which can affect protein function and distribution. Here, a fibrillar transformation peptidic (FTP) nanoparticle is synthesized, which can bind ATP7B membrane proteins (cuprous ions transporter) and transform into nanofibrils/ATP7B clusters, inducing ""copper-free cuproptosis"" in vivo. Without adding exogenous copper ions, the spherical FTP nanoparticles bound the high distribution regions of ATP7B membrane proteins, transforming into fibrillar networks in situ with prolonged retention. The cage-like fibrillar network would further capture unbound or newly generated free ATP7B membrane proteins, thereby significantly and consistently preventing cuprous ions efflux. The FTP nanoparticles would not undergo in situ fibrillar transformation on the low expression region of ATP7B membrane proteins but enter the cell for safe degradation, which exhibited high specificity and safety in vivo. By disrupting intracellular copper homeostasis, the transformable fibrillar clusters displayed a long-term anti-tumor effect on subcutaneous transplantation and liver metastatic CRC models."

"Mercury, a potent toxin that poses serious risks to human health, particularly for pregnant women and young children, is widely present due to artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM), which impacts water quality. The objective of this study was to evaluate methylmercury exposure among pregnant women in communities downstream from ASGM sites. We characterized hair total mercury (THg) concentrations among 148 pregnant women across 24 communities in the Tumbes region of Peru, downstream from ASGM sites in Ecuador. Using purposeful sampling, we classified communities into three exposure risk zones: Puyango-Tumbes River watershed, Coast, and Zarumilla. The mean THg concentration was 2.08 µg/g ± 1.36, with 45% of participants (67/148) exceeding UNEP/WHO exposure limits (>2.0 µg/g). The median was 1.84 with an interquartile range (IQR) from 1.01 to 2.83. Median THg levels were significantly higher in the Puyango-Tumbes River region (2.72 µg/g; IQR: 1.66-3.55) compared with Zarumilla (1.61 µg/g; IQR: 0.67-2.63; P = 0.001) and to the Coast (1.71 µg/g; IQR: 1.13-2.50; P = 0.01), suggesting that living close to the Puyango-Tumbes River may be associated with a higher mercury exposure risk. After controlling for potential confounders, individuals in the Puyango-Tumbes watershed exhibited a significant 57% higher expected geometric mean of hair THg compared with Zarumilla (95% CI: 0.1-146.2%). These findings underscore the importance of identifying high-risk regional populations and ongoing biomonitoring of the Puyango-Tumbes River watershed."
"The effect of essential oils (EOs) of 22 species and varieties of essential oil plants on the mental performance of elderly people when they inhaled air containing EOs in a gaseous state at a concentration of 1 mg/m3 of air was studied. For the study, a word recognition test with missing letters and a proofreading test were used. It has been established that recognition of words with missing letters is stimulated for a short (10-20 min) duration of exposure to EOs, and then the effect fades away. On the contrary, the greatest increase in the pace of performing the correction test occurs during the 30-minute period of exposure to EOs. EOs of rosemary, garden savory, catnip, small marigolds, peppermint varieties Udaychanka and Ukrainian, and cloves accelerate both the recognition of words with missing letters (with short-term exposure to EO) and the speed of completing the proofreading test (with long-term exposure to EO)."
"With the increased life expectancy of people with cystic fibrosis (CF), clinical attention has focused on prevention and treatment of non-pulmonary comorbidities. CF-related bone disease (CFBD) is a common complication and leads to increased fracture rates. Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is the recommended and gold standard technique to identify and monitor bone health. However, DXA has limitations because of its two-dimensional nature. Complementary tools to DXA are available, such as trabecular bone score (TBS) and vertebral fracture assessment (VFA). Quantitative computed tomography (QCT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and quantitative ultrasound (QUS) may also be useful."
"The effects of creativity on well-being have been supported by many studies, but the mechanisms involved have not been fully studied. This study used the Creative Conceptual Behavioral Scale, the Well-Being Scale, and the Meaning of Life Questionnaire to survey 1124 college students, in order to explore the mechanism of creativity's influence on well-being from the perspective of meaning in life. The results showed that: (1) There was a bipartite positive correlation between creativity, well-being and meaning of life; and (2) meaning in life played a partial mediating role between creativity and well-being, that is to say, creativity not only directedly influenced well-being but also indirectedly influenced well-being through meaning in life. This study reveals the effect of creativity on well-being and its mechanism theoretically, which has certain practical reference value for the education of meaning in life for college students."

"Sexual reproduction first appeared in unicellular protists and has continued to be an essential biological process in almost all eukaryotes. Ciliated protists, which contain both germline and somatic genomes within a single cell, have evolved a special form of sexual reproduction called conjugation that involves mitosis, meiosis, fertilization, nuclear differentiation, genome rearrangement, and the development of unique cellular structures. The molecular basis and mechanisms of conjugation vary dramatically among ciliates, and many details of the process and its regulation are still largely unknown. In order to better comprehend these processes and mechanisms from an evolutionary perspective, this study provides the first comprehensive overview of the transcriptome and proteome profiles during the entire life cycle of the newly-established marine model ciliate Euplotes vannus. Transcriptome analyses from 14 life cycle stages (three vegetative stages and 11 sexual stages) revealed over 26,000 genes that are specifically expressed at different stages, many of which are related to DNA replication, transcription, translation, mitosis, meiosis, nuclear differentiation, and/or genome rearrangement. Quantitative proteomic analyses identified 338 proteins with homologs associated with conjugation and/or somatic nuclear development in other ciliates, including dicer-like proteins, Hsp90 proteins, RNA polymerase II and transcription elongation factors, ribosomal-associated proteins, and ubiquitin-related proteins. Four of these homologs belong to the PIWI family, each with different expression patterns identified and confirmed by RT-qPCR, which may function in small RNA-mediated genome rearrangement. Proteins involved in the nonhomologous end-joining pathway are induced early during meiosis and accumulate in the developing new somatic nucleus, where more than 80% of the germline sequences are eliminated from the somatic genome. A number of new candidate genes and proteins likely to play roles in conjugation and its related genome rearrangements have also been revealed. The gene expression profiles reported here will be valuable resources for further studies of the origin and evolution of sexual reproduction in this new model species."
"One of the unavoidable issues with the bio-scaffolding process is the collapse of the visually appealing external three-dimensional (3D) sponge-like structure and the internal porous and multilayered morphology of a gas-foamed nanofibrous scaffold. Herein, a gas-foamed polycaprolactone/cellulose (g-PCL/CL) nanofibers scaffold is first prepared by electrospinning PCL/cellulose acetate, followed by deacetylation and then Sodium borohydride-assisted gas-foaming technique. The deformed 3D architecture of g-PCL/CL nanofiber is finally reconstructed by mixing it with chitosan (CS) solution and molding. This straightforward method leverages the mechanical strength of PCL, the hydrophilic properties of CL, and the curing characteristics of chitosan. The physical characterization validated the successful reformation of the 3D architecture of the CS + PCL/CL scaffold demonstrating the unique porous interior structure assembled with nanofiber-reinforced pore walls. This molding process with chitosan solution enables the formation of mechanically enhanced 3D scaffolds with improved structural integrity, as evidenced by the increased compressive strength of the CS + PCL/CL scaffold (~95 kPa). In vitro studies further demonstrate improved cell adhesion, differentiation, and proliferation for the CS + PCL/CL scaffold. These findings suggest that the structurally reconstructed CS + PCL/CL composite scaffold possesses suitable characteristics to act as a potential bioscaffold, paving the way for promising strategies to retain the structural integrity of collapse scaffolds."
"Sexual boredom in women is associated with various levels and dimensions of sexual desire, as well as lower sexual and relationship satisfaction. However, the directionality of these relationships remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate whether sexual boredom mediates the relationship between partner and attractive-other sexual desire and sexual and relationship satisfaction in a sample of 1155 Portuguese women in long-term monogamous relationships. Participants, aged 18-66 years (M = 31.60, SD = 5.65), were involved in cohabiting relationships of 1 year or more. Linear regression analysis and Structural Equation Modeling were conducted, revealing that sexual boredom emerged as a stronger predictor of sexual and relationship satisfaction compared to dimensions of sexual desire. Additionally, sexual boredom partially mediated the relationship between partnered sexual desire and satisfaction and fully mediated the relationship between attractive other-related sexual desire and satisfaction variables. Notably, sexual boredom explained up to one-third of sexual satisfaction (32%) and slightly less of relationship satisfaction (27%). These findings underscore the importance of addressing sexual boredom in long-term relationships to promote women's sexual health. Furthermore, they suggest that experiencing sexual desire for attractive non-partners is not indicative of sexual and relationship dissatisfaction unless accompanied by sexual boredom."
"Smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) patients are a heterogeneous group with variable prognosis. A subset of SMM patients have a higher risk of progressing to multiple myeloma (MM) within 2 years. The definition of high-risk patients is not consistent among different risk models, and the combination of various biomarkers and new technologies improves the predictive performance of risk models. In clinical research, different risk models are often combined and applied. New drugs for treating MM are gradually being applied in the treatment of high-risk SMM. Single or dual drug therapy prolongs the progression free survival of patients, but most studies have not yet shown an overall survival benefit for patients. Multi drug combination and intensive treatment can achieve deep relief in high-risk SMM, but most of the studies are single arm studies, which are not yet sufficient to prove that multi drug treatment is more effective than lower intensity treatment. Further exploration of treatment plans for high-risk SMM patients is still needed. This article reviews the progress in risk stratification and treatment of high-risk SMM."
"A novel series of steroidal β-carboline quaternary ammonium derivatives (SCQADs) derived from natural cholic acid and its derivatives was designed, synthesized and biologically evaluated against four Gram-positive bacteria for the first time. Most of these derivatives exhibited promising antibacterial activity against the tested strains, particularly, compound 21g displayed strong antibacterial activity against MRSA (MIC = 0.5-1 μg/mL) with low cytotoxicity. Meanwhile, derivative 21g was able to quickly kill Gram-positive bacteria within 0.5 h without inducing bacterial resistance. Preliminary mechanistic explorations indicated that compound 21g destroyed bacterial cell membranes to exert its antibacterial effects. Moreover, 21g exhibited high in vivo efficacy and high survival protection in a mouse skin abscess model. These findings suggested that compound 21g has great potential to develop as an antibacterial agent."

"Cancer immunotherapy using immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has revolutionized cancer treatment. However, patients with multiple myeloma (MM) rarely respond to ICB. Accumulating evidence indicates that the complicated tumor microenvironment (TME) significantly impacts the efficacy of ICB therapy. Therefore, investigating how TME components in MM influence ICB treatment is urgent."
"Osteotomies around the knee have a variety of indications, including pain reduction, functional improvement, knee joint stabilization, and articular cartilage preservation. Thorough preoperative planning is essential, including a determination of the precise location of any deformity (proximal tibia, distal femur, or both). High tibial osteotomies and distal femoral osteotomies can be performed in isolation, or jointly in the form of a double-level osteotomy, for correction of coronal and/or sagittal deformity of the knee. There are many technical tips and tricks to simplify these cases for safe and effective execution, including selection of the proper procedure for a given deformity, selection of optimal osteotomy hinge points, and soft-tissue handling for different surgical approaches."
"Background Paradoxical flare of pemphigus following rituximab infusion has been reported previously, however, its incidence or risk factors have not been studied in detail. Objectives To evaluate the clinical and immunological predictors associated with post-rituximab paradoxical pemphigus flare. Materials and Methods This was a prospective cohort study including adult patients with pemphigus vulgaris or foliaceus who were treated with rituximab. Patients were administered 1000 mg of intravenous rituximab on days 0 and 14 (Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) protocol), with or without oral prednisolone and/or conventional immunosuppressive agents. Baseline clinical and immunological predictors of post-rituximab pemphigus flares were assessed. Results Fifty patients (mean age 40.44 ± 12.36 years) with a mean pemphigus disease area index (PDAI) score of 27.8 ± 15.48 were administered rituximab. Post-rituximab flare occurred in 10 (20%) patients after a mean of 14.1 ± 4.33 days after the first rituximab infusion. The mean baseline PDAI score (36.4 ± 11.7 vs. 25.6 ± 15.7, P = 0.02) and serum anti-Dsg1 levels (1216.8 ± 850.1 vs. 592 ± 562.12 RU/mL, P = 0.03) were statistically significantly higher in patients experiencing a flare. Using ROC-curve analysis, a PDAI score of ≥28 (OR 8.3, 95% CI 1.5-44.7) was 80% sensitive and 67.5% specific in predicting post-rituximab flare, while serum anti-Dsg1 level of ≥1137.78 RU/ml had a sensitivity of 60% and specificity of 85%. There was no significant difference in terms of affected body surface area, type of pemphigus, starting prednisolone dose, oral immunosuppressive adjuvant, serum anti-Dsg3, serum anti-AchRM3, and peripheral CD19+ B cell population. Limitations Our study is limited by a relatively small sample size. Immunological factors were not evaluated at the time of pemphigus flare. Though these unexpected pemphigus flares are likely to be associated with rituximab infusion, the possibility of spontaneous disease exacerbation cannot be entirely excluded. Conclusions Patients with more severe pemphigus or high serum anti-Dsg1 are at risk of post-rituximab paradoxical flare, and may benefit from rituximab administration under close monitoring."
Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive therapy-resistant brain tumour that may impacts the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The BBB is a protective barrier of the central nervous system formed mainly by endothelial cells. This study aimed to investigate the in vitro effect of GBM cells on the BBB.
"This case report presents a patient with pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with RUNX1∷MTG16, admitted to the Blood Disease Hospital of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences in October 2023. He was 13 years old, with a chief complaint of fatigue for 20 days. Bone marrow smear revealed 17.0% blasts, the karyotype was 46,XY,t (16; 21) (q24; q22), molecular biology demonstrated RUNX1∷MTG16 fusion gene, combined with FLT3-ITD mutation. The child was diagnosed with AML (with RUNX1 ∷ MTG16). Complete remission was achieved after chemotherapy induction. The induction therapy regimen was mitoxantrone hydrochloride liposomes combined with cytarabine (MA). The RUNX1 ∷ MTG16 and FLT3-ITD were negative after another MA treatment course. However, the RUNX1 ∷ MTG16 and FLT3-ITD were turning positive during the following intensive treatment, and he then successfully underwent matched sibling donor umbilical cord blood transplantation."
"Understanding the distribution and variation in inflammatory markers is crucial for advancing our knowledge of inflammatory processes and evaluating their clinical utility in diagnosing and monitoring acute and chronic disease. 1H NMR spectroscopy of blood plasma and serum was applied to measure a composite panel of inflammatory markers based on acute phase glycoprotein signals (GlycA and GlycB) and sub-regions of the lipoprotein derived Supramolecular Phospholipid Composite signals (SPC1, SPC2 and SPC3) to establish normal ranges in two healthy, predominantly white cohorts from Australia (n = 398) and Spain (n = 80; ages 20-70 years). GlycA, GlycB, SPC1 and SPC3 were not significantly impacted by age or sex, but SPC2 (an HDL-related biomarker) was significantly higher in women across all age ranges by an average of 33.7%. A free-living Australian population cohort (n = 3945) was used to explore the relationship of BMI with the panel of inflammatory markers. The glycoprotein signals were directly associated with BMI with GlycB levels being significantly higher for women in all BMI classes. Conversely, SPC2 was found to be inversely associated with BMI and differed significantly between the sexes at each BMI category (normal weight p = 3.46x10-43, overweight p = 3.33x10-79, obese p = 2.15x10-64). SPC1 and SPC3 were markedly less affected by BMI changes. Given the significant association between SPC2 and sex, these data suggest that men and women should be modelled independently for NMR-determined inflammatory biomarkers, or that data should be corrected for sex."

"Fusarium head blight (FHB), mainly caused by Fusarium graminearum and Fusarium culmorum, is a major wheat disease. Significant efforts have been made to improve resistance to FHB in bread wheat (Triticum aestivum), but more work is needed for durum wheat (Triticum turgidum spp. durum). Bread wheat has ample genetic variation for resistance breeding, which can be readily exploited, while durum wheat is characterized by higher disease susceptibility and fewer valuable resistance sources. The Wheat Initiative - Expert Working Group on Durum Wheat Genomics and Breeding has promoted a scientific discussion to define the key actions that should be prioritized for achieving resistance in durum wheat comparable to that found in bread wheat. Here, a detailed state of the art and novel tools to improve FHB resistance in durum are presented, together with a perspective on the next steps forward. A meta-analysis grouping all quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with FHB resistance in both bread and durum wheat has been conducted to identify hotspot regions that do not overlap with Rht alleles, which are known to negatively correlate with FHB resistance. A detailed list of QTL related to FHB resistance and deoxynivalenol contamination and durum lines carrying different sources of FHB resistance are provided as a strategic resource. QTL, closely linked markers and durum wheat lines carrying the useful alleles, can be selected to design an effective breeding program. Finally, we highlight the priority actions that should be implemented to achieve satisfactory resistance to FHB in durum wheat."
"Diabetic patients develop wounds that exhibit delayed healing, prolonged inflammatory responses, and slower epithelialization kinetics compared to non-diabetic patients. Diabetic foot ulcers(DFUs) affect approximately 18.6 million people worldwide. The presence of a high glucose microenvironment in DFUs results in the significant accumulation of bacterial infection and advanced glycation end products (AGEs). To solve this, a self-assemble antibacterial nanofiber(ANF) loaded oriential artificial skin (ANF@OAS) was introduced in this research, which is consisted of L/D-phenylalanine derivatives coupled the natural antimicrobial peptides. The ANF@OAS can effectively reduce AGEs production and suppress multiple resistant bacteria. Additionally, the ANF@OAS can suppress infection and stimulate wound healing in infected diabetic mice."
"Results of retinoid-based therapies in head and neck cancer (HNC) are generally disappointing, indicating a lack of understanding of retinoic acid signaling. The role of retinoic acid receptor gamma (RARγ) and its isoforms in HNC is yet to be established. In this study, we found that RARγ1, 2, 4 are the predominant RARγ isoforms expressed in various types of human cancers, including HNC. The mechanistic study revealed that RARγ1, 2, 4 enhanced the proliferation of HNC cells by accelerating cell cycle progression through interaction with vinexin-β, as well as by ligand-dependent activation of EGFR with downstream Akt, ERK, Src, and YAP signaling pathways. Retinoic acid binding and CDK7-dependent phosphorylation on specific serine residue at the AF-1 domain are mandatory for RARγ-mediated growth promotion of HNC. Knockdown of RARγ abolished proliferation of cultured HNC cells, and completely prevented tumor growth in xenografted nude mice. Similar effects were observed in various human cancer types other than HNC. Our results indicate that RARγ-targeting approach could be a promising therapeutic and chemopreventive strategy for human cancers."
"Atherosclerosis involves the buildup of macrophage-derived foam cells in the arterial intima. Facilitating the egress of these cells from plaques can significantly slow disease progression. The transmembrane receptor Unc5b, a vascular-specific axon guidance receptor, is upregulated in foam cells, and inhibits their migration from the plaques. However, the mechanisms underlying Unc5b's regulation of foam cell production and retention within plaques, along with its downstream signaling pathways, remain insufficiently understood."
"At present, the prevalence of infectious diseases is rising annually, making it an important risk factor for human health that should not be neglected. Consequently, infection control and prevention have become even more important. The key to determining and designing the most effective anti-infectious medication depends upon the immediate and accurate identification of the causative agent. The standard techniques used for routine infection screening and surveillance tests are shifting toward biosensors. Furthermore, biosensors are projected to be employed for microbiological detection to satisfy the higher accuracy required for clinical diagnosis. This is because of their compact size, real-time monitoring and ability to analyze large sample numbers with less sophistication and manpower requirement, which have allowed them to develop quickly with extensive uses. Biosensors have multiple applications in food safety, environmental surveillance, drug sensing and national security because they offer several advantages such as quick response, outstanding sensitivity, remarkable selectivity, high degree of accuracy and precision, ease of use and affordable price. This review highlights the performance aspects of recently developed biosensors for the detection of infectious bacteria and viruses in biological and environmental samples and emphasizes the significance of nanotechnology in signal amplification for enhanced biosensor performance and dependability."
"Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory response caused by infection. When this inflammatory response spreads to the lungs, it can lead to acute lung injury (ALI) or more severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Pulmonary fibrosis is a potential complication of these conditions, and the early occurrence of pulmonary fibrosis is associated with a higher mortality rate. The underlying mechanism of ARDS-related pulmonary fibrosis remains unclear."
"Secukinumab is the first human monoclonal antibody that targets human interleukin-17A. This open-label, multicenter, uncontrolled, single-arm, prospective observational surveillance evaluated the long-term safety and effectiveness of secukinumab in patients with psoriasis vulgaris and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in Japan. Of 997 patients whose surveillance forms were collected, 976 were included in the safety analysis and 729 in the effectiveness analysis. Prior to the start of secukinumab treatment, biologics were used in 42.52% of patients for the treatment of conditions including psoriasis. The mean ± standard deviation (SD) duration of secukinumab administration was 288.1 ± 106.51 days and the median (range) was 344.0 (1-365) days. The most commonly used dose per administration was 300 mg in 96.21% (939 patients) and the mean ± SD total number of administrations was 13.6 ± 3.87. Adverse events (AEs), AEs suspected to be related to secukinumab, AEs that led to secukinumab treatment discontinuation, serious AEs, and deaths were reported in 36.17%, 18.85%, 8.09%, 5.84%, and 1.13%, respectively. The proportion of patients with an Investigator's Global Assessment score improvement to 0/1 increased over time from the start of secukinumab treatment to week 24 and remained stable thereafter. The Psoriasis Area and Severity Index 75 response rates and the proportions of patients with a Dermatology Life Quality Index score of 0/1 increased from baseline and were maintained up to week 52. This surveillance did not show any new safety concerns of secukinumab treatment. The effectiveness of secukinumab treatment was observed in patients with psoriasis vulgaris and PsA."
The aim of the present study was to analyze the methylation status in patients who presented with an Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC) concomitantly with multifocal Proliferative Verrucous Leukoplakia (PVL)(PVL-OSCC).
"During reinforcement learning, people learn based on both positive and negative feedback. Researchers have revealed the reward positivity (RewP) that reflects positive feedback evaluation, however, no electrophysiological indicator has been found to explain negative feedback processing. In reinforcement learning, people would like to expect the positive feedback after a choice, which might explain why previous studies usually found neural responses for reward processing, while the negative feedback processing seems absent. However, no study has designed a task to separate positive and negative feedback processing to measure the corresponding electrophysiological responses. Thus, the present study designed gain processing-advantaged (GA) and loss processing-advantaged (LA) contexts using a modified gambling task to measure specific neural responses to gain processing and loss processing. Electroencephalography (EEG) data were processed using time-domain and time-frequency analyses. The results revealed the RewP and delta oscillation following gain feedback in the GA context, while no negativity or other components specific to loss processing was found, even in the loss condition of LA context. The current results indicate that reward processing dominates the brain during feedback evaluation, whereas loss processing can't be captured by electrophysiological signal."
Antipsychotic prescriptions are frequent in nursing homes due to the challenging management of symptoms associated with Alzheimer's disease and related neurodegenerative disorders. This study aimed to assess the association between Health-related Quality Of Life (HrQOL) and antipsychotic use in nursing homes.
"The MET oncogene, encoding the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor, plays a key role in tumorigenesis, invasion, and resistance to therapy, yet its full biological functions and activation mechanisms remain incompletely understood. A feature of MET is its extensive interaction network, encompassing the following: (i) receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs); (ii) co-receptors (e.g., CDCP1, Neuropilin1); (iii) adhesion molecules (e.g., integrins, tetraspanins); (iv) proteases (e.g., ADAM10); and (v) other receptors (e.g., CD44, plexins, GPCRs, and NMDAR). These interactions dynamically modulate MET's activation, signaling, intracellular trafficking, and degradation, enhancing its functional versatility and oncogenic potential. This review offers current knowledge on MET's partnerships, focusing on their functional impact on signaling output, therapeutic resistance, and cellular behavior. Finally, we evaluate emerging combination therapies targeting MET and its interactors, highlighting their potential to overcome resistance and improve clinical outcomes. By exploring the complex interplay within the MET network of interacting cell surface proteins, this review provides insights into advancing anti-cancer strategies and understanding the broader implications of RTK crosstalk in oncology."

"This case report describes a woman in her 50s with a rare coexistence of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) and myasthenia gravis (MG), highlighting the diagnostic challenges and therapeutic considerations. Initially diagnosed with acetylcholine receptor antibody-positive MG, she later developed progressive visual impairment, leading to a diagnosis of NMOSD. Rituximab treatment was effective in managing both conditions, demonstrating the benefits of targeted therapies in reducing complications related to polypharmacy. This case underscores the importance of clinical vigilance and a multidisciplinary approach in managing overlapping autoimmune disorders, offering insights into their inter-relationships and therapeutic strategies."
Continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) are used to characterize postprandial glucose responses and provide personalized dietary advice to minimize glucose excursions. The efficacy of such advice depends on reliable glucose responses.
"Cancer predominantly affects older adults. An estimated 62% of the 15.5 million American cancer survivors are 65 years or older. Provision of supportive care is critical to this group; however, limited resources are available to them. As older survivors increasingly adopt technology, digital health programs have significant potential to provide them with longitudinal supportive care. Previously, we developed/tested a digital Cancer Survivorship Patient Engagement Toolkit for older adults, Cancer Survivorship Patient Engagement Toolkit Silver. The study examined the preliminary impact of the Cancer Survivorship Patient Engagement Toolkit Silver on older survivors' health outcomes. This was a 2-arm randomized controlled trial with two observations (baseline, 8 weeks) on a sample of 60 older cancer survivors (mean age, 70.1 ± 3.8 years). Outcomes included health-related quality of life, self-efficacy for coping with cancer, symptom burden, health behaviors, and patient-provider communication. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, linear mixed models, and content analysis. At 8 weeks, the Cancer Survivorship Patient Engagement Toolkit Silver group showed more improved physical health-related quality of life ( P < .001, effect size = 0.64) and symptom burden ( P = .053, effect size = -0.41) than the control group. Self-efficacy (effect size = 0.56), mental health-related quality of life (effect size = 0.26), and communication (effect size = 0.40) showed clinically meaningful effect sizes of improvement. Most participants reported benefits on health management (mean, 19.41 ± 2.6 [3-21]). Further research is needed with larger and more diverse older cancer populations."
"Chronic inflammation is a key factor in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) development. The cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP) reduces inflammation by activating α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (α7nAChRs) on macrophages, suppressing proinflammatory cytokines. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEis), primarily used for Alzheimer's disease (AD), may exert anti-inflammatory effects through the CAP. One AChEi, galantamine, also directly agonizes α7nAChRs, potentially enhancing its anti-inflammatory properties."
"Lactoferrin (Lf) is a naturally occurring glycoprotein known for its antiviral and antibacterial properties and is present in various physiological fluids. Numerous studies have demonstrated its antiviral effectiveness against multiple viruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), influenza virus (IFV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Lf, a vital component of the mucosal defense system, plays a crucial role in inhibiting viral infection by binding to both host cells and viral particles, such as the Hepatitis C virus (HCV). This interaction enables Lf to keep viral particles away from their target cells, emphasizing its significance as a fundamental element of mucosal defense against viral infections. Additionally, Lf has the ability to modulate cytokine expression and enhance cellular immune responses. In the innate immune system, Lf serves as a unique iron transporter and helps suppress various pathogens like bacteria, fungi, and viruses. This article summarises the potential antiviral properties of Lf against various viruses, along with its other mentioned functions. The advancement of Lf-based therapies supports the homology of food and medicine, providing a promising avenue to address viral infections and other public health challenges."

"Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) decreases hepatic lipogenesis in animal models, and FGF21 analogues decrease serum triglycerides (TG) in adults in phase-2 trials. On the other hand, serum FGF21 is associated with higher TG in observational studies of people with obesity, raising a sort of paradox. We tested the hypothesis that FGF21 is induced by TG in youth with obesity, as a compensatory mechanism."
"Degumming is essential to eliminate undesired phospholipids from crude vegetable oils before being processed into high-quality products. The degumming efficiency is hampered by the separation of oil and water. To overcome this problem, we introduced an innovative enzymatic degumming strategy for various vegetable oils (rice bran, peanut and flaxseed oil) by combining phospholipase A1 with monoacylglycerol lipase. Compared to using phospholipase A1, the combination of the two enzymes significantly reduced phosphorus content, indicating better hydrolysis of phospholipids. Additionally, the primary hydrolysates by the combined enzymes were glycerylphosphorylcholine and glycerylphosphorylethanolamine that were more affinitive to water to improve oil-water separation and oil yield. Characteristic markers obtained from Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis model confirmed the advantages of combined enzymes over single enzyme. This advantage of combined enzymes was further validated in a simulated degumming process. Our findings provide a new enzymatic degumming strategy to expand the toolkit for crude oil refinery."
"Success of assisted reproductive techniques depends on multiple factors including maternal endocrine status, hormonal balance, and paternal sperm quality. A comprehensive pre-treatment evaluation allows better prediction of outcomes and avoidance of unnecessary procedures and expenses."
"Omalizumab was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of any single food allergy or multiple food allergies in children aged 1 year and older and adults. There is currently no formal guidance regarding recommended best practices for omalizumab use in food allergy, including patient selection, anticipated goals and outcomes of therapy, procedure for monitoring patients who elect to start omalizumab therapy, and ways in which omalizumab can be incorporated into the landscape of food allergy management and daily clinical practice. This work group report was developed by the food allergy therapies subcommittee of the Adverse Reactions to Foods Committee within the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology. Consensus, evidence-based guidance regarding experts' recommendations for using omalizumab to treat children and adults with food allergy was developed by using modified Delphi methodology. In iterative fashion, a total of 8 statements regarding how to use omalizumab to treat patients with food allergy were developed by 16 clinical experts. This guidance provides the clinician with a suggested approach to patient selection, initiation of therapy, monitoring of efficacy, and long-term follow-up care. The role of preference-sensitive care is emphasized, with most statements offering care recommendations relevant to the culture and values of a particular practice setting."
"A scarcity of data exists concerning atrial fibrillation (AF) during the perioperative stage of non-cardiothoracic surgery, particularly orthopedic surgery. In addition, given the frequency and significant impact of AF in the perioperative period, therefore our aim was to identify prognosis and predictors of elderly hip fracture patients with perioperative AF."
"Spanning nearly 30 of the 50 years in which the National Institute on Aging (NIA) has existed, the Resource Centers for Minority Aging Research (RCMAR) program represents one of the most successful initiatives for advancing minority aging research and diversifying the scientific workforce within the Institute and across the National Institutes of Health. This article celebrates the genesis of the RCMAR program, beginning with the need to enhance this work, ranging from theories underlying the then-nascent field of health disparities research to study design, measurement, and analytic procedures. It describes the companion focus on preparing, expanding, and diversifying generations of future scholars/scientists to carry forward these advances. RCMAR's emphasis on promoting a comprehensive approach to research career development and building supportive learning communities heralded a more holistic approach to training than was previously the case. The discussion describes the evolution of the structure and emphases of the RCMAR program as it has responded to the frequently changing political, funding, and research environments. The article concludes by highlighting the major successes of this initiative, the challenges it faces, and opportunities afforded future growth as individual centers, the program at large, and NIA as a whole continue to innovate as they collectively address the original goals that remain relevant today and in the near future."
"Loss of Bcl2-associated athanogene 3 (BAG3) is associated with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). BAG3 regulates sarcomere protein turnover in cardiomyocytes; however, the function of BAG3 in other cardiac cell types is understudied. In this study, we used an isogenic pair of BAG3-knockout and wild-type human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to interrogate the role of BAG3 in hiPSC-derived cardiac fibroblasts (CFs). Analysis of cell type-specific conditional knockout engineered heart tissues revealed an essential contribution of CF BAG3 to contractility and cardiac fibrosis, recapitulating the phenotype of DCM. In BAG3-/- CFs, we observed an increased sensitivity to TGF-β signaling and activation of a fibrogenic response when cultured at physiological stiffness (8 kPa). Mechanistically, we showed that loss of BAG3 increased transforming growth factor-β receptor 2 (TGFBR2) levels by directly binding TGFBR2 and mediating its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. To further validate these results, we performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing of cardiac tissue from DCM patients carrying pathogenic BAG3 variants. BAG3 pathogenic variants increased fibrotic gene expression in CFs. Together, these results extend our understanding of the roles of BAG3 in heart disease beyond the cardiomyocyte-centric view and highlight the ability of tissue-engineered hiPSC models to elucidate cell type-specific aspects of cardiac disease."
"Exploring the causal relationships of diseases with genes, proteins, CpG sites, metabolites and other diseases is fundamental to the life sciences. However, large-scale research using Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis is currently lacking. To address this, we introduce DMRdb (http://www.inbirg.com/DMRdb/), a disease-centric Mendelian randomization database, designed to systematically assess causal relationships of diseases with genes, proteins, CpG sites, metabolites and other diseases. The database consists of three main components: (i) 6640 high-quality disease genome-wide association studies (GWASs) from public sources that were subjected to rigorous quality filtering and standardization; (ii) over 497 billion results from MR analyses involving 6640 disease GWAS datasets, 16 238 expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data, 2564 protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) data, 12 000 methylation quantitative trait locus (meQTLs) data and 825 metabolites data and (iii) over 380 000 causal relationship pairs from 1223 literature sources relevant to MR analyses. A user-friendly online database was developed to allow users to query, search, and download all the results. In summary, we anticipate that DMRdb will be a valuable resource for advancing our understanding of disease mechanisms and identifying new biomarkers and therapeutic targets."
"Factor H and membrane inhibitor of reactive lysis (CD59) are key regulators of complement activation. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) secrete Factor H and express CD59 to protect themselves from complement-mediated damage. Severe hypoxia found to decrease the survival chances of MSCs after transplantation; however, little is known about the impact of severe hypoxia on modulating the complement system activity and its effect on MSCs survival. Our study seeks to explore the effect of severe hypoxia on modulating the complement cascade in MSCs."
"Solitude represents an important context for emerging adults' well-being; but to date, little is known about how emerging adults spend their time alone. The goals of this study were to: (1) describe and characterize solitary activities among emerging adults attending university; (2) examine links between solitary activities and indices of adjustment; and (3) explore the moderating role of affinity for solitude in these associations."

"The article describes the forms, causes and consequences of insomnia in the elderly. It shows the clinical features of dyssomnic disorders in comorbid depressive and anxiety disorders, as the most common mental pathology of old age. The approaches of Russian and foreign authors to the diagnosis and treatment of insomnia in the elderly are considered. The analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of pharmacological and psychotherapeutic approaches in the treatment of sleep disorders in old age with comorbid affective disorders is carried out."
"Chronic musculoskeletal pain (CMP) poses a widespread health and socioeconomic problem, being the most prevalent chronic pain condition. Interdisciplinary multimodal pain treatment (IMPT) is considered the gold standard, offering cost-effective long-term care. Unfortunately, only a subset of patients experiences clinically relevant improvements in pain, fatigue, and disability post-IMPT. Establishing a prediction model encompassing various outcome measures could enhance rehabilitation and personalized healthcare. Thus, the aim was to develop and validate a prediction model for IMPT success in patients with CMP. A prospective cohort study within routine care was performed, including patients with CMP undergoing a 10-week IMPT. Success across four outcome measures was determined: patients' recovery perspective, quality of life (physical and mental), and disability. Sixty-five demographic and candidate predictors (mainly patient reported outcome measures) were examined. Finally, 2309 patients participated, with IMPT success rates ranging from 30% to 57%. Four models incorporating 33 predictors were developed, with treatment control being the sole consistent predictor across all models. Additionally, predictors effects varied in direction in the models. All models demonstrated strong calibration, fair to good discrimination, and were internally validated (optimism-corrected AUC range 0.69-0.80). Our findings show that treatment success can be predicted using standardized patient-reported measures, exhibiting strong discriminatory power. However, predictors vary depending on the outcome, underscoring the importance of selecting the appropriate measure upfront. Clinically, these results suggest potential for patient-centered care and may contribute to the development of a scientifically sound decision tool."
"Child malnutrition is a critical public health concern that significantly hampers children's physical and mental development and imposes serious economic burdens. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that malnutrition is responsible for half of all deaths among children under five, leading to long-term consequences such as lower educational achievement, decreased productivity, and deepened poverty. This study aims to estimate the burden of child malnutrition in Colombia for children up to four years old, assessing both direct and indirect costs from a societal perspective."
Primary pulmonary meningioma is a rare disease. There have been only a little over 50 cases of primary pulmonary meningioma (PPM) reported in previous literature. The pathogenesis of PPM is still unclear. We report a case of PPM cured by thoracoscopic right middle lobe wedge resection and systematically review previously reported cases in previous literature.
"The treatment of radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (RAIR-DTC) has made significant advancements in the twenty-first century. This study aimed to assess the current state of research and identify potential new directions by conducting a bibliometric analysis of scientific publications on RAIR-DTC treatment. Publications relevant to RAIR-DTC, published from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2023, were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection. Bibliometric analyses of major keywords, authors, countries, institutions, publications, and journals were conducted using CiteSpace and VOSviewer. A total of 859 papers were included in the analysis. The results demonstrated a rising trend in the number of publications over time. The United States was identified as the leading contributor in terms of publication output, citations, and international collaborations. Gustave Roussy emerged as the top organization in publication productivity, while the journal Thyroid had the highest number of related publications. The research on RAIR treatment was categorized into three key hotspots: clinical trials of targeted therapies, novel therapeutic strategies, and debates surrounding the RAIR-DTC management. RAIR-DTC research is expanding from the clinical trial phase of tyrosine kinase inhibitor monotherapy to a more complex combination therapy strategy, in particular, the synergistic effect of immune checkpoint inhibitors and other therapeutic agents, requiring more high-quality prospective studies to validate the clinical benefits. Moreover, the timely identification of RAIR-DTC patients holds the potential to enable early disease intervention, constituting a pivotal novel research direction in the future."
"Digital health technologies are increasingly being integrated into mental health care. However, the adoption of these technologies can be influenced by patients' digital literacy and attitudes, which may vary based on sociodemographic factors. This variability necessitates a better understanding of patient digital literacy and attitudes to prevent a digital divide, which can worsen existing health care disparities."

"We describe LnCeCell 2.0 (http://bio-bigdata.hrbmu.edu.cn/LnCeCell), an updated resource for lncRNA-associated competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks and web tools based on single-cell and spatial transcriptomics sequencing (stRNA-seq) data. We have updated the LnCeCell 2.0 database with significantly expanded data and improved features, including (i) 257 single-cell RNA sequencing and stRNA-seq datasets across 86 diseases/phenotypes and 80 human normal tissues, (ii) 836 581 cell-specific and spatial spot-specific ceRNA interactions and functional networks for 1 002 988 cells and 367 971 spatial spots, (iii) 15 489 experimentally supported lncRNA biomarkers related to disease pathology, diagnosis and treatment, (iv) detailed annotation of cell type, cell state, subcellular and extracellular locations of ceRNAs through manual curation and (v) ceRNA expression profiles and follow-up clinical information of 20 326 cancer patients. Further, a panel of 24 flexible tools (including 8 comprehensive and 16 mini-analysis tools) was developed to investigate ceRNA-regulated mechanisms at single-cell/spot resolution. The CeCellTraject tool, for example, illustrates the detailed ceRNA distribution of different cell populations and explores the dynamic change of the ceRNA network along the developmental trajectory. LnCeCell 2.0 will facilitate the study of fine-tuned lncRNA-ceRNA networks with single-cell and spatial spot resolution, helping us to understand the regulatory mechanisms behind complex microbial ecosystems."
"COGNITIVE FLEXIBILITY REFERS TO PEOPLE'S CAPACITY TO CHANGE OR EVOLVE THEIR THINKING AND STRATEGIES WHEN CONFRONTED WITH NEW INFORMATION OR CIRCUMSTANCES: These attributes are essential in research environments where complex and dynamic challenges frequently arise. In this study, the aim is to explore and establish whether a correlation exists between cognitive flexibility and research performance, especially in the medical students, in order to fill the deficit, if any, as well as understand the status of research teaching."
"Parkinson's Disease (PD) may lead to cognitive symptoms, including visuo-spatial attentional deficits such as unilateral spatial neglect (USN). Although there is some evidence for USN in PD patients, especially in those with left-sided onset of motor-symptoms (LPD), previous studies revealed inconsistent and highly variable results in neglect tasks using line bisection and have not systematically compared LPD with RPD (PD patients with right-sided onset) or healthy controls (HC)."
Identifying environmental factors that contribute to disease onset/activity in PV stands to improve clinical outcomes and patient quality of life by strategies aimed at reducing specific disease promoting exposures and promoting personalized clinical management strategies.
"The PAK (p21-activated kinases) family is a class of intracellular signal transduction protein kinases that regulate various cellular functions, mainly through their interactions with small GTP enzymes. PAK1 and PAK2 in the PAK kinase family are key signal transduction molecules that play important roles in various biological processes, including morphological changes, migration, proliferation, and apoptosis, and are involved in the progression of many diseases. Abnormal expression or dysregulation of PAK1 and PAK2 may be associated with several diseases, including cancer, neurological diseases, etc. The current research mainly focuses on studying the role of PAK and PAK inhibitors in the regulation of cancer progression, but relatively few reports are available that explore their potential role in cardiovascular diseases. Vascular injury and repair are complex processes involved in many cardiovascular conditions, including atherosclerosis, restenosis, and hypertension. Emerging research suggests that PAK1 and PAK2 have pivotal roles in vascular endothelial cell functions, including migration, proliferation, and angiogenesis. These kinases also modulate vascular smooth muscle relaxation, vascular permeability, and structural alterations, which are critical in the development of atherosclerosis and vascular inflammation. By targeting these activities, PAK proteins are essential for both normal vascular physiology and the pathogenesis of vascular diseases, highlighting their potential as therapeutic targets for vascular health. This review focuses on recent studies that offer experimental insights into the mechanisms by which PAK1 and PAK2 regulate the biological processes of vascular injury and repair and the therapeutic potential of the current existing PAK inhibitors in vascular-related diseases. The limitations of treatment with some PAK inhibitors and the ways that future development can overcome these challenges are also discussed."
"Traumatic injuries are a significant public health concern globally, resulting in substantial mortality, hospitalisation and healthcare burden. Despite the establishment of specialised trauma centres, there remains considerable variability in trauma-care practices and outcomes, particularly in the initial phase of trauma resuscitation in the trauma bay. This stage is prone to preventable errors leading to adverse events (AEs) that can impact patient outcomes. Prior studies have identified common causes of these errors, including delayed diagnostics, disorganisation of staff, equipment issues and communication breakdowns, which collectively contribute to AEs. This study addresses gaps in understanding the root causes of these errors by evaluating the most frequent AEs in trauma care through real-time video reviews of resuscitations in the trauma bay. Insights from this evaluation will inform targeted interventions to improve procedural adherence, communication and overall team performance, ultimately reducing preventable errors and improving patient safety."
"Trisomy 8 is a frequent chromosomal abnormality that occurs among patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). This abnormality is more common among MDS patients with concurrent Behcet's disease (BD) than among patients with MDS alone. This comorbidity is also associated with a higher prevalence of intestinal ulcers. In this case report, we describe a 45-year-old woman who was diagnosed with BD at age 35. Eight years later, her Behcet's disease relapsed with trisomy 8-positive MDS. After the disease was controlled by azacitidine, the patient received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), which involved the use of both peripheral blood stem cells and bone marrow stem cells. Although the patient experienced grave oral mucositis and chronic intestinal graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), remission of both MDS and BD was maintained. This case highlights the potential efficacy of allo-HSCT in treating patients with refractory autoimmune diseases complicated by MDS, particularly patients with trisomy 8 abnormalities. We also discuss the immunological implications and suggest allo-HSCT as a viable curative option for patients with BD and MDS."
"Preterm birth exposes the neonate to hypoxic-ischaemic and excitotoxic insults that impair neurodevelopment and are magnified by the premature loss of placentally supplied, inhibitory neurosteroids. The cerebellum is a neuronally dense brain region, which undergoes critical periods of development during late gestation, when preterm births frequently occur. We propose that neurosteroid replacement therapy using tiagabine and zuranolone will protect the cerebellum against preterm-associated insults. Guinea pig dams received c-section surgery preterm (gestational age (GA) 64) or at term (GA70) with preterm pups administered tiagabine (2.5 mg/kg/day), zuranolone (1 mg/kg/day) or vehicle (15% β-cyclodextrin) until term equivalent age (GA70). Behavioural testing was performed at corrected postnatal day 8 (PND8) and PND41 with tissue collection occurring at PND42. Neurodevelopmental markers (MBP, OLIG2 and NeuN) were assessed within the cerebellum by immunohistochemistry, whilst GABAergic and glutamatergic pathway expression was quantified using high throughput RT-PCR. Zuranolone and, to a lesser extent, tiagabine were able to protect against hyperactive behaviour at PND8 in males, whilst in females, a less marked hyperactive phenotype was present with neither treatment impacting behaviour further. Both treatments improved MBP staining, whilst tiagabine was found to restore oligodendrocyte maturation in females only. GABAergic and glutamatergic pathway expression was found to be restored by both treatments in females. Overall, this study demonstrates the neuroprotective attributes of neurosteroid replacement therapy using tiagabine and zuranolone, thereby demonstrating their potential to mitigate long-term neurodevelopmental impairments. Furthermore, the sexually dimorphic effects observed suggest future investigations may show increased benefit by using sex-specific treatment regimes."
"A pea protein isolate (PPI)-hyaluronic acid (HA) nanocarrier delivery system was created for quercetin (Que) encapsulation using the pH conversion strategy. The self-assembly of the PPI-HA binary nanocomplex (HPP) were mainly driven by electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. Que was successfully encapsulated in HPP nanocomposites (Que@HPP), which exhibited preferable redispersibility, and encapsulation efficiency (87.51%), loading capacity (14.50%). Que@HPP provided superior resistance to external environmental stresses (pH, ionic strength, high temperature, light exposure, and long-term storage), while maintaining its primary antioxidant activity after 15 days. Compared to free Que, the encapsulated Que shifted from a crystalline to an amorphous form, diffusing more easily through nanoparticle pores. Moreover, the encapsulated Que (Que@HPP) were stable in simulated gastric fluid (SGF, pH = 1.2) and released slowly in simulated intestinal fluid (SIF, pH = 6.8) compared to naked Que, demonstrating its potential to respond to specific external pH environments. Thus, the fabrication of HPP nanovehicles for Que encapsulation is a viable solution to improve its stability and release behaviors."
A standardized multi-day antiemetic regimen for multi-day chemotherapy remains elusive. This systematic review evaluated the efficacy and safety of multi-day antiemetic regimens in patients undergoing multi-day intravenous chemotherapy.
"Carotid plaques-the buildup of cholesterol, calcium, cellular debris, and fibrous tissues in carotid arteries-can rupture, release microemboli into the cerebral vasculature and cause strokes. The likelihood of a plaque rupturing is thought to be associated with its composition (i.e. lipid, calcium, hemorrhage and inflammatory cell content) and the mechanical properties of the plaque. Automating and digitizing histopathological images of these plaques into tissue specific (lipid and calcified) regions can help us compare histologic findings to in vivo imaging and thereby enable us to optimize medical treatments or interventions for patients based on the composition of plaques. Lack of public datasets and the hypocellular nature of plaques have made applying deep learning to this task difficult. To address this, we sampled 1944 regions of interests from 323 whole slide images and drastically varied their pixel resolution from [Formula: see text] to [Formula: see text] as we anticipated that varying the pixel resolution of histology images can provide neural networks more 'context' that pathologists also rely on. We were able to train Mask R-CNN using regions of interests with varied pixel resolution, with a [Formula: see text] increase in pixel accuracy versus training with patches. The model achieved F1 scores of [Formula: see text] for calcified regions, [Formula: see text] for lipid core with fibrinous material and cholesterol crystals, and [Formula: see text] for fibrous regions, as well as a pixel accuracy of [Formula: see text]. While the F1 score was not calculated for lumen, qualitative results illustrate the model's ability to predict lumen. Hemorrhage was excluded as a class since only one out of 34 carotid endarterectomy specimens had sufficient hemorrhage for annotation."

"Social insects, particularly honey bees, have exceptionally high genomic frequencies of genetic recombination. This phenomenon and underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. To characterise the patterns of crossovers and gene conversion in the honey bee genome, a recombination map of 187 honey bee brothers was generated by whole-genome resequencing. Recombination events were heterogeneously distributed without many true hotspots. The tract lengths between phase shifts were bimodally distributed, indicating distinct crossover and gene conversion events. While crossovers predominantly occurred in G/C-rich regions and seemed to cause G/C enrichment, the gene conversions were found predominantly in A/T-rich regions. The nucleotide composition of sequences involved in gene conversions that were associated with or distant from crossovers corresponded to the differences between crossovers and gene conversions. These combined results suggest two types of DNA double-strand break repair during honey bee meiosis: non-canonical homologous recombination, leading to gene conversion and A/T enrichment of the genome, and the canonical homologous recombination based on completed double Holliday Junctions, which can result in gene conversion or crossover and is associated with G/C bias. This G/C bias may be selected for to balance the A/T-rich base composition of eusocial hymenopteran genomes. The lack of evidence for a preference of the canonical homologous recombination for double-strand break repair suggests that the high genomic recombination rate of honey bees is mainly the consequence of a high rate of double-strand breaks, which could in turn result from the life history of honey bees and their A/T-rich genome."
"Bile duct regeneration is hypothesized to prevent biliary strictures, a leading cause of morbidity after liver transplantation. Assessing the capacity for biliary regeneration may identify grafts as suitable for transplantation that are currently declined, but this has been unfeasible until now. This study used long-term ex situ normothermic machine perfusion (LT-NMP) to assess biliary regeneration. Human livers that were declined for transplantation were perfused at 36 °C for up to 13.5 days. Bile duct biopsies, bile, and perfusate were collected throughout perfusion, which were examined for features of injury and regeneration. Biliary regeneration was defined as new Ki-67-positive biliary epithelium following severe injury. Ten livers were perfused for a median duration of 7.5 days. Severe bile duct injury occurred in all grafts, and biliary regeneration occurred in 70% of grafts. Traditional biomarkers of biliary viability such as bile glucose improved during perfusion but this was not associated with biliary regeneration (P > .05). In contrast, the maintenance of interleukin-6 and vascular endothelial growth factor-A levels in bile was associated with biliary regeneration (P = .017 for both cytokines). This is the first study to demonstrate biliary regeneration during LT-NMP and identify a cytokine signature in bile as a novel biomarker for biliary regeneration during LT-NMP."

"The current ANZCOR guidelines for first aid management of life-threatening bleeding from a limb, where bleeding cannot be controlled with direct pressure, recommends the use of an arterial tourniquet. However, tourniquets required specialised training and equipment, which may not be accessible in all emergencies. This systematic review evaluated the effectiveness of arterial pressure point techniques (APPT) as a first aid measure for controlling life-threatening, non-compressible bleeding from limbs and anatomical junctions. A comprehensive literature search was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines. The search was used in five databases: PubMed, CINAHL, SportDiscuss, Proquest Central and Embase. Eligible studies included adult participants in and out of hospital settings, focusing on extremities and junctional areas. Studies assessing APPT alone or compared with other first aid techniques were included. The review included nine quasi-experimental articles, with eight having low levels of evidence. Although most reported high success rates (87.5-100%) for APPT achieving blood flow cessation, its effectiveness compared to alternative methods, such as arterial tourniquets, remains inconclusive because of methodological heterogeneity and differing success benchmarks. APPT shows promise in external haemorrhage control. Additional research with higher levels of evidence, standardised protocols and larger sample sizes is needed. Investigation in real-world scenarios is crucial to compare methods like tourniquets. Future research will determine APPT's effectiveness and its potential role as a bridging technique before tourniquet application or medical assistance."
"Intraoperative stretching of the hip joint capsule often generates severe pain during the first 3 hours after hip arthroscopy. The short-lived severe pain mandates high opioid consumption, which may result in adverse events and delay recovery. The femoral nerve nociceptors are located anteriorly in the hip joint capsule. A femoral nerve block reduces pain and opioid demand after hip arthroscopy. It impedes, however, ambulation and home discharge after outpatient surgery. The iliopsoas plane block selectively anesthetizes the femoral sensory nerve branches innervating the hip joint capsule without compromising ambulation. We aimed to assess reduction of opioid consumption after iliopsoas plane block during the short-lived painful postsurgical period of time after hip arthroscopy."
"United Nations is standing for Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6 sets the agenda to address worldwide inequality in accessing safe water and improved sanitation facilities for all by 2030. However, governments in Africa seem unable to address the issue water and of sanitation facilities, since there are problems like increasing costs of sustaining existing water sources and the requirement to deliver new facilities ahead of time. Hence, this study aimed to investigate unimproved water sources and sanitation facilities geographical variation in Ethiopia using EDHS 2019 datasets. This study was community-based cross-sectional based on nationally representative data (EMDHS 2019) to identify the demographic variability of unimproved water sources and sanitation facilities in Ethiopia. STATA 14, ArcGIS 10.7, and Kuldorff's SaTScan 10.1 software were used in data analysis. Weighted by sampling weight was performed to do a trustworthy statistical analysis. Based on the dataset EMDHS 2019 Ethiopia access in both unimproved water sources was geographically clustered in Ethiopia. The finding revealed that, there were a significant spatial variation of unimproved water sources and sanitation facilities in Ethiopia. Hot and cold spot analysis revealed that there were parts of Ethiopia with higher levels of unimproved water sources and sanitation facilities coverage than other parts of the country. The SaTScan analysis of unimproved water sources indicated that the primary cluster was found southeast part of Ethiopia. The SaTScan analysis of unimproved sanitation facilities indicated that the primary cluster window was found in Benishangul Gumuz and the western part of Ethiopia. This study contribute to the understanding of the status of drinking water source and sanitation facilities based on recent EHDS data, which can inform policymakers in designing effective strategies that address specific regional challenges. This finding confirmed the previous EDHS 2016 that revealed spatial variation of unimproved water sources and sanitation facilities in the country. Findings implies that the persistence of water sources and sanitation facilities inequality continue in country. Hence, the result recommends responsible stakeholders working water source and sanitation facilities to guarantee Sustainable Development Goal 6 in Ethiopia. In addition to providing insight into Ethiopia's water and sanitation facilities situation, this study highlights important areas for development that can be applied to other nations dealing with comparable problems, especially those in Sub-Saharan Africa."
"The successful application of CAR-T cells in the treatment of hematologic malignancies has fundamentally changed cancer therapy. With increasing numbers of registered CAR-T cell clinical trials, efforts are being made to streamline and reduce the costs of CAR-T cell manufacturing while improving their safety. To date, all approved CAR-T cell products have relied on viral-based gene delivery and genomic integration methods. While viral vectors offer high transfection efficiencies, concerns regarding potential malignant transformation coupled with costly and time-consuming vector manufacturing are constant drivers in the search for cheaper, easier-to-use, safer, and more efficient alternatives. In this review, we examine different non-viral gene transfer methods as alternatives for CAR-T cell production, their advantages and disadvantages, and examples of their applications. Transposon-based gene transfer methods lead to stable but non-targeted gene integration, are easy to handle, and achieve high gene transfer rates. Programmable endonucleases allow targeted integration, reducing the potential risk of integration-mediated malignant transformation of CAR-T cells. Non-integrating CAR-encoding vectors avoid this risk completely and achieve only transient CAR expression. With these promising alternative techniques for gene transfer, all avenues are open to fully exploiting the potential of next-generation CAR-T cell therapy and applying it in a wide range of applications."

"The combined use of tocilizumab (TCZ) and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in cancer treatment is gaining attention, but preclinical studies are lacking. Our study aims to investigate the synergistic anti-tumor effect of TCZ combined with ICIs and its role in treating immune-related adverse events (irAEs). The clinical significance of high interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression in tumor patients was analyzed from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The expression levels of IL-6 were compared before and during the onset of ICIs-associated myocarditis patients. ICIs-related myocardial inflammatory injury and therapeutic lung cancer models were constructed in C57BL/6 J mice using murine-derived programmed death-1 (PD-1) inhibitors alone or in combination with TCZ. Possible inflammatory mechanisms were proposed and validated. The anti-tumor effects and mechanisms of both drugs in combination were assessed. Patients with high IL-6 expression had a poor prognosis, and those with ICIs-associated myocarditis exhibited elevated IL-6 from baseline. In the PD-1 inhibitors-associated myocardial inflammatory injury mouse model, the levels of IL-6 in the blood and cardiac tissues were significantly elevated. TCZ ameliorated immune myocardial inflammatory injury by inhibiting the IL-6/janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/signal transducer and activator of the transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway. The group treated with PD-1 inhibitors combined with TCZ showed significantly slower tumor growth than that treated with PD-1 inhibitors alone. TCZ resisted tumor growth by inhibiting the IL-6-JAK2-STAT3 pathway. By targeting the IL-6-JAK2-STAT3 pathway, TCZ can alleviate PD-1 inhibitors-associated myocardial inflammatory injury mediated by M1-polarized macrophages and plays a synergistic anti-tumor role by inhibiting lung cancer cell proliferation."

"By gaining insights into how brain activity is encoded and decoded, we enhance our understanding of brain function. This study introduces a method for classifying EEG signals related to visual objects, employing a combination of an LSTM network and nonlinear interval type-2 fuzzy regression (NIT2FR). Here, ResNet is utilized for feature extraction from images, the LSTM network for feature extraction from EEG signals, and NIT2FR for mapping image features to EEG signal features. The application of type-2 fuzzy logic addresses uncertainties arising from EEG signal nonlinearity, noise, limited data sample size, and diverse mental states among participants. The Stanford database was used for implementation, evaluating effectiveness through metrics like classification accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. According to the findings, the LSTM network achieved an accuracy of 55.83% in categorizing images using raw EEG data. When compared to other methods like linear type-2, linear/nonlinear type-1 fuzzy, neural network, and polynomial regression, NIT2FR coupled with an SVM classifier outperformed with a 68.05% accuracy. Thus, NIT2FR demonstrates superiority in handling high uncertainty environments. Moreover, the 6.03% improvement in accuracy over the best previous study using the same dataset underscores its effectiveness. Precision, recall, and F1 score results for NIT2FR were 68.93%, 68.08%, and 68.49% respectively, surpassing outcomes from linear type-2, linear/nonlinear type-1 fuzzy regression methods."
"Iron is a crucial micronutrient, and its deficiency can have detrimental effects on the health of infants. Dietary polysaccharide-iron (III) complexes (PICs) are promising for addressing iron deficiency due to their minimal adverse reactions and high iron absorption rate. This study aimed to investigate the effects of dietary Enteromorpha prolifera polysaccharide-Fe (III) complex (EP-Fe) on newborns, using 3-day weaned piglets as the iron-deficiency model. Results showed that EP-Fe improved iron levels and promoted intestinal development in piglets. Transcriptome sequencing revealed that EP-Fe increased the survival of intestinal epithelial cells under hypoxia by upregulating the expression of genes that promote the development of the vascular system. Additionally, EP-Fe enhanced the mucosal barrier functions by inhibiting myosin light chain kinase (MLCK)/phosphorylated myosin light chain (p-MLC) signaling pathway to increase the expression of intestinal tight junction proteins. Furthermore, the 16S rRNA gene sequencing of gut microbiota showed that EP-Fe promoted the enrichment of Bacteroides_fragilis and other gut microbes that can metabolize carbohydrates. In conclusion, EP-Fe is an effective iron supplement for newborns, and it can be developed as a comprehensive nutritional supplement."
"Cellular senescence is an established cause of cell and tissue aging. Senescent cells have been shown to increase in multiple organs during aging, including the skin. Here we hypothesized that senescent cells residing in the skin can spread senescence to distant organs, thereby accelerating systemic aging processes. To explore this hypothesis, we initially observed an increase in several markers of senescence in the skin of aging mice. Subsequently, we conducted experiments wherein senescent fibroblasts were transplanted into the dermis of young mice and assessed various age-associated parameters. Our findings reveal that the presence of senescent cells in the dermal layer of young mice leads to increased senescence in both proximal and distal host tissues, alongside increased frailty, and impaired musculoskeletal function. Additionally, there was a significant decline in cognitive function, concomitant with increased expression of senescence-associated markers within the hippocampus brain area. These results support the concept that the accumulation of senescent cells in the skin can exert remote effects on other organs including the brain, potentially explaining links between skin and brain disorders and diseases and, contributing to physical and cognitive decline associated with aging."
"Prognosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains poor especially in older patients who are ineligible for standard chemotherapy or have refractory disease. Here, we study the potential of Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor (PPAR)-γ agonist pioglitazone to improve the treatment of AML. We show that pioglitazone exerts an anti-proliferative and anti-clonogenic effect on AML cell lines KG-1a, MOLM-14 and OCI-AML3 and on primary cultures from AML patients. However, co-culture of AML cells with stromal cells mimicking the bone marrow microenvironment counteracts this effect, suggesting the existence of a stroma-mediated resistance mechanism to pioglitazone. We show that pioglitazone treatment upregulates the receptor AXL in AML cells at the mRNA and protein level, allowing AXL to be phosphorylated by its ligand Gas6, which is secreted by the stroma. Addition of exogenous Gas6 or stromal cell conditioned medium also abolishes the anti-proliferative effect of pioglitazone, with an increase in AXL phosphorylation observed in both conditions. Co-incubation with the AXL inhibitor bemcentinib restored the anti-leukemic activity of pioglitazone in the presence of stromal cells by reducing AXL phosphorylation to its baseline level. We also confirm that this resistance mechanism is PPAR-γ-dependent as stromal cells invalidated for PPAR-γ are unable to inhibit the antileukemic effect of pioglitazone. Altogether, we suggest that pioglitazone treatment exerts an anti-leukemic effect but concomitantly triggers a stroma-mediated resistance mechanism involving the Gas6/AXL axis. We demonstrate that a combination of pioglitazone with an AXL inhibitor overcomes this mechanism in primary cultures and AML cell lines and exerts potent anti-leukemic activity requiring further evaluation in vivo through murine xenograft pre-clinical models."

"Frailty is a common geriatric syndrome associated with poor clinical outcomes. Effectiveness of lifestyle intervention programmes among frail older people has been examined earlier, but effects of interventions on prevention of frailty have been rarely studied.

"Vennous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common complication associated to greater mortality in patients with cancer. Its etiology is multifactorial and depends on the characteristics and co-morbidities of the patient, the tumor type and extension, and the oncological treatment. The management of VTE is more complex in patients with cancer due to an increased risk of recurrence and major bleeding complications during anticoagulation compared to the general non-oncological population. The above differences have led to the development of specific clinical trials to assess the efficacy and safety of anticoagulant therapy in patients with cancer. The present clinical guidelines are intended to provide general recommendations on the management of cancer-associated VTE according to updated according to the most recent scientific evidence."
"Recently, germline variants have also been found as contributors of disease etiology in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). The consideration of such inherited traits is crucial for clinical management of patients, particularly with regards to indication for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (allo-HCT) and donor selections. Herein, we describe the very instructive case of a 49-year-old woman diagnosed with JAK2 V617F-positive primary myelofibrosis (PMF) who was found to also carry a germline variant in the SH2B3 gene, detailing clinical management, donor selection process for allo-HCT purposes, and appropriate genetic counseling."

"Osteoarthritis (OA) prevalence increases as the population ages. Diagnosing osteoarthritis often occurs in the late stages when cartilage degradation is severe, making it difficult to distinguish from other types of arthritis. Accurate differentiation of primary osteoarthritis from other arthritic conditions is crucial for effective treatment planning. A new diagnostic test has been developed that uses a dual-biomarker algorithm to inform osteoarthritis diagnosis. Synovial fluid from patients with confirmed primary osteoarthritis showed elevated levels of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein. However, this biomarker alone could not distinguish primary osteoarthritis from other inflammatory conditions that also cause cartilage deterioration. Therefore, a combinatorial algorithm using cartilage oligomeric matrix protein and Interleukin-8 concentrations was developed to differentiate primary osteoarthritis from inflammatory arthritis. Clinical decision limits for cartilage oligomeric matrix protein concentration and the cartilage oligomeric matrix protein to Interleukin-8 ratio were established and validated using 171 human knee synovial fluid specimens. The osteoarthritis algorithm demonstrated clinical sensitivity and specificity of 87.0% and 88.9%, respectively. This is the first report of a biomarker test that can differentiate primary osteoarthritis from inflammatory arthritis with a high degree of accuracy."
The interaction between frailty and Parkinson's disease (PD) is still unknown. This study aimed to study the effectiveness of a multidisciplinary telemedicine program in reducing frailty in Parkinson's disease.
"Osteoporosis is characterized by decreased bone mass and accumulation of adipocytes in the bone marrow. The mechanism underlying the imbalance between osteoblastogenesis and adipogenesis in bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) remains unclear. We found that ALG5 was significantly downregulated in BMSCs from osteoporotic specimens. ALG5 knockdown inhibited osteogenic differentiation and increased adipogenic differentiation of BMSCs. ALG5 deficiency diminished the N-glycosylation of SLC6A9, thereby altering its protein stability and disrupting SLC6A9-mediated glycine uptake in BMSCs. ALG5 overexpression by adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (rAAV9) alleviated bone loss in OVX mice. Taken together, our findings suggest a novel role for the ALG5-SLC6A9-glycine axis in the imbalance of BMSC differentiation in osteoporosis. Moreover, we identify ALG5 overexpression as a potential therapeutic strategy for treating osteoporosis."

A sort of AIEgens is applied in monitoring osteogenic differentiation and bone component analysis. Additionally, AIEgens targeting intra-articular inflammatory or rheumatic related molecules, such as reactive oxygen species, enable early-stage diagnosis and targeted therapies of arthritis. Researchers have also developed novel materials containing AIEgens for joint tissue repair. This review highlights the advantages of these applications while also exploring future demands and development directions in musculoskeletal system imaging and treatment, aiming to promote further design of AIEgens and their clinical applications in musculoskeletal diseases."

"Understanding the mechanisms that underlie the adaptive response of ectotherms to rising temperatures is key to mitigate the effects of climate change. We assessed the molecular and physiological processes that differentiate between rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) with high and low tolerance to acute thermal stress. To achieve our goal, we used a critical thermal maximum trial in two strains of rainbow trout to elicit loss of equilibrium responses to identify high and low tolerance fish. We then compared the hepatic transcriptome profiles of high and low tolerance fish relative to untreated controls common to both strains to uncover patterns of differential gene expression and to gain a broad perspective on the interacting gene pathways and functional processes involved. We observed some of the classic responses to increased temperature (e.g., induction of heat shock proteins) but these responses were not the defining factors that differentiated high and low tolerance fish. Instead, high tolerance fish appeared to suppress growth-related functions, enhance certain autophagy components, better regulate neurodegenerative processes, and enhance stress-related protein synthesis, specifically spliceosomal complex activities, mRNA regulation, and protein processing through post-translational processes, relative to low tolerance fish. In contrast, low tolerance fish had higher transcript diversity and demonstrated elevated developmental, cytoskeletal, and morphogenic, as well as lipid and carbohydrate metabolic processes, relative to high tolerance fish. Our results suggest that high tolerance fish engaged in processes that supported the prevention of further damage by enhancing repair pathways, whereas low tolerance fish were more focused on replacing damaged cells and their structures."
"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes persistent symptoms, including brain fog.

"Climate change is among the greatest threats to health in the 21st century, requiring the urgent scaling-up of adaptation interventions. We aim to summarise adaptation interventions that were funded by the Belmont Forum and the European Union, the largest global funders of climate change and health research. A systematic search was conducted (updated February 2023) to identify articles on adaptation interventions for health within this funding network. The data extracted included study characteristics, types of interventions, and study outcomes. The results were synthesised narratively within the PRISMA-ScR guidelines. A total of 197 articles were screened, with 37 reporting on adaptation interventions. The majority of interventions focused on the general population (n = 17), with few studies examining high-risk populations such as pregnant women and children (n = 4) or migrants (n = 0). Targeted interventions were mostly aimed at behavioural change (n = 8) and health system strengthening (n = 6), while interventions with mitigation co-benefits such as nature-based solutions (n = 1) or the built environment (n = 0) were limited. The most studied climate change hazard was extreme heat (n = 26). Several studies reported promising findings, principally regarding interventions to counter heat impacts on workers and pregnant women and improving risk awareness in communities. These findings provide a platform on which to expand research and public health interventions for safeguarding public health from the effects of climate change."

"Winter wild oat (Avena sterilis subsp. ludoviciana (Durieu) Gillet & Magne) has been considered the most common and troublesome weed in wheat fields of Iran. The widespread and continuous use of herbicides has led to the emergence and development of resistant biotypes in A. ludoviciana, making it one of the most important herbicide-resistant weeds within field crops. Considering the importance of understanding the mechanisms underlying resistance to herbicides and identifying key proteins involved in the response to Acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACCase) and Acetolactate synthase (ALS) inhibitor herbicides in A. ludoviciana. This study aimed to identify the proteins involved in herbicide resistance in A. ludoviciana using the Isobaric Tags for Relative and Absolute Quantification (iTRAQ) technique. In this study, a total of 18,313 peptides were identified with ≤ 0.01 FDR, which could be classified into 484 protein groups. Additionally, 138 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified in the resistant biotype (R), while 93 DEPs were identified in the susceptible biotype (S). Gene Ontology (GO) analysis revealed that these DEPs mainly consisted of proteins related to photosynthesis, respiration, amino acid synthesis and translation, secondary metabolite biosynthesis, defense proteins, and detoxification. Furthermore, enrichment pathway analysis using Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) showed that the most important pathways included metabolic pathways, carbohydrate metabolism, secondary metabolites, amino acid synthesis, and photosynthesis. The function of DEPs indicated that some proteins, such as cytochrome P450, play a direct role in herbicide detoxification. Overall, the results of this study demonstrated the complex response of the resistant biotype to herbicides and its ability to increase antioxidant capacity through up-regulated detoxification proteins, particularly cytochrome P450 (Q6YSB4), and defense proteins, particularly superoxide dismutase (Q0DRV6) and polyamine oxidase (Q7XR46). In the resistant A. ludoviciana populations, in addition to the activation of enzymatic and non-enzymatic defense systems, other strategies such as reduced photosynthesis and respiration, increased transcription and translation activity, enhanced lipid metabolism, regulation of cellular processes and homeostasis, and up-regulation of proteins associated with signaling and ion channels play a role in resistance to herbicide. Overall these findings provide new insights into the role of different proteins in resistance to herbicides and contribute to a comprehensive understanding of herbicide resistance in A. ludoviciana."
"Previous research indicates that both adults and newborns show enhanced electrophysiological and behavioral responses to schematic face-like configurations (FCs-three dots composing a downward-pointing triangle), as compared to the inverted configurations (ICs). Even fetuses, when exposed to light stimuli projected through the uterine wall, preferentially orient their heads toward FCs rather than ICs. However, when this effect emerges along the third trimester of pregnancy and in relation to the maturation of which brain structures is still unknown. Here, to provide a sensitive measure of fetal preference for FCs along the whole third trimester, fetal lens movements in response to FCs and ICs was monitored with 2D-ultrasound. In a series of three experiments, fetuses were recruited at 26, 31, and 37 weeks of gestational age and were presented with both flashing and continuous light stimuli. Our results showed that significantly more lens movements were observed in response to continuous as compared to flashing light stimuli. Furthermore, lens movements linearly increased within the third trimester and, regardless of the time-point, significantly more lens movements were observed in response to FCs versus ICs. We also found a significant correlation in the first time-point, wherein the greater the FCs versus ICs differential response the larger the thalamic nuclei dimension. These findings suggest that FC preference is already present at the beginning of the third trimester, as soon as thalamocortical projections are established."
"As populations age, low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are rapidly adapting hospital services to meet the needs of older populations.

The interest in this research area continues to grow annually, thereby increasing the demand for the high-throughput profiling of human blood plasma N-glycome. In response to this need, we have developed an optimized, simple, and rapid protocol for the N-glycome profiling of human plasma proteins. This protocol encompasses the entire analysis cycle, from plasma isolation to N-glycan spectrum quantification. While the proposed method may have lower efficiency compared to already published high-throughput methods, its adaptability makes it suitable for implementation in virtually any molecular biological laboratory."
"Dysbiosis of the gut microbiota is closely associated with neurodegenerative diseases, including Huntington's disease (HD). Gut microbiome-derived metabolites are key factors in host-microbiome interactions. This study aimed to investigate the crucial gut microbiome and metabolites in HD and their correlations. Fecal and serum samples from 11 to 26 patients with HD, respectively, and 16 and 23 healthy controls, respectively, were collected. The fecal samples were used for shotgun metagenomics while the serum samples for metabolomics analysis. Integrated analysis of the metagenomics and metabolomics data was also conducted. Firmicutes, Bacteroidota, Proteobacteria, Uroviricota, Actinobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia were the dominant phyla. At the genus level, the presence of Bacteroides, Faecalibacterium, Parabacteroides, Alistipes, Dialister, and Christensenella was higher in HD patients, while the abundance of Lachnospira, Roseburia, Clostridium, Ruminococcus, Blautia, Butyricicoccus, Agathobaculum, Phocaeicola, Coprococcus, and Fusicatenibacter decreased. A total of 244 differential metabolites were identified and found to be enriched in the glycerophospholipid, nucleotide, biotin, galactose, and alpha-linolenic acid metabolic pathways. The AUC value from the integrated analysis (1) was higher than that from the analysis of the gut microbiota (0.8632). No significant differences were found in the ACE, Simpson, Shannon, Sobs, and Chao indexes between HD patients and controls. Our study determined crucial functional gut microbiota and potential biomarkers associated with HD pathogenesis, providing new insights into the role of the gut microbiota-brain axis in HD occurrence and development."
"The win ratio method has been increasingly applied in the design and analysis of clinical trials. However, the win ratio method is a univariate approach that does not allow for adjusting for baseline imbalances in covariates, although a stratified win ratio can be calculated when the number of strata is small. This paper proposes an adjusted win ratio to control for such imbalances by inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) method. We derive the adjusted win ratio with its variance and suggest three IPTW adjustments: IPTW-average treatment effect (IPTW-ATE), stabilized IPTW-ATE (SIPTW-ATE) and IPTW-average treatment effect in the treated (IPTW-ATT). The proposed adjusted methods are applied to analyse a composite outcome in the CHARM trial. The statistical properties of the methods are assessed through simulations. Results show that adjusted win ratio methods can correct the win ratio for covariate imbalances at baseline. Simulation results show that the three proposed adjusted win ratios have similar power to detect the treatment difference and have slightly lower power than the corresponding adjusted Cox models when the assumption of proportional hazards holds true but have consistently higher power than adjusted Cox models when the proportional hazard assumption is violated."
"Aging is a complex and multifaceted process involving many epigenetic alterations. One key area of interest in aging research is the role of histone modifications, which can dynamically regulate gene expression. Here, we conducted a pan-tissue analysis of the dynamics of seven key histone modifications during human aging. Our histone-specific age prediction models showed surprisingly accurate performance, proving resilient to experimental and artificial noise. Simulation experiments for comparison with DNA methylation age predictors revealed competitive performance. Moreover, gene set enrichment analysis uncovered several critical developmental pathways for age prediction. Different from DNA methylation age predictors, genes known to be involved in aging biology are among the most important ones for the models. Last, we developed a pan-tissue pan-histone age predictor, suggesting that age-related epigenetic information is degenerated across the epigenome. This research highlights the power of histone marks as input for creating robust age predictors and opens avenues for understanding the role of epigenetic changes during aging."
"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease accompanied with the loss of cartilage and consequent nociceptive symptoms. Normal articular cartilage maintains at aneural state. Neuron guidance factor Semaphorin 3A (Sema3A) is a membrane-associated secreted protein with chemorepulsive properties for axons. However, the role of Sema3A in articular cartilage is still not clear. In the present studies, we investigated the functions of Sema3A in OA development in mice, non-human primates, and patients with OA. Sema3A has a protective effect on cartilage degradation, validated by the organoid culture in vitro and confirmed in chondrocyte-specific Sema3A conditional knockout mice. We demonstrated that Sema3A is a key molecule in maintaining cartilage homeostasis from chondrocyte hypertrophy via activating the PI3K pathway. The potential usage of Sema3A for OA treatment was validated in mouse and Rhesus macaque OA models through intra-articular injection of Sema3A, and also in patients by administering Sema3A containing platelet-rich plasma into the knee joints. Our studies demonstrated that Sema3A exerts a critical role in inhibiting neurite ingrowth and preventing chondrocyte hypertrophy in cartilage, and could be potentially used for OA treatment."
The aim of this single-center observational study was to assess the real-world performance of first- and second-generation automated insulin delivery (AID) systems in a cohort of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes over a one-year follow-up.
"Liupao tea is a post-fermented dark tea with bitterness and astringency as key sensory traits, though its chemical composition is not fully understood. Six Liupao tea samples with significant differences in bitterness and astringency were analyzed using non-targeted metabolomics and sensory evaluation. Thirty finished and five semi-finished Liupao tea samples were analyzed using UHPLC-MS-PRM for targeted quantification of bitter and astringent compounds. The results show that 477 non-volatile compounds were detected, including 18 potential bitter compounds and 22 potential astringent compounds. Six key bitter compounds (epigallocatechin gallate, catechin gallate, caffeine, quinic acid, neochlorogenic acid, and caffeic acid) and 11 key astringent compounds (e.g., epigallocatechin gallate, gallic acid, chlorogenic acid, ellagic acid) were identified. After fermentation, flavonoid glycosides and flavanols were reduced by 62.41 % to 97.46 %, while phenolic acids showed varied trends. Different rates of change in key compounds during fermentation resulted in variations in bitterness and astringency. This study offers insights for improving Liupao tea quality."
"According to the Portuguese clinical guidelines published in 1999, patients with traumatic brain injury and coagulopathies should remain in-hospital for 24 hours for clinical and image surveillance, despite having an admission computed tomography (CT) scan showing no intracranial lesions. Growing evidence suggests this practice is not only void of clinical relevance, but that it can also be potentially harmful for the patient. Nevertheless, up until now there is no published data concerning the economic impact of this clinical practice."

"Cellular senescence is an adverse factor in the development of pulmonary fibrosis (PF). Ginsenoside Rb1 has been found to inhibit both cellular senescence and PF. This study aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which ginsenoside Rb1 regulates cellular senescence and PF. A PF mouse model was established by Bleomycin (BLM) administration, and a cell model of senescence was constructed using MRC-5 cells treated with Adriamycin RD (ARD) administration. Hematoxylin and Eosin (HE) staining and Masson staining were employed to evaluate cellular structure and collagen fiber content. RT-qPCR and western blotting were used to detect mRNA and protein expression of the target genes. Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) was applied to measure the protein concentration of IL-1[Formula: see text] and IL-18. SA-[Formula: see text]-gal staining was used to evaluate cellular senescence. Our results show that ginsenoside Rb1 effectively suppressed BLM-induced PF in mice. ARD administration to induce cellular senescence reduced NRF2, QKI, and SMAD7 expression in MRC-5 cells. By inducing NRF2 overexpression, ARD-induced cellular senescence and fibrosis in MRC-5 cells were relieved. Notably, NRF2 knockdown abolished the mitigating effects of ginsenoside Rb1 on ARD-induced cellular senescence and fibrosis in MRC-5 cells. Mechanistically, NRF2 increased SMAD7 mRNA stability through the transcriptional regulation of QKI. As expected, ginsenoside Rb1 alleviated ARD-induced senescence and fibrosis in MRC-5 cells by activating the NRF2/QKI/SMAD7 axis. Therefore, it was found that ginsenoside Rb1 mitigates cellular senescence and fibrosis during PF progression by activating the NRF2/QKI/SMAD7 axis. This study provides a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of PF and elucidates its mechanism of action."
"The diagnosis of amyloidosis is important for early intervention, disease monitoring, and prevention of complications and progression. Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) and trigger digit (TD) are two common conditions associated with early disease. The purpose of this study was to define disease prevalence among patients with bilateral CTS and multiple TDs and assess for an increased rate of diagnosis in the presence of both."
"In observational studies, identifying and adjusting for a sufficient set of confounders is crucial for accurately estimating the causal effect of the exposure on the outcome. Even in studies with large sample sizes, which typically benefit from small variances in estimates, there is a risk of producing estimates that are precisely inaccurate if the study suffers from systematic errors or biases, including confounding bias. To date, several approaches have been developed for selecting confounders. In this article, we first summarize the epidemiological and statistical approaches to identifying a sufficient set of confounders. Particularly, we introduce the modified disjunctive cause criterion as one of the most useful approaches, which involves controlling for any pre-exposure covariate that affects the exposure, outcome, or both. It then excludes instrumental variables but includes proxies for the shared common cause of exposure and outcome. Statistical confounder selection is also useful when dealing with a large number of covariates, even in studies with small sample sizes. After introducing several approaches, we discuss some pitfalls and considerations in confounder selection, such as the adjustment for instrumental variables, intermediate variables, and baseline outcome variables. Lastly, as it is often difficult to comprehensively measure key confounders, we introduce two statistics, E-value and robustness value, for assessing sensitivity to unmeasured confounders. Illustrated examples are provided using the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey Epidemiologic Follow-up Study. Integrating these principles and approaches will enhance our understanding of confounder selection and facilitate better reporting and interpretation of future epidemiological studies."
"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a highly effective therapy for malignant blood illnesses that pose a high risk, as well as diseases that are at risk due to other variables, such as genetics. However, the prevalence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) has impeded its widespread use. Ensuring the stability of microbial varieties and associated metabolites is crucial for supporting metabolic processes, preventing pathogen intrusion, and modulating the immune system. Consequently, it significantly affects the overall well-being and susceptibility of the host to disease. Patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) may experience a disruption in the balance between the immune system and gut bacteria when treated with medicines and foreign cells. This can lead to secondary intestinal inflammation and GVHD. Thus, GM is both a reliable indicator of post-transplant mortality and a means of enhancing GVHD prevention and treatment after allo-HSCT. This can be achieved through various strategies, including nutritional support, probiotics, selective use of antibiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) to target gut microbes. This review examines research advancements and the practical use of intestinal bacteria in GVHD following allo-HSCT. These findings may offer novel insights into the prevention and treatment of GVHD after allo-HSCT."
Distal myopathies (MPDs) are heterogeneous diseases of complex diagnosis whose prevalence and distribution in specific populations are unknown.
"As little is known about sexual satisfaction among older (≥ 65 years) cancer survivors, this study examined sexual satisfaction defined as physical pleasure and emotional satisfaction in sexual relationships, including associated factors. This secondary analysis of the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project round 3 data set included 173 partnered older cancer survivors. The data included ratings of physical pleasure, emotional satisfaction, importance of sexual activity, mental and physical health, and scores of sexual function (the presence of problems; if any, the extent of related bother) and social support and strain from partners. The sample's mean age was 74.30 years (SD = 6.36). Most were male (n = 120, 69.36%) and White (n = 139, 80.35%). Older adults reported they were ""very"" satisfied with sexual relationships both physically and emotionally: mean (SD) = 2.88 (1.01) and 3.18 (0.77), respectively. Seventy (40.46%) had problems with sexual function that were bothersome. Adjusted linear regression models showed physical pleasure was associated with perceived physical health (β = 0.22) and social support (β = 0.19); and emotional satisfaction was associated with social support (β = 0.39) and strain from partners (β = -0.23). Sexual function was not associated with sexual satisfaction. In conclusion, perceived health and social factors may be more influential than sexual function in older cancer survivors' sexual satisfaction, but future research is warranted to confirm these relationships. A focus on relational aspects of sexual health may provide a broader array of options to improve older cancer survivors' sexual satisfaction."
"Linseed is an ancient crop used for diverse purposes since the beginning of civilization. In recent times, linseed has emerged as a superfood due to its high content of health-promoting omega-3 fatty acids and other bioactive compounds. Among primary health effects, it has potential to manage hypertension, diabetes, osteoporosis, atherosclerosis, cancer, arthritis, neurological, cardiovascular diseases including blood cholesterol levels, constipation, diarrhea, and autoimmune disorders etc. due to the presence of omega-3 fatty acid, lignans, high dietary fibers, and proteins, whereas, secondary health effects comprise of relieving from various skin disorders. Due to these health-beneficial properties, interest in linseed oil necessitates the intensification of research efforts on various aspects. These include cultivation technology, varietal and genetic improvement, post-harvest processing, profiling of nutrients and bioactive compounds, pre-clinical and clinical studies, etc. The present review discussed the advances in linseed research including pre- and post-harvest processing. However, focus on the bioactive compounds present in linseed oil and their health effects are also presented. Linseed cultivation, pre- and post-harvest processing aspects are covered including climatic, edaphic, agronomic factors, type of cultivar and storage conditions etc, which impact the overall oil yield and its nutritional quality. Various emerging applications of linseed oil in functional food, nutraceutical, pharmaceutical, and cosmeceutical preparations were also presented in detail. Further, recommendations were made on linseed oil research in the field of genetics, breeding germplasm resources and genome editing for exploring its full applications as a nutrition and health product."
"Dyslipidemia in infants is a rare condition characterized by abnormal levels of lipids in the blood, such as cholesterol and triglycerides. Early diagnosis poses a challenge due to nonspecific symptoms and lipid criteria differing from adults. Through two clinical cases of familial dyslipidemia (Type 1 Familial Hypercholesterolemia and Type 2b Combined Familial Hyperlipidemia), we highlight the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges encountered in infants, emphasizing the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in care and early screening. In the first case, a 3-month-old boy with a family history of dyslipidemia was diagnosed during bronchiolitis, revealing milky serum, pseudohyponatremia, and abnormal lipid profile. His Type 1 familial hyperlipidemia was confirmed by lipid electrophoresis. Despite dietary management and breastfeeding, he developed severe pancreatitis, successfully treated with intensive care. The second case involved a girl who presented at 3 months with vomiting and irritability. Laboratory tests indicated pseudohyponatremia, hematologic abnormalities, and lipid disturbances. Her Type 2b familial hyperlipidemia was confirmed by lipid electrophoresis. She responded well to a specialized diet, experiencing few pancreatitis episodes without meeting clinical or radiological severity criteria."
"In vitro antibody evolution is a powerful technique for improving monoclonal antibodies. This can be achieved by generating artificial diversity on an antibody template, which can be done using different in vitro diversification techniques. The resulting libraries consist of single- or multimutant variants of a defined antibody template that are screened for improved function using antibody display. Here, we describe a bioinformatic protocol for tracking synthetic antibody variants using high-throughput sequencing across screening rounds, enabling efficient high-throughput interpretation of the function of individual mutations in sorted antibody display libraries. The protocol enables a user to achieve precision analysis and interpretation of clonal antibody variant data for discovery purposes, especially for high-throughput antibody engineering or optimization against target antigens."
"Recent studies have found that disulfidptosis occurs in cells under glucose starvation. The role of this programmed death method in gastric cancer remains to be explored. Cluster analysis based on disulfidptosis related genes to analyze the differential characteristics of disulfidptosis subtypes. We construct a prognostic risk model using 12 differentially expressed genes of disulfidptosis subtypes. We also analyzed the disulfidptosis subtypes at single-cell resolution. We found that cluster 1 has a poor prognosis and is characterized by a younger age. Inhibiting the expression of GAMT genes associated with disulfidptosis subtypes can significantly inhibit the proliferation of gastric cancer cells, which may be an important target for gastric cancer treatment. Cluster 2 patients are more sensitive to various chemotherapy drugs and immunotherapy. Mesenchymal cells, especially myCAF, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells, have strong disulfidptosis scores. In summary, our study provides new insights into the role of disulfidptosis in gastric cancer, and this may be used to guide the treatment of gastric cancer."
"Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is an abundant heterotrimeric holoenzyme in eukaryotic cells coordinating with specific kinases to regulate spatial-temporal protein dephosphorylation in various biological processes. However, the function of PP2A in cortical neurogenesis remains largely unknown. Here, we report that neuronal-specific deletion of Pp2acα in mice displayed microcephaly, with significantly smaller brains and defective learning and memory ability. Mechanistically, neuronal Pp2acα deficiency resulted in elevated endogenous DNA damage and activation of ATR/CHK1 signaling. It was further induced by the loss of direct interaction between PP2AC and ATR as well as the function of PP2AC to dephosphorylate ATR. Importantly, ATR/CHK1 signaling dysregulation altered both the expression and activity of several critical downstream factors including P53, P21, Bcl2, and Bax, which led to decreased proliferation of cortical progenitor cells and increased apoptosis in developing cortical neurons. Taken together, our results indicate an essential function of PP2ACα in endogenous DNA damage response-mediated ATR signaling during neurogenesis, and defective PP2ACα in neurons contributes to microcephaly."
"Technological development has led to the need for materials able to block electromagnetic waves (EMWs) emitted from various devices. EMWs could negatively affect the working performance and lifetime of multiple instruments and measuring devices. New EMW shielding materials are being developed, while among nanomaterials, graphene-based composites have shown promising features. Herein, we have produced graphene oxide (GO), silver nanowires (AgNWs) composites, by varying the mass ratios of each component. UV-Vis, infrared, Raman spectroscopies, and thermogravimetric analysis proved the establishment of the interactions between them. For the first time, the strength and the nature of the interaction between GO sheets with various levels of oxidation and AgNWs were investigated using density function theory (DFT). The interaction energy between ideal graphene and AgNWs was calculated to be -48.9 kcal/mol, while for AgNWs and GO, this energy is almost doubled at -81.9 kcal/mol. The DFT results confirmed the interfacial polarization at the heterointerface via charge transfer and accumulation at the interface, improving the efficacy of EMW shielding. Our results indicated that AgNWs create a compact complex with GO due to charge transfer between them. Charge redistributions in GO-AgNWs composites resulted in an improved ability of the composite to block EMWs compared to GO alone."
"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects up to 1 in 59 children, and is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders. Recent genomic studies have highlighted the role of rare variants in ASD. This study aimed to identify genes affected by rare variants shared by siblings with ASD and validate the function of a candidate gene FRRS1L. By integrating the whole genome sequencing data of 866 multiplex families from the Hartwell Foundation's Autism Research and Technology Initiative and Autism Speaks MSSNG project, we identified rare variants shared by two or more siblings with ASD. Using shared rare variants (SRVs), we selected candidate genes for ASD. Gene prioritization by evolutionary features and expression alterations on autism identified FRRS1L in two families, including one with impaired social behaviors. One variant in this family was 6 bp away from human-specific trinucleotide fixation. Additionally, CRISPR/Cas9 experiments demonstrated downregulation by a family variant and upregulation by a fixed site. Population genetics further demonstrated that upregulation of this gene has been favored during human evolution. Various mouse behavioral tests showed that Frrs1l knockout specifically impairs social novelty recognition without altering other behavioral phenotypes. Furthermore, we constructed humanized mice by introducing human sequences into a mouse genome. These knockin mice showed improved abilities to retain social memory over time. The results of our population genetic and evolutionary analyses, behavior experiments, and genome editing propose a molecular mechanism that may confer a selective advantage through social memory enhancement and may cause autism-related social impairment when disrupted in humans. These findings highlight the role of FRRS1L, the AMPA receptor subunit, in social behavior and evolution."
"Overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) are commonly associated with an adverse prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This makes them key targets for the treatment of HCC. Studies have shown that the clinical efficacy of the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib alone in treating HCC is limited. Herein, we developed a series of novel gold(I) complexes using a ""dual-targeting strategy"" by combining gold(I) complexes with different gefitinib derivatives. Among them, the best complex 6g exhibits significant antiproliferative activity against Huh7 cells and Huh7R (lenvatinib-resistant) cells. Remarkably, complex 6g inhibits the expression of phosphorylated EGFR while also effectively inhibiting intracellular TrxR activity. In addition, complex 6g causes a significant increase in the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), disrupts mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), arrests the cell cycle in the G0/G1 phase, and induces apoptosis. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that complex 6g exhibits potential anti-HCC effects via dual-targeting of EGFR and TrxR."
Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) sequence analysis to screen for fetal aneuploidy can incidentally detect maternal cancer. Additional data are needed to identify DNA-sequencing patterns and other biomarkers that can identify pregnant persons who are most likely to have cancer and to determine the best approach for follow-up.
"Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) demonstrates significant heterogeneity, investigations into the distinctions in clinical and molecular characteristics between Chinese Uygur and Han DLBCL patients remain unexplored. We retrospectively reviewed 279 DLBCL patients (105 Uygur and 174 Han patients), of which 155 patients underwent genetic profiling by NGS. Compared with Han patient, Uygur patients have better clinical prognostic indicators, including a higher proportion of patients with 0-1 extranodal involvement and I/II Ann Arbor staging. Consistently, Uygur patients were significantly associated with lower risk of relapse (P = 0.06), with a one-year relapse rate of 5% vs 17% and two-year relapse rate of 19% vs 36% compared to Han patients. At the molecular level, TP53 (21.3%) was among the top frequently altered gene in the cohort. Notably, the Uygur patients exhibited a significantly lower frequency of TP53 alterations and higher frequency of ASXL3 alterations. Logistic regression analysis showed that the lowered frequency of TP53 and enrichment of ASXL3 in the Uygur patients were independent of other factors. However, only patients with TP53 mutations had higher relapse rate than those with wild type TP53 (one-year, 20% vs 10%; two-year, 51% vs 21%). Our findings highlight the notable contribution of a low TP53 mutation frequency in Uygur patients as a pivotal factor associated with the favorable prognosis of this population."
"Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) are a group of connective tissue disorders associated with skin, ligament, blood vessel and organ abnormalities. Skin hyperextensibility, joint hypermobility and widened atrophic scars are characteristic of classical EDS. Vascular complications, though rare in classical EDS, can be life-threatening, and this necessitates one to look for vascular associations in non-vascular, such as classical, forms of EDS due to the heterogeneity of the syndrome. Reports of vascular complications in classical EDS are often limited to haematomas being the most frequent manifestation. This case report discusses an elderly patient with genetically confirmed classical EDS who suffered from a series of pulmonary and vascular complications, including recurrent spontaneous haemopneumothorax, aortic dissection and eventual mesenteric haemorrhage, which resulted in his death. Identifying clinical red flags is crucial to predict such future catastrophic vascular events and guide appropriate counselling and management strategies for individuals with classical EDS."
"This paper examines the impact of environmental management system (EMS) certification, a significant voluntary participatory environmental regulation, on the risk of stock price collapse. The study is based on sample data of heavily polluting listed companies from 2008-2020. The study demonstrates that certification of environmental management systems has a significant impact on preventing share price collapse. This finding remains consistent even after controlling for endogeneity and conducting robustness tests. The analysis also reveals that the inhibitory effect of EMS certification is more pronounced for state-owned enterprises and firms with a higher degree of marketisation. Exploring the mechanism of its influence, it is found that environmental management system certification mainly suppresses the risk of stock price collapse by improving the environmental performance of enterprises and the transparency of corporate information, suggesting that environmental management system certification can be used as both an ""environmental governance tool"" for suppressing stock price collapse and an ""information transfer tool"" for improving the transparency of corporate information, thus suppressing the risk of stock price collapse. Meanwhile, the media's attention has been found to moderate the effect of environmental management system certification on stock price crash risk. These findings validate the inhibitory effect of environmental management system certification on stock price crash risk, expand our understanding of the economic consequences of environmental management system certification and the factors that influence stock price crash risk. They also provide a theoretical basis and practical support for environmental regulators."
"It is currently unclear how Pseudomonadota, a phylum that originated around the time of the Great Oxidation Event, became one of the most abundant and diverse bacterial phyla on Earth, with metabolically versatile members colonizing a wide range of environments with different O2 concentrations. Here, we address this question by studying isoprenoid quinones, which are central components of energy metabolism covering a wide range of redox potentials. We demonstrate that a dynamic repertoire of quinone biosynthetic pathways accompanied the diversification of Pseudomonadota. The low potential menaquinone (MK) was lost in an ancestor of Pseudomonadota while the high potential ubiquinone (UQ) emerged. We show that the O2-dependent and O2-independent UQ pathways were both present in the last common ancestor of Pseudomonadota, and transmitted vertically. The O2-independent pathway has a conserved genetic organization and displays signs of positive regulation by the master regulator ""fumarate and nitrate reductase"" (FNR), suggesting a conserved role for UQ in anaerobiosis across Pseudomonadota. The O2-independent pathway was lost in some lineages but maintained in others, where it favoured a secondary reacquisition of low potential quinones (MK or rhodoquinone), which promoted diversification towards aerobic facultative and anaerobic metabolisms. Our results support that the ecological success of Pseudomonadota is linked to the acquisition of the largest known repertoire of quinones, which allowed adaptation to oxic niches as O2 levels increased on Earth, and subsequent diversification into anoxic or O2-fluctuating environments."
To test the reliability of the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology Giant cell arteritis (GCA) Ultrasonography Score (OGUS) and other composite scores in a patient-based exercise involving experts and non-experts in vascular ultrasonography.
"The emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) poses a significant threat to health globally. During searching for new chemical entities regulating MDR- and XDR-Mtb, chemical investigation of the black oil beetle gut bacterium Micromonospora sp. GR10 led to the discovery of eight new members of arenicolides along with the identification of arenicolide A (Ar-A, 1), which was a previously reported macrolide with incomplete configuration. Genomic analysis of the bacterial strain GR10 revealed their putative biosynthetic pathway. Quantum mechanics-based computation, chemical derivatizations, and bioinformatic analysis established the absolute stereochemistry of Ar-A and arenicolides D-K (Ar-D-K, 2-9) completely for the first time. Biological studies of 1-9 revealed their antimicrobial activity against MDR and XDR strains of Mtb. Ar-A had the most potent in vitro antimicrobial efficacy against MDR- and XDR-Mtb. Mechanistically, Ar-A induced ATP depletion and destabilized Mtb cell wall, thereby inhibiting growth. Notably, Ar-A exerted a significant antimicrobial effect against Mtb in macrophages, was effective in the treatment of Mtb infections, and showed a synergistic effect with amikacin (AMK) in a mouse model of MDR-Mtb lung infection. Collectively, our findings indicate Ar-A to be a promising drug lead for drug-resistant tuberculosis."
"Exercising during cancer treatment reduces fatigue, improves quality of life, and increases survival, yet 60-70% of Australians undergoing cancer treatment do not meet current physical activity (PA) recommendations. This study aimed to explore barriers and enablers to PA amongst people undergoing cancer treatment and develop a video resource targeting these barriers."
"WHAT IS KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT?: Professional sexual misconduct is the name given to the phenomenon of healthcare providers crossing sexual boundaries with their patients. It is comprised of a range of behaviors from comments to unwanted touching and even rape. The exact incidence is unknown, but estimates have been made. These abuses are thought to be underreported. The applicable reporting processes are problematic. Trauma-informed care presupposes knowledge of various types of trauma, and this is one type. Traua-informed care places emphasis on healthcare systems and healthcare providers' avoidance of retraumatizing patients who disclose any type of trauma, including sexual violence. WHAT THE PAPER ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: This paper adds one narrative experience of a sexual assault perpetrated by the writer's colleague psychiatrist. It can be viewed as a cautionary tale about horizontal violence against nurses. This narrative discusses how one traumatic event can mushroom into chronic traumatic sequelae when disclosure re-traumatizes. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: Increased knowledge of this type of sexual violence may help those who have suffered it. As psychiatry is among the healthcare fields who regularly screen patients for trauma, it is imperative that the psychiatric workforce gain familiarity with trauma-informed responses to avoid re-traumatizing patients who disclose sexual violence."
"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has emerged as a transformative treatment for various hematological malignancies. Still, its remarkable efficacy is accompanied by unique adverse events that must be carefully managed. This comprehensive literature review evaluates the safety profile of CAR T-cell therapy, focusing on cytopenia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)/macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), and other potential complications. Cytopenia, characterized by reduced blood cell counts, affects a significant proportion of patients, with rates of anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia reaching up to 60%, 70%, and 80%, respectively. Risk factors include high tumor burden, prior chemotherapy, and bone marrow involvement. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) occurs in 13% to 77% of patients and is linked to the cytokine storm induced by CAR T cells, target antigen expression, and preexisting immune dysregulation. Other notable adverse events discussed are cytokine release syndrome, neurotoxicity, and infections. Understanding the mechanisms, risk factors, and management strategies for these adverse events is crucial for optimizing patient outcomes and unlocking the full potential of this revolutionary therapy. The review highlights the need for continued research, interdisciplinary collaboration, and evidence-based approaches to enhance the safety and efficacy of CAR T-cell therapy."
"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer among men and women combined, and the second leading cause of cancer death in the US. The revised USPSTF CRC screening recommendations increased CRC screening needs across health systems, which may create particular challenges for community health centers (CHCs) given their resource constraints. The objective of our study is to assess CRC screening rates across 10 CHCs in Massachusetts and estimate the additional increase in the number of average-risk screening-eligible individuals after the revision in guidelines. CRC screening was defined as being up to date vs. not up to date based on any of the approved screening modalities in the appropriate time frame. Our outcome of interest was CRC screening by age group and the percentage increase in screenings needed to screen individuals 45 to 49 across our partner CHCs after the revision in guidelines. Our analysis included 70,808 individuals aged 45 to 75. The overall CRC screening rate was 35.9% after the USPSTF guideline revision. Screening rates were lowest in those aged 45 to 49 at 9.6%, and highest in those over age 55 at 47.0%. There was a 22.9% increase in additional screenings needed after USPSTF guideline revision. The revised USPSTF guidelines increased screening needs by about 23% without additional funding for CHCs for which demand already outstrips staffing and clinical care resources. Future studies should include cost analyses of screening the population 45 to 49 and identify effective strategies that are low burden and do not add to the workload of CHC providers to improve screening at CHCs."
"The cervical uncinate process is a unique structure of the cervical spine that undergoes significant changes in its morphological characteristics with age, and these changes may be related to osteoporosis. This study aimed to observe the distribution of cancellous bone in the cervical uncinate process and its morphological features using micro-computed tomography (Micro-CT) to gain a deeper understanding of the morphological characteristics of the uncinate microstructure. We performed Micro-CT scans on 31 sets of C3-C7 vertebrae, a total of 155 intact bone samples, and subsequently used the measurement software with the Micro-CT system to obtain parameters related to the cancellous bone of the uncinate process. We found that the cancellous bone of the uncinate process was predominantly longitudinally cross-aligned and continuous with the cancellous bone within the vertebral body. Comparisons between the left and right sides of each parameter showed significant differences only in the bone surface area, and the peaks of each parameter were primarily concentrated in C4-C6. In this study, we found that the C5 uncinate process is the site of most significant stress in the cervical vertebrae, which leads to the earliest occurrence of osteoporosis, and this study provides experimental, theoretical bases for the prevention of cervical spondylosis and osteoporosis, and the diagnosis and treatment of related diseases."
"The present research aimed to evaluate the effects of the continuative dietary administration of a hemp oil extract containing cannabinoids (cannabidiol, CBD) on the macroscopic morphology, morphometry, and enzymatic activity of different intestinal tracts as well as on the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in the cecum of growing rabbits. The research was performed on 16 rabbits randomly selected from 2 experimental groups (8 per group). In detail, 42 sixty-day-old New Zealand White × California rabbits (sex ratio 1:1, average weight 1621.3 ± 46.2 g) were homogeneously divided into 2 groups (21 animals/group), namely control and CBD. Both groups were fed the same commercial diet, but the CBD one was supplemented with 0.1 mL of hemp extract in coconut-based oil corresponding to 10 mg of CBD/animal/d. Up to 92 d of age (for 27 d), individual live weight and feed intake were measured weekly. At 92 d of age, 8 rabbits/group (sex ratio 1:1) were moved to a specialized slaughterhouse, and the gastrointestinal tract was separated from the carcass. Samples from 8 rabbits per dietary treatment were used for the histomorphological analysis of small and large intestines. In addition, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and cecum were processed for enzymatic analysis. The caecal contents were used for the SCFAs determination. The administration of CBD did not affect feed intake and the final rabbits' whole body weight (P > 0.05), but some changes were detected in the gastrointestinal tract of the animals. CBD seemed to interfere with protein digestion, with a significantly lower activity of the enzymes related to peptides in the small intestine and a consequent increase of the fermentative activity of caecal microbiota. This effect, in combination with a general decrease of fermentative activity in the caecal content of rabbits submitted to CBD treatment, was responsible for a change in the SCFA proportion mainly regarding the reduction of butyrate production (P < 0.01) that resulted significant higher in CTR group compared to CBD. This last result is very important for intestinal health. Such fermentation activity modification was coupled with changes in the relative abundance of goblet cells in the colon. Overall, our findings suggest that a relatively long-term administration of CBD may affect digestion in rabbits, in particular at enzymatic and fermentative levels."
"Puberty is a particularly vulnerable time for individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) during which baseline challenges are exacerbated, functioning often deteriorates, and additional barriers emerge. Specific concerns include increased vulnerability, decreased safety, and increased mood and behavioral disturbances. Youth with ASD need guidance and explicit instruction/skill development on topics such as hygiene/self-care, appropriate sexual activity, and menstruation management. Lack of provider preparation, knowledge, and confidence, along with stigma about the needs and capabilities of individuals with ASD, are major barriers to care. Initiatives to expand the preparation of health care personnel, including nurse practitioners, to provide quality care to individuals with ASD are essential. This article describes the results of a pilot project using a brief, self-guided educational intervention for developing and practicing family nurse practitioners. Before and after viewing the educational module, participants completed author-created surveys assessing their self-perceived knowledge, attitudes, and intent to change practice. Expert analysis of survey items provided face validity. Comparison of mean presurvey and postsurvey responses showed significant increases in self-perceived knowledge, attitudes, and intent to implement practice changes. Lack of confidence was endorsed as the most common remaining barrier to change. Findings indicate that the brief module improved participants' self-reported knowledge, attitudes, and intent to implement practice recommendations. Such interventions can be easily incorporated into nursing education and professional development and are appropriate for dissemination to nurse practitioners working within and outside primary care settings, as well as to related service providers."
Relative dose intensity (RDI) is a measurement of chemotherapy (CT) dose defined as the actual dose received divided by the standard calculated dose during a set period. The study objective was to assess the impact of a RDI ≥ 80% on response and survival of patients treated in first line CT by FOLFOXIRI or FOLFIRINOX ± Bevacizumab (BV) for an unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).
"Evidence on co-occurring mental health problems in youth with physical disabilities is growing, however how services are provided remains unclear. This study examined current interprofessional rehabilitation practices for physical and mental health services."
To describe the characteristics and quality of caring interactions between nurses and patients during the earlier phases of the COVID-19 pandemic in acute and home care settings.
A previous study had established the safety and preserved of quality of life in patients with adrenal insufficiency (AI) who received prednisolone 5 mg once daily at sahur (predawn) during Ramadan fasting. It has been postulated that a lower dose of prednisolone between 2 and 3 mg may be sufficient for glucocorticoid replacement in this group of patients. This study aimed to assess the safety and effect on quality of life in patients with AI given prednisolone 2.5 mg during Ramadan fasting.
"Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare metabolic disorder caused by variations in the ATP7B gene. It usually manifests hepatic, neurologic, and psychiatric symptoms due to excessive copper accumulation. The prevalence of WD and its common variants differ across populations. This study aimed to examine these aspects of WD within the Thai population, where information has been limited. We reviewed ClinVar and the Wilson Disease Mutation Database, organizing variants classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic in one or both databases as ""relaxed"" and ""strict"" lists. Allele frequencies were estimated from genotyping array data (Asian Screening Array: ASA; Illumina Corp, CA) of 6291 Thai subjects, which also underwent genotype imputation. The prevalence of WD in the Thai population was estimated assuming Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium. The strict list yielded a prevalence of 1/24,128 (carrier frequency=1/78), while the relaxed list yielded a prevalence of 1/9971 (carrier frequency=1/50). The most common WD variants in Thai subjects were c.2333 G > T, c.3443 T > C, and c.813 C > A from the strict list, and c.3316 G > A and c.2605 G > A from the relaxed list. The ASA chip covered approximately 59 and 24% of WD variants from the strict and relaxed lists, respectively. Based on the estimated prevalence, a carrier screening program for WD is not currently required in Thailand. However, as genotyping services become more affordable and accessible, such a program would facilitate early identification, treatment, and prevention of WD."
"Marine-derived foods, often called blue foods, are promising sustainable alternatives to conventional food sources owing to their abundant amino acids and high protein content. Current treatments for hyperuricemia, a chronic condition attributed to purine metabolism disorders, are associated with various side effects. Novel peptide xanthine oxidase inhibitors have been discovered in the hydrolyzed products of marine fish and invertebrate proteins, which have demonstrated promising therapeutic potential by reducing uric acid levels in vitro and in vivo. This review explores the potential therapeutic effects of xanthine oxidase inhibitors derived from marine fish and invertebrates, summarizes the methods for extracting bioactive peptides from marine organisms, and emphasizes the impact of different proteases on the structure-activity relationship of bioactive peptides. The hypouricemic effects of these bioactive peptides warrant further verification. There is consensus on the in vitro chemical methods used to verify the xanthine oxidase inhibitory effects of these peptides. Considering several cell and animal model development strategies, this review summarizes several highly recognized modeling methods, proposes strategies to improve the bioavailability of bioactive peptides, and advocates for a diversified evaluation system. Although the screening and evaluation methods for antihyperuricemic peptides have been shown to be feasible across numerous studies, they are not optimal. This review examines the deficiencies in bioavailability, synthesis efficiency, and evaluation mechanisms in terms of their future development and proposes potential solutions to address these issues. This review provides a novel perspective for the exploration and application of marine-derived hypouricemic bioactive peptides."
"The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between skeletal antero-posterior profile of popular family cartoon characters and their perceived personal characteristics. The Internet Movie DataBase (IMDB) was used to identify popular animated family movies released since 2000. Cartoon characters were identified, and classified based on their gender (male/female), skeletal profile (Class I, II or III) and character assessment (protagonist/antagonist). Descriptive statistical analysis was carried out. Chi Square analysis was used to assess the differences (p-value) between gender and character assessment against the skeletal profile. Fifty popular animated family movies were identified. Within these 88 humanoid cartoon characters were identified made up of 32 male protagonists, 27 female protagonists, 22 male antagonists and 7 female antagonists. 40, 30, 21 were assessed as having a Class I, II and III skeletal profiles respectively. Statistically significant differences were observed in both FPFA and MPFP values for Class III characters (P = 0.009 and P = 0.006, respectively). However, no significant variations were noted when comparing the remaining groups. Female antagonists and male protagonists were most likely to be portrayed with a Class III skeletal pattern when compared to female protagonists and male antagonists respectively."
"Older adults are the least likely age group to seek mental health services. However, few studies have explored a comprehensive range of sociodemographic, psychological, and social barriers and facilitators to seeking treatment in later life."
"We analyzed factors shaping the choice of the lead indication (i.e., cancer type) in the first clinical development projects of new oncological drugs in the United States (US), and how the type of pharmaceutical company is related to this choice. We selected 576 new clinical development projects in the US since 2000 for analysis. These projects were characterized according to three potential perspectives detected by multiple correspondence analysis: the morbidity of the cancer type which corresponds to market size of each cancer type, the company's previous experience with the cancer type, and the company's attitude to development risks. Mega firms tend to choose cancer types with higher morbidity (and large-market), previously experienced cancer types, while diverse small firms choose both major and rare cancers and both high- and low-risk projects, indicating that different sizes of firms utilize different development entry patterns. Common tendencies concerning the choice of lead indication were found across all companies. Cancer types the company had developed and launched in the past were more likely to be chosen; cancer types with high five-year survival rates and those with high competition were less likely to be chosen. The study showed that pharmaceutical companies seem to enter clinical development from cancer types where they can demonstrate their strengths and advantages through experience, depending on each cancer type's different market sizes and development difficulties. The results could provide clues for considering what support measures and incentives are appropriate to balance the efficiency of industrial development and the fulfillment of society's unmet medical needs."
"Although fractional flow reserve (FFR) is the contemporary standard to detect hemodynamically significant coronary stenosis, it remains underused for the need of pressure wire and hyperemic stimulus. Coronary angiography-derived FFR could break through these barriers. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility and performance of a novel diagnostic modality deriving FFR from invasive coronary angiography (AccuFFRangio) for coronary physiological assessment."
"Patients should be optimally informed about their illness for patients' autonomy and shared decision-making. However, diagnosis nondisclosure to patients is traditionally widespread in Japanese culture with family-oriented autonomy. There is insufficient research on quality of death (QOD) and quality of care (QOC) among patients who are not told their diagnosis."
Little is known about financial toxicity in early-phase clinical trial (EP-CT) participants. This study sought to describe financial toxicity in EP-CT participants and assess associations with patient characteristics and patient-reported outcomes (PROs).
"Infection is the most prevalent complication of fractures, particularly in open fractures, and often leads to severe consequences. The emergence of bacterial resistance has significantly exacerbated the burden of infection in clinical practice, making infection control a significant treatment challenge for infectious bone defects. The implantation of a structural stent is necessary to treat large bone defects despite the increased risk of infection. Therefore, there is a need for the development of novel antibacterial therapies. The advancement in antibacterial biomaterials and new antimicrobial drugs offers fresh perspectives on antibacterial treatment. Although antimicrobial 3D scaffolds are currently under intense research focus, relying solely on material properties or antibiotic action remains insufficient. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are one of the most promising new antibacterial therapy approaches. This review discusses the underlying mechanisms behind infectious bone defects and presents research findings on antimicrobial peptides, specifically emphasizing their mechanisms and optimization strategies. We also explore the potential prospects of utilizing antimicrobial peptides in treating infectious bone defects. Furthermore, we propose that artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms can be utilized for predicting the pharmacokinetic properties of AMPs, including absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion, and by combining information from genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and clinical studies with computational models driven by machine learning algorithms, scientists can gain a comprehensive understanding of AMPs' mechanisms of action, therapeutic potential, and optimizing treatment strategies tailored to individual patients, and through interdisciplinary collaborations between computer scientists, biologists, and clinicians, the full potential of AI in accelerating the discovery and development of novel AMPs will be realized. Besides, with the continuous advancements in 3D/4D/5D/6D technology and its integration into bone scaffold materials, we anticipate remarkable progress in the field of regenerative medicine. This review summarizes relevant research on the optimal future for the treatment of infectious bone defects, provides guidance for future novel treatment strategies combining multi-dimensional printing with new antimicrobial agents, and provides a novel and effective solution to the current challenges in the field of bone regeneration."
"Malnutrition has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality in elderly patients diagnosed with heart failure (HF). However, nutritional problems are underdiagnosed in these patients. This study aimed to analyse malnutrition prevalence in elderly HF patients and its impact on survival."
"Unmet oral health needs remain a significant issue among immigrant adolescents, often exacerbated by experiences of racial discrimination. This study aimed to examine the associations between perceived discrimination and oral health behaviours in adolescents with immigrant backgrounds and explore the potential moderating role of resilience on this association."
"The saphenous vein graft (SVG) has been a cornerstone of coronary bypass surgery, but its long-term patency is limited by accelerated atherosclerosis. Recent advancements, including the no-touch technique and the use of SVG as a limb of the left internal thoracic artery (LITA), have shown promise in improving outcomes. Both approaches enhance nitric oxide (NO) availability, a key factor in promoting endothelial stability and arterial-like behavior in the SVG. Among these, the LITA-SVG connection may offer superior long-term benefits due to sustained NO supplementation. This paper argues that the SVG, with proper strategies, can indeed achieve outcomes comparable to arterial grafts."
"Sagittal synostosis is the most common type of craniosynostosis, resulting in deformity with distinctive morphological characteristics. These include occipital narrowing, parietal narrowing, anteriorly shifted vertex with parietal depression, and exaggerated frontal bossing. The traditional cephalic index affords limited reliability in quantifying initial severity and correction. The purpose of this study was to conceptualize and evaluate a set of novel metrics based on optical surface scanning (OSS) technology used for cranial remolding orthosis (CRO) treatment."
"As a central nervous system-specific member of the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) family, the striatal-enriched protein tyrosine phosphatase (STEP) is an attractive drug target for neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we reported the discovery of a series of benzoic acid derivatives as new STEP inhibitors. Among them, compound 14b exhibited good STEP inhibitory activity and displayed selectivity against other PTPs. The neuroprotective activity of compound 14b was evaluated against glutamate-induced oxidative cell death in HT22 cells. Results indicated that compound 14b co-treatment prevented cell death and reduced cellular ROS accumulation. Compound 14b inhibited cell apoptosis by upregulating BCL-2 expression and downregulating BAX and C-caspase3 expression. Moreover, compound 14b was also found to provide neuroprotection to primary cortical neurons after oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R). Further structural elaboration of compound 14b may provide new drug candidates for neurodegenerative diseases."
"Transitioning from child to adult services is a significant event for young adults. The study aimed to explore the experiences of young adults who transitioned from Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) to Adult Mental Health Services (AMHS) in Ireland. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with six young adults and analysed according to interpretative phenomenological analysis. Interpretations were subsequently viewed through the lens of transition theory. Findings indicate that the transition presents major challenges for young adults and can cause a deterioration in mental health, in the context of multiple concurrent life transitions, discontinuity of care, a dramatic culture shift in AMHS, and experiences of impersonal care. Participants expressed their view that AMHS clinicians did not know how to approach their treatment due to a lack of available options or diagnosis-specific expertise, leading these individuals to question the validity of their suffering; this is a novel finding in the context of previous transition research. The utility of transition theory in developing a CAMHS-AMHS transition framework is demonstrated."
"Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been studied as a potential treatment for many brain conditions. Although tDCS is well tolerated, continued study of perceptual and cognitive side effects is warranted, given the complexity of functional brain organization. This study tests the feasibility of brief tablet-based tasks to assess auditory and cognitive side effects in a recently reported pilot study of auditory-cortex tDCS in chronic tinnitus and attempts to confirm that this untested multisession tDCS protocol does not worsen hearing."
"HIV-TB co-infection poses a significant public health threat, notably in sub-Saharan Africa including Ethiopia. Despite this public health problem, studies in Ethiopia regarding the mortality of HIV-TB co-infection patients have been inconsistent, and the overall estimate of mortality was not determined. Accordingly, this meta-analysis aims to assess the magnitude of mortality and predictors among HIV-TB co-infected patients in Ethiopia."
"Multimodal analgesia and anesthesia have become the gold standard in total joint arthroplasty to reduce postoperative pain and opioid consumption and minimize complications associated with opioid use. There are several elements in an effective multimodal protocol, including oral medications, periarticular injection, regional nerve blocks, and spinal and general anesthesia. Many nonopioid medications are often used, such as acetaminophen and NSAIDs. Gabapentinoids and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are available and used in select cases, but have risks associated with their use. Corticosteroids are effective anti-inflammatory medications that reduce pain, opioid consumption, and postoperative nausea and vomiting. Nerve ablation may also be used preoperatively or in patients who have persistent pain after total knee arthroplasty."
"Junior anaesthesiologists often find it difficult to gain the trust of surgeons, possibly because of their limited experience and unfamiliarity with surgeons. Therefore, they can face pressure when navigating disagreements with senior surgeons. We investigated whether and how differences in anaesthesiologist-surgeon seniority might impact patient safety."
"Platinum-based anticancer chemotherapy (PAC) represents a cornerstone in cancer treatment, retaining its status as the gold standard therapy. However, PAC's efficacy is countered by significant toxicities, such as nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity, and neurotoxicity. Recent studies have linked these toxicities to ferroptosis, characterized by iron accumulation, reactive oxygen species generation, and lipid peroxidation. This review explores the mechanisms underlying PAC-induced toxicities, focusing on the involvement of ferroptosis with three major PAC drugs-cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin. Further, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the natural product mitigation of PAC-induced ferroptotic toxicity."
"Coinfections with porcine circovirus types 2, 3, and 4 (PCV2, PCV3, and PCV4) are increasingly being detected in the swine industry. However, there is no commercially available vaccine which prevents coinfection with PCV2, PCV3, and PCV4. The development of a vaccine expressing capsid (Cap) fusion proteins of multiple PCVs represents a promising approach for broadly preventing infection with PCVs. In this study, we developed a PCV subunit vaccine candidate (Cap 2-3-4) by predicting, screening, and fusing antigenic epitopes of Cap proteins of PCV2, PCV3, and PCV4. Immunoprotection assays showed that the prokaryotic expression of Cap 2-3-4 could effectively induce high levels of PCV2, PCV3, and PCV4 Cap-specific antibodies and successfully neutralize both PCV2 and PCV3. Furthermore, Cap 2-3-4 demonstrated a potent ability to activate cellular immunity and thus prevent lung damage in mice. This study provides a new option for the development of broad vaccines against PCVs."
"Theory predicts that spatial modular networks contain the propagation of local disturbances, but field experimental tests of this hypothesis are lacking. We combined a field experiment with a metacommunity model to assess the role of modularity in buffering the spatial spread of algal turfs in three replicated canopy-dominated macroalgal networks. Experimental networks included three modules where plots with intact canopy cover (nodes) were connected through canopy-thinned corridors. The local perturbation consisted of removal of the canopy and understory species from four nodes within a single module to enable the establishment of algal turfs, which could then spread vegetatively to other untouched nodes through the canopy-thinned links. Results show that algal turfs invade mainly untouched nodes in the perturbed module, in agreement with the hypothesis that modularity can effectively constrain the spread of a spatial perturbation. The metacommunity model supports the empirical findings, illustrating greater resistance to perturbations of modular than random macroalgal canopy networks and making alternative explanations for the observed results unlikely. Evidence that the buffering effect of modularity can operate in natural environmental conditions has important implications for designing more robust networks of protected areas and less-fragile human-dominated fragmented landscapes."
"In the United States, a disproportionately high number of incarcerated individuals suffer from serious mental illnesses, substance use disorders, chronic medical conditions, infectious diseases, and traumatic brain injuries. Correctional facilities are often ill-equipped to address the incarcerated community's physical and mental health needs. Current laws and policies remain outdated and do not adequately address the complex health issues faced by incarcerated individuals, particularly the aging and terminally ill patients in correctional settings. We present a case of a male with schizophrenia whose ongoing psychiatric symptoms impaired his decisional capacity, leading to him to refuse medical treatment for an initially treatable medical condition, ultimately resulting in his death due to the lack of a surrogate decision-maker. This case underscores the urgent need for policy revisions to assign medical decision-making authority for individuals in custody and highlights potential interventions to bridge existing gaps in care for this population."
The role of Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE and ACE2) phenotypes and polymorphisms in modulating severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARSCoV- 2) infection in hypertensive patients remains unclear. Our objective was to determine the distribution of ACE and ACE2 receptor phenotypes by patient demographics and correlate ACE and ACE2 levels of activity with SARS-CoV-2 outcomes.
"High medical expenditure is one of the major obstacles to achieving common prosperity in China. As a health risk compensation and protection mechanism, medical insurance has played a good role in alleviating the economic burden of patients. However, due to the existence of moral hazard, medical insurance may also lead to the occurrence of psychological deviation and overtreatment of patients or hospitals' health treatment expectations, thus generating unnecessary pressure on public financial expenditure."
"Understanding human behavior and human action recognition are both essential components of effective surveillance video analysis for the purpose of guaranteeing public safety. However, existing approaches such as three-dimensional convolutional neural networks (3D CNN) and two-stream neural networks (2SNN) have computational hurdles due to the significant parameterization they require. In this paper, we offer HARNet, a specialized lightweight residual 3D CNN that is built on directed acyclic graphs and was created expressly to handle these issues and achieve effective human action detection. The suggested method presents an innovative pipeline for creating spatial motion data from raw video inputs, which makes successful latent representation learning of human motions easier to accomplish. This generated input is then supplied into HARNet, which processes spatial and motion information in a single stream in an effective manner, maximizing the benefits of both types of cues. The use of traditional machine learning classifiers is done in order to further improve the discriminative capacity of the features that have been learned. To be more specific, we use the latent representations that are stored in HARNet's fully connected layer and use them as our deep learnt features. After that, these features are entered into the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier in order to accomplish action recognition. In order to evaluate the HARNet-SVM method that was developed, empirical tests were run on commonly used action recognition datasets such as UCF101, HMDB51, and the KTH dataset. These tests were carried out in order to gather data for the evaluation. The experimental results show that our method is superior to other state-of-the-art approaches, achieving considerable performance increases of 2.75% on UCF101, 10.94% on HMDB51, and 0.18% on the KTH dataset. These results were obtained by running the method on each dataset separately. Our findings demonstrate the usefulness of HARNet's lightweight design and highlight the significance of utilizing SVM classifiers with deep learnt features for the purpose of accurate and computationally efficient human activity recognition in surveillance videos. This work helps to the advancement of surveillance technology, which in turn makes video analysis in applications that take place in the real world safer and more dependable."
Psoriasis requires a comprehensive assessment of concomitant diseases to make better therapeutic decisions. This study examined the differences in the onset and progression of associated cardiometabolic comorbidities in psoriasis patients based on their treatments.
"Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic and relapsing inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) characterized by colorectal inflammation. The N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification of RNA regulates gene expression through the modulation of RNA metabolism, thus influencing various physiological and pathological processes. The aim of this study was to investigate the biological function of m6A methyltransferase METTL14 in colorectal epithelial cell inflammation. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that METTL14 expression was decreased in UC and was associated with disease severity and immune infiltration. We also noted a downregulation of METTL14 expression and a decrease in the total m6A RNA levels in TNF-α-stimulated Caco-2 cells. Moreover, METTL14 knockdown promoted inflammation and inhibited autophagy in TNF-α-stimulated Caco-2 cells, as indicated by the upregulation of NF-κB signaling and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression as well as LC3B protein downregulation. Treatment with the autophagy activator Torin-1 ameliorated the pro-inflammatory effects of METTL14 silencing. Furthermore, METTL14 knockdown significantly reduced the expression of ATG5. ATG5 overexpression could nullify the pro-inflammatory effect of METTL14 knockdown in TNF-α-stimulated Caco-2 cells. Mechanistically, METTL14 knockdown promoted ATG5 mRNA degradation, and luciferase analysis identified ATG5 as a target of m6A modification by METTL14. Taken together, silencing METTL14 promoted inflammation in Caco-2 cells via the downregulation of ATG5. Our findings revealed the importance of the m6A modification in colonic inflammation and autophagy, indicating that targeting METTL14 might be a potential therapeutic strategy for anti-inflammatory treatment in UC."
"The activation of macrophages or microglia in patients' whole body or local eyes play significant roles in diabetic retinopathy (DR). Mitochondrial function regulates the inflammatory polarization of macrophages. Therefore, the common mechanism of mitochondrial related genes (MRGs) and macrophage polarisation related genes (MPRGs) in DR is explored in our study to illustrate the pathophysiology of DR."
"Anterior urethroplasty is the gold standard for treating complex urethral strictures, primarily focusing on restoring urinary function. However, aesthetic complications, including penile curvature, scarring, and meatal deformities, can impact patient satisfaction, self-image, and quality of life. Despite their significance, cosmetic outcomes are underreported in the literature, affecting patient counseling and surgical planning."
This comment discusses the use of PD-L1 as a biomarker to guide treatment decisions for metastatic melanoma.
"Hypophosphatemic rickets is a rare metabolic bone disease caused by renal phosphate wasting, leading to impaired bone mineralization. We present a case of a boy with fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23)-related hypophosphatemic rickets who did not achieve callus consolidation after six months of conventional therapy with phosphate and active vitamin D following corrective osteotomy. After one month of therapy with an FGF23 antibody (burosumab), the patient demonstrated significant improvement and no longer required a walking aid. Following six months of burosumab therapy, the bone had nearly fully healed. This report is the first to address the short-term use of burosumab therapy to promote bone healing after orthopedic surgery. Our findings further emphasize the clinical advantages and short-term applications of burosumab in FGF23-related hypophosphatemic diseases, especially for patients undergoing orthopedic surgery."
Optimizing hamstring exercises is crucial for injury prevention and performance. This study explored the effects of blood flow restriction (BFR) during Nordic hamstring exercises (NHE) on hamstring muscle activation and vascular function.
"Neuromuscular abnormality is the leading cause of disability in adults. Understanding the complex interplay between muscle structure and function is crucial for effective treatment and rehabilitation. However, the substantial deformation of muscles during movement (up to 40%) poses challenges for accurate assessment. To address this, we developed a wearable structural-functional sensing patch (WSFP) that enables synchronous analysis of muscle structure and function. The WSFP incorporates a soft, stretchable electrode array for high-performance electrophysiological monitoring with low contact impedance and high stability. Its innovative design absorbs skin deformation stress, ensuring stable adhesion of a flexible ultrasound transducer array, offering higher-fidelity imaging. With dynamic tissue imaging, it allows real-time visualization of muscle structure. The WSFP achieves superior accuracy in dynamic action recognition and disease assessment compared to single-modal methods, maintaining stable operation during motion for up to 72 hours. This study advances neuromuscular system analysis and improves diagnostic precision."
"The aim of this work is to improve musculoskeletal-based models of the upper-limb wrench feasible set (WFS), i.e., the set of achievable maximal wrenches at the hand for applications in collaborative robotics and computer aided ergonomics. In particular, a recent method performing wrench capacity evaluation called the iterative convex hull method (ICHM) is upgraded in order to integrate nondislocation and compression limitation constraints at the glenohumeral (GH) joint not taken into account in the available models. Their effects on the amplitude of the force capacities at the hand, glenohumeral joint reaction forces and upper-limb muscles coordination in comparison to the original iterative convex hull method are investigated in silico. The results highlight the glenohumeral potential dislocation for the majority of elements of the wrench feasible set with the original iterative convex hull method and the fact that the modifications satisfy correctly stability constraints at the glenohumeral joint. Also, the induced muscles coordination pattern favors the action of stabilizing muscles, in particular the rotator-cuff muscles, and lowers that of known potential destabilizing ones according to the literature."
Electronic health (e-Health) interventions may increase effectiveness and address limitations of conventional in-person childhood obesity treatment programs. This study evaluates the effectiveness of a 10-week e-Health (web-based) healthy lifestyle program for school-aged children with overweight/obesity.
"With advancing age, progressive loss of muscle strength, as assessed by hand grip strength, may result in a poorer health-related quality of life. The aim of this study is to determine the associations of hand grip strength with quality of life among people aged 50-90 years from South West Poland. The study group comprised 1 446 people, including 351 men and 1 095 women, aged between 50 and 90 years. The WHOQoL-BREF questionnaire was used to assess quality of life. Hand grip strength of the dominant hand was measured. The general assessment of quality of life shows a significant relationship with hand grip strength. Two domains of quality of life: social and environmental also significantly differentiate hand grip strength. As the number of points in given domains increases, the hand grip strength increases. Among men, the relationship between the environmental domain and hand grip strength is significantly stronger compared to women. Hand grip strength is related to the quality of life among older adults, especially in the social and environmental domains. The results of our study suggest that measures need to be taken to improve the strength of skeletal muscles in adults, which might improve their quality of life."
"The CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas (CRISPR-associated protein) programmable nuclease system continues to evolve, with in vivo therapeutic gene editing increasingly applied in clinical settings. However, off-target effects remain a significant challenge, hindering its broader clinical application. To enhance the development of gene-editing therapies and the accuracy of prediction algorithms, we developed CRISPRoffT (https://ccsm.uth.edu/CRISPRoffT/). Users can access a comprehensive repository of off-target regions predicted and validated by a diverse range of technologies across various cell lines, Cas enzyme variants, engineered sgRNAs (single guide RNAs) and CRISPR editing systems. CRISPRoffT integrates results of off-target analysis from 74 studies, encompassing 29 experimental prediction techniques, 368 guide sequences, 226 164 potential guide and off-target pairs and 8840 validated off-targets. CRISPRoffT features off-target data from different CRISPR approaches (knockout, base editing and prime editing) applied under diverse experimental conditions, including 85 different Cas/guide RNA (gRNA) combinations used across 34 different human and mouse cell lines. CRISPRoffT provides results of comparative analyses for individual guide sequences, genes, cell types, techniques and Cas/gRNA combinations under different conditions. CRISPRoffT is a unique resource providing valuable insights that facilitate the safety-driven design of CRISPR-based therapeutics, inform experimental design, advance the development of computational off-target prediction algorithms and guide RNA design algorithms."
The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 177Lu-DOTA-IBA for pain palliation in participants with bone metastases and confirm its potential for treating bone metastasis.
"The brain develops most rapidly during pregnancy and early neonatal months. While prior electrophysiological studies have shown that aperiodic brain activity undergoes changes across infancy to adulthood, the role of gestational duration in aperiodic and periodic activity remains unknown. In this study, we aimed to bridge this gap by examining the associations between gestational duration and aperiodic and periodic activity in the EEG power spectrum in both neonates and toddlers. This cross-sectional study involved EEG data from 73 neonates (postnatal age 1-5 days, 40 females) and 56 toddlers (postnatal age of 2.9-3.2 years, 28 females) from the FinnBrain Birth Cohort Study. EEG power spectra were parameterized to aperiodic and periodic components using the SpecParam tool. We tested the associations between gestational duration as well as postnatal age and SpecParam parameters in neonates and toddlers while including birth weight and child sex as covariates. For neonates, multilevel models were employed, considering different data acquisitions (sleep and auditory paradigm + sleep), while in toddlers, regression models were used as only data from the auditory paradigm was available. We found that longer gestational duration was associated with a steeper power spectrum across EEG frequencies both in neonates and toddlers. Effect was especially strong in toddlers (β = 0.45, p = 0.004), while in neonates, it remained nearly statistically significant (p = 0.061). In neonates, a quadratic association between gestational duration and beta center frequency (12.5-30 Hz) was found. In toddlers, beta center frequencies were overall higher in females compared to males. Offset (calculated as the power of the aperiodic curve at 2.5 Hz) and theta center frequency had negative associations with postnatal age in neonates, but not in toddlers. Our results suggest that gestational duration may have significant and relatively long-lasting effects on brain physiology. The possible behavioral and cognitive consequences of these changes are enticing topics for future research."
"The Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome is one of the few genetic aberrations in which a casualty has been proven and, as such, represents a success in the history of medicine. This is also evident in the setting of Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the most frequent genetic subgroup in adult ALL, whose incidence increases with age and whose prognosis, before the advent of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), was particularly poor. The outcome and management of patients with Ph+ ALL have greatly improved since the incorporation of first-, second-, and third-generation TKIs in the therapeutic backbone and is further changing with the more recent introduction of immunotherapy. This allows for long-term survival rates currently ranging between 75% and 80%. The clinical scenario of adult Ph+ ALL has thus changed profoundly, and new challenges are emerging. In this article, illustrative clinical cases are used to discuss the current role of systemic chemotherapy and allogeneic stem cell transplant, the difficulty in treating central nervous system relapses and, more in general, relapses in the current therapeutic era, and the possibility of stopping TKIs. Finally, the challenges related to an optimal management of these patients are discussed."
"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized the treatment of systemic cancer therapy. During disinhibiting the antitumor responses of immune system, ICIs may also cause unique immune-related adverse events (irAEs) which could affect any organ. Here, we report a rare case of sintilimab-induced ureteritis/cystitis in a 55-year-old male undergoing neoadjuvant chemo-immunotherapy for gastric cancer. The patient presented with severe renal colic, hematuria, and hydronephrosis. Antibiotic antispasmodic and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug treatment failed to alleviate symptoms. The application of corticosteroid was negated for recent extirpative surgery under plan. Bilateral ureteral stenting effectively resolved the pain and improved renal function. The patient later successfully underwent laparoscopic radical gastrectomy with significant tumor regression in postoperative pathology. This case highlights ureteral stenting as a potential corticosteroid-free treatment option for ICI-induced ureteritis/cystitis."
DOCK8 deficiency is a primary immunodeficiency in which allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) represents the only known cure. We tested the ability of a busulfan-based regimen to achieve reliable engraftment and high levels of donor chimerism with acceptable toxicity in a prospective clinical trial in DOCK8 deficiency.
"Protein PARylation is a reversible post-translational modification; however, its role in fungal virulence has remained elusive. Recently, Gao et al. demonstrated that PARylation of two 14-3-3 regulatory proteins by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase is essential for the virulence of rice blast fungus, highlighting the critical regulatory function of PARylation in fungal pathogenicity."
"The cover letter is a critical component of medical journal submissions, often influencing acceptance decisions. However, authors frequently underestimate its importance. This narrative review aimed to provide guidance for authors on writing effective and succinct cover letters."
"Myxoma is a rare tumor that can be challenging to diagnose, with imaging findings that can be nonspecific. We present a case of a 21-year-old man who presented with a subacute history of right visual deterioration and proptosis. Imaging showed a large right superomedial orbital mass of 43 × 31 × 24 mm, which enhanced heterogeneously and was eroding the adjacent orbital roof and medial wall. An excisional biopsy was performed via a lid crease approach under transorbital endoscopic guidance. We review the clinical, radiological, and histological characteristics of myxoma. In addition, we highlight important associations with genetic syndromes including Carney complex and Mazabraud syndrome."
"Neuropeptides are involved in numerous brain activities being able to control a wide spectrum of physiological functions. In recent years, a number of novel pleiotropic regulatory peptides have been discovered in animal brain structures. The purpose of this descriptive neurochemical investigation was to detect the possible expression of the novel multifunctional neuropeptides spexin (SPX) and nesfatin-1 within the human brainstem. Using immunohistochemical and fluorescence techniques, neuroanatomical analysis of the SPX and nesfatin-1 expression and distribution was performed in selected sections of the human midbrain and medulla oblongata. The presence of SPX-positive neurons in the human brainstem was revealed for the first time and previous reports on the expression of nesfatin-1 were additionally confirmed. The research results suggest that SPX and nesfatin-1 are new regulatory neuropeptides of the human brainstem potentially involved in the regulation of key autonomic activities of this brain region."
"Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are effective against almost all kinds of pathogenic organisms. The green synthesis of AgNPs utilizing extracts from medicinal plants is being researched to examine the therapeutic advantages of AgNPs because the chemical production of AgNPs is more toxic. In this study, the stem extract of Ocimum Gratissimum (OG) also known as Karunthulasi or wild basil for green synthesis of AgNPs and evaluating their antiinflammatory and antimicrobial effects."
"The Naval Ship Code (NSC) was enacted in 2009 to standardize regulations for NATO member naval forces, and a study commissioned by the Spanish Navy General Staff (EMA) aimed to identify the factors that influence onboard personnel's ability to move during an evacuation process. This study validated the soundness of the safety protocols implemented on navy vessels and highlighted the impact of certain characteristics of the embarked military contingent, such as body mass index, age, and seniority. It also found that such characteristics could act as distinctive factors among the embarked contingents in the evacuation of a military vessel. The study quantified the effect of these intervening characteristics, confirming the need for different displacement models for each of the study contingents to improve ship evacuation maneuvers. The findings of this study provide insights into the behavior of different embarked contingents during the evacuation process and can inform the development of more effective safety protocols for military naval operations. The starting hypothesis is that certain characteristics of the embarked military contingent have a decisive influence on their displacement capacity during the evacuation process. This hypothesis has been expanded in the sense that these same characteristics can act as differentiating elements among the embarked contingents evacuating a military vessel. It is possible to quantify the influence of these characteristics and implement a displacement model applicable in escape, evacuation, and rescue processes. Thus, the specific characteristics of a study contingent will be reflected in its displacement model. In this article we find that while members of the landing force (LF) show greater displacement capacity through a longitudinal corridor (around 10%), their ability to overcome other passage elements present on the study vessel is reduced (around 30%) compared to members of the vessel's own crew."
"Quality control (QC) samples are commonly used in metabolomics approaches for three main reasons: (i) the initial conditioning of the column; (ii) the correction of analytical drift especially between batches; and (iii) the evaluation of measurement precision. In practice, there are several ways to prepare and conserve QC samples. The most common in untargeted metabolomics is to pool samples after or before extraction, in order to obtain pooled QC samples accounting, respectively, for analytical variance or for both analytical and sample preparation variances. In this study, focusing on untargeted analysis of tea (Camellia sinensis) leaves, we compared three ways of preparing pooled QC samples (two usual and one unusual QC sample preparations) and their efficiency to improve data quality in terms of inter-batch correction, measurement precision, and VIP candidates selection on datasets obtained using two mass spectrometry (MS) technologies (Orbitrap and time of flight (QToF)). We also investigated the effect of data processing modalities, based on the different QC preparations, on data loss and on the global structure of the datasets. Generally, our results show that usual QC sample preparation leads to comparable datasets quality in terms of precision and dispersion on both MS instruments. They also show that QC preparation is crucial for VIP selection; in fact, up to 54% of biomarkers candidates were specific of the QC preparation type used for data processing."
"The heat stress (HS) induced by high temperatures can result in oxidative damage to muscles, thereby compromising both muscle growth and immune function within the organism. Mitophagy serves as a pivotal pathway in alleviating excessive ROS production and subsequent oxidative damage. However, the potential role of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a natural antioxidant found in tea, in mitophagy under HS remains unexplored. Here, we present evidence of EGCG mitigating the oxidative-redox imbalance in porcine skeletal muscles induced by HS involving the antioxidant enzyme system mediated by the Keap1/Nrf2 pathway and mitophagy mediated by the PINK1/Parkin pathway. Importantly, we identified phosphate mutase 5 (PGAM5) for the first time as a key protein modulated by EGCG under HS conditions, regulating mitophagy. Inhibition of PGAM5 significantly attenuated the activation of mitophagy by EGCG. Molecular docking and dynamics simulations further suggested that EGCG directly binds to Keap1, disrupting the Keap1-PGAM5 protein interaction and thus promoting the release of PGAM5 and subsequently activating mitophagy. In summary, this study represents the first discovery of EGCG directly targeting Keap1/PGAM5-mediated mitophagy, which serves as a potential functional supplement for regulating the antioxidant capacity in pigs."
Intake of New Zealand blackcurrant (NZBC) extract for 7 days has been shown to improve high-intensity intermittent running (HIIR) performance.
"Large thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms due to chronic aortic dissection in patients with connective tissue disorders such as Loeys-Dietz syndrome present a challenging scenario, particularly in cases of variant anatomy and when patients are not candidates for conventional open repair. We demonstrate how by combining and modifying off-the-shelf devices during a hybrid procedure, one can create an endovascular solution tailored to the patient's complex anatomy, making use of an aberrant right subclavian artery, and allow for good clinical outcomes."
Our aim was to fill a gap in the research about the prevalence of developmental coordination disorder (DCD) among internationally adopted children. We explored the prevalence of signs of DCD and the associations between those and behavioural problems six and 18 months after adoption.
"Community ambulation is essential for maintaining a healthy lifestyle, but it poses significant challenges for individuals with limb loss due to complex task demands. In wearable robotics, particularly powered prostheses, there is a critical need to accurately estimate environmental context, such as walking speed and slope, to offer intuitive and seamless assistance during varied ambulation tasks. We developed a user-independent and multicontext, intent recognition system that was deployed in real-time on an Open Source Leg (OSL). We recruited 11 individuals with transfemoral amputation, with seven participants used for real-time validation. Our findings revealed two main conclusions: (1) the user-independent (IND) performance across speed and slope was not statistically different from user-dependent (DEP) models in real-time and did not degrade compared to its offline counterparts, and (2) IND walking speed estimates showed ∼0.09 m/s mean absolute error (MAE) and slope estimates showed ∼0.95 deg MAE across multicontext scenarios. Additionally, we provide an open-source dataset to facilitate further research in accurately estimating speed and slope using an IND approach in real-world walking tasks on a powered prosthesis."
"Chickpea (Cicer arietinum) and Apricot (Prunus armeniaca) both are economically and nutritionally important, these both faces severe losses due to fungal Infections. For several fungal infections, traditional methods of management rely on chemical fungicideswhich have environmental and health risks. The in-vitro antifungal efficacy of myco-synthesized and bacteria-synthesized zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles against pathogens impacting chickpea and apricot is aimed to be compared in this review article. Evaluated for their antifungal effectiveness against Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. ciceris in chickpea and Alternaria solani, myco-synthesized ZnO NPs generated from Trichoderma harzianum and bacteria-synthesized ZnO NPs were using a poisoned food approach, the study evaluated minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC), and inhibition zone diameter. At lower concentrations, myco-synthesized ZnO NPs shown better antifungal activity than their bacteria-synthesized counterparts, according to results. Surface changes, size, and concentration of nanoparticles were main determinants of antifungal activity. Emphasizing the need of more study to maximize the synthesis and application in agricultural environments, this review underlines the possibilities of ZnO NPs as sustainable substitutes for chemical fungicides."
"There is insufficient evidence comparing the outcomes of tacrolimus-based remission induction therapy with infliximab in refractory ulcerative colitis (UC) and evidence regarding optimal strategies after tacrolimus-based remission induction therapy. We conducted a multi-institutional retrospective study of patients with UC treated with tacrolimus or infliximab between January 2010 and March 2019. The proportion of clinical remission at week 8 and cumulative colectomy-free rate were examined using propensity score matching analysis. The predictors for colectomy after tacrolimus induction were also investigated. Ninety patients in the tacrolimus group and 151 in the infliximab group were enrolled. The proportion of patients in clinical remission at week 8 was 65.2% in the matched tacrolimus group and 37.3% in the matched infliximab group (P = 0.0016), and the long-term colectomy-free rate was lower in the matched tacrolimus group than in the matched infliximab group (P = 0.0003). After clinical remission with tacrolimus, a serum albumin level of ≤ 3.5 g/dL at week 8 was extracted as a factor predicting colectomy (area under the curve: 0.94). Tacrolimus showed a higher remission induction effect for UC compared to infliximab. However, a high rate of colectomy after transition to maintenance treatment was found to be a concern for tacrolimus therapy."
"Deciding the optimal time for surgery in patients with pre-existing comorbid disease is complex. A careful balance of risks is required to weigh up the therapeutic benefits of surgery against an increased risk of perioperative adverse outcomes, whereas the subsequent risk of adverse events and mortality is more dependent on pre-existing conditions. A study in a recent issue of BJA shows that people with a previous cardiovascular or cerebrovascular event within 10 yr of elective surgery were at a higher risk of major adverse cardiovascular events within 1 yr from surgery and that an at-risk period existed if surgery occurred within 37 months of the preoperative event. Before this observation can be used to inform clinical decision-making, caution is needed to interpret these findings because of biases introduced by the analytical approach and potential confounding."
"It is crucial to develop new tactics to prevent ovarian tissue damage in women whose reproductive toxicity is caused by chemotherapy. The present investigation was performed to assess the protective effects of Moringa oleifera (M. oleifera) leaf extract on cyclophosphamide (CP)-induced ovarian damage and reproductive dysfunction. Thirty-two female, healthy Wistar albino rats were randomly assigned to four groups (8 rats/group). The first group was given saline intraperitoneally (i.p.). The second group was given a single dose of CP (200 mg/kg; i.p.). The third and fourth groups were given M. oleifera leaf extract (150 and 250 mg/kg; orally) for 20 days before receiving CP on the final day of the experiment. Hormonal assessments, including follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and estrogen (ES), were performed 24 h after CP administration. In addition, the antioxidant status and inflammatory response against CP were evaluated. Moreover, detailed histopathological and ultra- structural observations were conducted. For evaluation of statistical significance between different groups; One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey's post hoc test was adopted. Our findings revealed that rats subjected to CP showed increased levels of FSH, LH, malondialdehyde (MDA), tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukin-8 and decreased levels of ES and glutathione. Pre-treatment with M. oleifera leaf extract (250 mg/kg; orally) was statistically significant (p values < 0.05) as it could improve hormonal changes, oxidative stress indices, and pro- inflammatory mediator levels. Consequently, a marked improvement was observed in the ovarian and uterine architectures, with a normal ovarian reserve and a normal endothelium with normal tubular glands. In conclusion, M. oleifera leaf extract (250 mg/kg) could be used as a pharmaceutical supplement because it protects female rats against CP-induced ovarian damage and reproductive dysfunction."
"This prospective cohort study is aimed to investigate circadian variations in corneal parameters, focusing on sleep-deprived subjects. Sixty-four healthy individuals (age range: 21-76 years) actively participated in this study, undergoing examinations at least five times within a 24-hour timeframe. The analysis encompassed keratometric parameters of the cornea's front (F) and back (B) surfaces, refractive power in flattest and steepest axes (K1, K2), astigmatism (Astig) and its axis (Axis), aspheric coefficient (Asph), corneal pachymetry values of thinnest corneal thickness (Pachy Min) and corneal thickness in the center of the pupil (Pachy Pupil), volume relative to the 3 and 10 mm corneal diagonal (Vol D3, Vol D10) and surface variance index (ISV). Circadian changes were assessed using a hierarchical, mixed-effects linear regression adjusted for age and night shift. A total of 1,636 measurements revealed significant circadian changes in various corneal parameters, including K1 F, K2 F/B, Astig F/B, Asph F/B, Pachy Min/Pupil, Vol D3/10, and ISV (p < 0.0001). Moreover, K1 B exhibited a significant circadian change (p = 0.0002), while Axis F/B remained unchanged. Notably, Corneal thickness peaked before 6 o'clock in the morning and reached its minimum after 12 o'clock. Contrary to previous notions linking corneal diurnal changes with eyelid closure during sleep, our study reveals that these changes persist in the absence of sleep. This research contributes valuable insights into the impact of sleep deprivation on corneal properties, warranting further investigations to deepen our understanding of daily variations in visual quality and guide the planning of refractive eye surgery interventions."
"Fluphenazine (FPZ) is a well-known neuroleptic that has attracted considerable scientific interest due to its biocidal, virucidal, and antitumor properties. Although methods for encapsulating and delivering FPZ to enhance its activity and reduce side effects have been developed, there is still limited knowledge about its conjugates with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). Therefore, the aim of this research was to develop a preparation method for stable FPZ-AuNP conjugates and to investigate their physicochemical and biological properties. FPZ-AuNP conjugates were synthesized via a ligand exchange process on the surface of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with an average size of 17 ± 5 nm. Electrokinetic measurements revealed that the zeta potential of FPZ-AuNPs is affected by both their composition and pH. The FPZ-AuNPs exhibited an isoelectric point due to the acid-base properties of FPZ. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), combined with density functional theory (DFT), was used to determine the adsorption structure of FPZ after conjugation. Studies with human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y) revealed that FPZ-AuNP conjugates more effectively reduced cell viability compared to citrate-stabilized AuNPs alone or free FPZ molecules. The reduction in SH-SY5Y cell viability was found to be dependent on the FPZ-AuNP concentration."

"Palliative care has become a standard of care for patients with serious illnesses. However, many rural hospitals do not have access to specialized palliative care consultation. This article describes the journey taken by a palliative care team to improve access to palliative care and overall patient outcomes at rural hospitals throughout the state of South Carolina by using the telehealth modality. The impact, challenges, and benefits of the program are discussed."
"Empathy plays a crucial role in promoting older adults' interpersonal experiences, but it remains unclear how these benefits of empathy occur. To address this gap, we examined associations between empathy and how older adults behave and express emotions during their daily interpersonal encounters. Participants included 268 adults aged 65+ (46% men, n = 124) from the Daily Experiences and Well-being Study. They reported background characteristics and empathy in baseline interviews and indicated interpersonal encounters every 3 hours across 5 to 6 days. Participants wore electronically activated recorders (EAR), an app that captured 30-second snippets of ambient sounds every 7 minutes. Verbatim transcripts were coded for positive and negative social behaviors (e.g., praise, complain) and text was analyzed via Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software for verbal expressions of positive and negative emotions (e.g., happy, hope, hate, hurt). Multilevel models showed that greater empathy was associated with greater variety in positive social behaviors throughout the day. More empathic older adults expressed more positive emotions while engaging in positive behaviors and less negative emotions when engaging in negative behaviors. This study innovatively draws on naturalistic data to delineate how more empathic older adults may have more positive and less negative social experiences than their less empathic counterparts. Findings may inform interventions that can incorporate empathy training to target those at higher risk of poor interpersonal experiences and outcomes (e.g., social isolation)."
"The accurate non-invasive detection and estimation of central aortic pressure waveforms (CAPW) are crucial for reliable treatments of cardiovascular system diseases. But the accuracy and practicality of current estimation methods need to be improved. Our study combines a meta-learning neural network and a physics-driven method to accurately estimate CAPW based on personalized physiological indicators. We collected data from 260 patients who underwent catheterization surgery, using measured CAPW and personalized physiological indicators (e.g., weight, body mass index (BMI), radial mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), cardiac output (CO), radial systolic blood pressure (SBP), and radial diastolic blood pressure (DBP)) as input for neural network training. The output of the neural network are the Gaussian characteristic parameters of the single-period decomposed CAPW. The neural network model was constructed using the model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) algorithm framework. Applying the physical characteristics of CAPW to the loss function, served to increase the constraints on the output and improve the accuracy of CAPW estimation. To verify the accuracy of the model, we compared measured and estimated CAPW in 52 patients. The results are consistent with a normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) of 0.0206. The predictions had low biases, namely SBP: 4.97 ± 4.42 mmHg, DBP: 4.78 ± 5.98 mmHg, and MAP: 0.35 ± 3.36 mmHg. The results demonstrate the accuracy and practicability of the approach to estimate CAPW. It can provide personalized parameters to calculate myocardial ischemia indicators (e.g., instantaneous wave-free ratio [iFR] and fractional flow reserve [FFR]) and may contribute to the early monitoring and prevention of cardiovascular diseases."
"Antibiotic resistance is a global public health concern. Bacteria have evolved resistance to most antibiotics, which means that for any given bacterial infection, the bacteria may be resistant to one or several antibiotics. It has been suggested that genomic sequencing and machine learning (ML) could make resistance testing more accurate and cost-effective. Given that ML is likely to become an ever more important tool in medicine, we believe that it is important for pre-health students and others in the life sciences to learn to use ML tools. This paper provides a step-by-step tutorial to train 4 different ML models (logistic regression, random forests, extreme gradient-boosted trees, and neural networks) to predict drug resistance for Escherichia coli isolates and to evaluate their performance using different metrics and cross-validation techniques. We also guide the user in how to load and prepare the data used for the ML models. The tutorial is accessible to beginners and does not require any software to be installed as it is based on Google Colab notebooks and provides a basic understanding of the different ML models. The tutorial can be used in undergraduate and graduate classes for students in Biology, Public Health, Computer Science, or related fields."
"In uremic patients, the accumulation of gut-derived protein-bound uremic toxins (PBUTs) induces changes in the microenvironment of the patients, leading to changes in the elimination pattern of drugs."
"The impact of production and cooking on protein oxidation, lipid oxidation and Maillard reaction products (MRPs) generation was evaluated for firm regular tofu, tempeh, and seitan, three plant-based alternatives to meat products. Tofu showed higher content of protein-bound carbonyls (25.5 ± 5.4 nmol/mg protein) indicating higher degree of protein oxidation, while seitan exhibited the lowest content of MRPs like N(6)-carboxymethyllysine, as revealed by LC-MS/MS. Through determination of the peroxide value and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances as well as analysis of volatile oxidation compounds by GC-MS, an overall higher lipid oxidation level was found in tofu. Likewise, a mean 92.2 % depletion of naturally occurring antioxidant tocopherol, assessed by HPLC-DAD, was observed in tofu. Furthermore, acrylamide was detected in tofu at 196.0 ± 15.4 μg/kg after frying at 190 °C. This study, therefore, concluded that practices used in tempeh and seitan processing are promising strategies to limit oxidation and Maillard reactions in food."

"Intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) is a primary contributor to chronic back pain and disability globally, with current therapeutic approaches often proving inadequate due to the complex nature of its pathophysiology. This review assesses the potential of nanoparticle-driven pharmacotherapies to address the intricate challenges presented by IDD. We initially analyze the primary mechanisms driving IDD, with particular emphasis on mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and the inflammatory microenvironment, all of which play pivotal roles in disc degeneration. Then, we evaluate the application of metal-phenolic and catalytic nanodots in targeting mitochondrial defects and alleviating oxidative stress within the degenerative disc environment. Additionally, multifunctional and stimuli-responsive nanoparticles are explored for their capacity to provide precise targeting and controlled therapeutic release, offering improved localization and sustained delivery. Finally, we outline future research directions and identify emerging trends in nanoparticle-based therapies, highlighting their potential to significantly advance IDD treatment by overcoming the limitations of conventional therapeutic modalities and enabling more effective, targeted management strategies."
"Maximizing the life-long reproductive output would lead to the prediction that short-lived and fast aging species would undergo no - if any - reproductive senescence. Turquoise killifish (Nothobranchius furzeri) are naturally short-lived teleosts, and undergo extensive somatic aging, characterized by molecular, cellular, and organ dysfunction following the onset of sexual maturation. Here, we tested whether naturally short-lived and fast aging male turquoise killifish maximize reproduction and display minimal - if any, reproductive senescence. We analysed age-related changes in sperm traits, the proportion of fertilized eggs, as well as embryo survival. Contrary to the expectation of no reproductive aging, we found that turquoise killifish males undergo extensive reproductive aging, consisting in the age-dependent decline in sperm quality, decreased proportion of fertilized eggs and lower embryo survival. Our results indicate that male turquoise killifish do not trade-off age-dependent soma decline with life-long sustained reproductive fitness. Instead, somatic and reproductive aging appear to occur simultaneously. Our findings question generalized soma vs. reproductive senescence trade-off models and highlight the importance of integrating species-specific ecological and demographic constraints to explain observed life history traits."
"Hemodynamic factors significantly influence the onset, progression, and rupture of intracranial aneurysms (IAs). Current rupture risk prediction scores focus primarily on the clinical, anatomic, and morphologic aspects. This study aimed to investigate the hemodynamic characteristics differences between ruptured and unruptured IAs."
"We propose a simple mathematical model to describe the mechanical relaxation of cells within a curved epithelial tissue layer represented by an arbitrary curve in two-dimensional space. This model generalises previous one-dimensional models of flat epithelia to investigate the influence of curvature for mechanical relaxation. We represent the mechanics of a cell body either by straight springs, or by curved springs that follow the curve's shape. To understand the collective dynamics of the cells, we devise an appropriate continuum limit in which the number of cells and the length of the substrate are constant but the number of springs tends to infinity. In this limit, cell density is governed by a diffusion equation in arc length coordinates, where diffusion may be linear or nonlinear depending on the choice of the spring restoring force law. Our results have important implications about modelling cells on curved geometries: (i) curved and straight springs can lead to different dynamics when there is a finite number of springs, but they both converge quadratically to the dynamics governed by the diffusion equation; (ii) in the continuum limit, the curvature of the tissue does not affect the mechanical relaxation of cells within the layer nor their tangential stress; (iii) a cell's normal stress depends on curvature due to surface tension induced by the tangential forces. Normal stress enables cells to sense substrate curvature at length scales much larger than their cell body, and could induce curvature dependences in experiments."
"Several microorganisms, which are not traditionally considered sexually transmitted infections (STIs), are capable of sexual transmission and have the potential to cause global outbreaks. The aim of this review is to describe pathogens which are not traditionally defined as STIs, to grant insight on current and potential outbreaks and call for clinical vigilance among members of key populations."
"Chronic respiratory diseases are important causes of disability and mortality globally. Their incidence may be higher in remote locations where healthcare is limited and risk factors, such as smoking and indoor air pollution, are more prevalent. E-health could overcome some healthcare access obstacles in remote locations, but its utilisation has been limited. An improved understanding of barriers and facilitators to the implementation of e-health in remote locations could aid enhanced application of these approaches."
"Microwave ablation is a new, minimally invasive technique for the treatment of thyroid nodules. Hyperthyroidism due to destructive thyroiditis is a known risk of microwave ablation, though it occurs in only a minority of cases. We report a rare case of a patient diagnosed with Graves' disease nearly six months after undergoing microwave ablation of a thyroid nodule."
"Transmission of the malaria parasite Plasmodium to mosquitoes necessitates gamete egress from red blood cells to allow zygote formation and ookinete motility to enable penetration of the midgut epithelium. Both processes are dependent on the secretion of proteins from distinct sets of specialized vesicles. Inhibiting some of these proteins has shown potential for blocking parasite transmission to the mosquito. To identify new transmission blocking vaccine candidates, we aimed to define the microneme content from ookinetes of the rodent model organism Plasmodium berghei using APEX2-mediated rapid proximity-dependent biotinylation. Besides known proteins of ookinete micronemes, this identified over 50 novel candidates and sharpened the list of a previous survey based on subcellular fractionation. Functional analysis of a first candidate uncovered a dual role for this membrane protein in male gametogenesis and ookinete midgut traversal. Mutation of a putative trafficking motif in the C-terminus affected ookinete to oocyst transition but not gamete formation. This suggests the existence of distinct functional and transport requirements for Plasmodium proteins in different parasite stages."
"Obesity is a chronic, multifactorial disease characterized by persistent low-grade tissue and systemic inflammation. Fat accumulation in adipose tissue (AT) leads to stress and dysfunctional adipocytes, along with the infiltration of immune cells, which initiates and sustains inflammation. Neutrophils are the first immune cells to infiltrate AT during high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity. Emerging evidence suggests that the formation and release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) play a significant role in the progression of obesity and related diseases. Additionally, obesity is associated with an imbalance in gut microbiota and increased intestinal barrier permeability, resulting in the translocation of live bacteria, bacterial deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), lipopolysaccharides (LPS), and pro-inflammatory cytokines into the bloodstream and AT, thereby contributing to metabolic inflammation. Recent research has also shown that short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), produced by gut microbiota, can influence various functions of neutrophils, including their activation, migration, and the generation of inflammatory mediators. This review comprehensively summarizes recent advancements in understanding the role of neutrophils and NET formation in the pathophysiology of obesity and related disorders while also focusing on updated potential therapeutic approaches targeting NETs based on studies conducted in humans and animal models."
"This study aimed to investigate whether genes with different modes of inheritance differ in the presence of promoter-enriched CGI loci. For each autosomal chromosome, the author searched for variations in the total number of diseases' phenotypes with autosomal dominant (AD) and recessive (AR) inheritance for a list of promoter-poor CGI (CGI-) and promoter-enriched CGI (CGI+) genes using the OMIM database. Then, the CGI- and CGI+ genes displaying random allelic or bi-allelic expression were examined. The author evaluated whether there was a distinct distribution of AD and AR diseases in the groups of chromosomes based on their SNP hotspot density. The same analysis was conducted for the X chromosome. The SPSS statistical package was utilized. The distribution of AD and AR diseases between CGI- and CGI+ bi-allelic genes significantly differed in autosomal chromosomes 6 and 17, which show intermediate SNP hotspot density. Additionally, a statistically significant difference was observed in AD and AR diseases in the remaining autosomal chromosomes with low SNP hotspots between their randomly allelic expressed CGI- and CGI+ genes. Specifically, AD diseases were related to CGI- genes, while AR diseases were associated with CGI+ genes. In the X chromosome, X-linked dominant (XLD) diseases were mainly found in CGI+ genes, and X-linked recessive (XLR) diseases were found in CGI- genes, regardless of the X-inactivation process. It is essential to study inheritance and classify genetic variants in a more stochastic way than the terms ""Dominant"" and ""Recessive,"" and their derivatives, such as ""Codominant"" and ""Incomplete Dominant,"" are applied in Mendelian and non-Mendelian inheritance. This concept may further explain the ""Reduced Penetrance"" and ""Variable Expressivity"" in certain human diseases. All the above suggests a need to reassess how genetic and epigenetic data are studied and utilized for genetic counseling or precision medicine."

"Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a genetic metabolic disorder that causes the accumulation of phenylalanine (Phe) in tissues, leading to intellectual disability, seizures, and socioemotional challenges. The role of social determinants of health (SDOH) in PKU management has not been formally studied, and this investigation evaluates the association between in-home and in-office factors on blood Phe levels in PKU patients. We conducted a retrospective chart review on over 200 patients attending the well-resourced PKU Clinic at Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago. Data included patients' average Phe level, various demographic information, and CDC/ATSDR social vulnerability index (SVI) score. The analysis revealed no significant association between social vulnerability status and average Phe level. However, a significant correlation was found between sapropterin dihydrochloride use and average Phe level. Age interacted separately with sex assigned at birth, pegvaliase use, total Phe samples submitted, and the presence of genetic testing to significantly influence the average Phe level. This study highlights the multifactorial influences on PKU management and underscores the importance of social resources, such as clinic social workers and state-provided formula, in modulating the effects of SDOH on PKU control. Further research in different healthcare settings is needed to understand the social determinants affecting PKU patients comprehensively, which will strengthen advocacy efforts for this population."

"Normal ogive (NO) models have contributed substantially to the advancement of item response theory (IRT) and have become popular educational and psychological measurement models. However, estimating NO models remains computationally challenging. The purpose of this paper is to propose an efficient and reliable computational method for fitting NO models. Specifically, we introduce a novel and unified expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for estimating NO models, including two-parameter, three-parameter, and four-parameter NO models. A key improvement in our EM algorithm lies in augmenting the NO model to be a complete data model within the exponential family, thereby substantially streamlining the implementation of the EM iteration and avoiding the numerical optimization computation in the M-step. Additionally, we propose a two-step expectation procedure for implementing the E-step, which reduces the dimensionality of the integration and effectively enables numerical integration. Moreover, we develop a computing procedure for estimating the standard errors (SEs) of the estimated parameters. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of our algorithm in terms of its recovery accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. To further validate our methods, we apply them to real data from the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). The results affirm the reliability of the parameter estimates obtained using our method."

"Flexor pollicis longus rupture is a major complication after volar locking plate fixation of distal radius fractures. Although the distance between the flexor pollicis longus tendon and the plate (plate-tendon distance) measured by ultrasonography is used to predict tendon rupture risk, the timing of the ultrasonography can affect the measurements. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze the chronological change of the plate-tendon distance between the tendon and plate."
"Gliomas are common brain tumors. Despite extensive research, the 5-year survival rate of glioma remains low. Many studies have reported that circular RNAs (circRNAs) play a role in promoting the malignant progression of glioma; however, the role of circ_0059914 in this process remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate the function and underlying mechanism of circ_0059914 in glioma. Western blotting and qRT-PCR were used to determine the levels of circ_0059914, miR-1249, VEGFA, N-cadherin, vimentin, Snail, and EIF4A3. EDU and colony formation assays were conducted to evaluate cell proliferation. Transwell assays were used to explore cell migration and invasion and tube formation assays were used to analyze angiogenesis. RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) and dual-luciferase reporter assays were used to explore the relationship between EIF4A3, circ_0059914, miR-1249, and VEGFA. A xenograft tumor assay was performed to determine the role of circ_0059914 in vivo. Circ_0059914 expression was upregulated in gliomas. Knockdown of gliomal circ_0059914 expression reduced the proliferation, migration, invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), angiogenesis, and growth of glioma cells in vivo. Circ_0059914 sponged miR-1249, and miR-1249 inhibition reversed the circ_0059914 knockdown-mediated effects in glioma cells. VEGFA was found to be a target gene of miR1249; overexpression of VEGFA reversed the effect of miR-1249 up-regulation in glioma. Finally, EIF4A3 increased the expression of circ_0059914. EIF4A3-induced circ_0059914 expression plays a role in promoting glioma via the miR-1249/VEGFA axis."

"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic profoundly disrupted the epidemiology of respiratory viruses, driven primarily by widespread non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) such as social distancing and masking. This eight-year retrospective study examines the seasonal patterns and incidence of influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and other respiratory viruses across pre-pandemic, pandemic, and post-pandemic phases in Jalisco, Mexico. Weekly case counts were analyzed using an interrupted time series (ITS) model, segmenting the timeline into these three distinct phases. Significant reductions in respiratory virus circulation were observed during the pandemic, followed by atypical resurgences as NPIs were relaxed. Influenza displayed alternating subtype dominance, with influenza A H3 prevailing in 2022, influenza B surging in 2023, and influenza A H1N1 increasing thereafter, reflecting potential immunity gaps. RSV activity was marked by earlier onset and higher intensity post-pandemic. Other viruses, including human rhinovirus/enterovirus (HRV/HEV) and parainfluenza virus (HPIV), showed altered dynamics, with some failing to return to pre-pandemic seasonality. These findings underscore the need for adaptive surveillance systems and vaccination strategies to address evolving viral patterns. Future research should investigate the long-term public health implications, focusing on vaccination, clinical outcomes, and healthcare preparedness."

"Self-replicating RNA (srRNA) technology, in comparison to mRNA vaccines, has shown dose-sparing by approximately 10-fold and more durable immune responses. However, no improvements are observed in the adverse events profile. Here, we develop an srRNA vaccine platform with optimized non-coding regions and demonstrate immunogenicity and safety in preclinical and clinical development. Optimized srRNA vaccines generate protective immunity (according to the WHO defined thresholds) at doses up to 1,000,000-fold lower than mRNA in female mouse models of influenza and rabies. Clinically, safety and immunogenicity of RBI-4000, an srRNA vector encoding the rabies glycoprotein, was evaluated in a Phase I study (NCT06048770). RBI-4000 was able to elicit de novo protective immunity in the majority of healthy participants when administered at a dose of 0.1, 1, or 10 microgram (71%, 94%, 100%, respectively) in a prime-boost schedule. Similarly, we observe immunity above the WHO benchmark of protection following a single administration in most participants at both 1 and 10 microgram doses. There are no serious adverse events reported across all cohorts. These data establish the high therapeutic index of optimized srRNA vectors, demonstrating feasibility of both low dose and single dose approaches for vaccine applications."
"Numerous Treponema species are prevalent in the dysbiotic subgingival microbial community during periodontitis. The major outer sheath protein is a highly expressed virulence factor of the well-characterized species Treponema denticola. Msp forms an oligomeric membrane protein complex with adhesin and porin properties and contributes to host-microbial interaction. Treponema maltophilum and Treponema lecithinolyticum species are also prominent during periodontitis but are relatively understudied. Msp-like membrane surface proteins exist in T. maltophilum (MspA) and T. lecithinolyticum (MspTL), but limited information exists regarding their structural features or functionality. Protein profiling reveals numerous differences between these species, but minimal differences between strains of the same species. Using protein modeling tools, we predict MspA and MspTL monomeric forms to be large β-barrel structures composed of 20 all-next-neighbor antiparallel β strands which most likely adopt a homotrimer formation. Using cell fractionation, Triton X-114 phase partitioning, heat modifiability, and chemical and detergent release assays, we found evidence of amphiphilic integral membrane-associated oligomerization for both native MspA and MspTL in intact spirochetes. Proteinase K accessibility and immunofluorescence assays demonstrate surface exposure of MspA and MspTL. Functionally, purified recombinant MspA or MspTL monomer proteins can impair neutrophil chemotaxis. Expressions of MspA or MspTL with a PelB leader sequence in Escherichia coli also demonstrate surface exposure and can impair neutrophil chemotaxis in an in vivo air pouch model of inflammation. Collectively, our data demonstrate that MspA and MspTL membrane proteins can contribute to pathogenesis of these understudied oral spirochete species."
"In this pre-specified sub-study of the POISE-3 trial, we examined the effect of a perioperative hypotension-avoidance strategy versus a hypertension-avoidance strategy on the risk of postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI). Altogether, 7307 patients were included from 110 hospitals in 22 countries. Patients were 45 years and older, had or were at risk of atherosclerotic disease, took at least one antihypertensive medication, and were scheduled for noncardiac surgery. Hypotension-avoidance strategy: (i) target intraoperative mean arterial pressure (MAP) 80 mm Hg or over, (ii) on day of surgery and for two days after, hold renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors and use other antihypertensives in stepwise fashion if systolic blood pressure (SBP) 130 mm Hg or more. Hypertension-avoidance strategy: (i) target intraoperative MAP 60 mm Hg or more, (ii) continue all antihypertensives before and after surgery. Primary outcome: postoperative AKI, an increase in serum creatinine concentration of either 26.5 μmol/L or more (0.3 mg/dL or more) within 48 hours of randomization or 50% or more within seven days of randomization. The hypotension-avoidance group (3654 patients) used fewer antihypertensive medications than the hypertension-avoidance group (3653 patients); specifically, 6% vs. 38% used an ACEI or ARB on the day of surgery, and 6% vs. 47% and 7% vs. 50% one and two days after surgery, respectively. Patients also spent about half as much intraoperative time with a MAP under 80 mm Hg (27 vs. 60 minutes, respectively), but had little difference in average BP before or after surgery. There was no significant difference in AKI risk (15.1% vs. 14.4%). Results were consistent with other definitions of AKI and in patients with preexisting chronic kidney disease. Thus, a hypotension-avoidance strategy targeting a MAP greater than 80 mm Hg in the operating room and discontinued blood pressure medication during the perioperative period did not confer a lower risk of AKI compared to a hypertension avoidance strategy. Clinical trial registration number: NCT03505723."
"Nowadays, it is only relatively rare and in selected situations that colonic interposition is chosen rather than the stomach as a reconstructive organ for replacing the oesophagus. The colon is a reliable organ for tubular replacement of the oesophagus when the stomach is not available for reconstruction. Colon interposition is a complex and complicated operation. It requires a specific indication and thorough preoperative preparation. From a technical point of view, colon interposition places high demands on the selection and surgical dissection of the vascular supply to the reconstructed organ. The reconstruction route and elevation of the interposition graft to the proximal oesophagus and the need to create 3 or 4 gastrointestinal anastomoses also place significantly higher demands than reconstruction using a gastric tube. Overall, despite the significant surgery-related morbidity, good functional results and a good quality of life can usually be achieved. The surgical technique applied in our own practice is described in detail. An overview from literature on the results of colonic interposition is given, particularly with regard to surgical complications and quality of life after colon interposition."
"Feline Idiopathic Cystitis (FIC), is a chronic lower urinary tract condition in cats analogous to PBS/IC in women, which presents significant treatment challenges due to its idiopathic nature. Recent advancements in regenerative medicine highlight the potential of Adipose Tissue-Derived Stem Cells (ADSCs), particularly through their secretome, which includes mediators, bioactive molecules, and extracellular vesicles (EVs). Notably, exosomes, a subset of EVs, facilitate cell-to-cell communication and, when derived from ADSCs, exhibit anti-inflammatory properties and contribute to tissue regeneration. In this work, we aim to characterize the content of exosomes derived from feline ADSCs (fADSCs) to elucidate their mechanisms of action on recipient cells and assess their therapeutic potential for FIC. Exosomes were isolated from fADSCs and their microRNA (miRNA) content sequenced using Illumina technology. Our findings demonstrate that fADSC-derived exosomes harbor miRNAs that can induce regenerative processes, such as cell proliferation, immune modulation, angiogenesis, and anti-inflammatory responses. Key miRNAs identified include fca-miR-221, fca-let-7f-5p, fca-miR-337-5p, fca-miR-542-5p, fca-miR-24-3p, fca-miR-205, and fca-miR-23a, which promote proliferative, angiogenic, differentiation, and regenerative mechanisms. Additionally, miRNAs with anti-inflammatory effects, such as fca-miR-193a-5p and fca-miR-127-3p, and those positively regulating the immune system, including fca-let-7a-5p and fca-miR-chrC1_18846-5p, were identified. Of particular interest, fca-miR-219-5p (has-miR-6766-3p) has been reported to suppress liver fibrosis.These results underline the therapeutic potential of fADSC-derived exosomes in treating FIC and suggest innovative strategies for feline veterinary medicine."

"LGBTQ communities around the world entered the COVID-19 pandemic with generally high rates of poor mental health and faced additional challenges including stigma, discrimination, and barriers to care. This study sample was drawn from a survey of 3135 LGBTQ adults residing in Australia during the pandemic. Regression analysis was used to explore individual differences in psychological distress and perceived change in mental wellbeing since the onset of the pandemic as well as the impact of lockdowns, by taking advantage of a natural experiment comparing the states that experienced more extensive lockdowns (Victoria and New South Wales) to the rest of Australia. The burden of mental health was found to vary across gender, sexual orientation, age, and area of residence. While no impact of lockdowns on psychological distress was observed, participants living in the states of Victoria (β = -0.15; 95% CI = -0.23, -0.07) and New South Wales (β = -0.13; 95% CI = -0.21, -0.05) self-reported a more negative impact of the pandemic on their mental wellbeing compared to the rest of the country. The findings suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic had a negative impact on the mental wellbeing of LGBTQ populations, particularly among those who experienced extensive lockdowns and highlight the need for increased efforts to enable access to mental health supports during times of crisis."

"The cation/proton exchanger (CHX), salt overly sensitive (SOS), and receptor-like kinase (RLK) genes play significant roles in the response to salt stress in plants. This study is the first to identify the SOS gene in Solanum lycopersicum (tomato) through genome-wide analysis under salt stress conditions. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) results indicated that the expression levels of CHX, SOS, and RLK genes were upregulated, with fold changes of 1.83, 1.49, and 1.55, respectively, after 12 h of exposure to salt stress. Genome-wide analysis revealed 21 CHX, 5 SOS, and 86 RLK genes in S. lycopersicum. CHX genes were found on chromosomes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, and 12 of S. lycopersicum. SOS genes were found on chromosomes 1, 4, 6, and 10. RLK genes were found on all chromosomes of S. lycopersicum. The Ka/Ks ratios indicate that the CHX, SOS, and RLK genes have been primarily influenced by purifying selection. This suggests that these genes have faced strong environmental pressures throughout their evolution. Purifying selection typically results in a decrease in genetic diversity. The estimated duplication time for CHX paralogous gene pairs ranged from approximately 26.965 to 245.413 million years ago (Mya), while the duplication time for SOS paralogous gene pairs ranged from around 116.682 to 275.631 Mya. For RLK paralogous gene pairs, the duplication time varied from approximately 27.689 to 239.376 Mya. Synteny analysis of the CHX, SOS, and RLK genes demonstrated collinear relationships with orthologous genes in Arabidopsis thaliana, but no collinearity orthologous relationships in Oryza sativa (rice). Furthermore, the analysis revealed that there were 6 orthologous SlCHX genes, 2 orthologous SlSOS genes, and 44 orthologous SlRLK genes paired with those in A. thaliana. The results of the present study may help to elucidate the role of the CHX, SOS, and RLK genes in salt stress in S. lycopersicum."

"This study used real-world data from three separate United States (US) databases to evaluate dosing patterns and time to next treatment (TTNT) following the first-incident adverse event (AE) in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) treated with first-line ibrutinib with and without dose reduction (DR). Median TTNT or death in patients with and without a DR following an AE in each database was as follows: Optum Clinformatics Data Mart (CDM): 59.5 and 30.6 months; ConcertAI: 27.1 and 18.0 months; and Medicare Fee-for-Service (FFS): 49.8 and 22.0 months, respectively. Median TTNT or death in patients with cardiac AEs, with and without a DR, was: Optum CDM: 44.4 and 22.9 months; ConcertAI: 29.9 and 18.3 months; and Medicare FFS: 49.6 and 14.0 months, respectively. Ibrutinib DR was associated with fewer outpatient visits and lower CLL/SLL-related medical costs. These findings suggest that utilizing ibrutinib DR may effectively manage tolerability without compromising clinical efficacy."

"Cadmium, a highly toxic heavy metal, can cause severe damage to several vital organs including the kidney, liver, and brain. Many of the natural compounds found in aromatic plants have beneficial pharmacological properties. Eugenol is one such compound reported to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. The aim of this study is to investigate whether eugenol, a natural compound found in aromatic plants known for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, can mitigate the detrimental effects of cadmium exposure on cardiac inflammation, oxidative stress, and dyslipidemia. Male albino rats were subjected to randomization into four groups, each comprising six animals, to investigate the potential of eugenol in mitigating cadmium-induced toxicity. All groups received oral gavage treatment for 21 days. Following the treatment regimen, cardiac tissue specimens were collected for analysis. The assessment of cardiac antioxidant status entailed the determination of enzymatic activities including catalase, SOD, GST, and GPx. Additionally, levels of lipid peroxidation, reduced glutathione, protein carbonyl oxidation, and thiol levels were quantified in the cardiac tissue samples. To evaluate cardiac damage, marker enzymes such as LDH and CK-MB were measured. Furthermore, the inflammatory response in the cardiac tissue induced by cadmium exposure was assessed through the quantification of NO, TNF-α, and IL-6 levels. Additionally, molecular docking and dynamics studies were conducted utilizing autodock and GLIDE methodologies. Cadmium administration markedly enhanced the activities of LDH and CK-MB, prominent cardiac markers. Furthermore, cadmium treatment also demonstrated a significant decrease in the reduced glutathione levels and antioxidant enzyme activities. Significant elevation of the inflammatory markers was also observed in the cadmium-treated group. Eugenol treatment effectively ameliorates cadmium-induced biochemical changes. This study underscores the potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant attributes of eugenol. Co-administration of eugenol alongside cadmium exhibited remarkable protective efficacy against cadmium-induced cardio-toxicity. Eugenol demonstrated the capability to reinstate the cellular redox equilibrium of rats subjected to cadmium treatment to levels akin to those of the normal control group."

"With the ongoing rise in the incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), its extraintestinal manifestations have garnered significant attention. IBD-related arthritis is notable for its insidious onset and unpredictability, presenting considerable challenges for clinical diagnosis and management. Factors such as gut microbiota, plasma proteins, inflammatory proteins, and biomarkers found in blood and urine may be closely associated with IBD-related arthritis. However, the mechanisms by which these factors influence this condition remain poorly understood and require urgent investigation. We employed the method of linkage disequilibrium and the two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) approach, utilizing single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified from large-scale genome-wide association studies as instrumental variables. In this scientifically rigorous manner, we explored the potential causal relationship between gut microbiota, plasma proteins, inflammatory proteins, and blood and urine biomarkers in relation to arthritis resulting from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This method aids in elucidating the potential roles of these biomarkers in the development of arthritis following IBD, while minimizing the confounding factors and reverse causality commonly encountered in observational studies. To further verify and strengthen our findings, we conducted subsequent sensitivity analyses. These analyses will evaluate the strength of the association between SNPs and the studied biomarkers, as well as post-IBD arthritis, while accounting for variations in SNP distribution among populations and other potential genetic influencing factors. Through these rigorous analytical steps, our objective is to enhance the robustness and credibility of the research findings and provide more reliable scientific evidence regarding the pathogenesis of post-IBD arthritis. MR analysis provides evidence for the association between genetically predicted gut microbiota, plasma proteins, inflammatory proteins, and blood and urine biomarkers with the risk of IBD-related arthritis. This analysis investigates the characteristics of the associations between specific gut microbiota, plasma proteins, inflammatory proteins, and blood and urine biomarkers in relation to IBD-related arthritis. Among the plasma proteins, pterin-4-alpha-carbinolamine dehydratase, aldo-keto reductase family 1 member C4, cathepsin L2, angiostatin, hepatocyte growth factor-like protein, hepatitis A virus cellular receptor 2, protein O-linked mannose beta-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 2, epididymal-specific alpha-mannosidase, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-like protein are associated with Crohn's disease-related arthritis. In contrast, agrin, methylenetetrahydrofolate synthetase domain-containing protein, neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) growth factor receptor, and neuropilin-1 are associated with ulcerative colitis-related arthritis. Furthermore, regarding gut bacterial pathway abundance, adenosylcobalamin, N-acetylglucosamine, N-acetylmannosamine, and N-acetylneuraminic acid degradation, as well as glycolysis metabolism and degradation pathways, are associated with Crohn's disease-related arthritis. Meanwhile, gut bacterial pathway abundance (pentose phosphate pathway) and gut microbiota abundance (Bacteroidetes, Bacteroidia, Bacteroidales, Porphyromonadaceae, Faecalibacterium, Eubacterium eligens) are linked to ulcerative colitis-related arthritis. Notably, we did not identify any connections between inflammatory protein factors, blood and urine biomarkers, and IBD-related arthritis. Lastly, in the reverse MR study, the insufficient number of SNPs available for analysis precluded the detection of a reverse causal relationship. This study employs the MR method to elucidate the potential causal relationships among gut microbiota, plasma proteins, inflammatory proteins, and blood and urine biomarkers in relation to the occurrence and progression of IBD-related arthritis. This research offers a novel perspective for a deeper understanding of the pathogenesis of IBD-related arthritis and highlights future directions for the diagnosis and treatment strategies of this condition."

"Chronic HCV infection is a risk factor for end-stage liver disease, leading to a major burden on public health. Mitophagy is a specific form of selective autophagy that eliminates mitochondria to maintain mitochondrial integrity. HCV NS5A is a multifunctional protein that regulates the HCV life cycle and may induce host mitophagy. However, the molecular mechanism by which HCV NS5A activates mitophagy remains largely unknown. Here, for the first time, we delineate the dynamic process of HCV NS5A-activated PINK1/Parkin-dependent mitophagy. By performing live-cell imaging and CLEM analyses of HCV NS5A-expressing cells, we demonstrate the degradation of mitochondria within autophagic vacuoles, a process that is dependent on Parkin and ubiquitin translocation onto mitochondria and PINK1 stabilization. In addition, the cargo receptors of mitophagy, NDP52 and OPTN, are recruited to the mitochondria and required for HCV NS5A-induced mitophagy. Moreover, ATG5 and DFCP1, which function in autophagosome closure and phagophore formation, are translocated near mitochondria for HCV NS5A-induced mitophagy. Furthermore, autophagy-initiating proteins, including ATG14 and ULK1, are recruited near the mitochondria for HCV NS5A-triggered mitophagy. Together, these findings demonstrate that HCV NS5A may induce PINK1/Parkin-dependent mitophagy through the recognition of mitochondria by cargo receptors and the nascent formation of phagophores close to mitochondria."
"Theoretical models of personality disorders (PDs) highlight the role of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) in the development and maintenance of personality pathology. This review presents recent studies on the associations between childhood adversity and PDs, while discussing mechanisms and factors that impact these relationships."
"Individuals with chronic physical conditions and comorbid mental illness have increased probability of adverse health outcomes. As minority populations have limited access to both medical care and culturally appropriate mental health services, having a comorbid mental health condition can further impede their ability to manage chronic conditions and widen racial disparities in health outcomes. Further, racial/ethnic disparities in treatment patterns are likely to exacerbate disparities in adverse health outcomes."
"Ovarian function declines significantly as females enter middle-age, but the mechanisms underlying this decline remain unclear. Here, we utilize whole-organ imaging to observe a notable decrease in ovarian blood vessel (oBV) density and angiogenesis intensity of middle-aged mice. This leads to a diminished blood supply to the ovaries, resulting in inadequate development and maturation of ovarian follicles. Utilizing genetic-modified mouse models, we demonstrate that granulosa cell secreted VEGFA governs ovarian angiogenesis, but the physiological decline in oBV is not attributed to VEGFA insufficiency. Instead, through single-cell sequencing, we identify the aging of the ovarian vascular endothelium as the primary factor contributing to oBV decline. Consequently, the administration of salidroside, a natural compound that is functional to reverse oBV aging and promote ovarian angiogenesis, significantly enhances ovarian blood supply and improve fertility in older females. Our findings highlight that enhancing oBV function is a promising strategy to boost fertility in females."
"Accessible contraception is critical for promoting the health and well-being of women and their families. In the UK, contraception is free at the point of access, but only 55% of pregnancies are planned, with negative implications for maternal and infant outcomes. In general, women from ethnic minorities use contraceptives less than white women. Barriers to the uptake of contraceptives have been identified, including perceived poor information from healthcare professionals and concerns about side effects. However, most studies do not include representative proportions of women from ethnic minorities. Evidence suggests that ethnic minority (EM) women feel targeted and coerced by healthcare professionals regarding contraception."

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) often coexists with substance use disorders (SUDs). This study aimed to determine factors associated with ADHD symptoms among adults with SUDs in Malaysia.
"Immunoisolation strategies that rely on porous membranes play an important role in cell transplantation therapies to protect cells from the host's immune system. These membranes must possess immunoprotective properties while facilitating the transport of nutrients and cell products to maintain the functional integrity of encapsulated cells. An easy and scalable process is described to fabricate a dual function porous polymeric membrane that shields cells against immune cell attack and promotes vascularization to address the nutritional and oxygen requirements of transplanted cells. The fabrication process results in a membrane cross-section with a gradient of nanopores to micropores that support cell immunoisolation and interfacial vascularization requirements, respectively. The membranes demonstrate excellent cell compatibility and effectively prevent T cell transmigration without compromising glucose diffusion and oxygen permeability. In a murine subcutaneous implantation model, membranes are stable for 60 days and exhibit significantly reduced fibrous capsules, with enhanced vascularization near the membrane. These porous polymeric membranes can potentially be used as pro-angiogenic immunoprotective membranes for cell transplantation applications where maximizing cell viability and function is of critical importance."
The study aimed to investigate whether the fine motor skills measured by the Functional Dexterity Test (FDT) in ADHD children differ from healthy controls. The second aim was to assess the applicability of the FDT assessment method among ADHD children.
"The incidence and magnitude of depression are rarely assessed during preanaesthetic evaluation. The shared physiological mechanisms of depression and anaesthetic drugs are likely to alter the pharmacodynamics of propofol. Therefore, the study aimed to evaluate the burden of presurgical depression and its effect on propofol consumption during anaesthesia. This prospective, observational, cross-sectional, analytical study included adult patients (> 18 years) undergoing surgery. During the preoperative period, depressive symptoms were evaluated by the psychiatrist on 9-point Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). The propofol requirements were recorded during anaesthesia and compared with those for patients without depression. One hundred and seventy-four patients (87 patients each with and without cancer) underwent presurgical evaluation. The prevalence of depression (>4 Patient Health Questionnaire-9) and moderate to severe depression (>9 PHQ-9) among patients with cancer was 58.6% and 35.6%, respectively. The prevalence of depression (>4 PHQ-9) and moderate to severe depression (>9 PHQ-9) among patients without cancer was 18.4% and 3.4%, respectively. In the cancer group, propofol requirement was significantly lower (114.7 ± 22.9mg vs. 126.4 ± 24.3mg; p = 0.025) in patients with depression than that in those without depression. In conclusion, the burden of depression during the preanaesthetic period among patients with cancer is substantial, and depression reduces propofol requirement during surgery."
There is conflicting evidence regarding whether excess adiposity without metabolic abnormalities reflects a truly benign phenotype. This study evaluated the independent and joint associations of the presence of excess adiposity and metabolic abnormalities on arterial stiffness.
"The transition to residency (TTR) goes along with new opportunities for learning and development, which can also be challenging, despite the availability of preparation courses designed to ease the transition process. Although the TTR highly depends on the organization, individual combined with organizational strategies that advance adaptation are rarely investigated. This study explores residents' strategies and experiences with organizational strategies to help them adapt to residency."
Bacteremia is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Rising prevalence and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) are critical public health issues. This study aims to determine the prevalence of bacteremia and the AMR pattern among patients in South Lebanon.
"Glutamate is the main excitatory transmitter in the mammalian central nervous system; glutamate transporters keep the synaptic glutamate concentrations at bay for normal brain function. Arachidonic acid (AA), docosahexaenoic acid, and other unsaturated fatty acids modulate glutamate transporters in cell- and tissue slices-based studies. Here, we investigated their effect and mechanism using a purified archaeal glutamate transporter homolog reconstituted into the lipid membranes. AA, docosahexaenoic acid, and related fatty acids irreversibly inhibited the sodium-dependent concentrative substrate uptake into lipid vesicles within the physiologically relevant concentration range. In contrast, AA did not inhibit amino acid exchange across the membrane. The length and unsaturation of the aliphatic tail affect inhibition, and the free carboxylic headgroup is necessary. The inhibition potency did not correlate with the fatty acid effects on the bilayer deformation energies. AA does not affect the conformational dynamics of the protein, suggesting it does not inhibit structural transitions necessary for transport. Single-transporter and membrane voltage assays showed that AA and related fatty acids mediate cation leak, dissipating the driving sodium gradient. Thus, such fatty acids can act as cation ionophores, suggesting a general modulatory mechanism of membrane channels and ion-coupled transporters."
"Primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by the infiltration of lymphocytes on salivary and lacrimal glands, resulting in their dysfunction. Patients suffering from severe pSS have an increased risk of developing multi-organ dysfunction syndrome due to the development of systemic inflammatory response, which results in immune cell-driven injury of the lungs, kidneys, liver, and brain. Therapeutic agents that are used for the treatment of severe pSS encounter various limitations and challenges that can impact their effectiveness. Accordingly, there is a need for targeted, personalized therapy that could address the underlying detrimental immune response while minimizing side effects. Results obtained in a large number of recently published studies have demonstrated the therapeutic efficacy of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in the treatment of severe pSS. MSCs, in a juxtacrine and paracrine manner, suppressed the generation of inflammatory Th1 and Th17 lymphocytes, induced the expansion of immunosuppressive cells, impaired the cross-talk between auto-reactive T and B cells, and prevented the synthesis and secretion of auto-antibodies. Additionally, MSC-derived growth and trophic factors promoted survival and prevented apoptosis of injured cells in inflamed lacrimal and salivary glands, thereby enhancing their repair and regeneration. In this review article, we summarized current knowledge about the molecular mechanisms that are responsible for the beneficial effects of MSCs in the suppression of immune cell-driven injury of exocrine glands and vital organs, paving the way for a better understanding of their therapeutic potential in the targeted therapy of severe pSS."
"CALGB 30610 trial demonstrated that once daily thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) was not superior compared to standard twice daily TRT, in patients with limited stage small cell lung cancer. Quality of life outcomes may help oncologists decide the best treatment approach."
"Berberine (BBR) is widely used as a botanical pesticide due to its broad-spectrum antibacterial and antifungal activities. However, BBR degradation pathway in soil microorganisms, which determines its impact on soil environment, remains poorly understood. Herein, a novel BBR-degrading bacterium Agrobacterium sp. V1 was isolated and characterized. Agrobacterium sp. V1 was able to utilize BBR as the sole carbon source for cell growth, and 50 μg/mL of BBR was completely degraded within 48 h. To reveal the possible BBR degradation pathway, whole genome sequencing of Agrobacterium sp. V1 was conducted, and proteins in Agrobacterium sp. V1 were aligned with enzymes involved in BBR biosynthesis in Rhizoma Coptidis. The results indicated that more than 60% of enzymes in BBR biosynthesis pathway had orthologs in Agrobacterium sp. V1. Combined with the primary mass spectra of BBR metabolites, a novel BBR degradation pathway in this bacterium was proposed. In summary, the proposed BBR degradation pathway offered new insights into the impact of BBR to the environment and also provided a reference for studying BBR metabolism in microorganisms."
"Mental ill-health and substance use bear significant public health burden on young people. Prevention is key. Trauma-informed approaches to prevention of mental ill-health and substance use demonstrate significant promise, yet it is unclear how well existing approaches work for young people targeting mental ill-health and substance use. This review aimed to assess the effectiveness, feasibility, and acceptability of trauma-informed mental ill-health and/or substance use prevention programs for young people."
"Phototheranostics is growing into a sparking frontier in disease treatment. Developing single molecular species synchronously featured by powerful absorption capacity, superior second near-infrared (NIR-II) fluorescence and prominent photothermal conversion ability is highly desirable for phototheranostics, yet remains formidably challenging. In this work, we propose a molecular design philosophy that the integration of noncovalent conformational locks (NoCLs) with aggregation-induced emission (AIE) in a single formulation is able to boost multiple photophysical properties for efficient phototheranostics. The introduction of NoCLs skeleton with conformation-locking feature in the center of molecular architecture indeed elevates the structural planarity and rigidity, which simultaneously promotes the absorption capacity and bathochromic-shifts the emission wavelength centered in NIR-II region. Meanwhile, the AIE tendency mainly originated from flexibly propeller-like geometry at the ends of molecular architecture eventually endows the molecule with satisfactory emission intensity and photothermal conversion in aggregates. Consequently, by utilizing the optimized molecule, unprecedented performance on NIR-II fluorescence-photoacoustic-photothermal trimodal imaging-guided photothermal-chemo synergistic therapy is demonstrated by the precise tumor diagnosis and complete tumor ablation."
"Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists are novel medications with proven efficacy in treating type 2 diabetes mellitus, and are increasingly being used for weight loss. They may potentially have benefit in treating metabolic disorders; however, evidence is sparse with regards to treating high blood pressure (BP). We performed a systematic review, meta-analysis and meta-regression investigating the efficacy of GLP-1 RAs in lowering BP in obese or overweight patients."

"GPA33 is a promising surface antigen for targeted therapy in colorectal cancer (CRC). It is expressed almost exclusively in CRC and intestinal epithelia. However, previous clinical studies have not achieved expected response rates. We investigated GPA33 expression and regulation in CRC and developed a GPA33-targeted cellular therapy. We examined GPA33 expression in CRC cohorts using immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. We analyzed GPA33 regulation by interference with oncogenic signaling in vitro and in vivo using inhibitors and conditional inducible regulators. Furthermore, we engineered anti-GPA33-CAR T cells and assessed their activity in vitro and in vivo. GPA33 expression showed consistent intratumoral heterogeneity in CRC with antigen loss at the infiltrative tumor edge. This pattern was preserved at metastatic sites. GPA33-positive cells had a differentiated phenotype and low WNT activity. Low GPA33 expression levels were linked to tumor progression in patients with CRC. Downregulation of WNT activity induced GPA33 expression in vitro and in GPA33-negative tumor cell subpopulations in xenografts. GPA33-CAR T cells were activated in response to GPA33 and reduced xenograft growth in mice after intratumoral application. GPA33-targeted therapy may be improved by simultaneous WNT inhibition to enhance GPA33 expression. Furthermore, GPA33 is a promising target for cellular immunotherapy in CRC."
"The human mycobiome encompasses diverse communities of fungal organisms residing within the body and has emerged as a critical player in shaping health and disease. While extensive research has focused on the skin and gut mycobiome, recent investigations have pointed toward the potential role of fungal organisms in neurological disorders. Among those fungal organisms, the presence of the commensal fungus Malassezia in the brain has created curiosity because of its commensal nature and primary association with the human skin and gut. This budding yeast is responsible for several diseases, such as Seborrheic dermatitis, Atopic dermatitis, Pityriasis versicolor, Malassezia folliculitis, dandruff, and others. However recent findings surprisingly show the presence of Malassezia DNA in the brain and have been linked to diseases like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Multiple sclerosis, and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The exact role of Malassezia in these disorders is unknown, but its ability to infect human cells, travel through the bloodstream, cross the blood-brain barrier, and reside along with the lipid-rich neuronal cells are potential mechanisms responsible for pathogenesis. This also includes the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, disruption of the blood-brain barrier, gut-microbe interaction, and accumulation of metabolic changes in the brain environment. In this review, we discuss these key findings from studies linking Malassezia to neurological disorders, emphasizing the complex and multifaceted nature of these cases. Furthermore, we discuss potential mechanisms through which Malassezia might contribute to the development of neurological conditions. Future investigations will open up new avenues for our understanding of the fungal gut-brain axis and how it influences human behavior. Collaborative research efforts among microbiologists, neuroscientists, immunologists, and clinicians hold promise for unraveling the enigmatic connections between human commensal Malassezia and neurological disorders."
"The correlation between central airway anatomical parameters and demographic factors, such as sex, age, weight, height, body mass index (BMI), and cardiac factors, remains unclear. This study examined the correlation between these factors and central airway anatomical parameters in adult patients."
"Globally, the quality of maternal and newborn care remains inadequate, as seen through indicators like perineal injuries and low Apgar scores. While midwifery practices have the potential to improve care quality and health outcomes, there is a lack of evidence on how midwife-led initiatives, particularly those aimed at improving the use of dynamic birth positions, intrapartum support, and perineal protection, affect these outcomes."
"Eyelid infiltrative basal cell carcinoma (iBCC) is the most common malignant tumor affecting the ocular adnexa, but studies on metabolic changes within its microenvironment and heterogeneity at the tumor invasive area are limited. This study aims to analyze metabolic differences among iBCC cell types using single-cell and spatial metabolomics analysis and to examine metabolic environment at the tumor invasive area."
"Prolonged exposure to hot environments increases the probability of heat load that may cause occupational heat strain to workers. This study investigates the impact of individual and work-related factors on the heat-related consequences among power plant workers in a hot region. This cross-sectional study was conducted in 2020. The collecting data tool was a validated self-reported 26 item questionnaire and completed in 534 individuals. We used logistic regression, Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) and maximum likelihood evaluations for data analysis. The findings indicated that age, work environment, physical work demands and drinking fluids during work hours are significant with heat exposure perception, heat-related symptoms, and work performance (P-value<0.05). Further, the male workers aged 40-49 are more prone to heat-related symptoms (AOR 1.34, 95% CI 1.18-2.13). The importance of addressing heat stress in occupational settings is necessary and informing strategies to help workers adapt to heat in hot workplaces."
"'Risk Management Plan Educational Materials' (RMP EMs) are additional risk minimization measures (aRMMs) intended to prevent or reduce the occurrence of adverse reactions associated with the exposure to a medicine, or to reduce their severity or impact on the patient. While the healthcare sector is embracing various digital tools and platforms for educational and/or awareness building purposes, paper-based materials have remained the mainstay approach for implementation of aRMMs by pharmaceutical companies. Novartis in Singapore conducted a pilot on the feasibility of distributing electronic copies of RMP EMs (e-RMP). Post-pilot, e-RMP was officially implemented in Novartis Singapore. A year following the launch of e-RMP, a survey was performed with healthcare professionals (HCPs) to understand end-users' experience. The survey responses revealed a general preference by both HCPs and patients towards e-RMP. Digital methods of delivering educational aRMMs offer great benefits over traditional paper-based programs. e-RMP significantly reduces the time needed for updated RMP EMs to reach HCPs and their patients/caregivers. This is important to ensure that HCPs and patients/caregivers are made aware of any updates in key safety messages of the products in a timely manner to ultimately ensure patient safety. The successful transition to digital solutions requires purposeful collaborations between key stakeholders of the healthcare ecosystem including regulatory authorities, pharmaceutical companies, HCPs, patients and caregivers. This article aims to provide insights on the digitalization journey of e-RMP, a case study in Singapore, outlining the value but also some of the challenges faced during this transformation."
"Rare germline variation in regulator of telomere elongation helicase 1 (RTEL1) is associated with telomere biology disorders (TBDs). Biallelic RTEL1 variants result in childhood onset dyskeratosis congenita and Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson syndrome whereas heterozygous individuals usually present later in life with pulmonary fibrosis or bone marrow failure. We compiled all TBD-associated RTEL1 variants in the literature and assessed phenotypes and outcomes of 44 individuals from 14 families with mono- or biallelic RTEL1 variants enrolled in clinical trial NCT00027274. Variants were classified by adapting ACMG-AMP guidelines using clinical information, telomere length, and variant allele frequency data. Compared with heterozygotes, individuals with biallelic RTEL1 variants had an earlier age at diagnosis (median age 35.5 vs. 5.1 years, p < 0.01) and worse overall survival (median age 66.5 vs. 22.9 years, p < 0.001). There were 257 unique RTEL1 variants reported in 47 publications, and 209 had a gnomAD minor allele frequency <1%. Only 38.3% (80/209) met pathogenic/likely pathogenic criteria. Notably, 8 of 209 reported disease-associated variants were benign or likely benign and the rest were variants of uncertain significance. Given the considerable differences in outcomes of TBDs associated with RTEL1 germline variants and the extent of variation in the gene, systematic functional studies and standardization of variant curation are urgently needed to inform clinical management."
"Prenatal hypoxia, often accompanied by maternal glucocorticoid stress, can predispose offspring to neurological disorders in adulthood. If placental ischemia (PI) primarily reduces fetal oxygen supply, the maternal hypoxia (MH) model also elicits a pronounced fetal glucocorticoid exposure. Here, we compared MH and PI in rats to distinguish their unique and overlapping effects on embryonic and newborn brain development. We analyzed glucocorticoid transport into the developing brain, glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression, and GR-dependent transcription, along with key enzymes regulating glucocorticoid metabolism in maternal (MP) and fetal placentas (FP) and in the brain. Additionally, we examined hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1α) and its downstream genes, as well as glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway, both associated with the transport of substrates essential for glucocorticoid synthesis and degradation. Both MH and PI induced HIF1-dependent metabolic alterations, enhancing glycolysis and transiently disrupting redox homeostasis. However, only MH caused a maternal glucocorticoid surge that altered early fetal brain glucocorticoid responsiveness. Over time, these differences may lead to distinct long-term outcomes in neuronal structure and function. This work clarifies the individual contributions of hypoxic and glucocorticoid stresses to fetal brain development, suggesting that combining the MH and PI models could provide valuable insights for future investigations into the mechanisms underlying developmental brain pathologies, including non-heritable psychoneurological and neurodegenerative disorders."
"The elderly population is growing worldwide and is more likely to die from injuries that younger patients would likely survive. Furthermore, elderly trauma patients are often subjected to triage decisions that admit them to lower-level facilities. These patients may require interhospital transfer to a major trauma center for definitive care. The aim of this study was to investigate the time interval from arrival at the primary hospital to arrival at the trauma center among elderly trauma patients (≥65 years) as compared to younger, adult patients (18-64 years). We hypothesized that elderly trauma patients would endure a longer time interval."
"Biomass valorization and bio-based material development are of major research interest following the spirit of the circular economy. Aloe vera cultivation is a widespread agricultural activity oriented toward supplement production because of its well-known antioxidant and antimicrobial properties. Aloe vera juice production also produces a large amount of biomass byproducts that are usually landfilled. On the other hand, cellulose nanocrystals are widely used in several applications, such as biomaterials, bio-compatible polymers, nanocomposites, food packaging, medicines, cosmetics, and sensors, due to their unique physical, mechanical, optical, electrical, and healing properties as well as their compatibility with biological tissues. This study introduces a novel approach combining the microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) of cellulose from this residue with the subsequent isolation of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs). The MAE process, which exhibits a rapid heating and penetrating ability, was optimized to maximize the cellulose yield under various conditions (microwave power, solvent ratio, and time). Analysis using FTIR, XRD, SEM, and DMA indicated that isolated pure cellulose nanocrystals and a stable PVA-CNC porous hydrogel network were produced. The PVA-CNC hydrogel was synthesized to enable the formation of a semi-crystalline network that imparts the material with enhanced mechanical properties. Both final products of this study could potentially be used for various applications."
"As an emerging desalination technology, flow-electrode capacitive deionisation (FCDI) has the advantages of theoretically infinite adsorption capacity and applicability to high-concentration brine. However, during the operation of FCDI, the flow electrode in the S-shape channel is prone to sedimentation and clogging the channel. This undesirable phenomenon brings low efficiency and security issues. Therefore, a drop-shape channel was designed for FCDI to improve the flow regime of the flow electrode. The flow simulation of the drop-shape channel was performed to select the appropriate geometry to avoid the formation of the vortex and low-velocity region. The simulation results showed that the streamlined design of the drop-shape channel has insignificant velocity gradients. It significantly reduces the low-velocity region and improves the phenomenon of particle sedimentation. The desalination performance with varieties of electrode flow rate, AC content, and voltage was used to investigate the advantage between S-shape and drop-shape channels. It was found that under the conditions of low flow rate, high AC content, and high voltage, the drop-shape channel FCDI system could still obtain better ASRR and CE."
"Neuronavigation in ventriculoscopy has been described in several papers. However, there are different ventriculoscopes and navigation systems. Because of these different combinations, it is difficult to find detailed navigation protocols for each ventriculoscope. We describe, step by step, a simple method to navigate both the trajectory to reach the ventricular system and the intraventricular work for the LOTTA ventriculoscope."
"The brain's complex distributed dynamics are typically quantified using a limited set of manually selected statistical properties, leaving the possibility that alternative dynamical properties may outperform those reported for a given application. Here, we address this limitation by systematically comparing diverse, interpretable features of both intra-regional activity and inter-regional functional coupling from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data, demonstrating our method using case-control comparisons of four neuropsychiatric disorders. Our findings generally support the use of linear time-series analysis techniques for rs-fMRI case-control analyses, while also identifying new ways to quantify informative dynamical fMRI structures. While simple statistical representations of fMRI dynamics performed surprisingly well (e.g., properties within a single brain region), combining intra-regional properties with inter-regional coupling generally improved performance, underscoring the distributed, multifaceted changes to fMRI dynamics in neuropsychiatric disorders. The comprehensive, data-driven method introduced here enables systematic identification and interpretation of quantitative dynamical signatures of multivariate time-series data, with applicability beyond neuroimaging to diverse scientific problems involving complex time-varying systems."
Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) is susceptible to reagent composition. This study aimed to investigate a large number of specimens and determine the cause of discrepancies.
"Bovine milk is widely recognized as one of the most valuable sources of nutrients such as proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals that support the development and health of the body. In recent years, there has been increasing scientific interest in exosomes, the small membrane-bound vesicles found in milk. Through their content (e.g., microRNA), exosomes can influence gene expression and modulate key signaling pathways within target cells. Results from in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that bovine milk-derived exosomes can alleviate intestinal inflammation by regulating signaling pathways and positively influencing the composition of the gut microbiota. They also improve cognitive function and support nervous system regeneration. In addition, exosomes promote bone health by stimulating osteoblast formation and inhibiting bone resorption, helping to prevent osteoporosis. Studies have shown that exosomes have beneficial effects on skin health by promoting collagen production, protecting cells from oxidative stress, and delaying the ageing process. Bovine milk-derived exosomes are a promising tool for the treatment and prevention of a variety of diseases, particularly those related to inflammation and tissue regeneration. Although these results are promising, further studies are needed to fully understand the mechanisms of action and the potential clinical application of milk exosomes in the prevention and treatment of different diseases."
"Interventional occlusion of Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is generally efficacious and complications such as delayed occluder displacement are infrequent. Herein, we report a case of 24-year-old female with a history of unsuccessful PDA closures, who subsequently experienced delayed occluder displacement into the left main pulmonary artery. Despite numerous unsuccessful catheter-based interventions, thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) was successfully executed. This procedure effectively resolved the PDA without any postprocedural complications. This case highlights the efficacy and safety of TEVAR as a viable alternative for managing complex PDA cases involving occluder displacement."
"CheckMate 914 is a two-part, randomized phase III trial evaluating adjuvant nivolumab plus ipilimumab (part A) or adjuvant nivolumab monotherapy (part B) versus placebo in mutually exclusive populations of patients with localized renal cell carcinoma (RCC) at high risk of postnephrectomy recurrence. Part A showed no disease-free survival (DFS) benefit for adjuvant nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus placebo. We report results from part B."
"The use of emergency tourniquets among military personnel has helped to dramatically reduce battlefield deaths and has recently gained popularity in the civilian sector. Yet, even well-trained individuals can find it difficult to assess proper tourniquet application. Emergency tourniquets are typically deemed sufficiently tightened through cursory visual confirmation or pulse assessment. These indicators are not always accurate and are difficult to assess during chaotic events where fast and effective tourniquet application by both trained and untrained personnel can contribute significantly to saving lives. Towards addressing these issues, we have developed the Tourniquet Integrated Monitor (TiMON) as an easy-to-use real-time pressure sensing device designed to seamlessly integrate with pre-existing emergency tourniquets. Here, we present the results of two studies in which the TiMON was tested among a group of soldiers participating in the Army Expeditionary Warrior Experiments (AEWE) as well as in a group of untrained civilians from Massachusetts General Hospital."
"This study advances a methodology to estimate effective apertures of fractures in glacial tills based on dye tracer infiltration tests and numerical simulations. The approach uses the visible penetration depth of the dye tracer along fracture flow paths as primary information to calculate effective fracture apertures. Further data used in the calculation are the dye tracer input concentration and retardation, the duration of the tracer injection, and the hydraulic gradient applied to control the infiltrating water fluxes. The method does not require measurement of hydraulic conductivity for the fractured till and enables direct observation of flow and transport patterns within the fractures (e.g., uniform flow and dye tracer distribution, channeling due to aperture variability, and presence of biogenic macropores in fractures). The approach was successfully verified by using the estimated effective fracture aperture values in Large Undisturbed Columns (LUCs) to consistently simulate both the observed LUC effluent breakthrough of a conservative bromide tracer and the water fluxes with the hydraulic gradient applied in the experiments. Sensitivity analyses revealed that estimation of small effective fracture apertures (<10 μm) required accurate determination of the dye tracer retardation factor. By contrast, in the case of larger effective apertures (>20 μm), the sensitivity of the estimated effective fracture aperture to variations in the porous material and solute transport parameters was low compared to the dominant sensitivity to the water flow through the fractures (cubic relation between flow and aperture). The proposed approach may be extended beyond laboratory applications and assist in characterizing field-scale fracture networks."
"This study aimed to investigate the hamstring activation in athletes with hamstring strain injuries in vertical jump tasks using an EMG time-frequency analysis. Fifteen injured athletes and 15 matched controls were recruited. The EMG signals of the lateral hamstring (LH) and medial hamstring (MH) were assessed during countermovement, squat, and drop vertical jump tasks. Wavelet analysis was used to analyze the hamstring activation during takeoff, flight, and landing phases. The kinetics outcomes were also investigated. The results showed a significantly lower mean frequency of the LH and MH for all phases and jumps in the injured group compared to the control group (p < 0.05). The activation deficit led to a higher landing force (p = 0.028) and loading rate (p = 0.024) in the injured athletes. The hamstrings were recruited to a greater extent during the countermovement jump compared to the other two jumping tasks. In conclusion, athletes with prior hamstring strain displayed neuromuscular deficits, indicating neuronal alteration after the strain. The persistent activation deficits led to a degraded jump-landing performance. In addition, the hamstring recruitment differed in different jumping tasks. The findings suggest that neuromuscular training may be beneficial as part of the daily training drills of hamstring strains."
"The impact of forced migration on the mental health of refugee men is far-reaching and compounded by gendered masculinity, which shapes men's access to employment and other resources. A gap in knowledge exists on the broader determinants of refugee men's mental health."
"Exposure to asbestos in the workplace is currently recognized as one of the leading causes of work-related deaths, with more than half of deaths attributable to cancer."
"The development of China's National Carbon Market has strengthened the inherent link between the carbon market and the broader energy market, providing a potential for cross-market risk transmission resonance. Studying the risk spillover effects between China's National Carbon Market and the crude oil futures market is of significant practical importance, both in terms of carbon market development and carbon risk management. Based on the Maximal Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform (MODWT), the price series are decomposed across multiple scales, and the risk spillover effects between the carbon market and the crude oil futures market are examined from both the time domain and the frequency domain. Methods such as wavelet energy decomposition, wavelet correlation, lead-lag analysis, and wavelet coherence are used to explore the mean spillover effects and volatility spillover effects (collectively referred to as risk spillover effects) across various scales. The study finds that China's National Carbon Market exhibits a clear compliance-driven effect, with relatively low market liquidity. The crude oil futures market experiences frequent price fluctuations, primarily driven by long-term factors. In the time domain, the risk transmission resonance between the carbon market and the crude oil futures market is high, with significant positive correlations observed at the D1 to D4 scales, and noticeable mean spillover effects. In the frequency domain, at the D3 to D4 scales, the carbon market and the crude oil futures market exhibit similar volatility frequencies, indicating strong volatility spillover effects. Based on these findings, it is recommended that the trading volume of the carbon market be gradually increased to improve market liquidity. Furthermore, the risk monitoring and early warning mechanisms of China's National Carbon Market should be improved. For carbon-emitting companies, enhancing awareness of carbon asset management and making informed investment and hedging decisions based on the correlation between the two markets is crucial."
"Environmental heat stress causes significant economic loss in the poultry industry. Therefore, interest has increased in using feed additives to reduce the negative impacts of heat stress on the chickens and improve production performance. This study aimed to assess the effect of supplementing with Nigella sativa nanoparticles (Nano-NS) as an anti-stress and growth promoter in broiler diets under hot climatic conditions. A total of 375 male one-day-old Ross 308 chicks were randomly divided into a control group and four treatment groups (75 chicks/group). The first group fed a basal diet without additives, the second group fed a basal diet supplemented with avilamycin at 50 mg/kg, and the other groups fed a basal diet supplemented with 30, 40, and 50 mg/kg Nano-NS, respectively. Despite that feed intake was not affected, feed conversion ratio, body weight gain, and crude protein digestibility improved in broilers fed Nano-NS (P < 0.05) compared with avilamycin and the control groups. Adding Nano-NS led to an increase in the dressing percentage and the relative weight of the bursa of Fabricius and thymus. Serum high-density lipoprotein levels increased while total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein concentrations decreased (P < 0.05) in broilers fed Nano-NS compared with control groups. Furthermore, Nano-NS supplementation significantly increased (P < 0.05) serum immunoglobulin (IgG and IgA), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels, while decreasing malondialdehyde (MDA), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) concentration. Moreover, there was a significant increase in the Lactobacillus population and a decrease (P < 0.05) in the E. coli and C. perfringens population in chicks fed Nano-NS. In the intestinal tissues, mucin 2 (MUC2) gene expression increased in chickens fed 50 mg/kg Nano-NS compared to other groups. It is concluded that adding Nano-NS (up to 50 mg/kg) reduced the negative effects of heat stress via enhancing growth performance, immune responses, and antioxidant status, modulating the microbial community structure, and increasing the expression of the MUC2 gene in broilers under high ambient temperature."
"Lung cancer, the leading cause of death worldwide, is associated with the highest morbidity. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for 80-85% of lung cancer cases. Advances in the domain of cancer treatment have improved the prognosis and quality of life of patients with metastatic NSCLC. Nevertheless, tumor progression or metastasis owing to treatment failure caused by primary or secondary drug resistance remains the cause of death in the majority of cases. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a vital biological process wherein epithelial cancer cells lose their inherent adhesion and transform into more invasive mesenchymal-like cells, acts as a powerful engine driving tumor metastasis. EMT can also induce immunosuppression in the tumor environment, thereby promoting cancer development and poor prognosis among patients with NSCLC. This review aims to elucidate the effect of EMT on metastasis and the tumor immune microenvironment. Furthermore, it explores the possible roles of EMT inhibition in improving the treatment efficacy of NSCLC. Targeting EMT may be an ideal mechanism to inhibit tumor growth and progression at multiple steps."
"Postoperative nutritional support in gastrointestinal cancer, including enteral nutrition (EN), parenteral nutrition (PN), and combined nutrition strategies, is vital for enhancing recovery and patient outcomes."
"This study investigated the antimicrobial efficacy of graphene, titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2NPs), and calcium oxide nanoparticles (CaONPs) against various microorganisms in dairy wastewater. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of graphene was determined to be 41.66 mg/L for Escherichia coli and 33.33 mg/L for Staphylococcus aureus, outperforming TiO2NPs and CaONPs. Additionally, graphene sheets embedded with 2.8% TiO2 (GST2.8) demonstrated superior performance in inhibiting bacterial growth compared to unmodified or other modified graphene sheets. The GST2.8 treatment significantly reduced microbial counts for S. aureus, E. coli, and mold/yeast, with the lowest observed counts being 4.85 CFU/mL, 3.00 CFU/mL, and 4.04 CFU/mL, respectively. These results suggest that graphene-based nanocomposites incorporating TiO2NPs and CaONPs hold promise as effective antimicrobial agents for wastewater treatment applications."
"This study investigated whether early cognitive assessment in children with developmental delay (DD) predicts cognitive development. We investigated the correlation between cognitive and language development in children with DD, cerebral palsy (CP), and autism spectrum disorder (ASD)."
"Drawing on developmental psychopathology and thinking about the we-mode of social cognition, we propose that historical myths - be they on the scale of the family, the nation, or an ethnic group - are an expression and function of our need to join with other minds. As such, historical myths are one cognitive technology used to facilitate social learning, the transmission of culture and the relational mentalizing that underpins social and emotional functioning."
"Rotavirus group A (RVA) is a major cause of pediatric acute gastroenteritis (AGE). Vaccination is an effective public health strategy and Angola implemented it in 2014. This hospital-based study aimed to estimate the prevalence of RVA infection and the severity of AGE in children under five years of age treated at six hospitals in Luanda Province. Between April 2021 and May 2022, 1251 fecal samples were screened by an immunochromatographic rapid test (SD Bioline). Data on socio-demographic profile, nutritional status, and clinical assessment were obtained. The association of RVA infection and AGE severity with possible risk factors was evaluated with a binary logistic regression model. Overall, the detection rate was 57.8% and girls tend to be more often infected than boys (55.2%). Infection was more common in the youngest group (1 to 6 months, 60.3%). Important sources of RVA infection were drinking water kept in tanks (57.9%) and private sanitary facilities with piped water (61%). Surprisingly, according to the Vesikari Scale score, the most severe symptoms were observed in children vaccinated with two doses (80.7%). RVA prevalence remains high despite vaccination, and further studies should address the association between infection sources and disease severity, as well as the causes underlying vaccine (un)effectiveness."
"Generalized Joint Hypermobility (GJH) offers flexibility that could enhance motor activities. However, if it leads to injury and pain, it increases functional difficulties and activity limitations. The far-reaching consequences of activity limitations and restricted participation include poor physical fitness and diminished quality of life. This study investigated whether variations in joint mobility are associated with physical activity levels, physical fitness, and overall quality of life (QoL) among children and whether these factors change over a 2-year period."
"Spondylodiscitis presents a significant diagnostic and treatment challenge to healthcare providers, with various risk factors and treatment outcomes having been identified. Malnutrition, a multifactorial condition defined by imbalance or deficiency of nutrients, is a known risk factor for various adverse events such as postoperative infection and readmissions in spine surgery. However, its impact in SD has not yet been explored. The study aims to assess the prevalence of malnutrition and hypoalbuminemia in SD patients and their impact on the 90-day-all-cause readmission and in-hospital mortality rates."
"Surgery can induce severe neuroinflammation and negative emotional symptoms, such as anxiety-like behaviour. We studied whether reactive astrocytes in the zona incerta (ZI) mediate surgery-induced anxiety in mice."
The efficacy and safety of transcervical inflatable mediastinoscopic esophagectomy (TIME) in the treatment of esophageal cancer are unclear. The objective of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TIME treatment for esophageal cancer and to compare it with thoracoscopic assisted minimally invasive esophagectomy (TAMIE) for the treatment of esophageal cancer.
"The present work describes the results for the bilateral comparison between the Secondary Standards Dosimetry Laboratories of the Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones Nucleares (SSDL-ININ), Mexico, and the pilot laboratory, the Centro de Protección e Higiene de las Radiaciones (SSDL-CPHR), Cuba, for the realization of the air kerma (${\boldsymbol{K}}_{\boldsymbol{a}}$) quantity to: (i) diagnostic X-ray (DXR) IEC 61267:2005 beam qualities: RQR 5 RQR 9, RQT 8, and RQT 9 and (ii) radiation protection (RP) ISO 4037:2019 X-ray beam qualities: N60, N100, and W60, as well S-Cs for gamma radiation. The matched and characterized reference fields are realized at SSDL-ININ with a Toshiba E7252FX X-ray tube. In all cases, the ${\boldsymbol{K}}_{\boldsymbol{a}}$ measurements are traceable to PTB, except for S-Cs, traceable to ININ. The SSDL-CPHR realizes its reference radiation beam qualities also as matched reference fields with a Pantak HF160C X-ray tube. For the S-Cs beam quality, the CPHR uses a Buchler OB6 irradiator; the ININ, a Siemens Cesagammatron. The transfer ionization chambers calibrated in the RQR and RQT qualities are an Exradin A650/DO70312; for the RQT qualities for CT, a PTW 30009/0655 and RC3CT/9217 were calibrated; and for the RP X-ray qualities, the Exradin A650/DO70312 and a PTW 32002/073 were calibrated. The ratio ${\boldsymbol{R}}_{\boldsymbol{k}}$ of the resulting calibration coefficients ${\boldsymbol{N}}_{{\boldsymbol{K}}_{\boldsymbol{a}}}$ of each SSDL of the RQR qualities are consistent within the $\boldsymbol{U}\left(\boldsymbol{k}=\mathbf{2}\right)\%$ ≤ 2.3%; for the RQT qualities, the differences are less than the $\boldsymbol{U}\left(\boldsymbol{k}=\mathbf{2}\right)\%$ ≤ 3.6%; and for the RP X-ray qualities, within the order of $\boldsymbol{U}\left(\boldsymbol{k}=\mathbf{2}\right)\%$ ≤ 3.5%. For the S-Cs quality, the ${\boldsymbol{R}}_{\boldsymbol{k}}$ is in the order of $\boldsymbol{U}\left(\boldsymbol{k}=\mathbf{2}\right)$ ≤ 3.0%. It should be noted that the ININ U's are generally larger due to the failure of the ${\boldsymbol{k}}_{\boldsymbol{TP}}$ correction factor, a brief discussion is given here. The ${\boldsymbol{E}}_{\boldsymbol{n}}$ score from ISO 17043 provides statistical support to this comparison."
"Economic performance is an important indicator of the efficiency and quality of a company's production, which is closely related to the profitability of the company and is crucial for the development of the manufacturing industry.This paper aims to develop a theoretical framework for assessing economic performance within the Chinese manufacturing industry. It achieves this by incorporating inputs, outputs, and energy consumption costs into the production function. By analyzing manufacturing data from 2000 to 2021, it quantifies the impact of various factors, including labor costs and technological advancements, on economic performance. The findings highlight technological progress as the primary driver of economic growth within the Chinese manufacturing sector. Notably, there exists a U-shaped relationship between technical progress and economic performance, suggesting nuanced dynamics at play. Contrary to expectations, the rate of change in per capita wages shows no significant positive impact on economic performance. However, technical progress in the eastern and central regions exhibits a capital bias and positively influences economic performance. Similarly, a U-shaped relationship characterizes the relationship between the western region and manufacturing industry performance. These results underscore the crucial role of technological innovation in sustaining economic performance amid challenges such as rising labor and environmental costs. Emphasizing the reliance on scientific and technological progress emerges as imperative for enhancing the industry's economic resilience and growth."
"This review will discuss heart failure, introduce a new drug finerenone, and discuss clinical studies with a focus on its effects on heart failure. Heart failure is a condition or syndrome characterized by an impairment of the pumping ability of the heart, thus no longer keeping up with the demands of the body. There are several types of heart failure; among them are heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, with mildly reduced ejection fraction and with preserved ejection fraction. Heart failure can be caused by several factors including lifestyle factors and diseases such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus and other cardiovascular diseases. Chronic kidney disease is also a risk factor of heart failure, as it leads to a state of inflammation that can impair the cardiovascular system over time. The novel nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist finerenone antagonizes the mineralocorticoid receptor and thereby decreases the amount of fibrosis and inflammation that is observed in many heart failure patients. It shows an equal tissue distribution among heart and kidney, a high affinity and selectivity for the mineralocorticoid receptor and little risk of hyperkalemia and feminization. It also exhibits a reduction in the incidence of cardiovascular outcomes among patients with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Therefore, finerenone has been proposed as a beneficial medication for reducing heart failure, especially in patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease. Further studies are to be conducted to clarify the effects of finerenone alone and in combination with other drugs."
"The life-altering effects of criminal trials necessitate providing reliable methods to distinguish adults (≥18) from minors (< 18). The present study aims to evaluate the accuracy of the third molar maturity index (I3M) introduced by Cameriere et al. (2008) in distinguishing adults from minors in the Iranian population. Panoramic radiographs of 800 Iranian individuals (400 males and 400 females) aged 14-23 were evaluated. The cut-off value of I3M=0.08 was analysed to determine whether the individual is younger or older than 18. All male or female subjects with I3M above 0.7 were below 18 years old. The cut-off value of 0.08 showed a sensitivity of 80.83% and 63.33% and a specificity of 88.12% and 93.12%, respectively, in males and females. The positive predictive values were 91.08% and 93.25%, and the negative predictive values were 75.40% and 62.87%, respectively, for males and females. The Bayes' post-test probability was 94% for females and 92% for males. 83.75% of males and 75.25% of females correctly classified as adults or minors. The most remarkable error rate occurred at 18 years old (67.5 % in females and 57.5% in males). By ROC curve analysis, the population-specific cut-off values of I3M 0.097 for males, 0.116 for females, and 0.099 regardless of sex, were acquired, which improved the sensitivity of discrimination between adults and minors (86.3%, 73.8%, and 78.1 %, respectively). The results showed that I3M is a reliable method for distinguishing between minors and adults in the Iranian population. This method provides a higher accuracy level in identifying individuals under 18 years old. Population-specific I3M cut-off values increased accuracy, sensitivity, and NPV, especially for females. The I3M method produced better results in diagnosing adult males than adult females and a higher accuracy level in identifying individuals under 18."
"Exploratory cognitive diagnosis models have been widely used in psychology, education and other fields. This paper focuses on determining the number of attributes in a widely used cognitive diagnosis model, the GDINA model. Under some conditions of cognitive diagnosis models, we prove that there exists a special structure for the covariance matrix of observed data. Due to the special structure of the covariance matrix, an estimator based on eigen-decomposition is proposed for the number of attributes for the GDINA model. The performance of the proposed estimator is verified by simulation studies. Finally, the proposed estimator is applied to two real data sets Examination for the Certificate of Proficiency in English (ECPE) and Big Five Personality (BFP)."
"Prolonged tracheal extubation time is defined as an interval ≥ 15 min from the end of surgery to extubation. An earlier study showed that prolonged extubations had a mean 12.4 min longer time from the end of surgery to operating room (OR) exit. Prolonged extubations usually (57%) were observed during OR days with > 8 h of cases and turnovers, such that longer OR times from prolonged extubation can be treated as a variable cost (i.e., each added minute incurs an expense). The current study addressed limitations of the generalizability of these earlier investigations."
"The Norwegian trauma plan was established in 2007 and renewed in 2017 defining national trauma team activation (TTA) criteria. Norwegian studies validating the performance of previous TTA protocols have found overtriage and undertriage to be out of line with the quality indicators set in the national trauma plan, but studies have not yet been published validating the new TTA protocol."
"Cardiovascular diseases, in addition to being a health problem for Chile, ranking as the second leading cause of death, also impose a significant economic burden on the country. Aiming to reduce these diseases' health and economic impact, we decided to structure a Cardiometabolic Integrated Practice Unit (UPI) at the FUSAT Clinical Hospital. Unlike the current organization of healthcare systems in Chile, a UPI is structured throughout the entire cycle of care (from promotion and prevention to rehabilitation), with a multidisciplinary team (both clinical and administrative) organized around closely related medical conditions or a set of health conditions."
"In her 2023 report to the United Nations Human Rights Council on digital innovation, technology, and the right to health, the Special Rapporteur on the right to health underscored the positive impact of the digital transformation on young people, but also noted serious concerns, calling for greater efforts to consult and engage with youth and civil society. In our study, early-career researchers from Bangladesh and Colombia collaborated within a broader international research and advocacy project to investigate how diverse young adults experience digital health and to invite their recommendations and collaborative advocacy. Researchers held focus group discussions and interviews with young adults aged 18-30 (in Bangladesh, predominantly men; in Colombia, people living with HIV, gay men, and transgender women). In both countries, young adults said the digital turn had transformed their access to sexual and reproductive health and HIV information, highlighting both the positive role of young social media influencers and the harms caused by misinformation, lack of confidentiality, and widespread stigma. They called for greater government efforts to develop digital health, including through social media platforms. We find that transnational collaborations like this one offer the potential to generate actionable insights and inform the development of rights-based digital governance."

"Cleft lip and cleft palate are among the most common congenital defects of the head. The treatment of clefts is centralized, multidisciplinary, and involves a plastic surgeon, orthodontist, anesthesiologist, clinical speech therapist, and other specialists. While the incidence of cleft lip and cleft palate remains approximately unchanged, the approach to their treatment is evolving. Modern treatment methods increasingly include 3D printing and the associated therapeutic and educational possibilities."
"Incidence of visual impairment (VI) and dyslipidemia is increasing with aging. Although good medication adherence (MA) is a crucial factor in achieving therapeutic goals for dyslipidemia, there is a paucity of studies measuring MA in the visually impaired with dyslipidemia. We investigated whether patients with VI had worse MA to dyslipidemia drugs than non-disabled people and determined the factors affecting MA among patients with VI. Data on dyslipidemia patients with VI were extracted in 2017 from the sample cohort database of the National Health Insurance Service. MA to dyslipidemia drugs was measured for two years based on the proportion of days covered (PDC). Conditional logistic regression analysis was performed to analyze the effect of VI on good MA (PDC ≥0.8). The VI group (0.860) had a larger PDC than the non-disabled group (0.850). The adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for good MA among VI vs. non-disabled individuals was statistically insignificant (1.137, 95% confidence interval:0.958-1.350). Significant factors for poor MA in the VI group were younger age (aOR for 20-39 vs. ≥75 years old: 0.124), lower income (aOR for 9-10th decile (rich) vs. 1-4th decile (poor): 1.771), shorter duration of dyslipidemia (aOR for 1-4 vs. 15 years: 0.416), having lower-level providers sas their main providers (aOR for clinics vs. general/tertiary-care hospitals: 0.545), and having mental diseases (aOR: 0.679). Patients with VI did not have worse MA than non-disabled patients taking dyslipidemia medication."
"Non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL), a more readily available and reliable lipid parameter, is unclear in its association with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Previous studies assessing the relationship between non-HDL and T2D risk remains inconsistent results. We performed a meta-analysis to systematically evaluate this association. The PubMed, EMBASE, Medline, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases were systematically searched to find articles on ""non-HDL"" and ""T2D"" from inception to December 6, 2023. A random-effects model was used to calculate the effect estimates and 95% confidence intervals. Subgroup analyses and univariate Meta-regression were performed to explore sources of heterogeneity. The main exposure and outcome were non-HDL and T2D, respectively, in the general population. A total of 8 studies included 251,672 participants who met the inclusion criteria for this study. Meta-analysis showed that higher non-HDL increased the risk of T2D compared with the lower non-HDL group (total effect size: 1.16; 95% CI 1.079-1.251, p < 0.001). Subgroup analyses and Meta-regression of the association between non-HDL and T2D were not affected by region, proportion of men, sample size, or adjustment for confounders (including BMI, hypertension, waist circumference, and family history of diabetes). Higher non-HDL may be associated with an increased risk of T2D. Large prospective cohort studies are needed to validate these findings, and further studies are required in order to elucidate the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying the association between non-HDL and T2D."
Point-of-care (POC) analysers in community settings can provide opportunistic and regular HbA1c monitoring. Community pharmacies in NHS Scotland are utilised by populations at greatest risk of type two diabetes (T2D). This study describes initial development of an HbA1c pathway using a POC analyser in community pharmacies.
"Following fracture fixation, fracture-related infection (FRI) is a common complication and requires systematic evaluation to allow for an optimal treatment strategy. A high index of suspicion is necessary for early and timely diagnosis, to diagnose occult infection, and to prevent untreated infections from worsening. Diagnosis of FRI includes evaluation based on history and clinical examination, surgical exploration, serum inflammatory markers, imaging modalities, microbiology, histopathology, and, when needed, molecular biology. FRI can be early, delayed, or late onset, and symptom presentation and the pathogenic organism may vary with each type. Key considerations during the evaluation of FRI include if the fracture has united, the onset of symptoms, the location of the infection, the stability of fixation, the quality of reduction, the quality of soft tissues, history of infection, and host physiology. Although the common treatment for early FRI includes débridement, implant retention, and antibiotics, the treatment for delayed-onset or late-onset FRI typically includes staged surgeries starting with removal of implants and antibiotic treatment."
"For patients with metal implants, computed tomography (CT) imaging results suffer from metal artifacts, which seriously affect image evaluation and even lead to misdiagnosis. Because spectral CT technology has the advantage of quantitative imaging, basis material decomposition, and so on, the current metal artifact reduction methods are utilizing spectral information to reduce metal artifacts with good results. However, they usually require projection data from multiple spectra or energy-windows, which is difficult to realize in conventional CT."

"With the growing global pet population and increased spending on veterinary care, compounded medications offer customized, often more suitable and affordable treatment options compared to the limited available veterinary medications. This research aims to understand pet owners' attitudes towards compounded medications, focusing on their challenges and needs. A total of 300 respondents from the territory of Novi Sad, province of Vojvodina, Republic of Serbia completed the questionnaire, through face-to-face interviews at veterinary clinics. Pet owners stated that the majority of companion animals were dogs (66.7%), followed by cats (22.8%). A significant portion of them received medication in the past five years (70.7%), while nearly half of them were human-approved (47.9%) out of which more than half (55%) of the pets received antimicrobials for systemic use. Although the majority of pets did not receive compounded medication (79.8%), respondents believed that both they and their pets would benefit from it. Only small fraction of respondents knew that local pharmacies had the ability to compound medications for pets (14.5%). In the era of personalized medicine, compounded medication for specialized needs play an important role providing optimum therapy for veterinary patients. However, limitations persist, including variability in formulation quality, limited regulatory oversight, and challenges in ensuring consistency in potency and stability, as well as decreased efficacy for certain drugs and the challenges related to the lack of pharmacokinetic data for some administration routes. By customizing treatments for individual veterinary patients, we can optimize antimicrobial use, reduce the selective pressure that drives resistance, and enhance patient outcomes, while acknowledging the need for careful oversight and quality control in compounding practices to ensure safety and efficacy."
"The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of taurine on skeletal muscle glycolysis in pigs. The results showed that dietary supplementation of taurine significantly reduced the activities of hexokinase (HK), phosphofructose kinase (PFK), and pyruvate kinase (PK) in finishing pigs. Meanwhile, taurine reduced the protein and mRNA expression levels of hypoxia inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) and the mRNA expression of glycolytic enzyme related genes (such as HK type II, HK Ⅱ; pyruvate kinase M2, PKM2; lactate dehydrogenase A, LDHA). In addition, taurine reduced the expression of HIF-1α, lactate content, and the expression of glycolysis related genes in porcine myotubes. These results suggest that taurine may regulate glycolysis in skeletal muscle of finishing pigs through the HIF-1α signaling pathway. To further investigate the mechanism by which taurine affects skeletal glycolysis, HIF-1α activator dimethyloxalyl glycine (DMOG) was used to treat porcine myotubes, our results showed that DMOG significantly increased the protein and mRNA expression levels of HIF-1α, lactate content, and glycolytic enzyme (HK, PFK, PK, and LDH) activity, but taurine treatment significantly inhibited this effect. Taken together, these results of in vivo and in vitro experiments revealed that taurine reduces skeletal muscle glycolysis by inhibiting HIF-1α signaling."
"Dietary restriction (DR) has been reported to be a significant intervention that influences lipid metabolism and potentially modulates the aging process in a wide range of organisms. Lipid metabolism plays a pivotal role in the regulation of aging and longevity. In this review, we summarize studies on the significant role of lipid metabolism in aging in relation to DR. As a potent intervention to slow down aging, DR has demonstrated promising effects on lipid metabolism, influencing the aging processes across various species. The current review focuses on the relationships among DR-related molecular signaling proteins such as the sirtuins, signaling pathways such as the target of rapamycin and the insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1, lipid metabolism, and aging. Furthermore, the review presents research results on diet-associated changes in cell membrane lipids and alterations in lipid metabolism caused by commensal bacteria, highlighting the importance of lipid metabolism in aging. Overall, the review explores the interplay between diet, lipid metabolism, and aging, while presenting untapped areas for further understanding of the aging process."
"Cancer is still one of the most important diseases that have a high mortality rate around the world. The management of cancer involves many procedures, which include surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. Drug resistance in cancer chemotherapy is considered one of the most important problems in clinical oncology. A good understanding of the tumorigenesis process and the mechanisms of developing chemotherapy resistance in cancer cells will help achieve significant advances in cancer treatment protocols. In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). LncRNAs are no longer just a transcriptional noise, and many investigations proved their possible roles in regulating mandatory cellular functions. A lot of newly published studies confirmed the implication of lncRNAs in the tumor formation process and the multiple drug resistance in cancer chemotherapy. The main aim of this review is to focus on the lncRNAs' functions in the cell, their possible roles in the tumor formation process, and their roles in the development of chemotherapy resistance in different cancer cells."
"Alternative food sources are crucial for the survival and reproduction of moths during nectar scarcity. Noctuid moths make a better use of fermented food sources than moths from other families, while the underlying molecular and genetic basis remain unexplored. As the fermentation progresses, yeasts lysis and the accumulation of metabolic byproducts alter the composition and the volatile release of the sugary substrates. However, it is unclear whether and how this would affect the feeding preference of moths."
"The rarity that is inherent in rare disease (RD) often means that patients and parents of children with RDs feel uniquely isolated and therefore are unprepared or unsupported in their care. To overcome this isolation, many within the RD community turn to the internet, and social media groups in particular, to gather useful information about their RDs. While previous research has shown that social media support groups are helpful for those affected by RDs, it is unclear what these groups are particularly useful or helpful for patients and parents of children with RDs."
"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease associated with the development of dementia. The hallmarks of AD neuropathology are accumulations of amyloid peptide (Aβ) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Aβ is derived from the processing of APP (amyloid beta precursor protein) by BACE1 (beta-secretase 1) and γ-secretase through an amyloidogenic pathway. However, processing of APP by ADAM10/α-secretase (ADAM metallopeptidase domain 10) enzymes through a non-amyloidogenic pathway produces soluble APP alpha (sAPPα), which has a neuroprotective effect. It has been shown that activated platelets are implicated in the pathogenesis of AD, which also increases platelet activation. Under physiological conditions, platelets regulate synaptic plasticity and increase neuronal differentiation by regulation of the inflammatory response. However, overactivated platelets contribute to the pathogenesis of AD. Activated platelets represent the main source of circulating APP and Aβ that may be involved in AD neuropathology. Therefore, there is a close relationship between AD neuropathology and activated platelets. This review discusses the potential role of platelets in the pathogenesis of AD, and how targeting of activated platelets may reduce AD neuropathology."
Nurse educators and students consider clinical learning experiences to be the best method for learning clinical judgment skills. Research on the relationship between dedicated education units (DEUs) and nursing students' clinical judgment skills is scarce. This study investigated the effects of a DEU on Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) students' clinical judgment skills.
"Cervical cancer (CESC) presents significant clinical challenges due to its complex tumor microenvironment (TME) and varied treatment responses. This study identified undifferentiated M0 macrophages as high-risk immune cells critically involved in CESC progression. Co-culture experiments further demonstrated that M0 macrophages significantly promoted HeLa cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, underscoring their pivotal role in modulating tumor cell behavior within the TME. A nine-gene prognostic model constructed from immune gene signatures highlighted CXCL8 as a key regulator of M0 macrophage behavior. Functional experiments demonstrated that CXCL8 knockdown in M0 macrophages inhibited their proliferation, shifted polarization toward an M1-dominant phenotype, and reduced tumor-promoting M2 polarization. Co-culture experiments with CXCL8-deficient M0 macrophages further revealed a suppression of HeLa cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. These findings position M0 macrophages as central regulators within the TME and suggest that targeting pathways like CXCL8 could provide novel therapeutic strategies for improving outcomes in CESC patients."

"Molariform second premolar is a rare dental anomaly where the second premolar resembles a molar in size and shape. This condition is often linked to macrodontia, a rare enlargement of teeth that disrupts dental proportions and can manifest in isolated, relative, or generalized forms. Although mandibular second premolars are more prone to morphological variability, the occurrence of bilateral molariform premolars, induced by a unique form of gemination, is exceptionally uncommon and infrequently documented, thus making this case clinically significant."
"The existence of trait coordination in roots and leaves has recently been debated, with studies reaching opposing conclusions. Here, we assessed trait coordination across twelve boreal tree species. We show that there is only partial evidence for above-belowground coordination for ""fast-slow"" economic traits across boreal tree species, i.e., while N content in leaves and roots were positively correlated, as well as dry matter content, root dry matter content and leaf N had no significant relationship. For resource acquisition traits (i.e. related to light capture and nutrient uptake) we did not find strong evidence for trait coordination, as specific root length and specific leaf area were not positively correlated. We further show that site only explained between 0 and 7% of the total trait variation, while within-site variation contributed substantially to the total trait variation for a large number of traits (1.6-96%), and more so for morphological root traits than leaf traits. This likely influences the strength of above-belowground trait coordination found across species in our study. Understanding sources of trait variation and above-belowground trait relationships can contribute to improving global and regional C cycling models. However, fine-scale environmental variability should be accounted for given its importance for driving trait variation."
"Heart failure (HF) frequently suffers from brain abnormalities and cognitive impairments. This study aims to investigate brain structure and function alteration in patients with chronic HF. This retrospective study included 49 chronic HF and 49 health controls (HCs). Voxel-based morphometry was conducted on structural MRI to quantify gray matter volume (GMV), and functional connectivity (FC) was assessed with seed-based analysis using resting-state fMRI. White matter microstructure integrity was also evaluated through tract-based spatial statistics employing DTI. Correlations between multimodal MRI features and cognitive performance were further investigated in patients with chronic HF. Patients with chronic HF exhibited significantly reduced regional GMV, white matter microstructure injury (Family wise error correction, p＜0.05), and decreased FC in multiple brain regions involved in cognition, sensorimotor, visual function (Gaussian random field correction, voxel level p＜0.0001 and cluster-level p＜0.01). There was no observed increases in GMV or FC compared with HCs. Decreased GMV showed positive correlations with cognitive performance (r = 0.025-0.577, p = 0.025-0.001), while decreased fractional anisotropy was negatively correlated with anxiety scores (r = -0.339, p = 0.040) in patients with chronic HF. This study revealed that patients with chronic HF exhibited brain structure injury affecting gray matter and white matter, as well as FC abnormalities of brain regions responsible for cognition, sensorimotor and visual function. These findings suggest GMV could serve as a neuroimaging biomarker for cognitive impairments and a potential target for neuroprotective therapies in patients with chronic HF."
"Skin and hair development is regulated by multitude of programs of activation and silencing of gene expression to maintain normal skin and hair follicle (HF) development, homeostasis, and cycling. Here, we have identified E74-like factor 5 (Elf5) transcription factor, as a novel regulator of keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation processes in skin. Expression analysis has revealed that Elf5 expression was localised and elevated in stem/progenitor cell populations of both the epidermis (basal and suprabasal) and in HF bulge and hair germ stem cell (SCs) compartments during skin and hair development and cycling. Expressional and functional analysis using RT-qPCR, western blot and colony forming assays, revealed that Elf5 plays an important role in regulating keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation processes as well as potentially determining cell fate by regulating the stem/progenitor cell populations in skin and HFs. These data will provide a platform for pharmacological manipulation of Elf5 in skin, leading to advancements in many areas of research, including stem cell, regenerative medicine, and ageing."
"Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is more common in Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Considering that ruptured AAA is potentially fatal, timely management of AAA would result in long-term survival benefits. We assess the prevalence and characteristics of AAA in resectable NSCLC patients who would benefit from AAA surveillance."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive fibrotic lung disorder characterized by dry cough, fatigue, and exacerbated dyspnea. The prognosis of IPF is notably unfavorable, becoming extremely poor when the disease advances acutely. Effective therapeutic intervention is essential to mitigate disease progression; hence, early diagnosis and treatment are paramount. When high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) reveals usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), a diagnosis of IPF can be established. However, when HRCT fails to conclusively confirm IPF, the diagnostic pathway becomes intricate and necessitates a multidisciplinary approach involving clinicians, radiologists, and pathologists. Consequently, the objective of this study was to investigate new diagnostic approaches through bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) analysis."
"This study aimed to investigate the impact of different offensive-reward-related rules on the physical performance, perceived exertion and enjoyment of young basketball players during small-sided games (SSG). Eighteen youth male players (age: 13.3±0.9y; height: 167.0±13.1cm; weight: 50.6±11.5kg; years of practice: 3.1±1.2y) participated in three distinct 3x3 SSG (14x15m pitch) experimental conditions: i) 3x3NORMAL, regular 3x3 game; ii) 3x3POINT-POSS, where the team in possession was rewarded a new ball possession after scoring; iii) 3x3PASSES, where the score was determined by the number of passes made before converting a basket. Players' performance was measured using global positioning systems, rating of perceived exertion and the Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale. Players covered more distance for total (p< .001), low (p< .01) and moderate-speed distance (p< .05), and presented a higher game pace (p< .001) during the 3x3POINT-POSS than in the other conditions. A higher number of accelerations (1-1.99 m·s-2, p < .01) and decelerations (>2 m·s-2, p < .01) were also reported in the 3x3POINT-POSS. Despite the higher external load in the 3x3POINT-POSS, players reported higher perceived exertion during the 3x3PASSES (small to moderate effects). In addition, players reported the 3x3POINT-POSS as being more enjoyfull than the 3x3NORMAL. In conclusion, coaches may consider incorporating the 3x3POINT-POSS to enhance players' external load while simultaneously increasing enjoyment and decreasing perceived exertion. Conversely, the 3x3PASSES condition may be useful for promoting adaptive behaviors under a higher perception of effort. Thus, coaches should carefully choose the type of rewards when designing training tasks for youth basketball players."

"The inflammasome plays multifaceted roles in cancer, but less is known about its function during premalignancy upon initial cell transformation. We report a homeostatic function of the inflammasome in suppressing malignant transformation through Ras inhibition. We identified increased hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) proliferation within the bone marrow of inflammasome-deficient mice. HSCs within an inflammasome-deficient stroma expressed a Ras signature associated with increased Ras pathway- and cancer-related transcripts and heightened levels of cytokine, chemokine and growth factor receptors. Stromal inflammasome deficiency established a poised Ras-dependent mitogenic state within HSCs, which fueled progeny B cell lymphomagenesis upon Myc deregulation in a spontaneous model of B cell lymphoma, and shortened its premalignant stage leading to faster onset of malignancy. Thus, the stromal inflammasome preserves tissue balance by restraining Ras to disrupt the most common oncogenic Myc-Ras cooperation and establish a natural defense against transition to malignancy. These findings should inform preventative therapies against hematological malignancies."
"With an ageing world population and increasing prevalence, heart failure is increasingly frequent as a comorbidity in operative patients, and its accurate preoperative diagnosis is essential to improve postoperative prognosis in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery. Use of electronic health records to assist in the accuracy of diagnosis and definition of an adjudicated heart failure reference standard could help guide intraoperative practice and improve outcomes in patients with heart failure."
"Mutations or loss of function of DJ-1 and Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) infection has been linked to neurodegenerative diseases, which are often caused by oxidative stress. However, the relationship between DJ-1 and T. gondii infection is not yet fully understood. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the expression of DJ-1 in the hippocampus tissue of mice or in HT22 infected with T. gondii Chinese 1 genotype Wh3 strain (TgCtwh3) and the effect of DJ-1 knockdown on neuronal apoptosis induced by TgCtwh3 tachyzoite, as well as the underlying mechanism at the cellular and molecular level. Firstly, we detected DJ-1 protein expression and cell apoptosis in the hippocampal tissue of mice infected by TgCtwh3. Then, we examined DJ-1 expression and apoptosis in HT22 challenged with TgCtwh3. Finally, we evaluated the apoptosis in HT22 with DJ-1 knockdown which was infected with TgCtwh3 and assayed the expression of NF-κBp65 and p-NF-κBp65. Our results showed that DJ-1 expression was reduced and neurons underwent apoptosis in the hippocampus of mice infected with TgCtwh3 tachyzoites. Additionally, the knockdown of DJ-1 followed by infection with TgCtwh3 tachyzoites led to increased apoptosis in HT22 cells through the NF-κB signaling pathway. Therefore, this study suggests that DJ-1 is an important target for preventing apoptosis caused by T. gondii TgCtwh3."
"Urinary tract infections (UTIs) frequently occur in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), presenting a complex pathogenesis that significantly impairs patient quality of life. Despite the availability of various clinical treatments, challenges remain regarding their efficacy and safety. Therefore, this retrospective study aimed to observe the therapeutic effects of Re-Lin-Qing granules in treating T2DM complicated by UTIs, aiming to provide more scientifically validated and effective treatment options for clinical practice."
"Pipeline embolization device (PED) placement for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms is safe and effective under general anesthesia (GA). However, GA is associated with certain risks, longer procedural time, and higher hospital cost.

"In the last years, a dramatic increase in colorectal cancer (CRC) diagnoses in early-onset (EO) patients has been observed. The prognosis of EO-CRC compared to late-onset (LO) patients is still unclear. This meta-analysis aims to clarify whether there is any difference in the prognosis between the two groups."
"We evaluated the liver transplantation (LT) criteria in acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF), incorporating an urgent living-donor LT (LDLT) program. Critically ill patients with a Chronic Liver Failure Consortium (CLIF-C) ACLF score (CLIF-C_ACLF_score) ≥65, previously considered unsuitable for LT, were included to explore the excess mortality threshold of the CLIF-C_ACLF_score (CLIF-C_ACLF_score_threshold). We followed 854 consecutive patients with ACLF (276 ACLF grade 2 and 215 ACLF grade 3) over 10 years among 4432 LT recipients between 2008 and 2019. For advanced ACLF patients without immediate deceased-donor (DD) allocation, an urgent LDLT program was expedited. The CLIF-C_ACLF_score_threshold was determined by the metrics of transplant survival benefit: >60% 1-year and >50% 5-year survival rate. In predicting post-LT mortality, the CLIF-C_ACLF_score outperformed the (model for end-stage liver disease-sodium) MELD-Na and (model for end-stage liver disease) MELD-3.0 scores but was comparable to the Sundaram ACLF-LT-mortality score. A CLIF-C_ACLF_score ≥65 (n = 54) demonstrated posttransplant survival benefits, with 1-year and 5-year survival rates of 66.7% and 50.4% (P < .001), respectively. Novel CLIF-C_ACLF_score_threshold for 1-year and 5-year mortalities was 70 and 69, respectively. A CLIF-C_ACLF_score-based nomogram for predicting survival probabilities, integrating cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and donor type (LDLT vs DDLT), was generated. This study suggests reconsidering the criteria for unsuitable LT with a CLIF-C_ACLF_score ≥65. Implementing a timely salvage LT strategy, and incorporating urgent LDLT, can enhance survival rates."
"The study developed octenyl succinylated (OS) potato starch complexes with ethanolic extracts of honey bee products (HBE) and assess their effects on starch-based films properties. X-ray diffraction and thermogravimetric analysis showed that OS starch films had lower crystallinity and higher thermal stability than native ones. Adding HBE enhanced V-type ordering in OS films. Starch esterification raised the water contact angle (WCA) from 52.9° to 62.3°, with hydrophobicity improvements when HBE was added (WCA >78.9°). OS starch-HBE complexes increased the antioxidant properties compared to non-modified starch films, in the order: propolis > bee bread > bee pollen > buckwheat honey > multiflower honey. The sum of individual phenolic compounds (IPC) in OS starch films was significantly higher compared to native counterparts, showing increases of 35 %, 83 % and 20 % for films with bee pollen, bee bread, and propolis, respectively. The latter film exhibited the highest IPC, totaling 2204.4 mg/100 g. While OS starch did not affect the antimicrobial properties of the films, the incorporation of HBE significantly improved their ability to bacterial inhibition, with propolis showing the strongest effect. Despite reduced optical and sensory properties of OS films, OS starch complexes with bee bread and propolis show great potential for food packaging."
"As a unicellular eukaryote, the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae strikes a unique balance between biological complexity and experimental tractability, serving as a long-standing classic model for both basic and applied studies. Recently, S. cerevisiae further emerged as a leading system for studying natural diversity of genome evolution and its associated functional implication at population scales. Having high-quality comparative and functional genomics data are critical for such efforts. Here, we exhaustively expanded the telomere-to-telomere (T2T) S. cerevisiae reference assembly panel (ScRAP) that we previously constructed for 142 strains to cover high-quality genome assemblies and annotations of 264 S. cerevisiae strains from diverse geographical and ecological niches and also 33 outgroup strains from all the other Saccharomyces species complex. We created a dedicated online database, ScRAPdb (https://www.evomicslab.org/db/ScRAPdb/), to host this expanded pangenome collection. Furthermore, ScRAPdb also integrates an array of population-scale pan-omics atlases (pantranscriptome, panproteome and panphenome) and extensive data exploration toolkits for intuitive genomics analyses. All curated data and downstream analysis results can be easily downloaded from ScRAPdb. We expect ScRAPdb to become a highly valuable platform for the yeast community and beyond, leading to a pan-omics understanding of the global genetic and phenotypic diversity."

"There is a growing concern that digital health care may exacerbate existing health disparities. Digital health care or eHealth encompasses the digital apps that are used in health care. Differences in access, use, and perceived benefits of digital technology among socioeconomic groups are commonly referred to as the digital divide. Current research shows that people in lower socioeconomic positions (SEPs) use eHealth less frequently."
"The Hog1 stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) is a key mediator of stress resistance and virulence in Candida albicans. Hog1 activation via phosphorylation of the canonical TGY motif is mediated by the Pbs2 MAPKK, which itself is activated by the Ssk2 MAPKKK. Although this three-tiered SAPK signalling module is well characterised, it is unclear how Hog1 activation is regulated in response to different stresses. Functioning upstream of the Ssk2 MAPKKK is a two-component related signal transduction system comprising three sensor histidine kinases, a phosphotransfer protein Ypd1, and a response regulator Ssk1. Here, we report that Ssk1 is a master regulator of the Hog1 SAPK that promotes stress resistance and Hog1 phosphorylation in response to diverse stresses, except high osmotic stress. Notably, we find Ssk1 regulates Hog1 in a two-component independent manner by functioning to promote interactions between the Ssk2 and Pbs2 kinases. We propose this function of Ssk1 is important to maintain a basal level of Hog1 phosphorylation which is necessary for oxidative stress, but not osmotic stress, mediated Hog1 activation. We find that osmotic stress triggers robust Pbs2 phosphorylation which drives its dissociation from Ssk2. In contrast, Pbs2 is not robustly phosphorylated following oxidative stress and the Ssk1-mediated Ssk2-Pbs2 interaction remains intact. Instead, oxidative stress-stimulated increases in phosphorylated Hog1 is dependent on the inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphatases that negatively regulate Hog1 coupled with the Ssk1-mediated promotion of basal Hog1 activity. Furthermore, we find that inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphatases is linked to the hydrogen peroxide induced oxidation of these negative regulators in a mechanism that is partly dependent on thioredoxin. Taken together these data reveal stress contingent changes in Hog1 pathway architecture and regulation and uncover a novel mode of action of the Ssk1 response regulator in SAPK regulation."
"Hexokinase (HK) deficiency is a rare autosomal recessively inherited disease manifested by chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia. Most patients present with a mild to severe course of the disease (fetal hydrocephalus, neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, severe anemia). We reviewed 37 cases of patients with hexokinase deficiency described so far, focusing on the severity of the disease, clinical presentation, treatment applied, and genetic test results."
"Demyelinating diseases including multiple sclerosis (MS) are chronic inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system. Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 2 (Ido2) is a recently identified as catalytic enzyme involved in the rate-limiting step of the tryptophan-kynurenine pathway that influences susceptibility to inflammatory diseases. However, the pathological role of Ido2 in demyelination remains unclear. In this study, we investigated whether Ido2 deficiency influences the pathogenesis of proteolipid protein transgenic (Plp tg) mice, an animal model of chronic demyelination. Ido2 deficiency exacerbates impairments of motor function in the locomotor activity test, wire hanging test, and rotarod test. Ido2 deficiency caused severe demyelination associated with CD68-positive microglial activation in Plp tg mice. In the cerebellum of Plp tg mice, Ido2 deficiency significantly increased the expression of Tnfα. Ido2 deficiency reduced tryptophan metabolite kynurenine (KYN) levels and subsequent aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) activity, which play an important role in anti-inflammatory response. These results suggest that Ido2 has an important role in preventing demyelination through AhR. Taken together, Ido2 could be a potential therapeutic target for demyelinating diseases."
Muscle fatigue is a risk factor for injuries in athletes and workers. This brings relevance to the study of this biochemical process to allow for its identification and prevention. This paper presents a novel dataset for muscle fatigue analysis comprising surface electromyography data from upper-limbs and the subject's self-perceived fatigue level. This dataset contains 13 h and 20 min of data from 13 participants performing a total of 12 upper-limb dynamic movements (8 uni-articular and 4 complex/compound). This dataset may contribute to the testing of new fatigue detection algorithms and analysis of the underlying mechanisms.
"Trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) is an antibody-drug conjugate targeting HER2-positive gastric cancer or gastroesophageal junction cancer (GC/GEJC).

"Alternative splicing (AS) is a crucial mechanism to regulate gene expression and protein complexity. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play an important role in regulating abnormal alternative splicing in cancers. However, few resources are available to identify specific RBPs responsible for regulating individual AS event. We have developed the OncoSplicing database for integrative analysis of clinically relevant alternative splicing events in TCGA cancers. Here, we further updated the OncoSplicing database by performing correlation analysis between the splicing and mRNA expression data from the TCGA cancers or GTEx tissues, mapping known RNA-binding motifs and eCLIP-seq peaks to all AS events, conducting splicing analysis for RNA-seq data from RBP perturbation experiments in the ENCODE project, and integrating exon and intron sequences for each AS event. With this updated database, users can easily identify potential RBPs responsible for the queried AS event and obtain sequences to design AS-specific primers and minigene constructs for experiment validation. Overall, compared to the previous version, the substantially updated OncoSplicing database (www.oncosplicing.com) offers a more valuable resource for users to identify RBPs responsible for regulating alternative splicing events in cancers."
"Universal salt iodisation (USI) plays an essential role in the provision of iodine (I) to populations worldwide. Countries adopting USI programmes, adhering to strict criteria laid down by expert organisations such as the Iodine Global Network, are estimated to have reduced the prevalence of I deficiency by 75% (protecting 720 million individuals worldwide). Despite this success, doubts have been raised as to the desirability of continuing such programmes because of (a) the need to reduce salt intake for cardiovascular prevention and (b) the induction of thyroid autoimmunity. We present current evidence from cross-sectional studies in several disparate populations of the possible short-term modulation of thyroid autoimmune markers, thyroid peroxidase (TPOAb) and thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAb), with minimal disruption of biochemical thyroid function. We also present evidence from longer term, mainly cross-sectional studies, that indicate a reduction in the prevalence of TPOAb and TgAb, and the persistence of normal biochemical thyroid function over as long as two decades of USI. We believe these studies indicate that USI is safe, and that long-term salt iodisation does not cause an increase in autoimmune thyroid disease in the populations studied and should not be a safety concern based on current evidence. More long-term and better-designed studies are required."
"Prostate cancer is a disease which poses an interesting clinical question: Should it be treated? Only a small subset of prostate cancers are aggressive and require removal and treatment to prevent metastatic spread. However, conventional diagnostics remain challenged to risk-stratify such patients; hence, new methods of approach to biomolecularly sub-classify the disease are needed. Here we use an unsupervised self-organising map approach to analyse live-cell Raman spectroscopy data obtained from prostate cell-lines; our aim is to exemplify this method to sub-stratify, at the single-cell-level, the cancer disease state using high-dimensional datasets with minimal preprocessing. The results demonstrate a new sub-clustering of the prostate cancer cell-line into two groups-protein-rich and lipid-rich sub-cellular components-which we believe to be mechanistically linked. This finding shows the potential for unsupervised machine learning to discover distinct disease-state features for more accurate characterisation of highly heterogeneous prostate cancer. Applications may lead to more targeted diagnoses, prognoses and clinical treatment decisions via molecularly-informed stratification that would benefit patients. A method that could discover distinct disease-state features that are mechanistically linked could also assist in the development of more effective broad-spectrum treatments that simultaneously target linked disease-state processes."
"The aroma changes of stir-fried shredded potatoes (SFSP) were investigated using thermal desorption combined with sensory evaluation and chemometrix analysis. The intensity of the sauce aroma, savory, fatty, and roasty attributes were significantly increased, while the intensity of beany and green attributes were significantly (p < 0.001) inhibited after soy sauce added. Ninety-nine aroma compounds were detected in SFSPs, and aldehydes were the most abundant (relative concentration ratio, 59.18 %-88.80 %). The pH value changes confirmed that soy sauce increased the aroma variances by migration but decreased the total aroma content due to the high oxidation inhibition of unsaturated fatty acids. Eleven aroma compounds contributing to aroma attribute variances were confirmed by partial least squares analysis and aroma-change pattern analysis. Addition test further verified that β-pinene, acetic acid, methanethiol, methional, limonene, 2-acetylpyrrole, ethyl acetate, 1-pentanol, dimethyl trisulfide, dimethyl disulfide, and phenylethanol played a key role in promoting the aroma profiles of SFSP."
"Arabidopsis thaliana, particularly the ecotype Columbia-0 (Col-0), has been extensively employed in the study of genetics of the nuclear genome. However, the difficulty of modifying the plastid genome of Col-0, the most widely used ecotype, has hindered investigation of the functional interactions between nuclear-encoded and plastid-encoded genes in this ecotype. Recently, we achieved targeted base editing, substituting a specific C:G pair with a T:A pair in the plastid genome of Col-0 through the application of genome-editing technology. This article introduces the method employed to accomplish this targeted base editing. The process involves four steps: (i) designing and constructing a binary vector encoding the genome-editing enzyme, (ii) introducing the binary vector into the nuclear genome of Col-0 via floral dipping, (iii) identifying base-edited plants, and (iv) verifying inheritance of the edited base(s) by the next generation. © 2025 The Author(s). Current Protocols published by Wiley Periodicals LLC. Basic Protocol 1: Design and construction of a binary vector encoding ptpTALECD or ptpTALECD_v2 Basic Protocol 2: Agrobacterium-mediated introduction of a binary vector into the Arabidopsis nuclear genome Basic Protocol 3: Selection of plants harboring T-DNA in the nucleus and detection of base editing in the plastid genome."
"Schizophrenia (SZ) is a complex, chronic mental disorder characterized by positive symptoms (such as delusions and hallucinations), negative symptoms (including anhedonia, alogia, avolition, and social withdrawal), and cognitive deficits (affecting attention, processing speed, verbal and visuospatial learning, problem-solving, working memory, and mental flexibility). Extensive animal and clinical studies have emphasized the NMDAR hypofunction hypothesis of SZ. Glycine plays a crucial role as an agonist of NMDAR, enhancing the receptor's affinity for glutamate and supporting normal synaptic function and plasticity, that is, signal transmission between neurons. In the absence of glycine or any other co-agonists (serine and D-cycloserine), NMDAR responsiveness to glutamate decreases, reducing its likelihood to open and allow ion flow, which leads to impaired synaptic plasticity and neurotransmission. Current antipsychotic treatments are severely limited, as they only address positive symptoms, can lead to significant neurological and metabolic side effects such as sexual dysfunction, and are effective in only about half of SZ patients. Similarly, direct glycine-site modulators have shown considerable side-effects due to high-dose usage, such as nausea, nephrotoxicity, anxiety, depression, and hyperexcitability resulting from the external administration of glycine, serine, and D-cycloserine. To this effect, the current study considers glycine-like compounds with improved BBB permeability directly targeting the Glycine modulatory site (GMS). A thorough evaluation encompassing ADMET analysis, virtual screening, and molecular dynamics was used to screen the glycine-like library. Data collected revealed Compound_8, Compound_15, and Compound_945 as promising agonists. Further experimental validation is needed to confirm their preclinical relevance as SZ treatment."
"The efficacy of dance in reducing fall risks among older adults highlights its potential for geriatric health, but the optimal dance style remains uncertain.

"Neurodegeneration, which manifests as several chronic and incurable diseases, is an age-related condition that affects the central nervous system (CNS) and poses a significant threat to the public's health for the elderly. Recent decades have experienced an alarming increase in the incidence of neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs), a severe public health issue due to the ongoing development of people living in modern civilizations. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading trigger of age-related dementia. Currently, there are no efficient therapeutics to delay, stop, or reverse the disease's course development. Several studies found that dietary bioactive phytochemicals, primarily flavonoids, influence the pathophysiological processes underlying AD. Flavonoids work well as a supplement to manufactured therapies for NDDs. Flavonoids are effective in complementing synthetic approaches to treat NDDs. They are biologically active phytochemicals with promising pharmacological activities, for instance, antiviral, anti-allergic, antiplatelet, anti-inflammatory, antitumor, anti-apoptotic, and antioxidant effects. The production of nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), and oxidative stress (OS) are downregulated by flavonoids, which slow the course of AD. Hence, this research turned from preclinical evidence to feasible clinical applications to develop newer therapeutics, focusing on the therapeutic potential of flavonoids against AD."
"Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a rare type of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that commonly presents with constitutional symptoms, lymphadenopathy, and laboratory abnormalities. Although less common, extranodal involvement of MCL may be seen at initial presentation and most commonly occurs in the spleen, liver, bone marrow, and gastrointestinal tract. Adrenal involvement in MCL is extremely rare, and only a few cases have been reported in the literature. Herein, we present 18 F-FDG PET/CT and 68 Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT findings of a unique case of primary extranodal MCL with gastric and adrenal involvement."

"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) poses a significant threat to human health, with its incidence and mortality rates increasing annually. This study investigated the hypoglycemic effects and underlying mechanisms of pure Hovenia dulcis (Guaizao) polysaccharide (HDPs-2A) in rats subjected to a high-fat and high-sugar diet combined with streptozotocin-induced T2DM. Oral administration of HDPs-2A resulted in significant increases in body weight and liver glycogen levels compared to untreated controls. Moreover, a reduction in fasting blood glucose levels, alleviation of hyperinsulinemia, enhanced glucose tolerance, and improved insulin resistance were observed in the HDPs-2A-treated group. HDPs-2A also effectively reversed diabetes-induced dyslipidemia, as evidenced by decreased total cholesterol and triglyceride levels, alongside increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Histopathological analyses confirmed that HDPs-2A partially repaired liver tissue damage by mitigating oxidative stress responses in the liver. Additionally, treatment with HDPs-2A significantly elevated short-chain fatty acid levels in T2DM rats. Real-time quantitative PCR and Western blot analyses indicated that HDPs-2A significantly enhanced the expression of InsR, IRS2, PI3K, Akt, and GLUT4, suggesting that HDPs-2A regulates insulin resistance and glycometabolism through the activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Furthermore, HDPs-2A appeared to modulate the expression of GS, GSK-3β, and FoxO1 to improve glucose metabolism and reduce insulin resistance. It also improved glucose metabolism by activating the AMPK pathway and modulating G6Pase and PEPCK expression. This study provides novel insights into the antidiabetic effects of HDPs, positioning them as promising nutritional agents for the management of T2DM."
The impact of antibiotics (ATBs) on the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) recurrence after curative resection remains unknown.
"Alterations of plasma lipoprotein levels and oxidative stress are frequently observed in obese patients, including low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (HDL-C) levels and alterations of HDL composition. Dysfunctional HDL with lower antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties have also been demonstrated in obesity. There is increasing evidence that white adipose tissue (WAT) participates in several metabolic activities and modulates HDL-C levels and function. In obese subjects, the changes in morphology and function of adipose tissue lead to impaired regulatory function and are associated with a state of low-grade chronic inflammation, with increased release of pro-inflammatory adipokines and cytokines. These alterations may affect HDL metabolism and functions; thus, adipose tissue is considered a potential target for the prevention and treatment of obesity. A cornerstone of obesity prevention and therapy is lifestyle modification through dietary changes, which is reflected in the modulation of plasma lipoprotein metabolism. Some dietary components and metabolites directly affect the composition and structure of HDL and modulate its anti-inflammatory and vasoprotective properties. The aims of the review are to summarize the crosstalk between adipocytes and HDL dysfunction in human obesity and to highlight recent discoveries on beneficial dietary patterns as well as nutritional components on inflammation and HDL function in human obesity."

"Cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy often experience anorexia and weight loss that substantially deteriorates overall health, reduces treatment tolerance and quality of life, and worsens oncologic outcomes. There are currently few effective therapeutic options to mitigate these side effects. The central melanocortin system, which plays a pivotal role in regulating appetite and energy homeostasis, presents a logical target for treating anorexia and weight loss. In this preclinical study, we evaluated the efficacy of TCMCB07, a synthetic antagonist of the melanocortin-4 receptor, in mitigating anorexia and weight loss in several rat models of chemotherapy: cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and a combination of irinotecan and 5-fluorouracil. Our results indicate that peripheral administration of TCMCB07 improved appetite, stabilized body weight, preserved fat and heart mass, and slightly protected lean mass after multiple cycles of chemotherapy. Furthermore, combining TCMCB07 with a growth differentiation factor 15 antibody enhanced treatment effectiveness. Similar effects from TCMCB07 treatment were observed in a rat tumor model following combination chemotherapy. No notable adverse effects nor increased chemotherapy-related toxicities were observed with TCMCB07 treatment. These findings suggest that peripheral administration of TCMCB07 holds promise as a therapeutic approach for alleviating chemotherapy-induced anorexia and weight loss, potentially benefiting numerous patients undergoing chemotherapy."
"The rise in global life expectancy has led to an increase in the older population, presenting significant challenges in managing infectious diseases. Aging affects the innate and adaptive immune systems, resulting in chronic low-grade inflammation (inflammaging) and immune function decline (immunosenescence). These changes would impair defense mechanisms, increase susceptibility to infections and reduce vaccine efficacy in older adults. Cellular senescence exacerbates these issues by releasing pro-inflammatory factors, further perpetuating chronic inflammation. Moreover, comorbidities, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes, which are common in older adults, amplify immune dysfunction, while immunosuppressive medications further complicate responses to infections. This review explores the molecular and cellular mechanisms driving inflammaging and immunosenescence, focusing on genomic instability, telomere attrition, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Additionally, we discussed how aging-associated immune alterations influence responses to bacterial, viral, and parasitic infections and evaluated emerging antiaging strategies, aimed at mitigating these effects to improve health outcomes in the aging population."
"Sutures are the most commonly used wound repair method after surgery. However, addressing delayed recovery and pain management remains a significant challenge. Here, microfibers are developed from microfluidic spinning with long-lasting analgesia capabilities for sutures. By using a solvent extraction manner, the polycaprolactone (PCL) microfibers encapsulated with ropivacaine (ROP), a well-known analgesic, can be continuously obtained from microfluidics. The intrinsic property of PCL and the advantage of microfluidic spinning technique impart the microfiber with highly controlled morphologies, mechanical strengths, as well as drug release. After exploring their biocompatibility both at in vitro and in vivo levels, the microfibers are directly applied to wound suture. The results demonstrate the lasting analgesic effect of the microfiber on mice with incision pain, highlighting its potential as promising suture for post-surgery treatments. It is anticipated that the multifunctional analgesic sutures produced through microfluidic spinning will pave the way for utilizing fibers as effective sutures in clinical incision wound treatment."
"Alzheimer's Disease is a degenerative neurological condition which leads to a decline in memory and cognitive function. Chlorogenic Acid (CGA) presents properties including neuroprotective, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory. The aim of this study was to examine the impact of CGA on cognitive impairments, neuroinflammation and neuronal damage in mice submitted to an experimental model of Sporadic Alzheimer Disease (SAD) induced by intracerebroventricular administration of streptozotocin (ICV-STZ). Male Swiss mice received bilateral ICV-STZ injections (3 mg/Kg) on days 1 and 3. The treatment with CGA (5 mg/Kg, orally) or vehicle (water, orally), was initiated and continued for 26 days, starting 2 h after the second induction procedure. At first, there was no change in serum glucose levels after SAD induction. ICV-STZ induces impairments in aversive, recognition, and spatial memory, while CGA treatment significantly alleviated these memory deficits. Furthermore, locomotor activity, working memory, and anxiety-related activities remained unaffected by the treatments. CGA treatment protects against ICV-STZ-induced increase in the nitrite/nitrate and TBARS levels. ICV-STZ induced a reduction in viable cells, depletion of BDNF, and triggered astrogliosis and microgliosis in the cortex and hippocampus. Treatment with CGA preserves viable cell count in the prefrontal cortex, CA1, and CA3 regions of the hippocampus. Additionally, it prevented BDNF depletion in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus (CA1, CA3, and DG regions), and mitigated astrogliosis and microgliosis in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus (CA1, CA3, and DG regions). These findings indicate the neuroprotective effects of CGA, underscoring their potential as therapeutic agents or adjuncts in the treatment of SAD."
"Acromegaly is a disease characterized by enhanced bone turnover with persistently high vertebral fracture risk. Sclerostin is a glycoprotein, which acts as an inhibitor of bone formation and activates osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. The osteoprotegerin (OPG)/receptor activator for the nuclear factor κ B ligand (RANK-L) system is crucial for controlling bone metabolism."
"This review documents the importance of postoperative interventions that accelerate the functional recovery of the thoracic surgical patient. Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) pathways aim to mitigate the harmful surgical stress response. Improvements to the entire patient pathway, by removing unnecessary care elements while introducing evidence-based interventions, have synergistic effects. At the same time, some key care elements appear to be more important than others, including early removal of chest tubes, early mobilization, and the limited use of opioids. These care elements are all intertwined. The goals of early mobilization and opioid-sparing analgesia are more readily achieved once a chest tube has been removed. A focus on achieving these goals earlier, including on the day of surgery, may benefit a patient's recovery further. The result is superior patient outcomes including a quicker restoration of normal function, fewer complications, reduced opioid requirements, reduced costs, and a shorter length of stay."
"People living with HIV (PLHIV) often face increased vulnerability due to factors like social isolation and reduced resilience. These factors can negatively impact health outcomes, quality of life, and well-being for both PLHIV and their families. Therefore, healthcare providers should carefully assess these variables when providing care for PLHIV. This study evaluated the levels of resilience and social isolation among PLHIV."
"Mixed signal analog/digital neuromorphic circuits represent an ideal medium for reproducing bio-physically realistic dynamics of biological neural systems in real-time. However, similar to their biological counterparts, these circuits have limited resolution and are affected by a high degree of variability. By developing a recurrent spiking neural network model of the retinocortical visual pathway, we show how such noisy and heterogeneous computing substrate can produce linear receptive fields tuned to visual stimuli with specific orientations and spatial frequencies. Compared to strictly feed-forward schemes, the model generates highly structured Gabor-like receptive fields of any phase symmetry, making optimal use of the hardware resources available in terms of synaptic connections and neuron numbers. Experimental results validate the approach, demonstrating how principles of neural computation can lead to robust sensory processing electronic systems, even when they are affected by high degree of heterogeneity, e.g., due to the use of analog circuits or memristive devices."
"Care transitions are complex and can make patients vulnerable to adverse events. Poor communication among clinicians, patients, and their caregivers is a critical gap during these periods of transition. Technology solutions such as platform-based patient-clinician digital health interventions (DHIs) can provide support and education to patients."
"Biosensing plays a vital role in healthcare monitoring, disease detection, and treatment planning. In recent years, nanofluidic technology has been increasingly explored to be developed into lab-on-a-chip biosensing systems. Given now the possibility of fabricating geometrically defined nanometric channels that are commensurate with the size of many biomolecules, nanofluidic-based devices are likely to become a key technology for the analysis of various clinical biomarkers, including DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and proteins in liquid biopsies. This review summarizes the fundamentals and technological advances of nanofluidics from the purview of single-molecule analysis, detection of low-abundance molecules, and single-cell analysis at the subcellular level. The extreme confinement and dominant surface charge effects in nanochannels provide unique advantages to nanofluidic devices for the manipulation and transport of target biomarkers. When coupled to a microfluidic network to facilitate sample introduction, integrated micro-nanofluidic biosensing devices are proving to be more sensitive and specific in molecular analysis compared to conventional assays in many cases. Based on recent progress in nanofluidics and current clinical trends, the review concludes with a discussion of near-term challenges and future directions for the development of nanofluidic-based biosensing systems toward enabling a new wave of lab-on-a-chip technology for personalized and preventive medicine."
"Multiple artificial intelligence systems have been created to facilitate accurate and prompt histopathological diagnosis of tumors using hematoxylin-eosin-stained slides. We aimed to investigate whether weakly supervised deep learning can aid in glioma diagnosis. We analyzed 472 whole slide images (WSIs) from 226 patients in West China Hospital (WCH) and 1604 WSIs from 880 patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We utilized the OpenSlide library to load WSIs, segmented them into small patches using the DeepZoom module, and then normalized the color using the Reinhard method. A weakly supervised deep learning model was developed using ResNet-50 combined with an attention mechanism. We investigated the performance of the model by calculating area under the curve (AUC) in a ten-fold cross-validation setting. Heatmap visualizations showed the prediction mechanism of the model. The results were promising, with high AUC values for differentiating grades of astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas, all gliomas, and glioma types in the TCGA dataset (0.9419, 0.8659, 0.9904, and 0.9298, respectively), and in the WCH cohort (0.9048, 0.7423, 0.9510, and 0.7098, respectively). The model demonstrated a strong ability to infer IDH status in the TCGA dataset (AUC = 0.9488). The weakly supervised deep learning model proved to be an effective and reliable tool for neuropathological diagnosis, making it an attractive auxiliary tool."

"Mutations in the ANXA11 gene, encoding an RNA-binding protein, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but the underlying in vivo mechanisms remain unclear. This study examines the clinical features of ALS patients harboring the ANXA11 hotspot mutation p.P36R, characterized by late-onset motor neuron disease and occasional multi-system involvement. To elucidate the pathogenesis, we developed a knock-in mouse model carrying the p.P36R mutation. In both heterozygous and homozygous mutant mice, ANXA11 protein levels were comparable to those in wild-type. Both groups exhibited late-onset motor dysfunction at approximately 10 months of age, with similar survival rates to wild-type (> 24 months) and no signs of dementia. Pathological analysis revealed early abnormal aggregates in spinal cord motor neurons, cortical neurons, and muscle cells of homozygous mice. From 2 months of age, we observed mislocalized ANXA11 aggregates, SQSTM1/p62-positive inclusions, and cytoplasmic TDP-43 mislocalization, which intensified with disease progression. Importantly, mutant ANXA11 co-aggregated with TDP-43 and SQSTM1/p62-positive inclusions. Electron microscopy of the gastrocnemius muscle uncovered myofibrillar abnormalities, including sarcomeric disorganization, Z-disc dissolution, and subsarcolemmal electron-dense structures within autophagic vacuoles. Autophagic flux, initially intact at 2 months, was impaired by 9 months, as evidenced by decreased Beclin-1 and LC3BII/I levels and increased SQSTM1/p62 expression, coinciding with mTORC1 hyperactivation. Significant motor neuron loss and neuroinflammation were detected by 9 months, with marked muscle dystrophy apparent by 12 months compared to wild-type controls. These findings implicate the gain-of-function ANXA11 mutation drives late-onset motor neuron disease by early presymptomatic proteinopathy, progressive neuronal degeneration, neuroinflammation, and autophagic dysfunction."

"Understanding how inflammatory cytokines influence profibrogenic wound healing responses in fibroblasts is important for understanding the pathogenesis of fibrosis. TNF-α and IL-13 are key cytokines in Th1 and Th2 immune responses, respectively, while TGF-β1 is the principal pro-fibrotic mediator. We show that 12-day fibroblast culture with TNF-α or IL-13 induces fibrogenesis, marked by progressively increasing type III and VI collagen formation, and that TGF-β1 co-stimulation amplifies these effects. Tofacitinib substantially reduced the formation of ECM proteins in response to IL-13, while fibrogenesis in response to TNF-α or TGF-β1 was marginally inhibited. The in vitro findings were supported by clinical observations in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis, which had elevated serum type III collagen formation, indicating ongoing fibrogenesis during inflammation. After 48-60 weeks of tofacitinib treatment, type III collagen degradation, aswell as formation, were significantly decreased compared to baseline, highlighting dual anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrogenic effects of tofacitinib. In contrast, other anti-inflammatory treatments including methotrexate, adalimumab and tocilizumab demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects only. Our results highlight fibro-inflammatory profiles associated with TNF-α or IL-13 stimulation, both alone and in combination with TGF-β1, and support the use of tofacitinib as an anti-fibrogenic treatment in chronic inflammatory conditions."

"The present study investigates the influence of nitrosamines and etoposide on mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) in a differentiation state- and biological age-dependent manner. The genotoxic effects of the agents on both neonatal and adult stem cell populations after treatment, before, or during the course of differentiation, and the sensitivity of the different MSC types to different concentrations of MNU or etoposide were assessed. Hereby, the multipotent differentiation capacity of MSCs into osteoblasts, adipocytes, and chondrocytes was analyzed. Our findings reveal that while all cell types exhibit DNA damage upon exposure, neonatal CB-USSCs demonstrate enhanced resistance to genotoxic damage compared with their adult counterparts. Moreover, the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs was more susceptible to genotoxic damage, whereas the adipogenic and chondrogenic differentiation potentials did not show any significant changes upon treatment with genotoxin. Furthermore, we emphasize the cell-specific variability in responses to genotoxic damage and the differences in sensitivity and reaction across different cell types, thus advocating the consideration of these variabilities during drug testing and developmental biological research."

"Among environmental contaminants, the rising level of cadmium in freshwater ecosystems is one of the most significant global concerns. The study addresses the current pollution status of cadmium in the middle stretch of River Ganga and explores the potential hazard associated with the consumption of 15 commercially important fish species by the inhabitants. Together 72 water and sediment samples were analyzed from the four representative sampling sites of River Ganga after the surveillance of major anthropogenic stressors. The concentration of cadmium ranges from 0.003 to 0.011 mg/l and 0.2 to 3.48 mg/kg in water and sediment respectively in 2022. The average concentration of cadmium was recorded to be the highest in Channa punctatus (1.35 mg/kg), followed by Rita rita = Johnius coitor (1.15 mg/kg), and the lowest in Labeo bata (0.2 mg/kg). The finding highlights greater exposure duration and feeding preferences of fish species have played a significant role in the bioaccumulation of the metal in the riverine system. Notably, the domestic effluents, agricultural runoffs, and pollutants brought along by the tributaries of River Ganga are identified as the main anthropogenic stressors for the moderate to considerably polluted status of the River Ganga. The target hazard quotient (THQ) and target carcinogenic risk (TCR) have revealed a higher susceptibility to cadmium contamination in children followed by females, and males. In addition, hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) has noted intake of Rita rita, Channa punctata, Puntius sophore, and Johnius coitor could be more detrimental to children's health than adults."

"There is, in the content of the Journal, an embarrassment of riches, and picking a ""best"" seems to demand a certain qualification: is the ""best"" the most interesting, most surprising, most educational, most important, most provocative, most enjoyable? How to choose? We are hardly unbiased and can admit to a special affection for the ones that we and the authors worked hardest on, modifying version after version into shape. Acknowledging these biases, here are the 2024 articles that we think deserve your attention or at least a second read."
"DDX21, a member of the DEAD-box RNA helicase family, plays a pivotal role in various aspects of RNA metabolism, including ribosomal RNA (rRNA) processing, transcription, and translation. Its diverse functions in cancer progression and viral infections have attracted considerable attention. DDX21 exerts a pivotal function through ribosomal DNA (rDNA) transcription and rRNA processing. DDX21 is involved in different biological processes of mRNA transcription. It interacts with transcription factors, modulates RNA polymerase II elongation, binds R-loops to regulate transcription, and participates in alternative splicing. The elevated expression of DDX21 has been observed in most cancers, where it influences tumorigenesis by affecting ribosome biogenesis, transcription, genome stability, and cell cycle regulation. Additionally, DDX21 plays a key role in the antiviral defense of host by interacting with viral proteins to regulate essential stages of the infection process. This review provides a thorough examination of the biological functions of DDX21, its involvement in cancer progression and viral infections, and its potential as both a biomarker and a therapeutic target. Future studies should aim to clarify the specific mechanisms of the activity of DDX21, advance the development of targeted therapies, and assess its clinical relevance across various cancer types and stages."
"Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is known to play roles in orchestrating cellular plasticity across many physiological and pathological contexts. Partial EMT, wherein cells maintain both epithelial and mesenchymal features, is gaining recognition for its functional importance in cancer in recent years. There are many factors regulating both partial and full EMT, and the precise mechanisms underlying these processes vary depending on the biological context. Furthermore, how different EMT states cooperate to create a heterogeneous tumor population and promote different pro-malignant features remains largely undefined. In a recent study published in Nature Cancer, Youssef and colleagues described how two disparate EMT programs, active in either organ fibrosis or embryonic development, are utilized within different cells within the same murine mammary tumor model. This work provides mechanistic insight into the development of intratumoral heterogeneity, providing evidence for the cooperation between the two EMT trajectories."
"Globally, Chronic kidney Disease (CKD) has become a significant public health concern, with sub-Saharan Africa being among the populations experiencing the highest rates. Managing CKD poses a significant challenge due to its health complications and associated high cost of care. Hypertension is one of the leading causes of CKD, responsible for the decline in kidney function in patients. Knowledge and lifestyle modifications are pivotal to the prevention and progression of CKD. In Tanzania, little is known regarding CKD knowledge and preventive practices among patients with hypertension. Therefore, this study aimed to assess context-specific factors associated with CKD knowledge and preventive practices among patients with hypertension at Amana Regional Referral Hospital in Dar es Salaam."

"Patients with limited distant metastatic disease, also known as oligometastasis, show better survival rates than polymetastatic patients, and may be amenable for curative-intent treatment. The definition of oligometastasis, however, is unknown, and no quantitative analyses on the cutoff value for oligometastasis have been performed before. This study aims to derive specific threshold values for the number of metastases and affected locations that defines oligometastatic disease in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma."
"Perioperative anaphylaxis is a serious entity with high morbidity and mortality. Perioperative anaphylaxis can be caused by any of the multitude of medications and substances used in anesthesia and surgery, and the most common causes include neuromuscular blocking agents, antibiotics, antiseptics, latex, and dyes. The differential diagnosis of perioperative anaphylaxis is wide from both an immunologic and a nonimmunologic standpoint. The majority of the intraoperative anaphylaxis reactions are thought to be immunoglobulin E (IgE) mediated; however, other primary non-IgE-mediated mechanisms can also be present. Clinical manifestations can vary from mild cutaneous exanthema to cardiac arrest. Tryptase can be helpful in identifying perioperative anaphylaxis. In this article, we present the case of a 75-year-old man who had a cardiac arrest without skin symptoms perioperatively during coronary artery bypass surgery. We describe the presentation, strategic evaluation, and subsequent management with recommendations for future surgery based on his evaluation and the identified culprit. Subsequent surgery was later completed. Understanding the clinical presentation, key components of testing, and recommendations for future management of perioperative anaphylaxis are invaluable skills that the allergist can provide for the patient and the anesthesia and surgery teams."
"Retinol, α-tocopherol and phylloquinone (vitamins A, E, and K) are presented in high concentrations within the chloroplast and leaves of most plants. They are fat-soluble vitamins and absorb similarly to other dietary lipids. Because the molecular mechanism of retinol, α-tocopherol, and phylloquinone absorption is still unknown, this work aims to investigate the distribution of these vitamins at the water/membrane interface using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Structures and variations of the hydroxyl group in vitamins are the keys to the investigation of the absorption process. Binding orientations, favorable binding sites, interactions, and diffusion of vitamins were identified. All vitamins spontaneously penetrate the lipid bilayer. According to simulations, the formation of the hydrogen bonding interaction with the phosphate group of DPPC during absorption requires a hydroxyl group of retinol and tocopherol. Therefore, retinol has -OH group at the tail of the structure and shows the highest structural flexibility of retinol, broadest tilt angle toward the lipid membrane, and highest diffusion coefficient. Finally, retinol plugs its head group into the hydrocarbon core of the lipid bilayer. In the case of α-tocopherol, the hydroxyl at the head group produces α-tocopherol, which moves through one leaflet of the lipid membrane and is stabilized in the opposite leaflet. Interestingly, phylloquinone, a molecule without a hydroxyl group, stabilizes close to a phosphate group without hydrogen bond formation. The head group of phylloquinone penetrates at a precise tilting angle of 120°. High retention of phylloquinone inside gel-phase DPPC is suggested by its low diffusion coefficient. MD simulations reveal the characteristics of three fat-soluble vitamins during absorption through the phospholipid membrane. This information is useful as a guideline to improve the absorption of drugs along the membrane."

"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) exhibits a cellular hierarchy with a subpopulation of stem-like cells known as glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) that drive tumor growth and contribute to treatment resistance. NAD(H) emerges as a crucial factor influencing GSC maintenance through its involvement in diverse biological processes, including mitochondrial fitness and DNA damage repair. However, how GSCs leverage metabolic adaptation to obtain survival advantage remains elusive."
"The human skin microbiome is closely associated with various diseases. We aimed to find the causal association of the human skin microbiome with vaginitis. A two-way two-sample Mendelian randomization study used summary statistics of the human skin microbiota from the largest genome-wide association study meta-analysis. Pooled statistics for vaginitis disease were obtained from the FinnGen consortium R10 release. Inverse variance weighted, MR-Egger, weighted median, weighted model, MR-PRESSO, and STEIGER methods were used to test for causal associations between different parts of the human skin microbiota and vaginitis disease in either dry or moist environments. IVW estimates suggest that phylococcus hominischaracterizes a protective effect against vaginitis lesions at the Antecubitalfossa wet site. Staphylococcus in the dry state at the Dorsalforearm site also demonstrated a protective effect against vaginitis lesions. Micrococcus showed a trend of up-regulation of vaginitis risk under IVW method estimation. In contrast, Anaerococcus and Veillonella were associated with a low risk of vaginitis as estimated by the IVW method: ASV061 and ASV065. In the Class, IVW estimation showed that Bacilli at Antecubitalfossa site had an increased risk effect on vaginitis in the moist skin condition. Similarly in Genus, Staphylococcus at Antecubitalfossa sites had an increased risk effect against vaginitis in the moist skin condition. Based on the results of the inverse MR analysis, no significant causal effect of vaginitis on the human skin microbiota was found. This two-sample bidirectional Mendelian randomization study found a causal relationship between seven human skin microbiota and vaginitis, further enriching our understanding of the value of skin flora in reproductive diseases such as vaginitis."
"The noradrenergic locus coeruleus (LC) regulates arousal levels during wakefulness, but its role in sleep remains unclear. Here, we show in mice that fluctuating LC neuronal activity partitions non-rapid-eye-movement sleep (NREMS) into two brain-autonomic states that govern the NREMS-REMS cycle over ~50-s periods; high LC activity induces a subcortical-autonomic arousal state that facilitates cortical microarousals, whereas low LC activity is required for NREMS-to-REMS transitions. This functional alternation regulates the duration of the NREMS-REMS cycle by setting permissive windows for REMS entries during undisturbed sleep while limiting these entries to maximally one per ~50-s period during REMS restriction. A stimulus-enriched, stress-promoting wakefulness was associated with longer and shorter levels of high and low LC activity, respectively, during subsequent NREMS, resulting in more microarousal-induced NREMS fragmentation and delayed REMS onset. We conclude that LC activity fluctuations are gatekeepers of the NREMS-REMS cycle and that this role is influenced by adverse wake experiences."
"As the United States faces burgeoning behavioral health needs and a growing recognition of the inextricable link between social conditions and health outcomes and quality-of-life indicators, a current representative profile of the MSW workforce with respect to sociodemographic and employment characteristics can provide a reference point for ongoing assessments of that workforce. The profile also can establish a baseline by which efforts to bolster the diversity and strength of the MSW workforce can be grounded. The core aim of the current study was to generate a nationally representative, descriptive profile of MSW graduates in the United States using a sample of 1,028 MSW graduates (representing a subpopulation of 691,061 individuals) from the 2021 National Survey of College Graduates. Weighted univariate and bivariate analyses were conducted to generate a descriptive profile of MSW graduates with respect to sociodemographic, education, and employment characteristics. Study findings can help employers, health services researchers, policymakers, and practitioners understand the context of the MSW workforce as it relates to diversity, labor workforce projection data, and student loan and salary considerations. This information can guide future policy and training goals to support the future vitality of the social work profession."
"How can we recommend items to users utilizing multiple types of user behavior data? Multi-behavior recommender systems leverage various types of user behavior data to enhance recommendation performance for the target behavior. These systems aim to provide personalized recommendations, thereby improving user experience, engagement, and satisfaction across different applications such as e-commerce platforms, streaming services, news websites, and content platforms. While previous approaches in multi-behavior recommendation have focused on incorporating behavioral order and dependencies into embedding learning, they often overlook the nuanced importance of individual behaviors in shaping user preferences during model training. We propose MBA (Multi-Behavior sequence-Aware recommendation via graph convolution networks), an accurate framework for multi-behavior recommendations. MBA adopts a novel approach by learning embeddings that capture both the dependencies between behaviors and their relative importance in influencing user preferences. Additionally, MBA employs sophisticated sampling strategies that consider the sequential nature of behaviors during model training, ensuring that the model effectively learns from the entire behavioral sequence. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate the superior performance of MBA compared to existing methods. MBA outperforms the best competitor, achieving improvements of up to 11.2% and 11.4% in terms of HR@10 and nDCG@10, respectively. These findings underscore the effectiveness of MBA in providing accurate and personalized recommendations tailored to individual user preferences."

"This research paper explores the intricate relationship between metacognitive dysfunctional beliefs, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and psychosocial performance in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia. Understanding these dynamics can help mental health nurses identify and address each patient's needs more effectively. It can guide them in devising personalized care plans that not only manage the symptoms but also improve the underlying mechanism that exacerbates the psychotic symptoms and social functioning and the overall quality of life. Moreover, the findings of this research can contribute to developing training programs for mental health nurses, equipping them with the necessary skills and knowledge to provide optimal care. What the paper adds to existing knowledge? • This study provides empirical evidence of the significant positive correlation between OCS and metacognitive dimensions in individuals with schizophrenia. • It highlights the role of certain demographic factors, such as younger age and single marital status, in increasing the likelihood of elevated OCS. • It underscores the inverse relationship between higher metacognitive dysfunctional beliefs and lower levels of psychosocial functioning. • It identifies age and metacognitive scores as crucial predictors of psychosocial functioning across various domains. What are the implications for practice? • The findings suggest that therapeutic nursing interventions for individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia should address metacognitive dysfunctional beliefs to improve overall functioning and well-being. • Clinicians, including psychiatrists and psychiatric nurses, should consider the patient's age, marital status, and metacognitive scores when assessing the risk of elevated OCS and devising treatment plans. • The study emphasizes the need for comprehensive psychiatric nursing assessment, including metacognitive dysfunction and OCS evaluation. What are the implications for future research? • Future research could explore the causal relationships between metacognitive dysfunctional beliefs, OCS, and psychosocial functioning in schizophrenia. • Longitudinal studies could provide insights into the progression of these relationships over time and the impact of therapeutic interventions. • Further research could also investigate the effectiveness of specific therapeutic strategies such as Metacognitive Therapy (MCT), Schema Therapy (ST), Cognitive Enhancement Therapy (CET), and Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) to address this population's metacognitive dysfunctional beliefs."
"A novel enzyme-modified cheddar cheese was prepared and the molecular mechanism of cheese flavor compensation by synergistic action of cell-free extracts and enzyme systems was investigated. By comparing five different protease-peptidase combinations, the group of neutral protease and flavor protease was found to increase the total leucine, valine, and isoleucine content (17.056 ± 0.136 g/kg) and the soluble nitrogen content was up to the level of a 12-month-matured cheese. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated their mode of action on four monomeric caseins. Adding a cell-free extract resulted in volatile flavor substances in the enzyme-modified cheese that were closest to those in the 12-month-matured cheese. This might be due to the flavor compensation effect of the conversion of leucine to 3-methylbutyraldehyde by transaminases and decarboxylases, and the conversion of 3-methylbutyric acid to 3-methylbutyraldehyde by ketoacid dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase. This is essential for the enzyme modified cheddar cheese preparation."

"Aggression is ubiquitous among social species and can function to maintain social dominance hierarchies. The African cichlid fish Astatotilapia burtoni is an ideal study species for studying aggression due to their dominance hierarchy and robust behavioral repertoire. To further understand the potential sex differences in aggression in this species, we characterized aggression in male and female A. burtoni in a mirror assay. We then quantified neural activation patterns in brain regions of the social behavior network (SBN) to investigate if differences in behavior are reflected in the brain with immunohistochemistry by detecting the phosphorylated ribosome marker phospho-S6 ribosomal protein (pS6), a marker for neural activation. We found that A. burtoni perform both identical and sex-specific aggressive behaviors in response to a mirror assay. Females had greater pS6 immunoreactivity than males in the Vv (ventral part of the ventral telencephalon), a homolog of the lateral septum in mammals. Males but not females had higher pS6 immunoreactivity in the ATn after the aggression assay. The ATn (anterior tuberal nucleus) is a homolog of the ventromedial hypothalamus in mammals, which is strongly implicated in the regulation of aggression in males. Several regions also have higher pS6 immunoreactivity in negative controls than fish exposed to a mirror, implicating a role for inhibitory neural processes in suppressing aggression until a relevant stimulus is present. Male and female A. burtoni display both similar and different behavioral patterns in aggression in response to a mirror assay. There are also sex differences in the corresponding neural activation patterns in the SBN. In mirror males but not females, the ATn clusters with the POA, revealing a functional connectivity of these regions that is triggered in an aggressive context in males. These findings suggest that distinct neural circuitry underlie aggressive behavior in male and female A. burtoni, serving as a foundation for future work investigating the molecular and neural underpinnings of sex differences in behavior in this species to reveal fundamental insights into understanding aggression."
"Each view of our environment captures only a subset of our immersive surroundings. Yet, our visual experience feels seamless. A puzzle for human neuroscience is to determine what cognitive mechanisms enable us to overcome our limited field of view and efficiently anticipate new views as we sample our visual surroundings. Here, we tested whether memory-based predictions of upcoming scene views facilitate efficient perceptual judgments across head turns. We tested this hypothesis using immersive, head-mounted virtual reality (VR). After learning a set of immersive real-world environments, participants (n = 101 across 4 experiments) were briefly primed with a single view from a studied environment and then turned left or right to make a perceptual judgment about an adjacent scene view. We found that participants' perceptual judgments were faster when they were primed with images from the same (vs. neutral or different) environments. Importantly, priming required memory: it only occurred in learned (vs. novel) environments, where the link between adjacent scene views was known. Further, consistent with a role in supporting active vision, priming only occurred in the direction of planned head turns and only benefited judgments for scene views presented in their learned spatiotopic positions. Taken together, we propose that memory-based predictions facilitate rapid perception across large-scale visual actions, such as head and body movements, and may be critical for efficient behavior in complex immersive environments."
"Interferons (IFNs) are a diverse family of cytokines secreted by various cells, including immune cells, fibroblasts, and certain viral-parasitic cells. They are classified into three types and encompass 21 subtypes based on their sources and properties. The regulatory functions of IFNs closely involve cell surface receptors and several signal transduction pathways. Initially investigated for their antiviral properties, IFNs have shown promise in combating cancer-associated viruses, making them a potent therapeutic approach. Most IFNs have been identified for their role in inhibiting cancer; however, they have also demonstrated cancer-promoting effects under specific conditions. These mechanisms primarily rely on immune regulation and cytotoxic effects, significantly impacting cancer progression. Despite widespread use of IFN-based therapies in viral-related cancers, ongoing research aims to develop more effective treatments. This review synthesizes the signal transduction pathways and regulatory capabilities of IFNs, highlighting their connections with viruses, cancers, and emerging clinical treatments."

"DDX41 is the most frequently mutated gene in myeloid neoplasms associated with germline predisposition including myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We analyzed 3795 patients with myeloid neoplasms and identified 151 (4%) with DDX41 variants and a diagnosis of AML (n = 96), MDS (n = 52), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (n = 3). The most frequent DDX41 variants were the somatic variant p.R525H, followed by the germline variants p.M1I and p.D140fs. Most neoplasms had a normal karyotype (59%) and the most frequent co-mutations were TP53 (16%) and ASXL1 (15%). 30% of patients had no concomitant mutations besides DDX41 mutation. Patients with myeloid malignancies and DDX41 variants responded well to therapy, with an overall response rate for patients with treatment naïve AML and MDS of 87% and 84%, respectively. The median overall survival (mOS) of patients with treatment-naïve AML or MDS was 49 and 71 months, respectively. Patients with AML treated with low-intensity regimens including venetoclax had an improved survival (2-year OS 91% vs. 60%, p = .02) and lower cumulative incidence of relapse compared to those treated without venetoclax (10% vs. 56%, p = .03). In the 33% of patients receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, the 2-year OS was 80% and 85% for AML and MDS, respectively."

"Modern molecular imaging routes, such as nuclear imaging and optical imaging, derive significant advantages from nanoparticles, where multimodality use and multipurpose are key benefits. Nanoparticles also showcase benefits over traditional imaging agents in nuclear and optical imaging, including improved resolution, penetration, and specificity. The goal of this literature review was to explore recent advancements in nanomaterials within these molecular imaging techniques to expand on the current state of nanomedicine in these modalities. This review derives findings from relevant reviews, original research papers, in-human clinical trials, and patents in the literature. Au- and Fe oxide-based nanosystems are just as ubiquitous within more modern modalities due to their multimodal diagnostic and therapeutic potential. It is also repeatedly highlighted in the literature, patents, and clinical trials that the use of nanoparticles, specifically in multimodal imaging techniques and theranostics, present innovative methods in recent years, enabling researchers and clinicians to overcome the limitations of unimodal imaging modalities and further advancing accuracy in the diagnosis and treatment of important pathologies, particularly cancer. Overall, nanoparticle-based imaging represents a transformative approach in advanced imaging modalities, offering new approaches to limitations of conventional agents currently being applied in clinical settings."

Finding a protocol that could prevent bone resorption and be implemented in clinical practice would be crucial in providing sufficient bone to replace missing teeth with implants.
"Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is associated with an increased risk of hip fracture beyond what can be explained by reduced bone mineral density, possibly due to changes in bone material from accumulation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) and altered matrix composition, though data from human cortical bone in T1D are limited. The objective of this study was to evaluate cortical bone material behavior in T1D by examining specimens from cadaveric femora from older adults with long-duration T1D (≥50 yr; n = 20) and age- and sex-matched nondiabetic controls (n = 14). Cortical bone was assessed by mechanical testing (4-point bending, cyclic reference point indentation, impact microindentation), AGE quantification [total fluorescent AGEs, pentosidine, carboxymethyl lysine (CML)], and matrix composition via Raman spectroscopy. Cortical bone from older adults with T1D had diminished postyield toughness to fracture (-30%, p = .036), elevated levels of AGEs (pentosidine, +17%, p = .039), lower mineral crystallinity (-1.4%, p = .010), greater proline hydroxylation (+1.9%, p = .009), and reduced glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content (-1.3%, p < .03) compared to nondiabetics. In multiple regression models to predict cortical bone toughness, cortical tissue mineral density, CML, and Raman spectroscopic measures of enzymatic collagen crosslinks and GAG content remained highly significant predictors of toughness, while diabetic status was no longer significant (adjusted R2 > 0.60, p < .001). Thus, the impairment of cortical bone to absorb energy following long-duration T1D is well explained by AGE accumulation and modifications to the bone matrix. These results provide novel insight into the pathogenesis of skeletal fragility in individuals with T1D."
"In light of COVID-19, telepractice for speech therapy has been increasingly adopted. Telepractice promotes accessibility to therapy services for those in rural environments, lowers the frequency of missed appointments, and reduces the costs of rehabilitation. The efficacy of telepractice has been scarcely explored in the aphasia literature. Preliminary research has demonstrated comparable results of telepractice and in-person therapy for people with aphasia, but the current scope of research is insufficient to guide clinical practice. The present study examined whether the virtual administration of a picture-naming therapy paradigm was as effective as in-person administration."
"Numerous statistical methods have been developed to search for genomic markers associated with the development, progression, and response to treatment of complex diseases. Among them, feature ranking plays a vital role due to its intuitive formulation and computational efficiency. However, most of the existing methods are based on the marginal importance of molecular predictors and share the limitation that the dependence (network) structures among predictors are not well accommodated, where a disease phenotype usually reflects various biological processes that interact in a complex network. In this paper, we propose a structured feature ranking method for identifying genomic markers, where such network structures are effectively accommodated using Laplacian regularization. The proposed method innovatively investigates multiple network scenarios, where the networks can be known a priori and data-dependently estimated. In addition, we rigorously explore the noise and uncertainty in the networks and control their impacts with proper selection of tuning parameters. These characteristics make the proposed method enjoy especially broad applicability. Theoretical result of our proposal is rigorously established. Compared to the original marginal measure, the proposed network structured measure can achieve sure screening properties with a faster convergence rate under mild conditions. Extensive simulations and analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas melanoma data demonstrate the improvement of finite sample performance and practical usefulness of the proposed method."
"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has led to significant changes in the lives, habits, and frequency of hospital admissions of People Living with HIV (PLWH).

"Up to 30% of adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) patients have metastasised disease upon initial presentation, and systemic treatments currently fail to sufficiently improve survival. Palliative primary tumour resection can be considered for symptomatic relief, but its potential survival benefit remains a topic of debate. This systematic review therefore aims to assess the effect of primary tumour resection on overall survival in patients with metastatic ACC. A systematic review was performed using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Relevant databases were searched from 2000 to 2024 for studies on primary tumour resection in metastatic ACC. Overall survival data were analysed. A total of 13 studies on primary tumour resection for metastatic ACC were included. All studies were retrospective and assessed as having a high risk of bias. Data regarding adequate patient characteristics and indications for surgery were missing in all studies. Hence, the current literature is hampered by both indication and selection biases to draw any conclusions on the survival benefit of primary tumour resection in patients with metastasised ACC. However, 12 out of 13 studies (92%) demonstrated longer overall survival after primary tumour resection compared to no surgery. Whereas this is in line with retrospective data on other cancers, randomised controlled trials in other tumours, such as breast and colorectal cancers, have failed to display survival benefits of primary tumour resection. These cancers are, however, relatively chemo-sensitive, unlike ACC. Primary tumour resection could therefore only be considered on an individual patient basis."
"Currently, available technologies and procedures enable aesthetic dermatologists to provide their patients with beneficial treatment outcomes for a wide variety of skin conditions. These treatments range from laser resurfacing and radiofrequency procedures to chemical peels and microneedling. The concept of integrated skincare is based on the application of adjunct therapies before, during, or after cosmetic medical procedures to promote healing, minimize discomfort, shorten down-time, and enhance overall aesthetic outcomes. Numerous peer-reviewed studies have demonstrated the benefit of combining a variety of adjunct treatments with cosmetic procedures. The concurrent application of integrated skincare can improve these skin-related issues and provide patients with greater global outcomes. The primary objective of the following consensus roundtable was to discuss best practices for aesthetic providers with or without dermatological training when treating patients with aging skin complaints and review considerations for evaluating patients interested in cosmetic procedures with concomitant skin issues, such as skin dyschromias, lines, and wrinkles. A roundtable discussion was held by several notable experts in their field during a special addition to the Thriving in Diversity webinar series on Saturday, July 8, 2023. The discussion included four leading dermatologists, one oculoplastic surgeon, and one facial plastic surgeon who provided their clinical experience and consensus recommendations for applying integrated skincare in the aesthetic medical practice.

"Tyrosine Kinase inhibitor (TKI) is a class of drugs that interfere with protein kinases' signal transduction pathways through an array of inhibitory mechanisms. Tyrosine kinases (TK) have an inevitable role in downstream signal transduction and the proliferation of tumour cells. Hence, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are frequently employed as anti-neoplastic agents in the treatment of colon, breast, kidney, and lung cancers. They can be used as single or combination therapy with other targeted therapies. It is understood that TKIs pose a risk of developing proteinuria in some patients as it can primarily result in dysfunction of the split diaphragm, constriction or blockage of capillary lumens mediated by the basement membrane, acute interstitial nephritis, or acute tubular necrosis. This paper reviews the mechanism of action of TKIs, the pathophysiological mechanism of TKI-induced proteinuria, and its management Fig. 1."

"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is the most common chronic liver disease in the world and a growing cause of liver-related morbidity and mortality. Yet, at the same time, our understanding of the pathophysiology and genetic underpinnings of this increasingly common yet heterogeneous disease has increased dramatically over the last 2 decades, with the potential to lead to meaningful clinical interventions for patients. We have now seen the first pharmacologic therapy approved for the treatment of MASLD, and multiple other potential treatments are currently under investigation-including gene-targeted RNA therapies that directly extend from advances in MASLD genetics. Here we review recent advances in MASLD genetics, some of the key pathophysiologic insights that human genetics has provided, and the ways in which human genetics may inform our clinical practice in the field of MASLD in the near future."

"Bile acids (BAs), a category of amphiphilic metabolites synthesized by liver cells and released into the intestine via the bile duct, serve a vital role in the emulsification of ingested fats during the digestive process. Beyond their conventional emulsifying function, BAs, with their diverse structures, also act as significant hormones within the body. They are pivotal in facilitating nutrient absorption by interacting with the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), and they serve as key regulators of lipid and glucose metabolism, as well as immune system balance. Consequently, BAs contribute to the metabolism of glucose and lipids, enhance the digestion and absorption of lipids, and maintain the equilibrium of the bile pool. Their actions are instrumental in addressing obesity, managing cholestasis, and treating diabetes, and are involved in the onset and progression of cancer. This paper presents an updated systematic review of the pharmacological mechanisms by which BAs target the FXR, incorporating recent findings and discussing their signaling pathways in the context of novel research, including their distinct roles in various disease states and populations. The aim is to provide a theoretical foundation for the continued research and clinical application of BAs."
"Metabolic alterations are related to tumorigenesis and other age-related diseases that are accelerated by ""Westernized"" diets. In fact, hypercaloric nutrition is associated with an increased incidence of cancers and faster aging. Conversely, lifespan-extending strategies, such as caloric restriction, impose beneficial effects on both processes. Here, we investigated the metabolic consequences of hypercaloric-induced aging on tumor growth in female mice. Our findings indicate that a high-fat high-sucrose diet increases tumor growth mainly due to the boosted oxidation of glucose and fatty acids. Consequently, through an increased expression of lactate, IGFBP3, and PTHLH, tumors modulate liver and white adipose tissue metabolism. In the liver, the induced tumor increases fibrosis and accelerates the senescence process, despite the lower systemic pro-inflammatory state. Importantly, the induced tumor induces the wasting and browning of white adipose tissue, thereby reversing diet-induced insulin resistance. Finally, we suggest that tumor growth alters liver-adipose tissue crosstalk that upregulates Fgf21, induces senescence, and negatively modulates lipids and carbohydrates metabolism even in caloric-restricted-fed mice."
"Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remains a significant challenge in oncology due to its aggressive nature and heterogeneity. As one of the deadliest malignancies, ESCC research lags behind other cancer types. The balance between ubiquitination and deubiquitination processes plays a crucial role in cellular functions, with its disruption linked to various diseases, including cancer."
"Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), mainly including Huntington's disease (HD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Alzheimer's disease (AD), are sporadic and rare genetic disorders of the central nervous system. A key feature of these conditions is the slow accumulation of misfolded protein deposits in brain neurons, the excessive aggregation of which leads to neurotoxicity and further disorders of the nervous system."
"Pain is a non-motor symptom that impairs quality of life in patients with Parkinson's disease. Pathological nociceptive hypersensitivity in patients could be due to changes in the processing of somatosensory information at the level of the basal ganglia, including the subthalamic nucleus (STN), but the underlying mechanisms are not yet defined. Here, we investigated the interaction between the STN and the dorsal horn of the spinal cord (DHSC), by first examining the nature of STN neurons that respond to peripheral nociceptive stimulation and the nature of their responses under normal and pathological conditions. Next, we studied the consequences of deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the STN on the electrical activity of DHSC neurons. Then, we investigated whether the therapeutic effect of STN-DBS would be mediated by the brainstem descending pathway involving the rostral ventromedial medulla. Finally, to better understand how the STN modulates allodynia, we used Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) expressed in the STN. The study was carried out on the 6-OHDA rodent model of Parkinson's disease, obtained by stereotactic injection of the neurotoxin into the medial forebrain bundle of rats and mice. In these animals, we used motor and nociceptive behavioural tests, in vivo electrophysiology of STN and wide dynamic range (WDR) DHSC neurons in response to peripheral stimulation, deep brain stimulation of the STN and the selective DREADD approach. Vglut2-ires-cre mice were used to specifically target and inhibit STN glutamatergic neurons. STN neurons are able to detect nociceptive stimuli, encode their intensity and generate windup-like plasticity, like WDR neurons in the DHSC. These phenomena are impaired in dopamine-depleted animals, as the intensity response is altered in both spinal and subthalamic neurons. Furthermore, as with L-DOPA, STN-DBS in rats ameliorated 6-OHDA-induced allodynia, and this effect is mediated by descending brainstem projections leading to normalization of nociceptive integration in DHSC neurons. Furthermore, this therapeutic effect was reproduced by selective inhibition of STN glutamatergic neurons in Vglut2-ires-cre mice. Our study highlights the centrality of the STN in nociceptive circuits, its interaction with the DHSC and its key involvement in pain sensation in Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, our results provide for the first-time evidence that subthalamic DBS produces analgesia by normalizing the responses of spinal WDR neurons via descending brainstem pathways. These effects are due to direct inhibition, rather than activation of glutamatergic neurons in the STN or passage fibres, as shown in the DREADDs experiment."
"The traditional diagnosis of chronic hepatitis C usually relies on liver biopsy. Diagnosing chronic hepatitis C based on serum indices provides a non-invasive way to determine the stage of chronic hepatitis C without liver biopsy. In this paper, we proposed two automatic diagnosis systems for non-invasive diagnosis of chronic hepatitis C based on serum indices, an extreme learning machine (ELM) based auto-diagnosis method and a hybrid method using k-means clustering and ELM. The two proposed systems were used to predict the fibrosis stage and inflammatory activity grade of patients with chronic hepatitis C by analyzing their serum index observations. ELM has superiorities such as simple structure and fast calculation speed and can provide good diagnosis performance. To overcome the problem of class-imbalance, outliers and small sample size, we also proposed a method hybridizing k-means and ELM. It employed the k-means clustering to generate new robust training samples and then employed the new generated training samples to train an ELM for chronic hepatitis C diagnosis. The proposed methods were tested on 123 real clinical cases. Experimental results show that the proposed methods outperform the state-of-the-art methods for the fibrosis stage and inflammatory activity grade diagnosis tasks."
"Spatial transcriptomics sequencing technology deepens our understanding of the diversity of cell behaviors, fates and states within complex tissue, which is often determined by the fine-tuning of regulatory network functional activities. Therefore, characterizing the functional activity within tissue space is helpful for revealing the functional features that drive spatial heterogeneity, and understanding complex biological processes. Here, we describe a database, SPathDB (http://bio-bigdata.hrbmu.edu.cn/SPathDB/), which aims to dissect the pathway-mediated multidimensional spatial heterogeneity in the context of functional activity. We manually curated spatial transcriptomics datasets and biological pathways from public data resources. SPathDB consists of 1689 868 spatial spots of 695 slices from 84 spatial transcriptome datasets of human and mouse, which involves 36 tissues, and also diseases such as cancer, and provides interactive analysis and visualization of the functional activities of 114 998 pathways across these spatial spots. SPathDB provides five flexible interfaces to retrieve and analyze pathways with highly variable functional activity across spatial spots, the distribution of pathway functional activities along pseudo-space axis, pathway-mediated spatial intercellular communications and the associations between spatial pathway functional activity and the occurrence of cell types. SPathDB will serve as a foundational resource for identifying functional features and elucidating underlying mechanisms of spatial heterogeneity."
"Our study presents a novel orbit with s-convexity, for illustration of the behavior shift in the fractals. We provide a theorem to demonstrate the escape criterion for transcendental cosine functions of the type Tα,β(u) = cos(um)+αu + β, for [Formula: see text] and m ≥ 2. We also demonstrate the impact of the parameters on the formatted fractals with numerical examples and graphical illustrations using the MATHEMATICA software, algorithm, and colormap. Moreover, we observe that the Julia set appears when we widen the Mandelbrot set at its petal edges, suggesting that each Mandelbrot set point contains a sizable quantity of Julia set picture data. It is commonly known that fractal geometry may capture the complexity of many intricate structures that exist in our surroundings."
"Given the growing interest in the metabolic heterogeneity of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and portal vein tumour thrombus (PVTT). This study comprehensively analysed the metabolic heterogeneity of HCC, PVTT, and normal liver samples using multi-omics combinations. A single-cell RNA sequencing dataset encompassing six major cell types was obtained for integrated analysis. The optimal subtypes were identified using cluster stratification and validated using spatial transcriptomics and fluorescent multiplex immunohistochemistry. Then, a combined index based meta-cluster was calculated to verify its prognostic significance using multi-omics data from public cohorts. Our study first depicted the metabolic heterogeneity landscape of non-malignant cells in HCC and PVTT at multiomics levels. The optimal subtypes interpret the metabolic characteristics of PVTT formation and development. The combined index provided effective predictions of prognosis and immunotherapy responses. Patients with a higher combined index had a relatively poor prognosis (p <0.001). We also found metabolism of polyamines was a key metabolic pathway involved in conversion of metabolic heterogeneity in HCC and PVTT, and identified ODC1 was significantly higher expressed in PVTT compared to normal tissue (p =0.03). Our findings revealed both consistency and heterogeneity in the metabolism of non-malignant cells in HCC and PVTT. The risk stratification based on cancer-associated fibroblasts and myeloid cells conduce to predict prognosis and guide treatment. This offers new directions for understanding disease development and immunotherapy responses."

"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) poses a grim prognosis for patients. Recent multidisciplinary research efforts have provided critical insights into its genetics and tumor biology, creating the foundation for rational development of targeted and immune therapies. Here, we review the PDAC genomic landscape and the role of specific oncogenic events in tumor initiation and progression, as well as their contributions to shaping its tumor biology. We further summarize and synthesize breakthroughs in single-cell and metabolic profiling technologies that have illuminated the complex cellular composition and heterotypic interactions of the PDAC tumor microenvironment, with an emphasis on metabolic cross-talk across cancer and stromal cells that sustains anabolic growth and suppresses tumor immunity. These conceptual advances have generated novel immunotherapy regimens, particularly cancer vaccines, which are now in clinical testing. We also highlight the advent of KRAS targeted therapy, a milestone advance that has transformed treatment paradigms and offers a platform for combined immunotherapy and targeted strategies. This review provides a perspective summarizing current scientific and therapeutic challenges as well as practice-changing opportunities for the PDAC field at this major inflection point."
"To maintain core body temperature in mammals, CNS thermoregulatory networks respond to cold exposure by increasing brown adipose tissue and shivering thermogenesis. However, in hibernation or torpor, this canonical thermoregulatory response is replaced by a new, emerging paradigm, thermoregulatory inversion (TI), an alternative homeostatic state in which cold exposure inhibits thermogenesis and warm exposure stimulates thermogenesis. Here, we demonstrate that in the non-torpid rat, either exclusion of the canonical thermoregulatory integrator in the preoptic hypothalamus or inhibition of neurons in the ventromedial periventricular area (VMPeA) induces the TI state through an alternative thermoregulatory pathway. Within this pathway, we have identified a dynorphinergic input to the dorsomedial hypothalamus from the dorsolateral parabrachial nucleus that plays a critical role in mediating the cold-evoked inhibition of thermogenesis during TI. Our results reveal a novel thermosensory reflex circuit within the mammalian CNS thermoregulatory pathways and support the potential for pharmacologically inducing the TI state to elicit therapeutic hypothermia in non-hibernating species, including humans."

"In the current study, the effects of fermentation by Lactobacillus acidophilus, Levilactobacillus brevis or Lactiplantibacillus plantarum (La/Lb/Lp, 1-2.5%) and incubation (30/37 °C, C1/C2) of red beetroot juice on the profile of betalains and polyphenols (UHPLC-DAD-MS), and antioxidant capacity using photochemiluminescence (PCL) and spectrophotometric assays (DPPH/ABTS) was investigated. Additionally, anti-glycaemic (anti-AGEs) and anticholinergic (anti-AChE) potential in vitro was analysed. Fermentation distinctly initiated isobetanin and neobetanin formation and enhanced flavonoid concentration, emphasising rutin, kaempferol and (+)-catechin. The fermented juices inhibited protein glycation in the BSA-GLU model and showed high DPPH and ABTS values. LP2.5% juice was the only one indicating anti-AChE potential."
"Microsatellite stable (MSS) colorectal cancer (CRC) is a subtype of CRC that generally exhibits resistance to immunotherapy, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors such as PD-1 blockade. This study investigates the effects and underlying mechanisms of combining PD-1 blockade with IDO1 inhibition in MSS CRC. Bioinformatics analyses of TCGA-COAD and TCGA-READ cohorts revealed significantly elevated IDO1 expression in CRC tumors, correlating with tumor mutation burden across TCGA datasets. In vivo experiments demonstrated that the combination of IDO1 inhibition and PD-1 blockade significantly reduced tumor growth and increased immune cell infiltration, particularly pro-inflammatory macrophages and CD8+ T cells. IDO1 knockdown in CRC cell lines impaired tolerance to interferon-γ and increased apoptosis in vitro, which were rescued by the application of kynurenine, the end product of IDO1. IDO1 knockdown in MSS CRC enhanced the effectiveness of PD-1 blockade therapy in vivo. IDO1 knockdown cancer cells promoted pro-inflammatory macrophage polarization and enhanced phagocytic activity in vitro, associated with the upregulation of JAK2-STAT3-IL6 signaling pathway. These findings highlight the role of IDO1 in modulating the tumor immune microenvironment in MSS CRC and suggest that combining PD-1 blockade with IDO1 inhibition could enhance therapeutic efficacy by promoting macrophage pro-inflammatory polarization and infiltration through the JAK2-STAT3-IL6 pathway."
"Synaptic pathology is crucial in neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), and numerous studies show a correlation between synaptic proteins and the rate of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, dementia, and Creutzfeldt-Jacob's disease. Due to the fact that altered synaptic function is considered a core feature of the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disorders, synaptic proteins, such as neurogranin, may serve as a biomarker of these diseases. Neurogranin is a postsynaptic protein located in the cell bodies and dendrites of neurons, foremost in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and striatum. It has been established that neurogranin is involved in synaptic plasticity and long-term potentiation. Literature data indicate that cerebrospinal fluid neurogranin may be useful as a biomarker for more accurate diagnosis and prognosis of neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, the diagnostic value of cerebrospinal fluid neurogranin in most common neurodegenerative diseases is examined."

Recent experimental and clinical studies have suggested that spontaneous effort can potentially injure the lungs. This review summarizes the harmful effects of spontaneous breathing on the lungs during mechanical ventilation in ARDS and suggests potential strategies to minimize spontaneous breathing-induced lung injury.
"Alzheimer's disease is characterized by progressive amyloid deposition and cognitive decline, yet the pathological mechanisms and treatments remain elusive. Here we report the therapeutic potential of low-intensity 40 hertz blue light exposure in a 5xFAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. Our findings reveal that light treatment prevents memory decline in 4-month-old 5xFAD mice and motivation loss in 14-month-old 5xFAD mice, accompanied by restoration of glial water channel aquaporin-4 polarity, improved brain drainage efficiency, and a reduction in hippocampal lipid accumulation. We further demonstrate the beneficial effects of 40 hertz blue light are mediated through the activation of the vLGN/IGL-Re visual circuit. Notably, concomitant use of anti-Aβ antibody with 40 hertz blue light demonstrates improved soluble Aβ clearance and cognitive performance in 5xFAD mice. These findings offer functional evidence on the therapeutic effects of 40 hertz blue light in Aβ-related pathologies and suggest its potential as a supplementary strategy to augment the efficacy of antibody-based therapy."

"Late-stage eosinophilic myocarditis (or Löffler endocarditis) is known to occur in patients with hypereosinophilic syndrome and can cause restrictive cardiomyopathy. Eosinophilic myocarditis is an acute life-threatening inflammatory disease of the heart that can be associated with cancer. We report a case of a 70-year-old White woman, previously treated for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in remission, admitted for acute dyspnea with a 1-year history of hypereosinophilia. 18F-FDG PET/CT revealed endocardial uptake consistent with MRI gadolinium enhancement, suggesting left ventricular wall inflammation."
A substantial proportion of patients within regular Mental Health Services have a mild intellectual disability (MID) or borderline intellectual functioning (BIF). Previous research has shown that psychiatrists are ambivalent about their own knowledge and skills in providing care to these patients.
"With the population aging, the prevalence of osteoporosis is rapidly increasing, which has become serious public health problem. At present, there is a severe shortage of effective anti-osteoporotic drugs in China, making it difficult to control the growing trend of osteoporosis. The key pathological mechanism of osteoporosis is bone homeostasis imbalance. It is necessary to continuously study the bone cell biology, important pathway regulating bone homeostasis, and its regulatory network constituted by bone-muscle-vessel-immune system-nerve-gut microbiota, in order to identify key targets for new drug, and develop more novel effective drugs to increase bone mineral density, improve bone strength, reduce fracture risk and protect bone health."
"The ESGE curriculum guideline on training in ESD advises an extensive experience in animal models before commencing ESD training on humans. However, the evidence on which this recommendation is based, is rather limited. In this study we evaluate the performance of novices in ESD during their one-year training period; with continuous supervision of an endoscopist with extensive experience in ESD."
"Identifying the risks of metabolic syndrome (MetS) can lead to early targeted interventions and thus contribute to improved quality of life by reducing the risk of developing MetS, diabetes or heart disease in the future. We aimed to develop a valid and reliable measurement tool to measure the MetS risk of the population."

"Clostridium butyricum is a probiotic widely used in animal husbandry, and there is evidence to suggest that it can alleviate intestinal inflammation in pigs and may be related to its lipoteichoic acid (LTA), but the mechanism is still unclear."
"The Marburg and Ebola viruses belong to the Filoviridae family and are known to cause emerging zoonotic diseases. These viruses have a high case fatality rate and are easily transmissible from person to person, which makes them capable of triggering outbreaks, including in non-endemic regions, and are also considered agents of bioterrorism. Fruit bats are the natural reservoirs of these filoviruses. Transmission to humans occurs through direct contact with bodily fluids or tissues from infected animals or humans. The most severe form of filovirus disease manifests as mucocutaneous hemorrhage, often accompanied by multiorgan failure, which is the main cause of death. Traditionally, these diseases are classified in the group of viral hemorrhagic fevers, although this term is being abandoned, as there are not always hemorrhagic manifestations or fever in the patient's clinical history. Currently, no specific antiviral treatment for filovirus disease exists, and the therapeutic approach consists of supportive measures. However, for the Zaire Ebola virus (EBOV), monoclonal antibodies have already been licensed for treatment and post-exposure prophylaxis, in addition to three vaccines available. Due to the public health importance and the possibility of cases outside Africa, this review aims to improve clinical knowledge and the approach to suspected cases of FD. Improved surveillance and preparedness for potential global outbreaks are essential measures to effectively respond to these public health threats and to ensure that healthcare professionals are well-informed and prepared to deal with these diseases."
"Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are primarily generated through the incomplete combustion or pyrolysis of organic materials in various industrial processes. Foods may become contaminated with environmental PAHs found in air, soil, or water, or through industrial food processing methods such as smoking, roasting, drying, and grilling. The Ministry of Health and Welfare in Taiwan has established maximum levels for benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) and indicative values for BaP as well as PAH4 (the sum of benz[a]anthracene, chrysene, benzo[b]fluoranthene, and benzo[a]pyrene) in foods as operational guidelines. The current study developed an analytical method for simultaneous determination of PAH4 levels in katsuobushi (dried bonito flakes), cocoa bean shells, and plant-based food supplements using gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS). Sample preparation methods were assessed using cyclohexane extraction and solid-phase extraction (SPE) for purification. PAH4 levels were subsequently quantified with matrix-matched calibration curves combined with isotopic internal standards. The limit of quantitation (LOQ) for each PAH was 5 μg/kg for katsuobushi and plant-based food supplements, and 1 μg/kg for cocoa bean shells. The effectiveness of the method was validated through each PAH analyte in the matrices of katsuobushi, cocoa bean shells, and plant-based food supplements. The average recoveries of PAH4 for fortified samples in each matrix ranged from 101.1 to 115.6% with all coefficients of variation being less than 6.5%. This method is applicable for routine analysis of PAH4 in a diverse array of food products to ensure food safety."
"Substantial improvements in spatial resolution in brain positron emission tomography (PET) scanners have greatly reduced partial volume effect, making head movement the main source of image blur. To achieve high-resolution PET neuroimaging, precise real-time estimation of both head position and orientation is essential for accurate motion compensation."
"Numerical modeling of the recovery of moisture by injecting warm air in the unsaturated zone in a 100 m × 100 m plot of agricultural land in Kuwait, a country located in an arid environment, was conducted to provide ""proof of concept"" of the technique. If technically and economically feasible, it will be a potential additional source of water that could be exploited for farming activities and other uses. The COMSOL software was used to develop the model and, based on the results of the scenario runs, the effects of different hydraulic and operational parameters, including that of well spacing, on moisture recovery were assessed. In general, the results suggested that the recovery should increase with the increase in the hydraulic conductivity of the unsaturated zone, the amount of heat input, and the pressure differential between the unsaturated zone and the well head. Within the period examined (0 to 11 days), the recovery decreases with the increase in the soil moisture content, possibly due to the fall in relative permeability to moisture-rich air with the increased water contents in the pore spaces, although the effects may change over a longer period as water contents decrease with moisture recovery. The moisture recovery from the unsaturated zone through the injection of warm air appears to be a feasible proposition from this study that should be demonstrated through a pilot scale experiment in the field."
"Subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma (SPTCL) is a rare subtype of T-cell lymphomas with a characteristic feature of subcutaneous nodules associated with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). Treatment options for SPTCL are mainly chemotherapy (CMT) or immunosuppressive agents with selection currently dependent on physician decisions. Outcomes between the 2 treatment remedies have not yet been comprehensively compared. This study aimed to compare complete remission (CR) rates between SPTCL patients receiving cyclosporin (CSA)-based regimen (CSA +/- steroid) and CMT. The 5-year overall survival (OS) and 5-year progression free survival (PFS) were also analyzed. Clinical data from patients with SPTCL were drawn from the Thai Lymphoma Study Group registry who were newly diagnosed between 2007 and 2023. A total of 93 patients were selected with 45 cases having received CSA-based regimen and 48 cases having received CMT. There were more patients with limited stage at skin in the CSA group (63.8% vs. 36.2%, p = 0.003), while more patients with hepato- and/or splenomegaly were found in the CMT group (56.2% vs. 24.5%; p = 0.002). Germline HAVCR2 mutations were detected in 26/33 (78.8%) cases. The CR rate was significantly higher in patients treated with CSA (87% vs. 58.3%; OR = 6.5 [95%CI, 2.7-15.3]; p = 0.002). At a median follow-up of 87.8 months (range 0-185), the 5-year OS (98% vs. 87%, p = 0.19) and PFS (72.4% vs. 69.2%, p = 0.19) showed a trend favoring patients treated with CSA. Based on our study, CSA-based regimens are the preferred first-line treatment remedy for newly diagnosed SPTCL, especially in patients with limited cutaneous involvement."
"Metabolomic microbiome research has become an important topic for understanding agricultural, ecological as well as health correlations. Only the determination of both the non-volatile and the volatile organic compound (mVOC) production by microorganisms allows a holistic view for understanding the complete potential of metabolomes and metabolic capabilities of bacteria. In the recent past, more and more bacterial headspaces and culture media were analyzed, leading to an accumulation of about 3500 mVOCs in the updated mVOC 4.0 database, including compounds synthesized by the newly discovered non-canonical terpene pathway. Approximately 10% of all mVOCs can be assigned with a biological function, some mVOCs have the potential to impact agriculture in the future (e.g. eco-friendly pesticides) or animal and human health care. mVOC 4.0 offers various options for exploring extensively annotated mVOC data from different perspectives, including improved mass spectrometry matching. The mVOC 4.0 database includes literature searches with additional relevant keywords, making it the most up-to-date and comprehensive publicly available mVOC platform at: http://bioinformatics.charite.de/mvoc."
"Model-based dose calculation algorithms (MBDCA), such as the Advanced Collapsed cone Engine (ACE) in Oncentra Brachy® can be used to overcome the limitations of the TG-43 formalism. ACE is a point kernel superposition algorithm that calculates the total dose separated into primary, first-scatter, and multiple-scatter dose. Albeit ACE yields accurate results under most circumstances, several studies have reported underestimations of the dose to cortical bone. These underestimations are likely caused by approximations in the handling of multiple-scatter dose for non-water media. Such would result in noticeable deviations where the multiple-scatter is a considerable fraction of the total dose, that is, at greater distances from the source."
"Obesity and overweight are chronic conditions characterized by excessive adiposity that negatively impact health. They are among the most significant risk factors for respiratory failure, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension. Genetic factors may contribute to some of these conditions, but they are mainly associated with the lifestyle in the majority. However, neither genetics nor lifestyle can fully explain all cases. Recent studies have proven that microRNA-21 causes the systemic hypertension, many cardiac pathologies, and some cancers. MicroRNA-21 is viewed as an important future biomarker for many critical conditions. We explored the role of microRNA-21 in the causation of overweight and obesity. There is conflicting data about this association in the literature. Determining if there is an association may help us in better understanding and managing this condition."
"Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have the potential for novel treatments of several musculoskeletal conditions due to their ability to differentiate into several cell lineages including chondrocytes, adipocytes and osteocytes. Researchers are exploring whether this could be utilized for novel therapies for joint afflictions. The role of gender in the ability of MSCs to differentiate and proliferate into different cells has not been clearly defined. This systematic review aims to report the current literature on studies, characterized by high quality and in-depth analysis even though quantitatively limited, that have looked at the role of gender in the differentiation and proliferation of MSCs. Sixteen studies were identified during the literature search, reporting 533 patients, of which 202 were male and 331 were female. MSC proliferation, phenotypic analysis and differentiation are reported and contrasted in terms of donor gender. Heterogeneity in methodologies across studies likely contributes to the inconclusive findings presented here, with no discernible statistical disparity observed between genders in differentiation traits. Nevertheless, the proliferation results indicate a notable gender-related impact. Future investigations should aim to ascertain the potential influence of gender on MSC proliferation capacities more conclusively, emphasizing the necessity of standardized protocols for MSC analyses to enhance accuracy and comparability across studies."

"Prediabetes and diabetes are common and serious public health problems, and high blood glucose can lead to serious cardiovascular complications. The purpose of this article was to explore the link between CVH levels and the incidence of prediabetes and diabetes in people over 20 years old, and whether serum vitamin D status could alter this relationship."
"This study assesses radiation doses in cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) procedures in Sri Lanka, with the goal of establishing initial diagnostic reference levels (DRLs). Data from 1162 retrospective scans across four institutions were analyzed, and the medians of the pooled dose distribution for seven clinical indication categories were presented as the DRL values. The proposed DRLs based on clinical indications are 1013 mGy·cm2 for pathological conditions including cysts, tumors, and lesions, 1307 mGy·cm2 for implant planning, 1266 mGy·cm2 for presurgery assessment, and 1585 mGy·cm2 for evaluation of sinus and nasal pathology, temporomandibular disorder, and facial trauma. Considerable variability in doses across facilities was observed, driven by differences in equipment and imaging practices. Therefore, this study recommends adopting suggested DRL values as benchmarks, standardizing protocols to reduce dose variability, and implementing a national framework for regular updates of DRL values."
"Synucleinopathies, such as Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and multiple system atrophy, are characterized by the aggregation of α-synuclein. Variations in brain distribution allow for differentiation among these diseases and facilitate precise clinical diagnosis. However, distinguishing between synucleinopathies and Parkinsonism with tauopathies poses a challenge, significantly impacting clinical drug development. Therefore, molecular imaging is crucial for synucleinopathies, particularly for clinical diagnosis, assessment of drug efficacy, and disease surveillance. In recent years, advances in molecular imaging have led to rapid development of α-synuclein-specific tracers for positron emission tomography (PET), most of which are still in pre-clinical stages. Interestingly, some of these tracers share similar compound skeletal structures and are currently undergoing optimization for clinical application. Despite this progress, there remain challenges in developing α-synuclein tracers. This review summarizes recent findings on promising PET tracers and discusses representative compounds' characteristics while offering suggestions for further research orientation."
"Accurate analysis of anxiety behaviors in animal models is pivotal for advancing neuroscience research and drug discovery. This study compares the potential of DeepLabCut, ZebraLab, and machine learning models to analyze anxiety-related behaviors in adult zebrafish. Using a dataset comprising video recordings of unstressed and pre-stressed zebrafish, we extracted features such as total inactivity duration/immobility, time spent at the bottom, time spent at the top and turn angles (large and small). We observed that the data obtained using DeepLabCut and ZebraLab were highly correlated. Using this data, we annotated behaviors as anxious and not anxious and trained several machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Random Forests, Naive Bayes Classifiers, and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). The effectiveness of these machine learning models was validated and tested on independent datasets. We found that some machine learning models, such as Decision Tree and Random Forests, performed excellently to differentiate between anxious and non-anxious behavior, even in the control group, where the differences between subjects were more subtle. Our findings show that upcoming technologies, such as machine learning models, are able to effectively and accurately analyze anxiety behaviors in zebrafish and provide a cost-effective method to analyze animal behavior."
This study aimed to characterise the clinical and epidemiological profiles of dengue patients and their outcomes during an ongoing outbreak in a non-endemic region of Bangladesh.
"Linking patients living with chronic, diet-related diseases and food insecurity to charitable food assistance, medically tailored groceries (MTGs) and food resource coaching may empower patients to better manage their health in a way that is economically sustainable. This protocol paper describes the implementation of a study evaluating MTGs and food resource coaching in a food pantry setting."
"A number of studies have compared Alzheimer's disease (AD), the commonest form of dementia, based on their age of onset, i.e. before the age of 65 years (early-onset AD, EO-AD) to those developing after 65 years of age (late-onset AD, LO-AD), but the differences are not clear. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare clinical characteristics between EO-AD and LO-AD."
"X chromosome inactivation (XCI) is a female-specific process in which one X chromosome is silenced to balance X-linked gene expression between the sexes. XCI is initiated in early development by upregulation of the lncRNA Xist on the future inactive X (Xi). A subset of X-linked genes escape silencing and thus have higher expression in females, suggesting female-specific functions. One of these genes is the highly conserved gene Kdm6a, which encodes a histone demethylase that removes methyl groups at H3K27 to facilitate gene expression. KDM6A mutations have been implicated in congenital disorders such as Kabuki Syndrome, as well as in sex differences in development and cancer."
"A unique collaboration of multi-disciplinary experts from the European Association of Dermato-Oncology (EADO), the European Dermatology Forum (EDF), and the European Organization of Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) was formed to make recommendations on cutaneous melanoma diagnosis and treatment, based on systematic literature reviews and the experts' experience. Cutaneous melanomas are excised with one to two-centimeter safety margins. For a correct stage classification and treatment decision, a sentinel lymph node biopsy shall be offered in patients with tumor thickness ≥ 1.0 mm or ≥ 0.8 mm with additional histological risk factors, although there is as yet no clear survival benefit for this approach. Therapeutic decisions should be primarily made by an interdisciplinary oncology team (""Tumor Board""). Adjuvant therapies can be proposed in completely resected stage IIB-IV. In stage II only PD-1 inhibitors are approved. In stage III anti-PD-1 therapy or dabrafenib plus trametinib for patients with BRAFV600 mutated melanoma can be discussed. In resected stage IV, nivolumab can be offered, as well as ipilimumab and nivolumab, in selected, high-risk patients. In patients with clinically detected macroscopic, resectable disease, neoadjuvant therapy with ipilimumab plus nivolumab followed complete surgical resection and adjuvant therapy according to pathological response and BRAF status can be offered. Neoadjuvant therapy with pembrolizumab followed by complete surgical resection and adjuvant pembrolizumab is also recommended. For patients with disease recurrence after (neo) adjuvant therapy, further treatment should consider the type of (neo) adjuvant therapy received as well as the time of recurrence, i.e., on or off therapy. In patients with irresectable stage III/IV disease systemic treatment is always indicated. For first line treatment PD-1 antibodies alone or in combination with CTLA-4 or LAG-3 antibodies shall be considered. In stage IV melanoma with a BRAFV600 mutation, first-line therapy with BRAF/MEK inhibitors can be offered as an alternative to immunotherapy, in selected cases. In patients with primary resistance to immunotherapy and harboring a BRAFV600 mutation, this therapy shall be offered as second line. Other second line therapies include therapy with tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and combinations of immune checkpoint inhibitors not used in first line. This guideline is valid until the end of 2026."
"The postpartum period provides an opportunity for birthing people with opioid use disorder (OUD) to consider their future reproductive health goals. However, the relationship between the use of medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) and contraception utilization is not well understood. We used multistate administrative claims data to compare contraception utilization rates among postpartum people with OUD initiating buprenorphine (BUP) versus no medication (psychosocial services receipt without MOUD (PSY)) in the United States (US)."
"The increasing use of ChatGPT in clinical practice and medical education necessitates the evaluation of its reliability, particularly in geriatrics."
"The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the efficacy of ultrasonic subgingival curettage in conjunction with antibacterial polypeptide periodontal gel in the management of chronic periodontitis of moderate to severe severity. Methods included dividing 500 hospitalised patients with moderate to severe chronic periodontitis evenly between an observation group and a control group. Subgingival ultrasonic curettage was performed on the placebo group. The non-treatment group received ultrasonic subgingival curettage and a periodontal gel rinse containing polypeptides. Results were compared before and after treatment in terms of the periodontal index, inflammation in the gingival crevicular fluid, and occlusal and masticatory efficiency. Both groups saw significant reductions in occlusal duration and occlusal force balance after treatment compared to pre-treatment levels, though the observation group saw a more dramatic decrease in these indices than the control group with P ≤ 0.05. The treatment and observation groups both saw significant reductions in the masticatory efficiency standard deviation afterward, but the index in the observation group was significantly lower than that of the control group with P ≤ 0.05.The authors claim that moderate to severe chronic periodontitis can be effectively treated with a combination of polypeptide periodontal gel and ultrasonic subgingival curettage. Substantial decreases from pre-treatment levels for both groups, with the Observation Group's index being significantly lower than the Control Group's index (P ≤ 0.05). It is possible that this treatment will help reduce inflammation and improve your periodontal health. Biting strength and occlusion stability can both be improved at the same time to help patients improve their chewing efficiency. Therefore, this method can be used securely in real-world patient care settings."
"Patients with high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) are virtually insensitive to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) employed as standalone therapeutics, at least in part reflecting microenvironmental immunosuppression. Thus, conventional chemotherapeutics and targeted anticancer agents that not only mediate cytotoxic effects but also promote the recruitment of immune effector cells to the HGSOC microenvironment stand out as promising combinatorial partners for ICIs in this oncological indication."
"Reexamine the item structure and reliability of the Mayo-Portland Adaptability Inventory (4th ed; MPAI-4) through Rasch analysis of admission and discharge scores for a large sample of adults with acquired brain injury (ABI) who participated in various types of posthospital brain injury rehabilitation (PHBIR) programs; (2) compare differential item functioning (DIF) for traumatic brain injury (TBI), stroke and other ABI; and (3) explore the viability of more specific subscales in addition to the established indices."
"The donor organ shortage is still a ""bottleneck"" problem in the field of liver transplantation, and has been limiting the development of liver transplantation. In order to effectively expand the source of donor organs, transplant experts have also been thinking about technological innovation to solve this outstanding problem. Split liver transplantation is an effective strategy to solve the difficult problem, and it is a highly focused and applied technology in the transplantation field in recent years. However, the perioperative complication rate of split liver transplantation is still high. In order to further improve the perioperative management of split liver transplantation, the Enhanced Recovery after Surgery Committee of the Chinese Research Hospital Association organized experts from multiple disciplines and formulated the consensus to improve the perioperative management of split liver transplantation and further demonstrated and formulated this consensus according to the principles of evidence-based medicine. This consensus provides recommendations from three aspects: preoperative evaluation, intraoperative operation, and postoperative management, in order to provide reference for centers that are conducting or planning to conduct split liver transplantation."
"Puppy play is a kink activity, in which people dress as, take on the role of, and mimic the physical and emotional behaviours of young canines or pups. We explore how the pup identity, depicted in cellphilms by queer men who are part of the pup community, influences men's body image perceptions using multimodal critical discourse analysis. Participants expressed feelings of dissonance, shame, and self-rejection when viewing themselves as humans, but conveyed excitement, pleasure, and self-celebration when viewing themselves as pups. Participants depicted their body images being transformed by way of puppy gear, puppy spaces, handlers, and playmates, which was said to foster more (self-)acceptance, playfulness, and freedom. This study highlights the potential for puppy play to provide a transformative experience for individuals, allowing participants to explore, re-signify, and embrace their bodies as pups."
"Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is accompanied by a decreased 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) and vitamin D binding protein (DBP). High parathyroid hormone (PTH) is associated with elevated interleukin-6 (IL-6) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), yet the effect of parathyroidectomy (PTX) on DBP and cytokines is not clear. This study aims to prospectively evaluate the effect of PTX on inflammatory profiles, total and free 25OHD, and DBP in patients with PHPT."
"Diagnostic stewardship is a set of clinically based changes to the ordering, processing, and reporting of diagnostic tests designed to improve patient outcomes (through decreased inappropriate testing, and reduced patient harm from wrong, delayed, or missed diagnosis). It shares a common philosophy with laboratory stewardship but has some key differences."
"Cellulitis is an acute bacterial infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue. The characteristic symptoms of the disease are an area of skin that is swollen, warmth, redness, pain, unknown borderline, tends to expand, and can lead to tissue necrosis. Hyperbaric Oxygen (HBO) is a non-drug treatment, which has the effect of relieving pain, reducing edema, and accelerating the wound healing process for patients with cellulitis. This study aims to evaluate the results of treating patients with cellulitis by HBO."
"Inadequate dewatering technologies are reported as the dominant challenge in handling faecal sludge (FS) within urban settings of most African countries. Studies have been carried out to evaluate the efficiencies of unplanted sand drying beds (USDBs), decentralized wastewater treatment systems (DEWATS), and geo-tubes. However, limited information is available on comparative capabilities in dewatering the FS. This work reviewed treatment efficiencies by assessing the reported actual waste removal capacities and ascertaining if they align with the design removal provisions. Peer-reviewed papers, books, and technical reports from trusted sources were examined. The results show that all the technologies perform best in dewatering the FS; however, USDBs are widely adopted for city-wide treatment, and the other two are suited for decentralized communities. The USDB is challenged by frequent clogging and poor quality of dewatered sludge when reused or recycled in the production of solid fuel and compost due to sticking sand after sludge harvesting. The DEWATS and geo-tubes increase operational costs when used to treat the FS at a large scale. More studies should be conducted to explore locally made, cost-effective filter media and technologies to enhance the dewatering quality and quantity of the FS and increase the quality of recycled by-products."
"Wheat straw contains a high amount of lignin, hindering the action of cellulase and hemicellulase enzymes, leading to difficulties in nutrient absorption by animals from straw feed. However, currently, the biological treatment of straw relies primarily on fungal degradation and cannot be directly utilized for the preparation of livestock feed. This study focuses on enzymatic co-fermentation of wheat straw to produce high-protein, low-cellulose biological feed, integrating lignin degradation with feed manufacturing, thereby simplifying the feed production process. After the optimization using Box-Behnken Design for the feed formulation, with a glucose oxidase addition of 2.46%, laccase addition of 3.4%, and malonic acid addition of 0.6%, the wheat straw feed prepared in this experiment exhibited a true protein content of 9.35%. This represented a fourfold increase compared to the non-fermented state, and the lignocellulose degradation rate of wheat straw reached 45.42%. These results not only highlight the substantial enhancement in protein content but also underscore the significant advancement in lignocellulose breakdown. This formulation significantly enhanced the palatability and nutritional value of the straw feed, contributing to the industrial development of straw feed."
"A potential link has been reported between skin exposure to aromatic amines, such as ortho-toluidine (OT) and 3,3'-dichloro-4,4'-diaminodiphenylmethane (MOCA), and bladder cancer cases observed in Japanese chemical factories. To evaluate this association, we explored the permeability of OT and MOCA through pig skin and investigated the subsequent changes in plasma and urine concentrations in rats following percutaneous exposure. Employing Yucatan micropig skin, we first executed a permeability test by affixing the skin to a diffusion cell and applying 14C-labeled OT or MOCA. The receptor fluid's radioactivity was quantified at intervals of 1, 3, 6, 8, 24, and 48 h after application using a liquid scintillation counter. Next, we applied lint cloths drenched in OT and MOCA solutions to the backs of 7-week-old male F344 rats and monitored plasma and urine concentrations over time. Additionally, we investigated the pharmacokinetics of 14C-labeled OT or MOCA solutions for 8 h following percutaneous administration. Both OT and MOCA demonstrated high skin penetration; in particular, plasma concentrations significantly rose at 6 h for OT and 8 h for MOCA after exposure. However, OT was rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream and swiftly excreted into the urine, indicating quick absorbability. In contrast, MOCA penetrated the skin quickly but exhibited delayed bloodstream entry and urinary excretion, suggesting slower absorbability. Pharmacokinetic findings revealed the rapid urinary excretion of OT, whereas MOCA was excreted in the urine and potentially in the feces as well via bile. These findings indicate that implementing measures based on chemical absorbability could significantly enhance the management of industrial chemicals where percutaneous absorbability is a concern."
"Human induced pluripotent stem cells derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) can recapitulate the properties of human cardiomyocyte and exhibit disease phenotypes in vitro, attributable to their healthy- or patient-specific genetic backgrounds. Therefore, hiPSC-CMs are a crucial tool for developing therapeutic agents for cardiovascular diseases, and regenerative medicine using hiPSC-CMs is expected to be an alternative therapy to heart transplantation. Moreover, the development of organoid models has been advanced to replicate the complex structure of heart tissue in vitro, thereby effectively facilitating drug discovery. On the other hand, current methods for advancing drug discovery using hiPSC-CMs face limitations, including the difficulty of quantifying characteristics such as cell structure and predicting the risk and efficacy of candidate drug in clinical practice. In the field of regenerative medicine, challenges include quality control and the verification of safety of transplanted cells in human.

This review outlines the current status and challenges of drug discovery using hiPSC-CMs and in silico model, based on the published reports."
"Plastic pollution is a significant environmental challenge of contemporary age. Polystyrene (PS), among the most commonly used plastic polymers worldwide, is highly durable and difficult to degrade. Despite various disposal strategies, PS continues to impact biodiversity, human health, and ecosystems. Recently, the scientific community has focused on the potential role of microorganisms for plastic biodegradation, particularly those from the gut of plastivorous insects. In a previous study, three bacterial strains, each representing a distinct taxonomic group (Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, and Stenotrophomonas), were isolated from Alphitobius diaperinus larvae after rearing on a PS diet and enriched in a medium with PS as the sole carbon source. The Stenotrophomonas sp. strain, here identified as S. indicatrix, showed the greatest potential for PS degradation. The present study investigates the genetic profile of the newly isolated S. indicatrix strain DAI2m/c through genome sequencing, to identify enzyme-encoding genes involved in the intracellular metabolic pathways responsible for the biodegradation of the styrene monomer. Our findings indicate that the genome of S. indicatrix strain DAI2m/c encodes all enzymes required for one of the two recognized styrene degradation pathways, suggesting its ability to convert styrene into byproducts that are then utilized for cellular energy production."
"Molecular structure prediction and homology detection offer promising paths to discovering protein function and evolutionary relationships. However, current approaches lack statistical reliability assurances, limiting their practical utility for selecting proteins for further experimental and in-silico characterization. To address this challenge, we introduce a statistically principled approach to protein search leveraging principles from conformal prediction, offering a framework that ensures statistical guarantees with user-specified risk and provides calibrated probabilities (rather than raw ML scores) for any protein search model. Our method (1) lets users select many biologically-relevant loss metrics (i.e. false discovery rate) and assigns reliable functional probabilities for annotating genes of unknown function; (2) achieves state-of-the-art performance in enzyme classification without training new models; and (3) robustly and rapidly pre-filters proteins for computationally intensive structural alignment algorithms. Our framework enhances the reliability of protein homology detection and enables the discovery of uncharacterized proteins with likely desirable functional properties."
College students are at higher risk for problematic substance use and disordered eating. Few studies have examined the comorbid risks associated with OCD despite the increased prevalence of OCD among young adults. This study examined substance use and disordered eating risk associated with OCD conditions among college students and how this association may vary by sex/gender.
"The complex and heterogeneous genomic landscape of multiple myeloma (MM) and many of its clinical and prognostic implications remains to be understood. In other cancers, such as breast cancer, using whole-exome sequencing (WES) and molecular signatures in clinical practice has revolutionized classification, prognostic prediction, and patient management. However, such integration is still in its early stages in MM. In this study, we analyzed WES data from 35 MM patients to identify potential mutational signatures and driver mutations correlated with clinical and cytogenetic characteristics. Our findings confirm the complex mutational spectrum and its impact on previously described ontogenetic and epigenetic pathways. They show TYW1 as a possible new potential driver gene and find no significant associations of mutational signatures with clinical findings. Further studies are needed to strengthen the role of mutational signatures in the clinical context of patients with MM to improve patient management."
"This data descriptor presents a comprehensive and replicable dataset and method for calculating the cervical range of motion (CROM) utilizing quaternion-based orientation analysis from Delsys inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors. This study was conducted with 14 participants and analyzed 504 cervical movements in the Sagittal, Frontal and Horizontal planes. Validated against a Universal Goniometer and tested for reliability and reproducibility. Analysis showed strong validity in the sagittal plane (R = 0.828 ± 0.051) and moderate in the frontal (R = 0.573 ± 0.138), with limitations in the horizontal plane (R = 0.353 ± 0.122). Reliability was high across all planes (Sagittal: ICC = 0.855 ± 0.065, Frontal: ICC = 0.855 ± 0.015, Horizontal: ICC = 0.945 ± 0.005). Our model for CROM measurements is a valuable tool aiding diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring of cervical spine conditions. This study presents an accessible analysis process for biomechanical assessments in cervical and spinal fields. The dataset herein serves as a benchmark for state-of-the-art machine learning models predicting head/neck position, analyzing smoothness of movements, measuring standard motion patterns, and calibrating drift based on movement comparisons."
"Beak deformation, known as avian keratin disorder (AKD), can impair feeding and preening of birds, reducing their survival. This disorder is apparently caused by Poecivirus infection, although to date, the viral origin has been corroborated in only a few North American bird species. Considering that fruit-eating birds can track spatiotemporal variations in fruit abundance and that AKD may have a viral origin, the incidence of this disease can be expected to increase with flocking by birds. Therefore, we evaluated if austral thrushes (Turdus falcklandii) were attracted to urban areas when exotic plants offered fruits and if flocking of thrushes in urban areas increased the spread of AKD in this species in a Patagonian town. We fitted GPS loggers on some individuals with normal beaks in rural areas and found that they visit the town in fall. Through point count censuses, we recorded greater abundances of thrushes with normal and deformed beaks during fall-winter in urban sites than in rural sites. However, the abundance of birds with AKD declined more (78-87%) than that of individuals with normal beaks (44-52%) during the transition from fall-winter to spring-summer. In urban zones in our study area, fruits of exotic species ripen during fall, attracting austral thrushes from rural sites. Nevertheless, such an attraction for food resources may be an ecological trap for this species, as the increase in incidence of AKD in urban areas may drastically reduce the survival of birds during the most unfavorable period of the year."
"The extracellular calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) is a multifunctional receptor proposed as a possible drug target for inflammatory bowel disease. We showed previously that CaSR inhibition with NPS 2143, a negative allosteric modulator of the CaSR, somewhat ameliorated the symptoms of chemically induced severe colitis in mice. However, it was unclear whether the potential of CaSR inhibition to reduce colitis may have been overshadowed by the severity of the induced inflammation in our previous study. Therefore, we tested if CaSR inhibition could prevent medium-grade colitis."

"The introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors has considerably improved the life expectancy (LE) for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Evaluating health-related quality of life within the treatment pathway remains crucial. Using the Swedish CML register, we included 991 adult patients with chronic-phase (CP) CML diagnosed 2007 to 2017, with follow-up until 2018. We developed a multistate model to estimate the loss in LE (LLE) and loss in quality-adjusted life expectancy (LQALE) for the patient population compared to the general population, along with the respective proportions of losses relative to the general population. All patients with CP-CML had a relatively low reduced LE but with larger LQALE. The maximum LLE within age/sex subgroups was 5.7 years (general population LE: 43.2 years vs. CP-CML LE: 37.5 years) for females diagnosed at age 45 years, with LQALE of 12.0 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) (general population QALE: 38.2 QALYs vs. CP-CML QALE: 26.3 QALYs). Across all ages, the proportions of LLE ranged from 9% to 15%, and the proportions of LQALE were 29% to 33%. Despite a low LLE, our findings reveal a greater LQALE for patients with CP-CML. Further improvements in management of CP-CML are thus warranted to successfully address the prevailing medical needs."
"Biomarker-based screening enables early detection of AL amyloidosis in intermediate/high-risk MGUS patients. Our study shows that identifying pre-symptomatic AL through biomarker longitudinal monitoring allows early treatment, leading to significant organ function recovery."
"Leprosy is an infectious disease classified as Neglected Tropical Disease (NTD) by the World Health Organization (WHO). Its diagnosis is challenging, relying on clinical symptoms and invasive procedures. Delays can cause severe physical disability, including hand, foot, and eye impairments. Herein, we describe the development of a magneto-immunoassay based on an electrochemical disposable microfluidic device for the serological diagnosis of leprosy. The assay makes use of magnetic particles (MPs) modified with Mycobacterium leprae mimotope as a probe to capture and separate target-specific antibodies from serum samples. The antibody anti-M. leprae was detected using the anti-human antibody IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase enzyme as an electrochemical maker. The magneto-immunoassay was applied in serum samples from healthy subjects and patients diagnosed with leprosy classified as paucibacillary (PB) and multibacillary (MB). The results showed that the method could differentiate between negative and positive patients (AUC = 0.990) with high clinical sensitivity (91.2%) and specificity (100.0%). In addition, the assay showed the capability to differentiate between paucibacillary and multibacillary with sensitivities of 88.9% and 93.7%, respectively, indicating that the device can be used to guide the treatment of positive cases. Thus, magneto-immunoassay based on the use of a disposable microfluidic device demonstrated to be a valuable tool for the early diagnosis of leprosy which can help the public health system to reduce disability cases and even control and eliminate the disease by interrupting the chain of transmission."

"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) presents a significant challenge in neuro-oncology due to its aggressive behavior and self-renewal capacity. Circular RNAs (circRNAs), a subset of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) generated through mRNA back-splicing, are gaining attention as potential targets for GBM research. In our study, we sought to explore the functional role of circMMP9 (circular form of matrix metalloproteinase-9) as a promising therapeutic target for GBM through bioinformatic predictions and human data analysis. Our results suggest that circMMP9 functions as a sponge for miR-149 and miR-542, both upregulated in GBM based on microarray data. Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that reduced levels of miR-149 and miR-542 correlate with worse survival outcomes in GBM, suggesting their role as tumor suppressors. Importantly, miR-149 has been demonstrated to inhibit the expression of BIRC5 (baculoviral inhibitor of apoptosis repeat-containing 5 or survivin), a significant promoter of proliferation in GBM. BIRC5 is not only upregulated in GBM but also in various other cancers, including neuroblastoma and other brain cancers. Our protein-protein interaction analysis highlights the significance of BIRC5 as a central hub gene in GBM. CircMMP9 seems to influence this complex relationship by suppressing miR-149 and miR-542, despite their increased expression in GBM. Additionally, we found that circMMP9 directly interacts with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins C and A1 (hnRNPC and A1), although not within their protein-binding domains. This suggests that hnRNPC/A1 may play a role in transporting circMMP9. Moreover, RNA-seq data from GBM patient samples confirmed the increased expression of BIRC5, PIK3CB, and hnRNPC/A1, further emphasizing the potential therapeutic significance of circMMP9 in GBM. In this study, we propose for the first time a new epigenetic regulatory role for circMMP9, highlighting a novel aspect of its oncogenic function. circMMP9 may regulate BIRC5 expression in GBM by sponging miR-149 and miR-542. BIRC5, in turn, suppresses apoptosis and enhances proliferation in GBM. Nonetheless, more extensive studies are advised to delve deeper into the roles of circMMP9, especially in the context of glioma."
"Though significant research highlights higher rates of mental ill-health and substance use among trans, non-binary and gender diverse (henceforth 'trans') young people, little research has considered patterns, contextual characteristics, and correlates of co-occurring experiences of mental ill-health and substance use among trans young people. Using data from the Trans Pathways study, we used prevalence ratios and age- and gender-adjusted logistic regression models to examine prevalence and differences of co-occurring substance use (past six-month cigarette use, alcohol use, and other drug use) and contextual characteristics of substance use (past six-month solitary alcohol and/or drug use, substance use for coping) by mental ill-health (depression disorder, anxiety disorder, past 12-month self-harm thoughts and behaviours, suicidal thoughts, planning, and attempt/s). Age- and gender-adjusted models assessed associations between co-occurring depressive and anxiety disorders and recent cigarette, alcohol, and other drug use (six co-occurring items total) and 18 interpersonal stressors. Significantly increased odds of smoking or recent use of cannabis or sedatives was observed among trans young people reporting depressive disorder, anxiety disorder (aORs ranging 1.8-3.1). Trans young people who reported recent smoking or use of cannabis, inhalants, or sedatives, had 40% to 80% reduced odds of past 12-month self-harm thoughts, self-harm behaviours, suicidal thoughts, and suicide attempt/s (aORs ranging 0.2-0.6). On the other hand, solitary alcohol and/or other drug use and substance use for coping was significantly associated with increased odds of all mental ill-health outcomes. Issues with school, secure housing, and intimate partner abuse were the most robust correlates of co-occurring mental ill-health and substance use. Trans young people using substances, especially cigarettes, cannabis, and sedatives, often so do with co-occurring experiences of depression and anxiety though limited substance use in more 'social' contexts may confer benefits for preventing self-harm and suicide thoughts and behaviours. Continued research in partnership with trans young people is warranted to conceptualise more nuanced and precise conceptual parameters of trans-affirming substance use harm reduction approaches."
"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent form of sustained cardiac arrhythmia, with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) increasingly recognized for its potential role in the pathogenesis of AF through mechanisms involving atrial remodeling, inflammation, and fibrosis.

"The polymerase chain reaction (PCR), is a widely used, sensitive and reliable method for detecting pathogens. However, technical limitations may restrict its use outside sophisticated laboratories, e.g. for detecting pathogens at the site of a disease outbreak. In this study, real-time PCR reagents specific to four bacteria (Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, Francisella tularensis, and Brucella spp.) and to the Influenza A virus were dried using a vacuum oven drying method. The performance of the dried reagents stored at different temperatures, was monitored using both a standard-size and a portable real-time PCR instrument. The vacuum oven dried real-time PCR reagents were stable and retained the sensitivity for at least 14 months when stored in a refrigerator (+ 4 °C). When stored at room temperature, DNA assays remained stable for at least 10 weeks and Influenza A RNA assay for 3 weeks. These results demonstrate the feasibility of vacuum oven dried real-time PCR reagents and a portable thermocycler for the rapid and reliable detection of pathogens. The drying protocol presented here is cost-effective and easy to use, and could be applied to real-time PCR methods specific to other pathogens as well. In addition, this in-house drying protocol reduces reliance on commercial PCR tests during a time of shortage, such as that experienced during the Corovirus disease (COVID-19) crisis."
"In this post-hoc analysis of ESTHER trial, we aimed to investigate the longitudinal relationship between inflammation on MRI and the achievement of inactive disease/low disease activity in patients with axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) treated with long-term tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor etanercept."
"NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) plays a pivotal role in regulating both the canonical and non-canonical NF-κB signaling pathways, driving the expression of proteins involved in inflammation, immune responses, and cell survival. Overactivation of NIK is linked to various pathological conditions, including chronic inflammation, autoimmune diseases, metabolic disorders, and cancer progression. As such, NIK represents a compelling target for therapeutic intervention in these diseases. In this study, we explored the inhibitory potential of marine-derived compounds against NIK using integrated computational techniques, including molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and free energy calculations. By screening a library of bioactive marine compounds, we identified several promising candidates with strong binding affinity to the NIK active site. By continuously narrowing down the library at each step, we found that the compounds santacruzamate A, xanthosine, and actinonine stand out at each step by demonstrating compact binding, highly stable interactions, and the most favorable free energy profiles, indicating their potential as effective NIK inhibitors. These findings not only advance our understanding of marine compounds as valuable resources for drug discovery but also highlight their potential for the development of natural anti-inflammatory therapies targeting NIK. This study opens new avenues for future research and therapeutic development aimed at combating inflammation and cancer through NIK inhibition."
"Cognitive impairment is a common health problem among older adults. Previous studies have proven the association between sleep quality and cognitive impairment, but the specific underlying mechanisms need to be further explored. This study aimed to examine the relationship between sleep quality and cognitive impairment and the mediating effect of frailty in this relationship among the rural older adults."
"In cisplatin-induced premature ovarian failure (POF) mice, granulosa cells showed a high level of ferroptosis. Previous research has indicated that the fat mass and obesity-associated protein/activating transcription factor 4 (FTO/ATF4) axis was involved in the regulation of ferroptosis. The purpose of this study was to explore the role of the FTO/ATF4 axis in cisplatin-induced ferroptosis in granulosa cell."

"Therapeutic nucleic acids (TNAs) including antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) and small interfering RNA (siRNA) have emerged as promising treatment strategies for a wide variety of diseases, offering the potential to modulate gene expression with a high degree of specificity. These small, synthetic nucleic acid-like molecules provide unique advantages over traditional pharmacological agents, including the ability to target previously ""undruggable"" genes. Despite this promise, several biological barriers severely limit their clinical efficacy. Upon administration, TNAs primarily enter cells through endocytosis, becoming trapped inside membrane-bound vesicles known as endosomes. Studies estimate that only 1-2% of TNAs successfully escape endosomal compartments to reach the cytosol, and in some cases the nucleus, where they bind target mRNA and exert their therapeutic effect. Endosomal entrapment and inefficient nuclear localization are therefore critical bottlenecks in the therapeutic application of TNAs. This review explores the current understanding of TNA endosomal escape and nuclear transport along with strategies aimed at overcoming these challenges, including the use of endosomal escape agents, peptide-TNA conjugates, non-viral delivery vehicles, and nuclear localization signals. By improving both endosomal escape and nuclear localization, significant advances in TNA-based therapeutics can be realized, ultimately expanding their clinical utility."
"Over the past decade, precision medicine has garnered increasing attention, making significant strides in discovering new therapeutic drugs and mechanisms, resulting in notable achievements in symptom alleviation, pain reduction, and extended survival rates. However, the limited target specificity of primary drugs and inter-individual differences have often necessitated high-dosage strategies, leading to challenges such as restricted deep tissue penetration rates and systemic side effects. Material science advancements present a promising avenue for these issues. By leveraging the distinct internal features of diseased regions and the application of specific external stimuli, responsive materials can be tailored to achieve targeted delivery, controllable release, and specific biochemical reactions. This review aims to highlight the latest advancements in stimuli-responsive materials and their potential in precision medicine. Initially, we introduce disease-related internal stimuli and capable external stimuli, elucidating the reaction principles of responsive functional groups. Subsequently, we provide a detailed analysis of representative pre-clinical achievements of stimuli responsive materials across various clinical applications, including enhancements in the treatment of cancers, injury diseases, inflammatory diseases, infection diseases, and high-throughput microfluidic biosensors. Finally, we discuss some clinical challenges, such as off-target effects, long-term impacts of nano-materials, potential ethical concerns, and offer insights into future perspectives of stimuli-responsive materials."
"Folic acid (FA) plays a crucial role in various biological processes. Insufficient intake of FA during pregnancy can lead to serious clinical complications, including neural tube defect. The current study sought to assess the awareness, knowledge, and usage of FA among young females in Jazan region of Saudi Arabia. This cross-sectional descriptive study involved 472 adult females from October 1 to 9, 2023, in Jazan region, Saudi Arabia. The questionnaire of the study was randomly distributed among females. The data showed that awareness and usage of FA supplementation were poor to fair among females. Furthermore, socio-demographic variables, including age, marital status, monthly income, education levels, number of pregnancies, and current pregnancy status, were found to be associated with awareness and utilization of FA supplementation. The study highlights the need to enhance awareness and knowledge of FA supplementation among females in the Jazan region. Introducing educational programs is essential in Saudi Arabia, particularly in the Jazan region, to enhance the knowledge and awareness of FA within the community."
"Magnetic resonance images (MRIs) are a valuable tool in the study of brain tumors, and multimodal sequences provide unique insights into different aspects of brain tumors. However, in clinical practice, missing modalities are often encountered due to various factors. This makes it difficult to obtain comprehensive and reliable information related to brain tumors."
"Renal abscesses require prompt diagnosis and appropriate intervention, as they can be life-threatening. However, diagnosis based solely on clinical findings is often challenging. We present the case of a 69-year-old woman with left renal masses on follow-up computed tomography (CT) after surgery for pT2aN0M0 lung carcinosarcoma. The masses were localized only in the left kidney without suspected metastatic lesions at other sites. The patient was referred to our department for further evaluation and treatment under a diagnosis of suspected metastatic lung carcinosarcoma of the left kidney. On enhanced CT, the left renal masses, the largest of which had a diameter of 40×36 mm had thick irregular walls gradually enhanced by the contrast media and an internal low-attenuation area. The masses showed heterogeneous signal intensity with a pseudocapsule on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Clinical symptoms such as fever or costovertebral angle tenderness were absent, and blood and urine tests were not sufficiently inflammatory to suggest a renal abscess. Histopathological findings on CT-guided renal biopsy revealed only inflammatory tissue and no tumor cells. However, because lung carcinosarcoma metastatic nodules could not be ruled out, laparoscopic left nephrectomy was performed for a definitive diagnosis and curative intent. The pathological diagnosis was renal abscess without malignant lesions. Here, we present a case of renal abscess mimicking metastatic lesions in a patient with lung carcinosarcoma. Accurately differentiating renal abscesses from metastatic renal tumors before treatment is often difficult. Renal abscess diagnosis should be considered through a comprehensive evaluation of the clinical findings of individual cases."

"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are typically non-coding RNAs of 18-26 nucleotides (nts) that are produced endogenously and regulated post-transcriptionally through degradation or translational repression. Since miRNAs are evolutionarily conserved, their preservation is essential for important regulatory functions in plant development, growth, and responses to environmental stress. Sorghum bicolor (sbi) is a valuable food and fodder crop which is grown worldwide. A range of sbi miRNAs were identified so far as being connected to plant development and stress responses. Herein, we employed a variety of bioinformatics tools for miRNA profiling in sbi and a PCR-based platform for the validation of these miRNAs. In total, 74 new conserved sbi miRNAs from 52 miRNA families have been predicted. Using the psRNA Target method, 10613 different protein targets of these predicted miRNAs have been attained. These targets include 54 GO-terms which have substantial targets in the biological, molecular, and cellular processes. We particularly found that the sbi-miR1861c and sbi-miR5050 are involved to regulate sulphur compound biosynthetic process, while the significant spliceosomal complex is regulated by sbi-miR815b and sbi-miR7768b. Also, we report that the pre-ribosome, electron transport chain, cell communication, cellular respiration, protein localization, and photosynthesis are controlled by sbi-miR2907b, sbi-miR530, sbi-miR7749, sbi-miR1858a, sbi-mi7729a, and sbi-miR417, respectively. The identification and validation of these novel sbi miRNAs shall contribute a lot in improving the crop yield and ensure sustainable agriculture."
"Natural designs provide abundant inspirations for constructing structure regulated, performance enhanced and function enriched materials. An impressive 3D brush-like silk nanostructure (SNB) was designed and regulated via template-guided self-assembly approach in our previous work. While fundamental issues on template-guided self-assembly process to construct SNBs and followed by regulating flower-like silk nanostructure (SNF) mineralization have not been studied in detail yet. Robust structural effects and additional functionalities on composites construction remain hazy. Herein, current works concentrate on issues related to assembly dynamics, structural features, characteristic parameters and assembly simulation during template-guided self-assembly process. Morphologies change, transmittance, pH value, zeta-potential, ThT-induced fluorescence emission and MD simulation are measured to monitor SNBs formation, proving it's a nucleus reliance and conformation transition process. Structural superiorities of SNBs and SNFs are proved by constructing composited materials (such as membranes, hydrogels or aerogels) with cellulose or chitin derivatives, and enhanced mechanical performance, excellent viscoelastic behavior or highly porous network can be found therewith. In addition, additional functionalities such as Ag nanoparticle reducing property and anti-bacteria application are evaluated as well. This work is expected to provide guidelines and inspirations for tailoring versatile structures in controlled manners and exploiting functional features to expand silk utilization scopes."
"Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is defined as a neurodevelopmental condition. The precise underlying mechanisms remain incompletely elucidated. A body of research suggests disruptions in both the cellular architecture and neuronal function within the brain regions of individuals with ADHD, coupled with disturbances in the biochemical parameters. This study seeks to evaluate the morphological characteristics with a volume measurement of the striatal regions and a neuron density assessment within the studied areas across different developmental stages in Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats (SHRs) and Wistar Kyoto Rats (WKYs). Furthermore, the investigation aims to scrutinize the levels and activities of specific markers related to immune function, oxidative stress, and metabolism within the striatum of juvenile and maturing SHRs compared to WKYs. The findings reveal that the most pronounced reductions in striatal volume occur during the juvenile stage in SHRs, alongside alterations in neuronal density within these brain regions compared to WKYs. Additionally, SHRs exhibit heightened levels and activities of various markers, including RAC-alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase (AKT-1), glucocorticoid receptor (GCsRβ), malondialdehyde (MDA), sulfhydryl groups (-SH), glucose (G), iron (Fe), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). alanine transaminase (ALT), and aspartate transaminase (AST). In summary, notable changes in striatal morphology and elevated levels of inflammatory, oxidative, and metabolic markers within the striatum may be linked to the disrupted brain development and maturation observed in ADHD."
"Coronary artery disease (CAD) has become a dominant economic and health burden worldwide, and the role of autophagy in CAD requires further clarification. In this study, we comprehensively revealed the association between autophagy flux and CAD from multiple hierarchies. We explored autophagy-associated long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) and the mechanisms underlying oxidative stress-induced human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs) injury."
"Artificial Intelligence techniques are being used to analyse vast amounts of medical data and assist in the accurate and early diagnosis of diseases. The common brain related diseases are faced by most of the people which affects the structure and function of the brain. Artificial neural networks have been extensively used for disease prediction and diagnosis due to their ability to learn complex patterns and relationships from large datasets. However, there are some problems like over-fitting, under-fitting, vanishing gradient and increased elapsed time occurred in the course of data analysis and prediction which results in performance degradation of the model. Therefore, a complex structure perception is much essential by avoiding over-fitting and under-fitting. This empirical study presents a statistical reduction approach along with deep hyper optimization (SRADHO) technique for better feature selection and disease classification with reduced elapsed time. Deep hyper optimization combines deep learning models with hyperparameter tuning to automatically identify the most relevant features, optimizing model accuracy and reducing dimensionality. SRADHO is used to calibrate the weight, bias and select the optimal number of hyperparameters in the hidden layer using Bayesian optimization approach. Bayesian optimization uses a probabilistic model to efficiently search the hyperparameter space, identifying configurations that maximize model performance while minimizing the number of evaluations. Three benchmark datasets and the classifier models logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, K-nearest neighbour, support vector machine and Naïve Bayes are used for experimentation. The proposed SRADHO algorithm achieves 98.2% of accuracy, 97.2% of precision rate, 98.3% of recall rate and 98.1% of F1-Score value with 0.3% of error rate. The execution time for SRADHO algorithm is 12 s."

Gene Ontology (GO) and Sequence Ontology annotations were comprehensively updated, increasing GO term coverage to 75% of families. The release adds 14 new Hepatitis C Virus RNA families and completes microRNA family synchronization with miRBase, resulting in 1603 microRNA families. New data types, including FULL alignments, have been implemented. Integration with APICURON for improved curator attribution and multiple website enhancements further improve user experience. These updates significantly expand Rfam's coverage and improve annotation quality, reinforcing its critical role in RNA research, genome annotation and the development of machine learning models. Rfam is freely available at https://rfam.org."
"Paramount to human health, symbiotic bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract rely on the breakdown of complex polysaccharides to thrive in this sugar-deprived environment. Gut Bacteroides are metabolic generalists and deploy dozens of polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs) to forage diverse dietary and host-derived glycans. The expression of the multi-protein PUL complexes is tightly regulated at the transcriptional level. However, how PULs are orchestrated at translational level in response to the fluctuating levels of their cognate substrates is unknown. Here, we identify the RNA-binding protein RbpB and a family of noncoding RNAs as key players in post-transcriptional PUL regulation. We demonstrate that RbpB interacts with numerous cellular transcripts, including a paralogous noncoding RNA family comprised of 14 members, the FopS (family of paralogous sRNAs). Through a series of in-vitro and in-vivo assays, we reveal that FopS sRNAs repress the translation of SusC-like glycan transporters when substrates are limited-an effect antagonized by RbpB. Ablation of RbpB in Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron compromises colonization in the mouse gut in a diet-dependent manner. Together, this study adds to our understanding of RNA-coordinated metabolic control as an important factor contributing to the in-vivo fitness of predominant microbiota species in dynamic nutrient landscapes."
"The rapid development of delivery systems for cosmetics has revealed two critical challenges in the field: enhancing the solubility of active ingredients and ensuring the stability of natural materials used in cosmetics. Nanoemulsion technology has emerged as an indispensable solution for addressing these challenges, not only enhancing the stability of cosmetics but also improving the solubility of pharmaceuticals and active ingredients with poor solubility. Nanoemulsion formulations have reinforced stability and amended the bioavailability of hydrophobic drugs. Moreover, nanoemulsion exhibit excellent skin penetration and long-lasting effects, making them particularly appealing to consumers, especially in the cosmetic industry. This article aims to provide an overview of herbal nanoemulsion formulations as cosmetic products, covering formulation, production, and characterization. Herbal nanoemulsions is an effective, stable, and promising option for cosmetic delivery. The nanoemulsions were characterized by their key properties, such as particle size, polydisperse index (PDI), zeta potential, viscosity, stability and others. Techniques like zeta potential measurement, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electronmicroscopy (SEM) were used to analyze the surface morphology, whereas stability tests were employed to evaluate nanoemulsion performance. This review also delves into the high-energy and the low-energy methods of manufacturing nanoemulsions. Additionally, we also explore the selection of appropriate surfactants, co-surfactants, and ingredients for creating herbal nanoemulsions with desirable attributes and qualities. Overall, this review consolidates the current knowledge on herbal nanoemulsion formulations for cosmetic preparations, designs, shedding light on their effectiveness, characteristics, and stability. These formulations hold promise in overcoming challenges related to meeting the increasing demand for effective herbal nanoemulsion and high-quality cosmetic products."

"Cognitive impairment is a significant complication of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, the mechanisms underlying the development of cognitive dysfunction in individuals with T2DM remain elusive. Herein, we discussed the role of Bmal1, a core circadian rhythm-regulating gene, in the process of T2DM-associated cognitive dysfunction. We identified a marked decrease in BMAL1 levels in the hippocampus of db/db mice, followed by gain- and loss-of-function studies to explore the impact of BMAL1 on cognitive function. Our findings indicated that BMAL1 downregulation led to cognitive deficits, characterized by tau hyperphosphorylation and accumulated amyloid plaque. Conversely, BMAL1 overexpression mitigated these Alzheimer-like pathologies. Further investigation revealed that BMAL1 directly activated the transcription of Areg, thereby activating the PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β pathway and ameliorating cognitive dysfunction. Moreover, these effects of BMAL1 were attenuated by LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor. Collectively, these results underscore the significant role of BMAL1 in T2DM-associated cognitive impairment, proposing a novel intervention strategy for individuals exposed to risk factors of T2DM."
Nasal defects after skin cancer excision can often be healed by second intention in certain circumstances.
"Myocarditis is an inflammatory disease of the myocardium with heterogeneous etiology, clinical presentation, and prognosis; when it is associated with myocardial dysfunction, this identifies the entity of inflammatory cardiomyopathy. In the last few decades, the relevance of the immune system in myocarditis onset and progression has become evident, thus having crucial clinical relevance in terms of treatment and prognostic stratification. In fact, the advances in cardiac immunology have led to a better characterization of the cellular subtypes involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory cardiomyopathy, whether the etiology is infectious or autoimmune/immune-mediated. The difference in the clinical course between spontaneous recovery to acute, subacute, or chronic progression to end-stage heart failure may be explained not only by classical prognostic markers but also through immune-pathological mechanisms at a cellular level. Nevertheless, much still needs to be clarified in terms of immune characterization and molecular mechanisms especially in biopsy-proven myocarditis. The aims of this review are to (1) describe inflammatory cardiomyopathy etiology, especially immune-mediated/autoimmune forms, (2) analyze recent findings on the role of different immune cells subtypes in myocarditis, (3) illustrate the potential clinical relevance of such findings, and (4) highlight the need of further studies in pivotal areas of myocarditis cellular immunology."

Cross-sectional plasma citrulline concentration (CIT) is considered a marker of enterocyte mass. The role of CIT in clinical practice in patients with short bowel syndrome (SBS) is not clearly defined.
"Vitamin C deficiency, colloquially known as scurvy, has become rare in modern times due to the widespread availability of ascorbic acid-rich foods. Despite this, it continues to be a concern in certain at-risk populations. The purpose of this report is to describe the case of a two-year-old girl who initially presented to a pediatric dental clinic with the chief complaint of hypertrophic gingiva and bleeding. Suspecting a systemic cause, the dental team referred the patient to a hematology clinic for further evaluation. Subsequent assessments and laboratory work confirmed a diagnosis of diet-related vitamin C deficiency. Management with supplements led to the resolution of the oral manifestations and normalization of laboratory values. This report details the clinical presentation and pathophysiology of vitamin C deficiency to assist healthcare providers in recognizing signs and symptoms, ensuring timely referral and facilitating appropriate treatment. Additionally, it underscores the importance of pediatric dentists as potentially the first clinicians to encounter such cases and their role in the multidisciplinary management of these pediatric patients."
Hepatic steatosis (HS) and 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk ≥ 7.5% are associated with increased risk for cardiovascular events.
"Cancer has been associated with lower risk of dementia, although methodological issues raise concerns about the validity of this association. We recruited 31,080 men aged 65-85 years who were free of cancer and dementia, and followed them for up to 22 years. We used health record linkage to identify incident cases of cancer and dementia, and split time span to investigate this association. 18,693 (60.1%) and 6897 (22.2%) participants developed cancer and dementia during follow-up. The hazard ratio (HR) of dementia associated with cancer was 1.13 (95% CI = 1.07, 1.20) and dropped to 0.85 (95% CI = 0.80, 0.91) when 449 participants who developed dementia within 2 years were excluded. The diagnosis of cancer seems to facilitate the early detection of dementia cases. Older participants who survive cancer for 2 or more years have lower risk of receiving the diagnosis of dementia over time. The factors that mediate this association remain unclear."
"Adherence to HIV treatment regimens involves the consistent and correct intake of all prescribed medications. The implementation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) program has significantly reduced mortality among adolescents living with HIV. However, adherence to ART is lower among adolescents compared to other sub-populations and even lower in sub-Saharan Africa. The factors influencing ART adherence are context-specific and vary across countries and regions. In the Tanzanian context, there is a paucity of data regarding these factors."
"Epidemiological studies have demonstrated a causal relationship between ambient ozone (O 3 ) and mortality from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is the only outcome considered in the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021 for O 3 .

"Brucellosis is a serious public health problem worldwide and can affect any organ system. Due to brucellosis's variable clinical presentation, ranging from subclinical to fully symptomatic, and limited available information, it poses a diagnostic challenge. In this study, we reported a case series of patients with diverse presentations. In addition, we briefly described the pathophysiology and mechanisms of Brucella in the body. These case presentations will be valuable in increasing the awareness of physicians. A prompt diagnosis is crucial, as detecting some clues of the infection in its early stages can help avoid misdiagnoses."
"A 30-year-old male patient with symptomatic Mycoplasma genitalium urethritis failed treatment with oral azithromycin, 2-stage doxycycline-moxifloxacin, and minocycline.

"Artificial intelligence (AI) tools for histological diagnosis offer great potential to healthcare, yet failure to understand their clinical context is delaying adoption. IGUANA (Interpretable Gland-Graphs using a Neural Aggregator) is an AI algorithm that can effectively classify colonic biopsies into normal versus abnormal categories, designed to automatically report normal cases. We performed a retrospective pathological and clinical review of the errors made by IGUANA."
"Many studies evaluated the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor versus clopidogrel in patients with ischemic stroke; none of these trials included North African participants, and all of these trials comprised only participants who experienced transient ischemic attack (TIA) or minor stroke."
"Depression currently affects about 280 million people worldwide and its prevalence has been increasing dramatically, especially among the young and people of reproductive age, which consequently leads to an increase in antidepressant consumption. Antidepressants are associated with sexual dysfunction in both men and women; however, their role in male fertility has been scarcely studied. Fluoxetine and sertraline, two serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), are among the most prescribed antidepressants worldwide. To determine their possible effects, human sperm cells were exposed to either sertraline or fluoxetine at concentrations previously found in blood and seminal fluid of patients undergoing treatment. Spermatozoa were incubated for up to 24 h at 37°C and 5% CO 2 , and important functional parameters such as sperm motility, viability, mitochondrial membrane potential, cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, chromatin/DNA integrity, acrosome status, and tyrosine phosphorylation were assessed. At low levels, fluoxetine consistently decreased progressive motility throughout time while promoting fluctuations in ROS levels and sperm capacitation. Nevertheless, it did not affect viability, mitochondrial membrane potential, acrosome reaction nor chromatin/DNA integrity. Sertraline, on the other hand, had little to nonsignificant impact at low doses, but affected almost all tested parameters at supratherapeutic concentrations. Altogether, our results suggest that both antidepressants may impair sperm function, possibly through different mechanisms of action, but fluoxetine is the only exhibiting mild negative effects at doses found in vivo ."
"Nervous system diseases represent a significant global burden, affecting approximately 16% of the world's population and leading to disability and mortality. These conditions, encompassing both central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS) disorders, have substantial social and economic impacts. Metformin, a guanidine derivative derived from a plant source, exhibits therapeutic properties in various health conditions such as cancer, aging, immune-related disorders, polycystic ovary syndrome, cardiovascular ailments, and more. Recent studies highlight metformin's ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, stimulate neurogenesis, and provide beneficial effects in specific neurological disorders through diverse mechanisms. This review discusses the advancements in research on metformin's role and mechanisms in treating neurological disorders within both the central and peripheral nervous systems, aiming to facilitate further investigation, utilization, and clinical application of metformin in neurology."
"Currently, most assisted reproduction units transfer a single embryo to avoid multiple pregnancies. Embryologists must select the embryo to be transferred from a cohort produced by a couple during a cycle. This selection process should be accurate, non-invasive, inexpensive, reproducible, and available to in vitro fertilization (IVF) laboratories worldwide. Embryo selection has evolved from static and morphological criteria to the use of morphokinetic embryonic characteristics using time-lapse systems and artificial intelligence, as well as the genetic study of embryos, both invasive with preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidies (PGT-A) and non-invasive (niPGT-A). However, despite these advances in embryo selection methods, the overall success rate of IVF techniques remains between 25 and 30%. This review summarizes the different methods and evolution of embryo selection, their strengths and limitations, as well as future technologies that can improve patient outcomes in the shortest possible time. These methodologies are based on procedures that are applied at different stages of embryo development, from the oocyte to the cleavage and blastocyst stages, and can be used in laboratory routine."
"Congenital cystic eye (CCE) is a rare congenital ocular disease, which has been suggested to be caused by problems with optic vesicle invagination. This is characterized by the formation of intraorbital cystic lesions lined by undifferentiated neuroepithelium. However, cases involving ocular structures with varying degrees of differentiation have also been reported as CCE in humans and animals. In horses, CCE have only been reported as a case presenting as neuroepithelial-lined cysts without the formation of ocular structures. This paper describes large bilateral intraorbital cysts in a 1-day-old horse. The histopathological findings revealed that the cysts were covered by neuroepithelium with formation of the lens, ciliary body, and optic nerve, and it was diagnosed as CCE. This report provides further variations of CCE in horses."
"Similar to other malignancies, immune dysregulation is a key feature of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), manifesting as suppressed anti-leukemia immune cells, immune evasion by leukemia blasts, and disease progression. Various immunosuppressive factors within the AML microenvironment contribute to the weakening of host immune responses and the efficacy of cellular immunotherapy. To address these challenges, strategies targeting immunosuppressive elements within the AML microenvironment aim to bolster host or adoptive immune effector cells, ultimately enhancing leukemia treatment. Additionally, the off-target effects of certain targeted drugs (venetoclax, sorafenib, ivosidenib, etc.) may also positively impact anti-AML immunity and immunotherapy. This review provides an overview of the immunosuppressive factors present in AML microenvironment and the strategies developed to rescue immune cells from immunosuppression. We also outline how targeted agents can alter the immune landscape in AML patients, and discuss the potential of targeted drugs to benefit host anti-leukemia immunity and immunotherapy for AML."

"After the maturity period, human bones will experience aging changes such as decreased bone mass, abnormal trabecular structure and increased bone fragility. In recent years, with the development of aging research, research on bone aging markers has increased. Primary osteoporosis, which is related to aging, also belongs to the category of bone aging. This article will review the knowledge related to aging, bone aging markers and osteoporosis to explain the interrelationships between them, and combine some research progress to propose to learn from the bone aging markers research in the field of osteoporosis research. Combining bone aging markers and osteoporosis, the discussion around aging, bone aging, and osteoporosis will provide new ideas for further research on osteoporosis."
"Bacterial infections commonly complicate cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), worsening the disease and delaying healing. Despite this, there is a gap in research concerning the characteristics of pathogenic microorganisms associated in CL patients. This study aims to identify bacterial isolates and drug susceptibility patterns in CL patients. A purposive cross-sectional study was conducted among CL patients attending the ALERT hospital from January 2021 to June 2021. Standardized questionnaires were used to collect socio-demographic and clinical data. Each patient's lesion was aseptically sampled with two swabs. The swabs were aseptically inoculated onto blood agar plates (BAP) and Mac Conkey agar (MAC) and cultured following standard protocols. The isolates were identified by gram staining, colony morphology, and biochemical testing. Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns were done using the disk diffusion technique according to 2021 CLSI guidelines. SPSS version 20 was used to enter and analyze data. In this study 384 CL patients (66.9% male), aged 2-85 years were enrolled. 390 pathogenic bacteria were isolated from CL lesions, with 58.0% and 42.0% Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, respectively. S aureus (41.5%), coagulase-negative Staphylococci (14.4%), Citrobacter spp. (10.8%), Klebsiella spp. (9.9%), and Proteus spp. (7.9%) were the most commonly identified bacteria. Over 80% of the isolates demonstrated multi-drug resistance to two or more antibiotics. S. aureus showed high resistance to penicillin (86.4%), methicillin (83.9%), and tetracycline (47.5%). These findings highlight the critical needs of microbial diagnostics and antibiotic susceptibility testing in CL patients due to the rising prevalence of drug-resistance, including the multi-drug resistant bacteria."
"The development of evidence-based treatments relies on accurate theoretical frameworks sensitive to the lived realities of the populations from which they are derived. Yet, the perspectives of Black youth are vastly underrepresented in extant theories of suicidal behavior. Cultural Consensus Modeling provides an evidence-based approach for developing a culturally informed understanding of suicide risk among Black youth."
"It is well established that central nervous system leukemia (CNSL) is an adverse prognostic factor in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), yet whether prognostic heterogeneity reside in CNSL is less addressed. Therefore, we aimed to develop potential risk classification for CNSL. We retrospectively analyzed a study in PDT-ALL-2016 pediatric-inspired cohort (N = 494). Flow cytometry (FCM) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) were tested on bone marrow (BM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The 5-year OS of 437 non-CNSL patients was 62.3% and 33.7% in 57 CNSL patients (P < 0.001). 57 CNSL including 16 primary CNS involvement and 41 CNS relapse patients were divided into 3 groups. The 5-year OS was 48.9% in patients with concordant FCM and NGS between BM and CSF, which were defined as non-clonal evolutionary CNSL, a standard-risk subgroup, while the 5-year OS was 30.2% in patients with discordant FCM or NGS between BM and CSF and isolated CNS relapse (P < 0.05), which were defined as clonal evolutionary CNSL, a high-risk subgroup. Furthermore, the mean times of lumbar punctures to achieve complete remission (CR) in CSF was 4.14 in clonal evolutionary CNSL, comparing to 1.62 in non-clonal evolutionary CNSL (P < 0.05). Based on the evidence of clonal evolution, we develop a risk stratification for CNSL for the first time."
"Fibro-osseous lesions (FOL) are benign, slow-growing lesions that are often incidentally discovered in the sinonasal cavity. They may necessitate surgical resection in patients with postobstructive sinusitis, or in cases of cranial nerve and orbital compression. We examine the recent advancements in otolaryngology relating to diagnostic characteristics and treatments for FOL, with emphasis on new technologies to improve outcomes and reduce recurrence."
"The incidence of knee osteoarthritis after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) is high to 57%, and the biomechanical abnormality during walking is one of the reasons. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of 12 weeks of knee extension constraint training on walking biomechanics during the stance phase of injured side after ACLR."
"Immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti-PD-1 antibodies, represent a significant advancement in cancer immunotherapy, but their efficacy varies notably between individuals, influenced by complex biological systems. Recent evidence suggests that sex-related biological differences play a pivotal role in modulating these responses. This study uses a systems biology approach to examine how sex-specific differences in the immune system contribute to variability in the response to treatment. Our model extends previous frameworks by incorporating sex-specific parameters that reflect observed immunological distinctions. The results from the simulation studies align with our clinical observations, showing that on average, males exhibit a more robust response to anti-PD-1 treatment compared to females. Additionally, this study explores the potential of combination therapy with recombinant IL-12, revealing sex-specific differences in treatment efficacy. These findings underscore the need for personalized immunotherapy strategies that consider individual immunological profiles, including sex, to optimize treatment outcomes."
"The norovirus (NoV), known for its high contagion rate, is the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis. The development of a NoV vaccine is hindered by significant antigenic variation, lack of suitable models, unknown vaccine protection duration, limited human challenge studies, complex performance patterns, and the absence of a reliable in vitro cultivation system, making prevention, early detection, and control the only effective measures to mitigate outbreaks. This review aims to discuss about several norovirus biosensor for point-of-care analysis. Several innovative biosensors have been developed, including techniques such as electrochemical NoV biosensors, colorimetric NoV biosensors, fluorescence NoV biosensors, CRISPR-based NoV biosensors, and other NoV biosensors. These approaches have detected norovirus in biological samples with high sensitivity and specificity. This biosensing technique holds significant promise, not only in improving the speed and accuracy of diagnostic processes but also in strengthening the global response to norovirus infections, thereby underscoring its pivotal role in public health and disease prevention."

The relationship between pleural fluid volume and cytological diagnosis of malignancy has been often investigated with conflicting conclusions on whether or not a minimum fluid volume should be defined. The primary objective of this retrospective investigation is to evaluate the relationship between fluid volume and cytological diagnosis of malignancy.
"Construction and demolition (C&D) waste recycling plays a significant role in waste reduction and carbon reduction, which is critical for sustainable development. However, due to various limitations such as financial problems, C&D waste recycling industry is not well developed in developing countries. To address this problem, this study combines complex network theory and evolutionary game theory to analyse the diffusion of C&D waste recycling behaviour among enterprises under governmental incentive policies within a complex network context. The results demonstrate that the size of the network has limited effects on behaviour diffusion in Watts-Strogatz small-world network. Additionally, the study highlights the clear impact of governmental incentive probability, initial rate and connection degree on the diffusion path. By quantitatively investigating the effects of incentive tools, this study contributes to the knowledge of C&D waste management and provides valuable implications for stakeholders seeking to promote the diffusion of C&D waste recycling."
"Observational studies suggested a potential correlation between dietary intake and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but conflicting findings exist and causality remains unclear. Here, we performed a Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to evaluate the causal impact of relative intake of (i) carbohydrate, (ii) fat, and (iii) protein on ALS risk."
"Microfluidic technology has emerged as a prevalent tool to produce lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for nucleic acid delivery. However, its wide-ranging application is hindered by specialized, costly equipment and consumables. Herein, a ready-to-use lipid nanoparticle (RULNP) technology employing deep eutectic solvents (DESs) was developed. The DES, consisting of fructose and glycerol ([Fru][Gly]), was able to dissolve lipids and nucleic acids, facilitating the formation of RULNPs by simple physical mixing and hydrating. This innovative approach circumvents the high costs and organic solvents associated with microfluidic methods and offers flexibility in preparation techniques, accommodating various application scenarios. RULNPs exhibited physicochemical properties and plasmid DNA (pDNA) or RNA delivery efficacy comparable to those of LNPs. Mechanistic studies revealed that RULNPs achieved superior cellular uptake compared with LNPs despite exhibiting limited endosomal escape capabilities. Collectively, the DES-based RULNP system presents a rapid and straightforward method for LNP production, potentially revolutionizing nucleic acid delivery."
"Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a chronic disease, the prevalence of which has been increasing in recent years. And the prevalence of patients who test negative with existing diagnostic techniques remains high. It was found that the antigenic BCOADC-E2 protein could detect patients with a negative original test. And experiments revealed that the lipoyl domain of BCOADC-E2 plays an important role. The present study was carried out to verify the necessity of maintaining the folding conformation of the lipoyl β-sheet of the protein in the lipoyl domain during the recognition of the BCOADC-E2 protein and the importance of the glutamic acid and isoleucine residues at position 4 and position 13, respectively. In order to search for a new pathway for the pre-detection of patients with PBC, firstly, the mutant proteins were subjected to an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with serum. Then, MTSSL spin tags were positioned at specific sites of the Cys mutant and reacted with serum samples from PBC patients and controls, and EPR spectroscopic data were measured. The multiple mutant proteins all reacted less specifically with the serum than the wild-type protein in the ELISA; the spectra measured for the pGEX-BCKD-E4A-I13A mutant were severely broadened, and the compactness at the conformational position of the lipoyl β-sheet structural conformation of the proteins of amino acids 4 and 13 remained unchanged. The EPR spectral data validate the importance of the glutamate and isoleucine residues at position 4 and position 13 and their necessity in the maintenance of the lipoyl β-sheet structural conformation of proteins in the lipoyl domain in anti-BCOADC-E2 recognition."
"This study aimed to develop, assess, and test an Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) to evaluate nurses' competency in planning and managing infusion therapy. The study adopted a methodological approach with a quantitative design and was conducted from December 2020 to August 2021 at a university hospital in São Paulo, Brazil. Data collection occurred in 3 stages: development of scenarios and assessment checklists, evaluation of expert consensus, and testing scenarios with the target audience. Data analysis involved calculating the Modified Kappa coefficient. The OSCE comprised 8 clinical stations, designed based on the theoretical framework of the Vessel Health and Preservation model and the Infusion Therapy Standards of Practice, which delineate evidence-based procedures for vascular access and infusion therapy. During expert assessment and examination testing, all evaluated items demonstrated coefficient values ≥0.74. Thus, the study successfully developed evidence-based OSCE for infusion therapy, showing strong expert consensus. Testing with nurses yielded positive outcomes, affirming the effectiveness of the educational practice's design and structure."

"Fusarium oxysporum, an important soilborne fungal pathogen that causes serious Fusarium wilt disease, secretes diverse effectors during the infection. In this study, we identified a novel secreted cysteine-rich protein, FolSCP1, which contains unknown protein functional domain. Here, we characterized FolSCP1 as a secreted virulence factor that promotes the pathogen infection of host plants by inhibiting diverse plant defence responses. FolSCP1 interacted with the pathogenesis-related 5 (PR-5) protein SlPR5, a positive regulator of tomato plant immunity against multiple tomato pathogens, and effectively attenuated the antifungal activity of the tomato PR-5 protein. FoSCP1, a homologue of FolSCP1, was secreted by a F. oxysporum isolate from infected tobacco and targeted the tobacco PR-5 protein NtPR5 to suppress plant defence for further infection. In summary, our study revealed a fungal virulence strategy in which F. oxysporum secrete effectors that interfere with plant immunity by binding to the PR-5 protein of the host plant and inhibiting its biological activity, thereby promoting fungal infection."

"While microRNAs (miRs) like miR-9 are crucial for neurogenesis and neuronal differentiation, their regulatory mechanisms are not well understood. miR-9 is highly expressed in the brain and plays a significant role in neurogenesis. Using the Collaborative Cross resource, we identified significant quantitative trait loci (QTL) through genetic analyses. We then characterized over 130 candidate genes within these QTL regions using RNA interference, qPCR, and neuronal differentiation assays, narrowing them down to 13 promising candidates. Among these, Panx2, Polr1c, and Mgea5 were found to colocalize in the neurogenic niches of the SVZ and DG regions, as shown by immunofluorescence. Further ChIP-seq and Co-IP analyses revealed their interaction and binding to the miR-9 locus, forming a DNA-protein regulatory complex we termed 'miRSome-9.' A 3C/ChIP-loop assay confirmed the chromatin organization of miRSome-9 at the miR-9 locus, shedding light on the upstream mechanisms regulating miR-9 expression during neurogenesis."
"Gene expression is orchestrated by transcription factors, which function within the context of a three-dimensional genome. Zinc-finger protein 143 (ZNF143/ZFP143) is a transcription factor that has been implicated in both gene activation and chromatin looping. To study the direct consequences of ZNF143/ZFP143 loss, we generated a ZNF143/ZFP143 depletion system in mouse embryonic stem cells. Our results show that ZNF143/ZFP143 degradation has no effect on chromatin looping. Systematic analysis of ZNF143/ZFP143 occupancy data revealed that a commonly used antibody cross-reacts with CTCF, leading to its incorrect association with chromatin loops. Nevertheless, ZNF143/ZFP143 specifically activates nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes, and its loss leads to severe mitochondrial dysfunction. Using an in vitro embryo model, we find that ZNF143/ZFP143 is an essential regulator of organismal development. Our results establish ZNF143/ZFP143 as a conserved transcriptional regulator of cell proliferation and differentiation by safeguarding mitochondrial activity."
"Atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death. Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) mediates cholesterol efflux to lower the risks of atherosclerosis. Elevating circulating apoA-I is an effective strategy for atheroprotection. However, the regulatory mechanisms of apoA-I have been elusive."

We aim to explore the most recent insights into the pathogenesis of recurrent angioedema caused by different mechanisms and then focus on the management and treatment approaches available.
"Understanding the emergence of complex biochemical systems, such as protein translation, is a great challenge. Although synthetic approaches can provide insight into the potential early stages of life, they do not address the equally important question of why the complex systems of life would have evolved. In particular, the intricacies of the mechanisms governing the transfer of information from nucleic acid sequences to proteins make it difficult to imagine how coded protein synthesis could have emerged from a prebiotic soup. Here we discuss the use of intellectual frameworks in studying the emergence of life. We discuss how one such framework, namely the RNA world theory, has spurred research, and provide an overview of its limitations. We suggest that the emergence of coded protein synthesis could be broken into experimentally tractable problems by treating it as a molecular bricolage-a complex system integrating many different parts, each of which originally evolved for uses unrelated to its modern function-to promote a concrete understanding of its origin."
"Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) is a feeding and eating disorder for which there are very few evidence-based treatments. Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (CBT-AR) is a novel exposure-based treatment which is suitable for people aged ten and older. The primary aims of the study are to undertake a real-world evaluation of the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness of CBT-AR for young people aged 12-25 years old in an outpatient eating disorders service where the patient population has high levels of psychiatric comorbidity. Clinicians, patients, and parents/guardians will be involved in the evaluation. Assessments will be carried out at baseline, during weekly sessions, at the end of each treatment stage, at end of CBT-AR treatment, and at 3-month follow-up. Assessments will measure ARFID symptoms, mood, quality of life, therapeutic alliance, and feedback on the treatment. The study will take place over a 12-month period and will evaluate the use of CBT-AR within real-life clinical practice conditions, noting how and why deviations from the treatment have occurred. The findings of this research will inform future ARFID treatment delivery and the implementation of CBT-AR at outpatient mental health services."
"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are two diseases highly prevalent in the aging population and often co-occur. The exact relationship between the two diseases is uncertain, though epidemiological studies have demonstrated that CVDs appear to increase the risk of AD and vice versa. This scoping review aims to examine the current identified overlapping genetics between CVDs and AD at the individual gene level and at the shared pathway level."
"This narrative review aims to report upon the existing treatment evidence and strategies for managing lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) during treatment, including transurethral resection and intravesical therapy. This review also attempts to examine novel approaches to mitigate treatment-related lower urinary tract symptoms and improve treatment adherence."
"Uterotonics are the mainstay of management for postpartum haemorrhage and an understanding of their use is essential for the obstetric anaesthetist. First-line uterotonics comprise oxytocin and carbetocin, which act on the oxytocin receptor, and recent research has shown that lower doses of first-line uterotonics can be used to adequate effect. The oxytocin receptor is known to undergo desensitisation with exposure to the agonist over time and with increasing concentrations. Therefore, second-line uterotonics, such as ergometrine, carboprost, sulprostone or misoprostol, need to be considered earlier than they have been in past clinical practice. Choice of second-line uterotonic will vary depending on the comorbidities of the patient. This article will outline each of the available first- and second-line uterotonics, their mechanisms of action, pharmacokinetics, side effects and contraindications. Comparisons between them will also be discussed, as well as differences in superiority and guidance on dosing, based on recent evidence."
"The Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale-29 (MSIS-29) is a patient self-reported outcome (PRO) that measures patients' quality of life, and it is divided into two sub-scales for the physical (PHYS) and psychological (PSYCH) domains. This study aimed to translate the MSIS-29 into Arabic, cross-culturally adapt it, and examine its psychometric properties."
"Spinal cord injury (SCI) leads to permanent motor and sensory loss that is exacerbated by intraspinal inflammation and persists months to years after injury. After SCI, monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) infiltrate the lesion to aid in myelin-rich debris clearance. During debris clearance, MDMs adopt a proinflammatory phenotype that exacerbates neurodegeneration and hinders recovery. The underlying cause of the lipid-mediated MDM phenotype shift is unclear. Our previous work suggests that cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) plays a role in the proinflammatory potentiating effect of myelin on macrophages in vitro. Cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) frees arachidonic acid from phospholipids, generating eicosanoids that play an important role in inflammation, immunity, and host defense. cPLA2 is expressed in macrophages along with multiple other cell types after SCI, and cPLA2 inhibition has been reported to both reduce and exacerbate secondary injury pathology recovery. The role of cPLA2 in MDMs after SCI is not fully understood. We hypothesize that cPLA2 activation in MDMs after SCI contributes to secondary injury. Here, we report that cPLA2 plays an important role in the myelin-induced inflammatory macrophage phenotype in vitro using macrophages derived from cPLA2 knockout bone marrow. Furthermore, to investigate the role of cPLA2 in MDMs after SCI, we generated female bone marrow chimeras using cPLA2 knock-out donors and assessed locomotor recovery using the Basso Mouse Scale (BMS), CatWalk gait analysis system, and horizontal ladder task over six weeks. We also evaluated tissue sparing and intralesional axon density six weeks after injury. cPLA2 KO chimeras did not display altered locomotor recovery or tissue pathology after SCI compared to WT chimera controls. These data suggest that although cPLA2 plays a critical role in myelin-mediated potentiation of proinflammatory macrophage activation in vitro, it may not contribute to secondary injury pathology in vivo after SCI."
Lumbar burst fracture combined with lamina fracture is a special type of spinal fracture. Neither CT nor MRI can accurately determine it. The present study aims to investigate the clinical value of 3D CT/MRI fusion imaging in the treatment of lumbar burst fracture complicated with lamina fracture.
"Over the past two decades there has been increased interest in orphan drug development for rare diseases. However, hurdles to clinical trial design for these disorders remain. This phase 1a/1b study addressed several challenges, while evaluating the safety and tolerability of the novel oral molecule KL1333 in healthy volunteers and subjects with primary mitochondrial disease. KL1333 aims to normalize the NAD+:NADH ratio that is critical for ATP production. The trial incorporated innovative design elements with potential translatability to other rare diseases including patient involvement, adaptive design and exploratory objectives, all of which have subsequently informed the protocol of an ongoing phase 2, pivotal efficacy study of KL1333. Results indicate KL1333 is safe and well tolerated, with dose-dependent gastrointestinal side effects, and validate potential novel outcome measures in primary mitochondrial disease including the 30-s Sit to Stand, and the patient-reported fatigue scales. Importantly, the data from the trial support efficacy of KL1333 based on improvements in fatigue and functional strength and endurance. Furthermore, the study highlights the value in using phase 1 studies to capture data that helps optimize later phase efficacy trial design."
"Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are common and result in significant morbidity, mortality, and associated hospital costs. Models predicting ADRs in older adults were previously found to lack reliability and validity. This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to provide an updated, comprehensive quality assessment and analysis of ADR-risk prediction tools in older adults."
"Chitinase-3-like-1 (Chi3l1), also known as YKL-40 or BRP-39, is a highly conserved mammalian chitinase with a chitin-binding ability but no chitinase enzymatic activity. Chi3l1 is secreted by various cell types and induced by several inflammatory cytokines. It can mediate a series of cell biological processes, such as proliferation, apoptosis, migration, differentiation, and polarization. Accumulating evidence has verified that Chi3l1 is involved in diverse inflammatory conditions; however, a systematic and comprehensive understanding of the roles and mechanisms of Chi3l1 in almost all human body system-related inflammatory diseases is still lacking. The human body consists of ten organ systems, which are combinations of multiple organs that perform one or more physiological functions. Abnormalities in these human systems can trigger a series of inflammatory environments, posing serious threats to the quality of life and lifespan of humans. Therefore, exploring novel and reliable biomarkers for these diseases is highly important, with Chi3l1 being one such parameter because of its physiological and pathophysiological roles in the development of multiple inflammatory diseases. Reportedly, Chi3l1 plays an important role in diagnosing and determining disease activity/severity/prognosis related to multiple human body system inflammation disorders. Additionally, many studies have revealed the influencing factors and regulatory mechanisms (e.g., the ERK and MAPK pathways) of Chi3l1 in these inflammatory conditions, identifying potential novel therapeutic targets for these diseases. In this review, we comprehensively summarize the potential roles and underlying mechanisms of Chi3l1 in inflammatory disorders of the respiratory, digestive, circulatory, nervous, urinary, endocrine, skeletal, muscular, and reproductive systems, which provides a more systematic understanding of Chi3l1 in multiple human body system-related inflammatory diseases. Moreover, this article summarizes potential therapeutic strategies for inflammatory diseases in these systems on the basis of the revealed roles and mechanisms mediated by Chi3l1."
"Research suggests that Muslim women wearing the hijab may be particularly vulnerable to the experiences of stigmatization as the hijab represents a dominant marker of ""otherness."" Using the relational demography perspective, this paper explored the viewpoints of hijab and non-hijab-wearing Muslim women in Delhi regarding the different forms of discrimination and/or social isolation they may have experienced. Thematic analysis was used to explore the participant's narratives, gathered by means of six focus group discussions (n = 38). For the hijab-wearing group, two emergent themes were evident: ""Journey of my hijab"" and ""The two sides of the hijab."" For the non-hijab-wearing group, the emergent themes included: ""My name is (un)safe"" and ""Not Muslim enough."" The study findings can inform the development of intervention strategies to integrate the community more meaningfully by preventing ""othering"" and providing agency and autonomy."
"The risk of suicide in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) poses a major concern, with studies suggesting that genetics may be a contributing factor. Although there are many transcriptomic studies on postmortem brain tissue related to suicidal behavior, the blood transcriptional mechanisms of suicidal ideation (SI) remain unknown. This study utilized a weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) approach to investigate the associations between gene coexpression modules and SI in individuals with MDD using peripheral blood RNA-seq data from 75 MDD patients with SI (MDD_SI), 82 MDD patients without SI (MDD_nSI), and 149 healthy controls (HC). An ANCOVA was conducted to assess differences in gene coexpression modules among groups, with age and sex included as covariates. The gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) databases were used to annotate module functions. Results indicated that the magenta module (associated with RNA splicing processes) differentiated MDD_SI from MDD_nSI (p = 0.021), while the green module (related to immune and inflammatory responses) distinguished MDD_SI from HC (p = 0.004). Additionally, three modules showed differences between MDD_nSI and HC: magenta (p = 0.009), brown (related to innate immunity and mitochondrial metabolism; p = 0.001), and turquoise (associated with energy metabolism and neurodegeneration; p = 0.005). Our findings highlight that gene expression regulation, immune response, and inflammation may be linked to SI in patients with MDD, while pathways associated with innate immunity, energy metabolism, mitochondrial function, and neurodegeneration appear to be more broadly related to MDD."
"Pulmonary sequestration is a rare congenital anomaly, characterized by aberrant lung tissue supplied by an aberrant systemic artery or arteries coursing within the inferior pulmonary ligament. The intralobar variety is the most frequent form. Clinical presentation may include recurrent haemoptysis and infection. Standard treatment involves surgical resection of the affected tissue with maximal preservation of healthy lung. This video tutorial presents the surgical technique for resecting intralobar pulmonary sequestration involving the right lower lobe. Rather than attempting to skeletonize the frequently friable aberrant artery(ies), the lung is mobilized, and the inferior pulmonary ligament containing the aberrant artery is isolated before being divided en masse; in this way, one may decrease the risk of intraoperative arterial injury and haemorrhage. Subsequent lung resection is performed in the standard fashion, in this case, an S10 segmentectomy. Transarterial embolization has been described both as a definitive treatment and as a preoperative intervention to decrease the risk of intraoperative bleeding. In the case of preoperative embolization, one must be wary to avoid embolic material when positioning the vascular stapler to divide the aberrant artery."
"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the leading public health threats globally. AMR genes can be transferred between bacteria through lateral gene transfer, and AMR organisms can spread through environments by contaminated water, agriculture and animals. Thus, widespread environmental dissemination of bacteria and lateral gene transfer facilitate AMR transmission pathways. Farm environments in dairy and calf production are known to harbour AMR bacteria that pose a risk for food contamination and to workers in direct or indirect contact with animals. Escherichia coli is present in farm environments and is known to participate in lateral gene transfer, providing a good marker of resistance genes in each environment."
"Although prediction models for heart transplantation outcomes have been developed previously, a comprehensive benchmarking of survival machine learning methods for mortality prognosis in the most contemporary era of heart transplants following the 2018 donor heart allocation policy change is warranted. This study assessed seven statistical and machine learning algorithms-Lasso, Ridge, Elastic Net, Cox Gradient Boost, Extreme Gradient Boost Linear, Extreme Gradient Boost Tree, and Random Survival Forests in a post-policy cohort of 7,160 adult heart-only transplant recipients in the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR) database who received their first transplant on or after October 18, 2018. A cross-validation framework was designed in mlr. Model performance was also compared in a seasonally-matched pre-policy cohort. In the post-policy cohort, Random Survival Forests and Cox Gradient Boost had the highest performances with C-indices of 0.628 and 0.627. The relative importance of some predictive variables differed between the pre-policy and post-policy cohorts, such as the absence of ECMO in the post-policy cohort. Survival machine learning models provide reasonable prediction of 1-year posttransplant mortality outcomes and continual updating of prediction models is warranted in the contemporary era."
"This study aimed to identify factors influencing the completeness of primary and re-excision of basal cell carcinoma (BCC), cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and cutaneous carcinoma in situ (CIS) of the head and neck. A retrospective single-center analysis was conducted, encompassing 1513 instances of cutaneous tumors recorded between 2015 and 2022. This dataset comprised 1108 primary excisions and 405 re-excisions, all of which were histologically verified cases of BCC, SCC, and CIS located within the head and neck region. Correlation analyses were performed, considering variables such as patients' gender and age, tumor localization, preoperative suspicion or histological confirmation of skin tumor diagnosis, surgeons' levels of training, and the utilization of magnifying glasses. The primary objective was to assess the impact of these factors on the completeness of both primary and re-excisions of skin tumors. The analysis revealed a significant correlation between the localization of BCC and the completeness of primary excision. Specifically, the nose and ear exhibited a significantly higher rate of incomplete excisions (R1), whereas the cheek demonstrated a substantial reduction in the R1 rate. The utilization of magnifying glasses exhibited a positive correlation with the completeness of primary BCC excision. However, no discernible influencing factors were identified for BCC re-excisions and the combined group of primarily and re-excised cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and carcinoma in situ (CIS). Tumor entity and localization emerged as crucial factors influencing the completeness of skin tumor excisions, with specific anatomical sites exhibiting varying rates of incomplete procedures. Notably, the use of magnifying glasses demonstrated a significant positive correlation with reduced rates of incomplete excisions, re-excisions, and subsequent procedures, suggesting its potential as a valuable tool in enhancing surgical precision and optimizing outcomes."
"Recent studies highlight an over-representation of progressive supranuclear palsy, with atypical features, in South Asians. We offer additional insights, including an over-representation of PSP among Malaysian patients of Indian compared to other Asian ancestries. However, RBD symptoms, hallucinations, and early onset were not more frequent in Indians vs. Chinese."
"The study found a significant causal relationship between coffee intake and obsessive-compulsive disorder, showing a negative correlation. There was no causal relationship between coffee intake and other mental disorders. The sensitivity analysis test found no pleiotropy affecting the results, and no single nucleotide polymorphism had a major impact on the robustness of the results, indicating that the results are stable and reliable."
To investigate the clinical phenotype and molecular pathogenic mechanism of a hereditary coagulation factor V deficiency (FⅤD) family.
"Bcl-2, a key regulator of cellular apoptosis, is typically linked to adverse prognosis in solid tumors due to its inhibition of apoptotic cell death and promotion of cellular proliferation, leading to tumor progression. However, studies on Bcl-2 in breast cancer have shown inconsistent results, with some indicating favorable outcomes. This study aims to determine the subtype-specific role of Bcl-2 in breast cancer. Female breast cancer patients who completed primary treatment at Wonju Severance Hospital, Korea, from 2004 to 2018 were included. Clinicopathological characteristics, including Bcl-2 expression, were collected, and patients were classified based on Bcl-2 expression in more than or less than 10% of tumor cells. Kaplan-Meier curves compared recurrence-free interval (RFI) and overall survival (OS). The final cohort of 617 patients, with a mean age of 54.79 ± 11.2 years, showed no overall survival difference by Bcl-2 status (p = 0.616). In HER2-overexpressed patients, high Bcl-2 expression was linked to poor prognosis (p = 0.0021). This trend appeared in ER-positive (p = 0.297) and ER-negative (p = 0.029) subgroups. Conversely, in HER2-negative patients, Bcl-2 overexpression indicated better survival (p = 0.009), consistent in ER-positive (p = 0.259) and ER-negative (p = 0.010) subgroups. Bcl-2's impact on survival varies with HER2 status, showing poor prognosis in HER2-overexpressed and better prognosis in HER2-negative patients."
Low-carbohydrate (LC) diets have gained popularity. We compared glycaemic and metabolic parameters following an LC versus a Mediterranean (MED) diet in adolescents and youths with type 1 diabetes.
"Retinal degenerative diseases lead to irreversible vision loss due to photoreceptor cell death, driven by complex genetic and environmental factors. Ceramide, a sphingolipid metabolite, emerges as a critical mediator in the apoptotic cascade associated with retinal degeneration. Our previous work demonstrated L-Cycloserine's ability to protect photoreceptor-derived cells from oxidative stress by inhibiting the de novo ceramide pathway and thus prompting further investigation on its effect in the in vivo retina. This study investigates the potential of L-Cycloserine to protect albino BALB/c mice against light-induced retinal degeneration (LIRD). L-Cycloserine, in an optimal dose, administered systemically 30 min before LIRD, was found to prevent photoreceptor cell death significantly from light-induced degeneration. We further determined the retinal bioavailability and pharmacokinetic behavior of L-Cycloserine, its effect on sphingolipid profile, expression of sphingolipid biosynthetic, and cell death-promoting genes and proteins from the retina to understand the underlying mechanisms. This study lays the groundwork for further preclinical and clinical investigations into L-Cycloserine's potential as a novel therapeutic in treating retinal degenerative diseases."

"This paper aims to investigate the trend, spatio-temporal distribution, and socioeconomic inequality of the low birthweight rate (LBWR) in China from 1992 to 2021 and to project the LBWR to 2030. We performed a secondary analysis of data from the China Health Statistics Yearbook. LBWR refers to the ratio of the number of infants born with a birth weight less than 2,500 grams to the number of live births in a given year. We used joinpoint regression models to estimate LBWR trends from 1992 to 2021 for the whole country and from 2002 to 2021 for the three regions (eastern, central, and western regions) and each province. The slope index of inequality (SII) and relative index of inequality (RII) were calculated for each year from 2002 to 2021 based on provincial data. LBWR increased from 2.52% (1992) to 3.70% (2021), and the average annual percentage change (AAPC) (95% confidence interval [CI]) was 1.35% (0.22%, 2.49%) in China. The overall LBWR from 2002 to 2021 was greatest in the Eastern region, but LBWR had the fastest increase in the Western region, with an AAPC (95% CI) of 3.15% (2.59%, 3.12%). There were spatio-temporal differences in the LBWR and trends between provinces. The SII and RII increased linearly from -0.15 and 0.94 to 0.53 (B = 0.035%, p < 0.001) and 1.16 (B = 0.011, p < 0.01), respectively, over the past 20 years. The results of the ARIAM model showed that the National LBWR will be increasedfrom 3.70% in 2021 to 5.28% in 2030. The LBWRs in the eastern, central and western regions in 2030 will be 4.93%, 6.02% and 5.82%, respectively. National and local governments must prioritize disadvantaged groups to mitigate the rapid prevalence of LBWR, reduce regional disparities, and improve perinatal and infant health and health equity in China."
"Frailty is thought to be associated with an increased risk of adverse health outcomes such as death and falls, but comparatively little is known about the impact of frailty transitions on the adverse health outcomes. Moreover, owing to insufficient sample size or a single-center study design, previous studies have not been sufficiently representative of elderly inpatients in China. This study aimed to provide estimates at the population level of the association between frailty transitions and adverse outcomes among elderly inpatients following discharge."
"Intracellular recycling via autophagy is governed by post-translational modifications of the autophagy-related (ATG) proteins. One notable example is ATG4-dependent delipidation of ATG8, a process that plays critical but distinct roles in autophagosome formation in yeast and mammals. Here, we aim to elucidate the specific contribution of this process to autophagosome formation in species representative of evolutionarily distant green plant lineages: unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, with a relatively simple set of ATG genes, and a vascular plant Arabidopsis thaliana, harboring expanded ATG gene families. Remarkably, the more complex autophagy machinery of Arabidopsis renders ATG8 delipidation entirely dispensable for the maturation of autophagosomes, autophagic flux, and related stress tolerance; whereas autophagy in Chlamydomonas strictly depends on the ATG4-mediated delipidation of ATG8. Importantly, we also demonstrate the distinct impact of different Arabidopsis ATG8 orthologs on autophagosome formation, especially prevalent under nitrogen depletion, providing new insight into potential drivers behind the expansion of the ATG8 family in higher plants. Our findings underscore the evolutionary diversification of the molecular mechanism governing the maturation of autophagosomes in eukaryotic lineages and highlight how this conserved pathway is tailored to diverse organisms."
"The End-of-Life Dementia-Comfort Assessment in Dying (EOLD-CAD) scale is one of the few outcome instruments designed to capture symptom burden and well-being among nursing home residents with dementia; however, psychometric evaluations of the EOLD-CAD are limited. Although the instrument is often used to assess outcomes prospectively, it was originally developed and tested as a postmortem assessment. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the instrument properties of the EOLD-CAD using staff reports from a large sample of nursing home residents with cognitive impairment prior to death."
"We aimed to examine the association between relative monocytosis and the recurrence of pulmonary Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis. Clinical, laboratory, radiographic and treatment data for 86 patients with a histopathological diagnosis of Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis over a 20-year duration. Parameters such as biological sex, age at diagnosis, time to diagnosis, molecular diagnostic data and imaging were collected. Treatment responses were assessed predominantly through radiography, with RECIST 1.1 criteria applied to MRI or CT scans and PERCIST utilized for serial PET imaging. Investigators also assessed peripheral blood absolute monocyte count at various time points, including initial diagnosis and the most recently available value. While peripheral blood absolute monocyte count between the earliest assessed timepoint and latest value did not differ, the mean value on progression (0.94 K/µL), however, was significantly higher than that following re-institution of therapy (0.31, p = 0.000794. Our observation of relative monocytosis on LCH disease progression may be related to an increase in circulating LCH on disease progression or from increased monocyte production for later differentiation into mature dendritic cells that participate in MHC Class 1 upregulation. This trend is especially evident in pulmonary LCH which is incited by tissue trauma and irritation by environmental factors. The phenomena observed in our study parallel other non-LCH cohorts, specifically in published findings from our own group in patients with Rosai Dorfman and Erdheim Chester Disease. To further elucidate the molecular underpinnings of LCH and explore the etiology of this monocyte trend, expanded integrated genomic-transcriptomic sequencing analyses to evaluate the molecular character of LCH and ultimately clarify the origin of this monocyte trend are in progress. These studies are poised to offer invaluable insight to the molecular mechanisms underlying LCH, specifically as they pertain to monocyte signaling and differentiation."
"Work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WRMSDs) are a leading cause of chronic conditions among working-age adults. Preventing these disorders is crucial to reducing their impact, and quantitative analysis through sensors can help identify their causes and guide ergonomic solutions. This systematic review aims to compile research from 2000 to 2023 published in English and sourced from Web of Science, Scopus, or PubMed that examines workers' movements during tasks using wearable sensor systems that are applicable in workplace settings. The goal is to identify the job sectors that have been studied and highlight tasks lacking ergonomic risk research. A total of 111 papers were selected through a screening process across three databases, assessed using the McMaster risk of bias tool. The studies span various job sectors and report on the use of different technologies for data collection and study population sizes. The review identifies existing research on WRMSD risks utilizing wearable systems in different job sectors, drawing attention to under-researched areas that warrant further study. It serves as a foundation for future research aimed at understanding the causes of WRMSDs and developing solutions supported by wearable technologies to mitigate these risks."
"Liver fibrosis could lead to serious secondary diseases, including osteodystrophy. The interaction between liver and bone has not been fully elucidated, thus existing therapies for osteodystrophy secondary to liver fibrosis are often ineffective. FGF23 was initially found as an endocrine regulator of phosphate homeostasis, but recently, its involvement in fibrosis has been suggested. In this study, we hypothesized that the FGF23 level increases with liver injury, which in turn induces liver fibrosis and osteodystrophy."
"Most cases of type 2 diabetes (T2D) can be prevented by adopting a healthy lifestyle, highlighting that lifestyle modifications should be the primary defence against developing T2D. Although accumulating evidence suggests that exercise can be an efficacious therapy for T2D, especially in conjunction with pharmacological interventions, its long-term effectiveness remains controversial owing to significant adherence challenges. In this narrative review, we combine an evolutionary perspective with epidemiological and prospective interventional studies to examine the efficacy versus effectiveness of varying volumes of exercise prescriptions for treating T2D. Commonly prescribed and recommended volumes of moderate-intensity physical activity (150 min/week) have demonstrated low-to-moderate efficacy in improving glycaemic control, reflected by improvements in glycated haemoglobin levels. Higher exercise volumes have been shown to enhance efficacy. While exercise can be moderately efficacious under the optimal circumstances of short-term exercise interventions (≤1 year), there is little evidence of its long-term effectiveness, primarily due to poor adherence. To date, no study has demonstrated long-term adherence to exercise programmes in individuals with T2D (>1 year). From an evolutionary perspective, the finding that exercise interventions are often ineffective over time is unsurprising. Although often overlooked, humans never evolved to exercise. Exercise is a counter-instinctive behaviour that can be difficult to maintain, even in healthy populations and can be especially challenging for individuals who are unfit or have T2D morbidities. We conclude by presenting several considerations informed by evolutionary logic that may be useful for practitioners, policymakers and advocates of exercise as medicine to improve exercise adherence."

"The ketogenic diet (KD) has demonstrated efficacy in ameliorating inflammation in rats with osteoarthritis (OA). However, the long-term safety of the KD and the underlying mechanism by which it delays OA remain unclear. We found that while long-term KD could ameliorate OA, it induced severe hepatic steatosis in mice. Consequently, we developed 2 versions of ketogenic-based diets: KD supplemented with vitamin D and intermittent KD. Both KD supplemented with vitamin D and intermittent KD effectively alleviated OA by significantly reducing the levels of inflammatory cytokines, cartilage loss, sensory nerve sprouting, and knee hyperalgesia without inducing hepatic steatosis. Furthermore, β-hydroxybutyrate (β-HB), a convenient energy carrier produced by adipocytes, could ameliorate OA without causing liver lesions. Mechanistically, β-HB enhanced chondrocyte autophagy and reduced apoptosis through the activation of Erb-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 3 (ERBB3) signaling pathway; a pathway which was down-regulated in the articular chondrocytes from both OA patients and mice. Collectively, our findings highlighted the potential therapeutic value of β-HB and KD supplemented with vitamin D and intermittent KD approaches for managing OA."
Cardiac masses represent a heterogeneous clinical scenario. Potential electrocardiographic (ECG) red flags of malignancy remain to be investigated.
"cGAS plays an important role in regulating both tumor immune responses and DNA damage repair. Nevertheless, there was little research that comprehensively analyzed the correlation between cGAS and the tumor microenvironment, immune cell infiltration, and DNA damage repair in different cancers. In this study, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) data were used to analyze the mRNA expression and genomic alterations of cGAS in pan-cancer. The HPA database was used to explore the protein levels of cGAS in normal tissues and cancers. Correlation analysis were performed to explore the role of cGAS in interferon expression, immune cell infiltrations, DNA damage repair, and predictive immune markers. The prognostic value of cGAS was analyzed using survival data from the TCGA, Kaplan-Meier plotter database, and PrognoScan database. Lastly, the role of cGAS in DNA damage repair signaling and interferon signaling was validated in NSCLC cell lines. The results showed that cGAS was widely expressed in human normal tissues and various cancers, and the expression of cGAS was significantly upregulated in almost all of the solid cancers. Genomic analysis indicated that the expression of cGAS was positively correlated with copy number levels, while negatively correlated with the methylation levels of cGAS promoter. In addition, the level of cGAS was positively correlated with type I interferons expression, infiltration levels of most immune cell types, TMB and MSI levels, stromal and immune scores, and DNA damage repair gene sets including nonhomologous end joining and homologous recombination pathway. Survival analysis indicated that cGAS levels were associated with patient prognosis in several cancers. Lastly, in vitro study showed knockdown of cGAS expression inhibits the DNA damage repair signaling pathway and interferon signaling in NSCLC. In conclusions, cGAS is wildly activated in human cancers, which might participate in regulating cancer immunity and DNA damage repair. cGAS could be used as an effective target for cancer treatment and might be a potential predictive immune marker."
"Extraskeletal chondromas are rare benign neoplasms comprising mature hyaline cartilage. A distinctive feature of these tumors is that they develop in soft tissues away from bone and cartilage. Extraskeletal chondromas account for 1.5% of benign soft tissue tumors. They occur predominantly at 30-60, in males, and in the hand or foot. In only 4% of cases, the tumor is located not on the extremities. Patients predominantly complain of increased mass, rarely on pain or a pulling sensation. The literature on the chondromas of the anterior abdominal wall is scarce. We present a rare case of a large extraskeletal left inguinal chondroma in a 71-year-old patient. The mass was over 6 cm large, and this is the only case of inguinal chondroma described in the literature. The mass was resected with surrounding tissues (a surgical margin of 1 cm) under combined endotracheal anesthesia and the histology confirmed the tumor to be a chondroma."
Artificial intelligence (AI)-based systems are transforming cytopathology practice. The aim of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) Papanicolaou (Pap) diagnosis assisted by the Hologic Genius Digital Diagnostics System (GDDS).
"In this study, the degree of accumulation of biogenic element and heavy metal contents of different parts and edible layers of leeks cultivated in Konya in Turkey was revealed. The amounts of P and K of leek were determined from 154.69 (leaf top of leek) and 985.05 mg/kg (root of leek) to 1377.63 (onion part of leek) and 2688.50 mg/kg (root of leek), respectively. P and K contents of leek layers changed from 139.45 (1st layer) and 446.63 mg/kg (7th layer) to 1596.69 (2nd layer) and 2201.53 mg/kg (4th layer), respectively. While Ca amounts of leek parts vary between 577.09 (leaf of leek) and 666.87 mg/kg (root of leek), Mg contents of leek parts were determined between 130.70 (onion part of leek) and 264.58 mg/kg (root of leek). All of the macro elements were detected in the highest amount in the root of the leek, followed by the leaf and bulb parts in decreasing order. Fe and Zn contents of different parts of leeks varied from 0.506 (onion part of leek) and 22.71 mg/kg (root of leek) to 1.53 (leaf top of leek) and 5.85 mg/kg (root of leek), respectively. In general, the heavy metals found in the highest amount both in different parts of the leek and in the edible bulbous layers were As and Ba. The layers of the leeks are rich in potassium, phosphorus, iron, and zinc."
"Objective To explore the effects of peer assistance model based on mini-clinical evaluation exercise (Mini-CEX) combined with direct observation of procedural skill (DOPS) in the teaching of autoimmune liver diseases (AILDs). Methods A total of 115 residents receiving training in the Department of Gastroenterology of Xijing Hospital were selected and divided into a control group and an experimental group according to the order in which they came to the department. The control group received traditional teaching mode, while the experimental group underwent peer assistance model based on Mini-CEX combined with DOPS. Results The experimental group showed significantly higher scores in both clinical competence and medical record documentation compared to the control group. In addition, the experimental group reported higher satisfaction levels in terms of self-learning ability, learning interest, communication skills and cooperation ability. The overall satisfaction of the experimental group is higher than that of the control group. Conclusion The use of peer assisted learning mode based on Mini-CEX and DOPS in the AILD teaching could improve the teaching effects."

"We have developed a flexible undergraduate curriculum that leverages the place-based research of environmental microbiomes to increase the number of Indigenous researchers in microbiology, data science and scientific computing. Monitoring Environmental Microbiomes (MEM) provides a curriculum and research framework designed to integrate an Indigenous approach when conducting authentic scientific research and to build interest and confidence at the undergraduate level. MEM has been successfully implemented as a short summer workshop to introduce computing practices in microbiome analysis. Based on self-assessed student knowledge of topics and skills, increased scientific confidence and interest in genomics careers were observed. We propose MEM be incorporated in a scalable course-based research experience for undergraduate institutions, including tribal colleges and universities, community colleges and other minority serving institutions. This coupled curricular and research framework explicitly considers cultural perspectives, access and equity to train a diverse future workforce that is more informed to engage in microbiome research and to translate microbiome science to benefit community and environmental health."
"Humans can flexibly change rules to categorize sensory stimuli, but their performance degrades immediately after a task switch. This switch cost is believed to reflect a limitation in cognitive control, although the bottlenecks remain controversial. Here, we show that humans exhibit a brief reduction in the efficiency of using sensory inputs to form a decision after a rule change. Participants classified face stimuli based on one of two rules, switching every few trials. Psychophysical reverse correlation and computational modeling reveal a reduction in sensory weighting, which recovers within a few hundred milliseconds after stimulus presentation. This reduction depends on the sensory features being switched, suggesting a constraint in routing the sensory information flow. We propose that decision-making circuits cannot fully adjust their sensory readout based on a context cue alone, but require the presence of an actual stimulus to tune it, leading to a limitation in flexible perceptual decision making."

"Positive pressure transmitted from continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) to the sinuses and skull base in the early post-operative period has not been studied in live subjects and controversy exists in when to restart this post-operatively. This study found that approximately 32.76% and 13.52% of the delivered CPAP pressures reached the post-surgical sphenoid sinus and the mid-nasal cavity, respectively, suggesting that surgical factors such as tissue edema, nasal packing, blood, and nasal secretions may provide a protective effect."
"Experimental research has uncovered lipocalin 2 (LCN2) as a novel biomarker implicated in the modulation of intestinal inflammation, metabolic homeostasis, and colon carcinogenesis. However, evidence from human research has been scant. We, therefore, explored the association of pre-diagnostic circulating LCN2 concentrations with incident colorectal cancer (CRC) in a nested case-control study within the in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort. LCN2 was measured in 1267 incident CRC cases matched to 1267 controls using incidence density sampling. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) according to tumor subsite and sex. Weighted Cox proportional hazard regression was used to explore associations by adiposity status. In multivariable-adjusted analyses, the IRR [95% CI] per doubling in LCN2 concentration was 1.16 [0.98-1.37] for CRC overall, 1.26 [1.00-1.59] for colon cancer, and 1.08 [0.85-1.38] for rectal cancer. The association for colon cancer was more pronounced in women (IRR [95% CI], 1.66 [1.20-2.30]) and for proximal colon cancer (IRR [95% CI], 1.96 [1.15-3.34]), whereas no association was seen in men and distal colon cancer. The association for colon cancer was positive in individuals with high waist circumference (hazard ratio [95% CI], 1.69 [1.52-1.88]) and inverse in individuals with low waist circumference (hazard ratio [95% CI], 0.86 [0.76-0.98], P interaction<0.01). Overall, these data suggest that pre-diagnostic LCN2 concentrations were positively associated with colon cancer, particularly occurring in the proximal colon, in women and among individuals with abdominal adiposity."
"In this study, the results of a comprehensive assessment of the variability in the occurrence of ten perfluorinated compounds (PFAS) in fish tissues originating from 2014 to 2019 from six fisheries in the Baltic Sea are presented. A total of 360 fish samples of three species (perch, herring and flatfish) were analysed. For the determination of PFAS, both linear and branched stereoisomers, LC-ESI-MS/MS technique preceded by simultaneous SPE isolation was validated and applied. The total concentration of all determined PFAS compounds shows that the highest levels were observed in the Szczecin Lagoon (4.8 ± 0.7 µg/kg) and the lowest in the Pomeranian Bay (1.9 ± 0.1 µg/kg). In most samples, the dominant compound was perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS). The present research enabled the assessment of the variability in the occurrence of PFAS stereoisomers in marine fish."
"The high mortality rate of chronic heart failure (CHF) makes it a primary battlefield in the field of cardiovascular diseases. Qiangxin Lishui Prescription (QLP) is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) prescription used clinically for treating CHF, but its underlying mechanism remains unclear. This study integrated plasma metabolomics, network pharmacology, and experimental validation to reveal the pharmacological effects of QLP and its potential mechanism of anti-CHF. Using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography combined with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q/TOF-MS/MS), 119 absorbed prototype compounds of QLP were identified from rat plasma. By applying network pharmacology and molecular docking techniques, a QLP absorption components-target-CHF network was constructed. The IL6/JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway is likely critical to QLP's therapeutic effect on CHF. A CHF mouse model was established using aortic ligation surgery to investigate the regulation of the IL6/JAK/STAT3 pathway by QLP in CHF mice. Network pharmacology analysis and in vivo experimental data indicate that QLP alleviates myocardial injury and inflammatory response in CHF mice by modulating the IL6/JAK/STAT3 pathway, significantly improving cardiac function. This presents a promising therapeutic strategy for CHF treatment."
"Hox genes are crucial in determining segmentation identity in developing embryos, which ultimately sets an anteroposterior body axis. Over a century of research has discovered the fundamentals of the Hox gene and protein function in animal development and diseases. However, there are still fundamental questions about the specificity of HOX function. This chapter discusses many unknowns about Hox genes and how modern technologies can overcome technical limitations. We have also addressed these questions to gain a better understanding of the roles of these genes."
"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD, formerly known as NAFLD) is a major driver of cirrhosis and liver-related mortality. However, therapeutic options for MASLD, including prevention of liver steatosis, are limited. We previously described that vasoactive intestinal peptide-producing neurons (VIP-neurons) regulate the efficiency of intestinal dietary fat absorption and IL-22 production by type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3) in the intestine. Given the described hepatoprotective role of IL-22, we hypothesize that modulation of this neuroimmune circuit could potentially be an innovative approach for the control of liver steatosis."
"Road traffic injury is the leading cause of death among young people globally, with motor vehicle collisions often resulting in severe injuries and entrapment.

"Neuroendocrine cells have been implicated in therapeutic resistance and worse overall survival in many cancer types. Mucinous colorectal cancer (mCRC) is uniquely enriched for enteroendocrine cells (EEC), the neuroendocrine cells of the normal colon epithelium, as compared with non-mCRC. Therefore, targeting EEC differentiation may have clinical value in mCRC. In this study, single-cell multiomics uncovered epigenetic alterations that accompany EEC differentiation, identified STAT3 as a regulator of EEC specification, and discovered a rare cancer-specific cell type with enteric neuron-like characteristics. Furthermore, lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) and CoREST2 mediated STAT3 demethylation and enhanced STAT3 chromatin binding. Knockdown of CoREST2 in an orthotopic xenograft mouse model resulted in decreased primary tumor growth and lung metastases. Collectively, these results provide a rationale for developing LSD1 inhibitors that target the interaction between LSD1 and STAT3 or CoREST2, which may improve clinical outcomes for patients with mCRC. Significance: STAT3 activity mediated by LSD1 and CoREST2 induces enteroendocrine cell specification in mucinous colorectal cancer, suggesting disrupting interaction among LSD1, CoREST2, and STAT3 as a therapeutic strategy to target neuroendocrine differentiation."
"Laryngopharyngeal reflux remains a diagnostic challenge due to the lack of a definitive diagnostic tool. Esophageal multichannel intraluminal impedance (MII) pH monitoring has been proven reliable for detecting gastric reflux. This study aims to evaluate the association between clinical scores and MII/pH monitoring according to the Lyon Consensus 2.0. Patients with laryngo-pharyngeal symptoms (LPS) who had a reflux symptom index (RSI) ≥13 or reflux finding score (RFS) ≥7 underwent MII/pH monitoring. The findings were analyzed in comparison with clinical scores. A total of 100 patients meeting the inclusion criteria were recruited for this study. MII/pH monitoring revealed a median acid exposure time (AET) of 1.9% (interquartile range [IQR] = 0.2, 4.9), with 22% of patients recording an AET above 6%. The median number of reflux episodes was 29.5 episodes per day (IQR = 19.0, 43.8), with 7% experiencing more than 80 episodes per day. Gas reflux was identified as the most prevalent type. Based on the Lyon Consensus 2.0, 25 patients exhibited conclusive pathological reflux, while 75 patients showed no conclusive evidence of pathological reflux. No significant differences were found in RSI and RFS between these groups. Only gas reflux episodes showed a significant correlation with RSI (r = 0.255, P = 0.011). RSI and RFS among patients with LPS showed no statistically significant differences in identifying pathological reflux or no conclusive evidence of pathological reflux. This finding suggests that the pathophysiology underlying LPS may not be solely attributable to reflux."
"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and lethal intracranial tumor in adults. Despite advances in the understanding of the molecular events responsible for disease development and progression, survival rates and mortality statistics for GBM patients have been virtually unchanged for decades and chemotherapeutic drugs used to treat GBM are limited. Arsenic derivatives, known as highly effective anticancer agents for leukemia therapy, has been demonstrated to exhibit cytocidal effects toward GBM cells by inducing cell death, cell cycle arrest, inhibition of migration/invasion, and angiogenesis. Differentiation induction of glioma stem-like cells (GSCs) and inhibition of neurosphere formation have also been attributed to the cytotoxicity of arsenic derivatives. Intriguingly, similar cytotoxic effects against GBM cells and GSCs have also been observed in natural agents such as anthocyanidins, tetrandrine, and bufadienolides. In the current review, we highlight the available data on the molecular mechanisms underlying the multifaceted anticancer activity of arsenic compounds and natural agents against cancer cells, especially focusing on GBM cells and GCSs. We also outline possible strategies for developing anticancer therapy by combining natural agents and arsenic compounds, as well as temozolomide, an alkylating agent used to treat GBM, in terms of improvement of chemotherapy sensitivity and minimization of side effects."

"The globally vital oil palm, a major oil producer, confronts productivity challenges due to Ganoderma boninense (Gb), causing output decline. Chemical control efforts have proven ineffective, prompting exploration of microbial-based biocontrol. While single fungal biocontrol research exists, the impact of employing multiple biocontrols concurrently to combat Ganoderma and enhance oil palm growth remains uncharted. This study examined four soil-derived fungal isolates for their ability to antagonize Gb PER71 in vitro. Molecular identification categorized them as Talaromyces spp. and Penicillium sp. Moreover, all isolates were revealed to have at least three plant growth-promoting (PGP) traits and were shown to have phosphoric hydrolase, ester hydrolase, peptide hydrolase, and glycosidase activities which are essential for plant growth. Furthermore, the synergistic evaluation of fungal isolates was tested against Gb PER71. One out of six combinations of fungal isolates showed a synergistic effect in vitro, and two showed a synergistic effect in planta. The application of single and combined fungal isolates tested in planta also suppressed Gb PER71 and enhanced oil palm growth compared to control groups. The findings indicate the promising potential of these isolates as biocontrol agents (BCAs) and bioformulations against Gb in oil palm cultivation."
"The concealed nodoventricular/nodofascicular (NV/NF) pathway is mostly a bystander, retrograde bypass tract connecting the right ventricle/right bundle branch (RBB) and slow pathway that is observed in patients with atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT).

"Diabetes may have an impact on aesthetic medicine, influencing both the safety and efficacy of various aesthetic procedures. Key aspects of the impact of diabetes on aesthetic medicine are summarized. Individuals with diabetes often experience dry skin, a condition known as xerosis, which may affect the overall texture and appearance of the skin. Diabetes can compromise the immune system, making individuals more susceptible to skin infections. Aesthetic procedures involve the introduction of foreign substances, and compromised skin integrity may heighten the risk of infection. This underscores the importance of strict hygiene and postprocedure care to minimize the risk of complications. Delayed wound healing can be a significant concern in aesthetic procedures where incisions, injections, or other manipulations are made, as impaired healing may affect the final outcome and increase the risk of complications. Collagen metabolism, affecting the elasticity and structural integrity of the skin, may influence the long-term results of procedures such as dermal fillers, where collagen plays a crucial role in maintaining skin volume and firmness. Diabetes is linked to vascular complications, including poor blood circulation, which may have implications for procedures like laser treatments or other interventions that rely on adequate blood supply for optimal results."
"Pathogen species are experiencing strong joint demographic and selective events, especially when they adapt to a new host, for example through overcoming plant resistance. Stochasticity in the founding event and the associated demographic variations hinder our understanding of the expected evolutionary trajectories and the genetic structure emerging at both neutral and selected loci. What would be the typical genetic signatures of such a rapid adaptation event is not elucidated. Here, we build a demogenetic model to monitor pathogen population dynamics and genetic evolution on two host compartments (susceptible and resistant). We design our model to fit two plant pathogen life cycles, ""with"" and ""without"" host alternation. Our aim is to draw a typology of eco-evolutionary dynamics. Using time-series clustering, we identify three main scenarios: 1) small variations in the pathogen population size and small changes in genetic structure, 2) a strong founder event on the resistant host that in turn leads to the emergence of genetic structure on the susceptible host, and 3) evolutionary rescue that results in a strong founder event on the resistant host, preceded by a bottleneck on the susceptible host. We pinpoint differences between life cycles with notably more evolutionary rescue ""with"" host alternation. Beyond the selective event itself, the demographic trajectory imposes specific changes in the genetic structure of the pathogen population. Most of these genetic changes are transient, with a signature of resistance overcoming that vanishes within a few years only. Considering time-series is therefore of utmost importance to accurately decipher pathogen evolution."

"Cancer has emerged as a global health crisis, claiming millions of lives annually. Dendrimers and dendronized nanoparticles, a novel class of nanoscale molecules with highly branched three-dimensional macromolecular structures, have gained significant attention in cancer treatment and diagnosis due to their unique properties. These dendritic macromolecules offer a precisely controlled branching architecture, enabling functionalization with specific targeting molecules to enhance the selective delivery of therapeutic agents to tumor cells while minimizing systemic toxicity. Through surface modifications and the incorporation of various components, dendrimers demonstrate remarkable adaptability as nanocarriers for biomedical imaging and theranostic applications. Surface functionalization strategies, including PEGylation and ligand attachment (e.g., folic acid, RGD peptide, lactobionic acid), further enhance biocompatibility and facilitate targeted tumor cell imaging. Leveraging their improved biocompatibility and target specificity, dendritic nanosystems offer heightened sensitivity and precision in cancer diagnostics. Notably, the encapsulation of metal nanoparticles within dendrimers, such as gold nanoparticles, has shown promise in enhancing tumor imaging capabilities. Ongoing advancements in nanotechnology are poised to increase the sophistication and complexity of dendrimer-based systems, highlighting their potential as nanocarriers in drug delivery platforms, with a growing number of clinical trials on the horizon. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the potential and future prospects of dendrimers and dendrimer-based nanocarriers in targeted cancer therapy and diagnosis, exploring their ability to enhance biocompatibility, reduce toxicity, and improve therapeutic outcomes across various malignancies."
"The World Health Organisation's International Health Regulations were amended in May 2024, with a number of implications for countries to amend their legal and institutional frameworks. This perspective highlights two key areas of focus in the amendments-the importance of multisectoral coordination and subnational work - and explores their links to health security challenges and to concrete country experiences. National legal and institutional frameworks constitute a key enabling mechanism for effective public health systems capable of preventing, detecting, and responding promptly to public health events and emergencies, and the recent IHR amendments provide a new impetus for WHO Member States to make these changes."
"Phototheranostics integrates light-based diagnostic techniques with therapeutic interventions, offering a non-invasive, precise, and swift approach for both disease detection and treatment. The efficacy of this approach hinges on the multimodal imaging potential and photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) of phototheranostic agents (PTAs). Despite the promise, crafting multifunctional phototheranostic organic small molecules brims with challenges. In this research, four innovative xanthene-derived PTAs are synthesized by fine-tuning the donor-π-acceptor (D-π-A) system to strike a balance between radiative and nonradiative decay. The inherent robust photostability and intense fluorescence of the traditional xanthene core are preserved, meanwhile the addition of highly electron-withdrawing groups boosts the non-radiative decay rate to enhance PCE and photoacoustic imaging capabilities. Remarkably, one of the PTAs, DMBA, demonstrates an exceptional absolute fluorescence quantum yield of 2.46% in PBS, and when encapsulated into nanoparticles, it achieves a high PCE of 79.5%. Consequently, DMBA nanoparticles (DMBA-NPs) are effectively employed in fluorescence, 3D photoacoustic, and photothermal imaging-guiding tumor photothermal therapy. This represents the first instance of a multimodal phototheranostic xanthene agent achieving synergistic fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging for diagnostic purposes. Furthermore, this work paves the way for leveraging xanthene fluorophores as versatile tools in the development of multifunctional reagents."
"Glioblastoma (GBM) is a rare brain cancer with an exceptionally high mortality rate, which illustrates the pressing demand for more effective therapeutic options.

"Single-cell whole-genome sequencing is a powerful tool for uncovering mutations in individual cells. In recent times, the generation of vast amounts of data has significantly advanced our understanding of key biological processes, including cell development and tumor progression. This rapid accumulation of data underscores the urgent need for a comprehensive resource platform to manage and utilize this information effectively. To address this need, we introduce HSCGD, the first open-access and comprehensive database dedicated to the collection, integration, analysis, and visualization of single-cell whole-genome data and metadata. The current release of HSCGD includes processed single-cell whole-genome sequencing data and curated metadata of 74 154 human cells derived from 63 public single-cell datasets, involving 23 cell types and 17 major single-cell whole-genome amplification methods. HSCGD is designed to help researchers interested in cellular heterogeneity explore and utilize whole genome data at the single-cell level by providing browsing, searching, visualization, downloading and online tools. The database can be accessed from the following URL: http://www.hscgd.com."
"Targeting DNA damage response (DDR) pathways represents one of the principal approaches in cancer therapy. However, defects in DDR mechanisms, exhibited by various tumors, can also promote tumor progression and resistance to therapy, negatively impacting patient survival. Therefore, identifying new molecules from natural extracts could provide a powerful source of novel compounds for cancer treatment strategies. In this context, we investigated the role of oleanolic acid (OA), identified in fermented Aglianico red grape pomace, in modulating the DDR in response to camptothecin (CPT), an inhibitor of topoisomerase I. Specifically, we found that OA can influence the choice of DNA repair pathway upon CPT treatment, shifting the repair process from homologous recombination gene conversion to single-strand annealing. Moreover, our data demonstrate that combining sub-lethal concentrations of OA with CPT enhances the efficacy of topoisomerase I inhibition compared to CPT alone. Overall, these findings highlight a new role for OA in the DDR, leading to a more mutagenic DNA repair pathway and increased sensitivity in the HeLa cancer cell line."
"The study aimed to evaluate the potential protection against fractures of oral Q10 supplementation in the tibias of rats exposed to nicotine. Nicotine is known to negatively impact bone density and increase the risk of fractures, in addition to affecting other systems such as the gastrointestinal system, impairing its absorption capacity, negatively affecting bone health. To investigate this, eighty male rats were divided into four groups (n = 20) receiving either nicotine hemisulfate or saline solution (SS) for 28 days. Two daily subcutaneous applications were administered accordingly. Concurrently, vegetable glycerin and Q10 gavage began on day ""0"". SS: the animals in this group received two daily subcutaneous applications of sodium chloride solution during the entire trial period. 30 days after starting the SS applications subcutaneously, the animals received vegetable glycerin daily until the end of the experiment. SS-Q10: the animals received the SS protocol and daily supplementation with Q10 until the end of the experiment. NIC: The animals received the protocol for NIC and vegetable glycerin daily until the end of the experiment. NIC-Q10: The animals received the protocol for NIC and daily supplementation and Q10 until the end of the experiment. Euthanasia occurred at 7 and 28 days after the beginning the gavage. The tibiae collected were processed for morphometric, densitometric, mechanical, and microtomographic (micro-Ct) analysis. A complementary analysis of intestinal changes was performed. The groups that received Q10 showed slightly better results regarding the mechanical resistance and micro-Ct parameters and to intestinal histomorphometry, as compared with groups not supplemented with Q10. Thus, in rats, it can be concluded that coenzyme Q10 exhibited a protective property to the skeletal system and the gastrointestinal tract, even in the presence of nicotine."
"Phyllodes tumors (PTs) are fibroepithelial neoplasms of the breast, with current treatment guidelines recommending wide excision to achieve surgical margins of ≥1 cm to minimize the recurrence risk.

"Molecules that are able to induce proximity between two proteins are finding ever increasing applications in chemical biology and drug discovery. The ability to introduce an electrophile and make such proximity inducers covalent can offer improved properties such as selectivity, potency, duration of action, and reduced molecular size. This concept has been heavily explored in the context of targeted degradation in particular for bivalent molecules, but recently, additional applications are reported in other contexts, as well as for monovalent molecular glues. This is a comprehensive review of reported covalent proximity inducers, aiming to identify common trends and current gaps in their discovery and application."
"The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) contributes to retinal homeostasis, and its metabolic dysfunction is implied in the development of retinal degenerative disease. The isoform M2 of pyruvate kinase (PKM2) is a key factor in cell metabolism, and its function may be affected by insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). This study aims to investigate the effect of IGF-1 on PKM2 modulation of RPE cells and whether co-treatment with klotho may preserve it. ARPE-19 cells, an ex vivo model of human pigmented epithelium, were exposed to IGF-1. Then, we evaluated PKM2 expression, dimerization and subcellular localization, energy metabolism, and redox balance, and whether pre-treatment with Klotho may antagonize the effects of IGF-1. The results show that IGF-1 favors PKM2 dimerization, thus reducing the activity of PKM2 and leading to an altered cellular energy status coupled with reduced oxidative stress. In conclusion, PKM2 plays a pivotal role in the modulation of RPE metabolism and redox balance and could explain the mechanisms through which IGF-1 participates in the pathogenesis of some retinal diseases. Klotho may exert protective effects by mitigating the IGF-1 signal and its effect on mitochondrial function."

This study investigates COVID-19 dose 1 and 2 vaccine uptakes among them by race, ethnicity, and sex."
"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) play a pivotal role in regulating numerous physiological processes through their interactions with two key effectors: G proteins and β-arrestins (βarrs). This makes them crucial targets for therapeutic drug development. Interestingly, the evolving concept of biased signaling where ligands selectively activate either the G proteins or the βarrs has not only refined our understanding of segregation of physiological responses downstream of GPCRs but has also revolutionized drug discovery, offering the potential for treatments with enhanced efficacy and minimal side effects. This Review explores the mechanisms behind biased agonism, exploring it through various lenses, including ligand, receptor, cellular systems, location, and tissue-specific biases. It also offers structural insights into both orthosteric and allosteric ligand-binding pockets, structural rearrangements associated with the loops, and how ligand-engineering can contribute to biased signaling. Moreover, we also discuss the unique conformational signature in an intrinsically biased GPCR, which currently remains relatively less explored and adds a new dimension in biased signaling. Lastly, we address the translational challenges and practical considerations in characterizing bias, emphasizing its therapeutic potential and the latest advancements in drug development. By designing ligands that target specific signaling pathways, biased signaling presents a transformative approach to creating safer and more effective therapies. This Review focuses on our current understanding of GPCR-biased signaling, discussing potential mechanisms that lead to bias, the effect of bias on GPCR structures at a molecular level, recent advancements, and its profound potential to drive innovation in drug discovery."

"Sweet lime (Citrus limetta), known for its unique taste and aroma, is limited in use due to its bitterness. Osmotic dehydration of sweet lime slices was studied to optimize mass transfer kinetics using response surface methodology (RSM). The debittering pre-treatment using NaCl ranging from 0 to 5 % resulted in a significant reduction of bittering compounds, achieving a 39.40 % decrease in naringin and a 21.46 % decrease in limonin at 4 % NaCl concentration. Osmotic solution concentrations (60, 70, and 80°Brix) and ultrasound time (4, 8, and 12 min) were examined for optimization of osmotic dehydration. Ultrasound treatment enhanced mass transfer, reducing processing time while retaining vitamin C, though it altered the colour of the slices, significantly impacting L*, ΔE, and the browning index (BI). The optimal conditions for osmotic dehydration were found to be 80°Brix and 5.3 min as the solution concentration and ultrasound time. Under these conditions, predicted values for water loss (WL), solid gain (SG), weight reduction (WR), retention of ascorbic acid and ΔE were 90.71 g/100 g, 73.65 g/100 g, 15.33 %, 74.28 %, and 7.87 respectively. This method enhances mass transfer efficiency and vitamin C retention, facilitating the comprehensive utilization of sweet lime with minimal waste generation."
The anti-cancer properties of zinc oxide-doped carbon dots (CDs/ZnO) in inhibiting triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) progression merit more investigation.
"Preeclampsia (PE) is a prevalent and severe pregnancy complication that significantly impacts maternal and perinatal health. Epidemiological studies and animal experiments have demonstrated that PE adversely affects the cardiovascular and nervous systems of offspring, increasing their risk of hypertension and renal pathology. However, the mechanisms underlying this increased risk remain unclear. This study utilized an L-NAME-induced preeclampsia mouse model (PELS model) to investigate the effects of PE on offspring blood pressure and renal pathology, focusing on the expression of Angiotensin II Type 1 Receptors (AT1R) and related molecules in renal tissues. Our findings show that L-NAME-induced pre-eclampsia led to reduced birth weights and significantly elevated systolic blood pressure in 6-week-old offspring. Histopathological analysis revealed pronounced glomerular and tubular damage in the kidneys of both 1-week and 6-week-old offspring from the pre-eclampsia group. At 1 week of age, the pre-eclampsia group exhibited elevated mRNA and protein expression levels of AT1R, GRK4, AQP2, ENaC, and NCC in renal tissues compared to controls. However, these differences were no longer significant at 6 weeks of age. No significant gender differences were observed in either blood pressure or renal pathological changes. Preeclampsia induced by L-NAME results in increased blood pressure and renal damage in offspring, potentially mediated by early alterations in the renal RAS system. The observed changes in AT1R and related molecules appear to be transient, suggesting that the early impact of pre-eclampsia on renal structure may trigger, but not sustain, hypertension in offspring. Further studies are needed to elucidate the long-term mechanisms driving hypertension in this population."
"In recent decades, immunometabolism in cancers has emerged as an interesting target for treatment development. Indeed, the tumor microenvironment (TME) unique characteristics such as hypoxia and limitation of nutrients availability lead to a switch in metabolic pathways in both tumor and TME cells in order to support their adaptation and grow. Glioblastoma (GBM), the most frequent and aggressive primary brain tumor in adults, has been extensively studied in multiple aspects regarding its immune population, but research focused on immunometabolism remains limited. Here, we provide an overview of immunometabolism adaptation of myeloid cells in cancers with a specific focus on GBM and other brain tumors, before describing current therapeutic strategies targeting metabolic pathways. The main myeloid cells composing the GBM TME include tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), which comprise both peripheral macrophages and local microglia, as well as myeloid-derived suppressor cells. The metabolic pathways involved in myeloid cell remodeling encompass the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle), the lipid, glucose and amino acid metabolism and hypoxia. Developing treatments that target these metabolic pathways in tumor growth and its TME is a promising and increasing field. It includes both drug-repurposing and the development of innovative metabolic therapies. We finally provide an overview of all clinical trials in neuro-oncology involving treatments modifying cell metabolism and provide the preclinical rationale for both drugs already evaluated within clinical trials and potential candidates for future trials."
"Although sodium glucose cotransporter2 inhibitor (SGLT-2I) is widely used in clinical practice, sufficient renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibition remains the cornerstone of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) treatment.

"Over the past millennia, the evaluation and management of thyroid nodules has essentially remained the same with thyroidectomy as the only reliable method to identify malignancy. However, in the last 30 years, technological advances have significantly improved diagnostic management of thyroid nodules. Advances in imaging have allowed development of a reliable risk- based stratification system to identify nodules at increased risk of malignancy. At the same time, sensitive imaging has caused collateral damage to the degree that we are now identifying and treating many small, low risk nodules with little to no clinical relevance."
Reaching social milestones is an important goal of childhood. Children with acquired brain injury (ABI) and cerebral palsy (CP) frequently experience challenges with social functioning and participation.

Genetic screening has advanced from prenatal cell-free DNA (cfDNA) screening for aneuploidies (cfDNA-ANP) to single-gene disorders (cfDNA-SGD). Clinical validation studies have been promising in pregnancies with anomalies but are limited in the general population.
"Procarbazine-containing chemotherapy regimens are associated with cytopenias and infertility, suggesting stem-cell toxicity. When treating Hodgkin lymphoma, procarbazine in escalated-dose bleomycin-etoposide-doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide-vincristine-procarbazine-prednisolone (eBEACOPP) is increasingly replaced with dacarbazine (eBEACOPDac) to reduce toxicity. We aimed to investigate the impact of this drug substitution on the mutation burden in stem cells, patient survival, and toxicity."

"Sonodynamic therapy is an emerging therapeutic approach against brain tumours. However, the treatment scheme and ultrasound parameters have yet to be explored for clinical translation. Our study aimed to optimize ultrasound parameters for sonodynamic therapy (SDT) with 5-ALA as a sonosensitizing agent and to evaluate its therapeutic outcome on the rodent 9L gliosarcoma and the human U87 glioblastoma models. We stereotactically implanted brain tumour cells in rats and monitored tumour volume via MRI. SDT was conducted weekly using a 60 mg/kg dose of 5-ALA, injected intravenously 6 h before sonication. We used a driving frequency of 580 kHz with 0.75 MPa and evaluated the effect of different burst lengths to optimize ultrasound parameters. We also tested SDT against advanced-stage brain tumours to verify its efficacy further. Our results showed that a longer burst length could improve therapeutic outcomes. Tumour growth inhibition was established only in the first three weeks with 10 ms and 50 ms burst length sonication, but 86 ms burst length greatly improved the survival outcome. Therefore, the therapeutic efficacy is proportionate to the burst length and, thus, the total delivered energy. Repeated SDT using multiple targets to cover the entire tumour volume with optimal ultrasound parameters can achieve significant anti-tumour effects in both 9L and U87 models. Lastly, our results on late-stage tumour treatments showed that SDT can still provide prolonged survival. These promising findings demonstrate that repeated SDT using transcranial-focused ultrasound together with 5-ALA can optimize anti-tumour effects and even lead to complete clearance of the tumours. This weekly treatment with pulsed ultrasound sonication strategy is practical for future clinical translation."
"This study investigated the immunomodulatory effects of calcium phosphate (CaP) microspheres, focusing on how particle size influenced macrophage polarization and cytokine secretion patterns. SEM analysis revealed that HA microspheres predominantly exhibited a spherical shape with distinct sizes and sub-micro-sized pores. The average particle sizes for the S1, S2, and S3 groups were 17.36 μm, 27.59 μm, and 47.14 μm, respectively."
"Methylergometrine has widely been used pharmacologically to treat conditions such as pain, addiction, vasoconstriction, migraines, and Parkinson's disease. Despite its side effects, it is used as a therapeutic agent and research material for various diseases based on its natural potential; however, the regulatory effect of its interaction with the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) has not yet been investigated. The α3β4 nAChR is an ion channel essential for neurotransmission within the sympathetic, parasympathetic, and autonomic nervous systems. Inhibiting the α3β4 nAChR can suppress neural signaling, affecting physiological processes such as heart rate, blood pressure, and digestion. This inhibition also holds analgesic potential by blocking pain pathways. Additionally, because the α3β4 nAChR is linked to addiction, its inhibition may reduce dependence, offering promise for addiction therapies. Inhibiting the α3β4 nAChR may impact cardiovascular and gastrointestinal regulation, presenting therapeutic possibilities for related disorders. This study investigated methylergometrine's regulatory effects on the α3β4 nAChR using oocytes and a two-electrode voltage clamp. Methylergometrine inhibited α3β4 nAChR activity in a reversible, concentration-dependent, and non-competitive manner with the interaction of α3-and β4-subunit E175 and E51 residues. These findings indicate that methylergometrine modulates α3β4 nAChR function by interacting with specific ligand-binding sites, as evidenced by electrophysiological analysis. This study advances the pharmacological understanding of methylergometrine, elucidating its mechanism of action at the cellular level."
"Prokaryotes (Bacteria and Archaea) encode a highly diversified arsenal of defence systems that protect them against mobile genetic elements, such as phages and plasmids. In turn, mobile genetic elements encode anti-defence systems that allow them to escape the activity of these defence systems. This has resulted in an evolutionary arms race in which defence systems and anti-defence systems evolve and adapt continuously, driving intriguing innovation and enormous diversification on both sides. Over 150 prokaryotic defence systems have been identified to date. Anti-defence systems are known for only a subset of these, but more are being discovered at a steady rate. Despite an increasing understanding of the highly diverse molecular mechanisms of anti-defence systems, their diverse evolutionary origins, the selective pressures they are subjected to, and their ecological importance and implications often remain obscure. In this review, we describe the diverse strategies that phage and plasmid anti-defence systems employ to escape host defence systems. We explore the evolutionary origins of anti-defence systems and describe different factors that exert selective pressure, affecting their maintenance and diversification. We describe how, in turn, defence systems themselves evolved to act upon anti-defence mechanisms, thereby adding a new layer to the co-evolutionary battle between prokaryotes and their mobile genetic elements. We discuss how the continuous selective pressures found in dynamic microbial communities promote the retention and diversification of these anti-defence systems. Finally, we consider the ecological implications for both hosts and their mobile genetic elements, noting how the balance of defence and anti-defence strategies can shape microbial community composition, influence horizontal gene transfer, and impact ecosystem stability."

"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common chronic inflammatory skin disease. Moderate-to-severe AD severely affects patients' quality of life. New drugs selectively targeting molecular pathways involved in the pathogenesis of the disease led to a new era for the treatment of AD. However, the current available options are limited and do not completely fulfill patients' needs. Recently, lebrikizumab, a new humanized monoclonal antibody targeting IL-13, has been approved for treating moderate-to-severe AD."
"Porcine circovirus 3 (PCV3) is a small non-enveloped circovirus associated with porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (PDNS). It has occurred worldwide and poses a serious threat to the pig industry. However, there is no commercially available vaccine. PCV3 capsid protein (Cap) is an ideal antigen candidate for serodiagnosis. Here, a novel fully automated chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay (CLEIA) was developed to detect antibodies (Abs) to Cap in porcine serum. Recombinant PCV3 Cap, self-assembled into virus-like particles (VLPs), was produced using baculovirus and coupled to magnetic particles (Cap-MPs) as carriers. Combined with an alkaline phosphatase (AP)-adamantane (AMPPD) system, Cap-Abs can be rapidly measured on a fully automated chemiluminescence analyzer. Under optimal conditions, a cut-off value of 31,508 was determined, with a diagnostic sensitivity of 96.8% and specificity of 97.3%. No cross-reactivity was observed with PCV1 and PCV2 and other common porcine pathogens, and both intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients were less than 5% and 10%, respectively. Prepared Cap-MPs can be stored at 4 °C for more than 6 months. Importantly, this CLEIA had a good agreement of 95.19% with the commercially available kit, demonstrating excellent analytical sensitivity and significantly reduced operating time and labor. A serological survey was then conducted, and showed that PCV3 continues to spread widely in South China. In conclusion, our CLEIA provides time and labor-saving, and a reliable tool for PCV3 epidemiological surveillance."
Case reports suggest that calcitonin gene-related peptide monoclonal antibodies (CGRP mAbs) may trigger inflammatory flares in patients with autoimmune diseases.
"Preclinical murine infection models lack inter-laboratory uniformity, complicating result comparisons and data reproducibility. The European Innovative Medicines initiative-funded consortium (COMBINE) has developed a standardized murine neutropenic pneumonia protocol to address these concerns. While model methods have been standardized, a major obstacle to consistent results is the lack of available bacteria with defined viability and variability. Herein, we establish a diverse challenge set of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa suitable for use in the COMBINE protocol to further minimize experimental inconsistency and improve the interpretability of data generated among differing laboratories."

"Respiratory pathogen coinfections pose significant challenges to global public health, particularly regarding the intersecting epidemics of COVID-19 and influenza. This study investigated the incidences of respiratory infectious pathogens in this unique context. We collected throat swab samples from 308 patients with a fever from outpatient and emergency departments at sentinel surveillance hospitals in Xiamen, southeast of China, between April and May 2023, testing for SARS-CoV-2 and 26 other respiratory pathogens. The coinfection rate of the XBB SARS-CoV-2 variant with other respiratory pathogens was higher than that observed during the Alpha and Delta phases. Among patients with influenza, bacterial coinfections were more prevalent. Only 0.65% (2/308) of the patients were concurrently infected with both COVID-19 and influenza. Age-stratified analysis showed a clear pattern, with a higher incidence of coinfections in children under 18 years of age. These findings highlight the need for the timely detection of respiratory pathogen coinfections and for the implementation of appropriate interventions, crucial for reducing disease burden during intersecting respiratory epidemics."
The literature on clinical psychophysiology highlights the possibility of using Heart Rate Variability (HRV) as an index of psychophysical balance and resilience to stress. This study investigates the differences in stress reactivity and subsequent recovery between a group of migraineurs and healthy controls.
"Endothelial dysfunction is a strong prognostic factor in predicting the development of cardiovascular diseases. Dysfunctional endothelium loses its homeostatic ability to regulate vascular tone and prevent overactivation of inflammation, leading to vascular dysfunction. These functions are critical for vascular homeostasis and arterial pressure control, the disruption of which may lead to hypertension. Hypertension itself can also cause endothelial dysfunction, as endothelial cells are susceptible to haemodynamic changes. Although it is unclear which of those factors appear first, they create a vicious circle further damaging multiple organs, including the heart and vessels. There are also sex-specific differences in homeostatic functions of the endothelium regarding vessel tone regulation, which may contribute to differences in arterial blood pressure between men and women. Even more importantly, there are sex-differences in the development of endothelial dysfunction and vessel remodelling. Hence, an understanding of the mechanisms of endothelial dysfunction and its contribution to pathological vascular remodelling during hypertension is of critical importance. This review addresses immunological and metabolic aspects in mechanisms of endothelial dysfunction and the resulting mechanisms in vascular remodelling with respect to arterial hypertension, including the potential role of sex-specific differences."

"Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being used to diagnose complications of diabetes. Artificial intelligence is technology that enables computers and machines to simulate human intelligence and solve complicated problems. In this article, we address current and likely future applications for AI to be applied to diabetes and its complications, including pharmacoadherence to therapy, diagnosis of hypoglycemia, diabetic eye disease, diabetic kidney diseases, diabetic neuropathy, diabetic foot ulcers, and heart failure in diabetes.Artificial intelligence is advantageous because it can handle large and complex datasets from a variety of sources. With each additional type of data incorporated into a clinical picture of a patient, the calculation becomes increasingly complex and specific. Artificial intelligence is the foundation of emerging medical technologies; it will power the future of diagnosing diabetes complications."
"Current temporal studies of DNA replication are either low-resolution or require complex cell synchronisation and/or sorting procedures. Here we introduce Nanotiming, a single-molecule, nanopore sequencing-based method producing high-resolution, telomere-to-telomere replication timing (RT) profiles of eukaryotic genomes by interrogating changes in intracellular dTTP concentration during S phase through competition with its analogue bromodeoxyuridine triphosphate (BrdUTP) for incorporation into replicating DNA. This solely demands the labelling of asynchronously growing cells with an innocuous dose of BrdU during one doubling time followed by BrdU quantification along nanopore reads. We demonstrate in S. cerevisiae model eukaryote that Nanotiming reproduces RT profiles generated by reference methods both in wild-type and mutant cells inactivated for known RT determinants. Nanotiming is simple, accurate, inexpensive, amenable to large-scale analyses, and has the unique ability to access RT of individual telomeres, revealing that Rif1 iconic telomere regulator selectively delays replication of telomeres associated with specific subtelomeric elements."
"Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is an aggressive clonal stem cell disorder categorized among myelodysplastic/ myeloproliferative overlap neoplasms. While sharing features with both myelodysplastic syndromes and myeloproliferative neoplasms, CMML has distinct molecular and clinical profiles. The presence of CMML-specific prognostic models, response criteria, and dedicated clinical trials underscores a unique and complex biology. Age-related changes affecting the bone marrow microenvironment, immune responses, and the intricate balance between epigenetic deregulation and proinflammatory signaling are characteristic of this disease, collectively posing significant scientific and clinical challenges in its management. CMML is an aging-related, clinically heterogeneous neoplasm with limited approved therapeutic options, representing an area of unmet medical need. This review offers a comprehensive analysis of the current understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving CMML evolution and its clinical manifestations within the ever-evolving landscape of precision medicine. In light of the most recent molecular discoveries, we highlight the shortcomings of existing therapies and underscore promising investigational agents. Many of the biological findings discussed are shared across a spectrum of acute and chronic myeloid neoplasms, as well as clonal hematopoiesis, broadening the scope of this review."

"Ecuador's legal framework promises equitable access to health care for all. However, gaps in coverage are being exacerbated by the nearly 500,000 Venezuelan distress migrants remaining in the country over the past decade. The purpose of our study was to examine how the Ecuadorian health system responds to the needs of migrant populations arriving in poor health conditions. We conducted 28 key informant interviews with government officials, health care providers, and representatives of international cooperation agencies and migrant organizations, and analyzed documents from a related Constitutional Court sentence. We find that despite Ecuador's commitments, significant gaps exist in the implementation of protection mechanisms for distress migrants. Systemic obstacles, such as documentation requirements and exclusion from benefits granted by law, remain. Discriminatory practices and concerns about the allocation of limited resources can further impede access. The Constitutional Court case underscores how the judicialization of health may prompt the government to address distress migrants' right to health and document its progress. Ultimately, more comprehensive approaches are needed to promote a more equitable health system that addresses the specific experiences and needs of distress migrants in Ecuador."
"The limited availability of suitable animal models and cell lines often impedes experimental cancer research. Wet-laboratory experiments are also time-consuming and cost-intensive. In this review, we present an in silico modeling strategy, namely, Boolean network (BN) models, and demonstrate how it could be applied to streamline experimental design and to focus the effort of experimental read-outs. Boolean network models allow for the dynamic analysis of large molecular signaling pathways and their crosstalks. After establishing and validating a specific tumor model, mechanistic insights into the tumor cell behavior can be gained by studying the trajectories of different tumor phenotypes. Also, tumor driver and drug target screenings can be performed. These automatic screenings can help to identify new intervention targets and putative biomarkers for tumor evolution, hence guiding new wet-laboratory experiments. The goal of this round-up is to demonstrate how to establish, validate, and use BN modeling and its crosstalks in classic wet-laboratory research using a chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) BN model."
"Regulator of G protein signaling 1 (RGS1) is known to be highly expressed in various tumors, but its specific effects and regulatory mechanism in ovarian cancer (OC) progression are not well understood. To delve into the tumor biology, a predictive risk model for OC was developed, incorporating RGS1, PRKG2, CD24, and ABCB1, with RGS1 exhibiting the strongest correlation. The model's reliability and validity were confirmed through Kaplan-Meier analysis, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and principal component analysis (PCA). The risk score was validated as an independent indicator of overall survival, and a nomogram model was created to predict overall survival. Moreover, RGS1 expression was found to be up-regulated and associated with a poor prognosis in OC. Functional studies revealed that deleting RGS1 inhibited OC cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo, while overexpression of RGS1 enhanced cell proliferation. Additionally, blocking the NF-kB pathway was shown to impede RGS1-induced proliferation, and overexpression of p65 partially reversed the effects of RGS1 deletion, promoting the tumorigenic properties of OC cells. These findings suggest that RGS1 could be a valuable biomarker for predicting prognosis and a potential novel therapeutic target for OC treatment."

"Influenza A virus particles assemble at the plasma membrane of infected cells. During assembly all components of the virus come together in a coordinated manner to deform the membrane into a protrusion eventually forming a new, membrane-enveloped virus. Here, we integrate recent molecular insights of this process, particularly concerning the structure of the matrix protein 1 (M1), within a theoretical framework describing the mechanics of virus assembly. Our model describes M1 polymerization and membrane protrusion formation, explaining why it is efficient for M1 to form long strands assembling into helices in filamentous virions. Eventually, we find how the architecture of M1 helices is controlled by physical properties of viral proteins and the host cell membrane. Finally, by considering the growth force and speed of viral filaments, we propose that the helical geometry of M1 strands might have evolved to optimize for fast and efficient virus assembly and growth."
"Obesity is a major public health issue worldwide. Despite various approaches to weight loss, the most effective technique for reducing obesity, as well as diabetes and associated diseases, is bariatric surgery. Increasingly, young women without children are undergoing bariatric surgery, vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) being the most common procedure nowadays. However, despite several reports suggesting bone loss after VSG, little is known about the potential additive effects of gestation and lactation after VSG to bone health. This study investigated the combined effects of pre-gestational VSG and subsequent gestation/lactation on bone metabolism in a rat model fed a high fat high sugar (HFHS) diet, with a focus on bone biomechanics, mass, microarchitecture and material properties. Furthermore, bone mass and remodelling were followed longitudinally by microCT prior to surgery, 4 weeks post-surgery, after weaning and at sacrifice. Significant alterations in bone mass and microarchitecture, characterized by changes in trabecular thickness and number, as well as changes in bone formation and resorption were influenced by both surgery and reproductive demands. Mechanical testing at sacrifice demonstrated compromised long bone fragility, in rat with HFHS regardless of the surgical procedure (Sham or VSG). Furthermore, analysis of bone material properties highlighted potential disruptions in the pattern of bone mineralization in sham and VSG animals fed a HFHS diet. These findings underscore the complex interplay between pre-gestational VSG and subsequent gestation/lactation in modulating bone metabolism in the investigated rat model. The preclinical rat model may help with optimizing surgical strategies and developing targeted interventions to mitigate potential bone-related complications associated with VSG in reproductive-aged individuals."
"The weight-adjusted waist index (WWI) is a novel anthropometric measure. WWI is linked to reduced muscle mass and strength; however, its efficacy for assessing sarcopenia and predicting adverse outcomes has yet to be validated.

A recent study by Peterson et al. that characterized individuals with metabolically healthy obesity (MHO) or metabolically unhealthy obesity (MUO) in depth provides insights into the potential pathogenesis of MUO that accounts for much of the cardiometabolic disease and excess mortality caused by the obesity epidemic.
"Hyperpolarized 1- 13 C-pyruvate magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and MRS imaging (MRSI) offer noninvasive and real-time direct assessment of the altered metabolism of cancer cells known as the Warburg effect-a key hallmark of cancer. When combined with simultaneously acquired 18 F-FDG PET in a PET/MR scanner, coined hyperPET by us, this dual-modality may unveil cancer-type specific glucose metabolic phenotypes with potential implications for patient prognostication, treatment-response assessment, and prediction. We here present the first human data of simultaneously acquired hyperpolarized MRS/MRSI and PET performed in a PET/MR scanner-and the first human hyperpolarized MRS/MRSI data from a patient with lymphoma."
Continuous monitoring of blood culture (BC) systems allows rapid detection of microbial growth.

"Geisha coffee is recognized for its unique aromas and flavors and, accordingly, has achieved the highest prices in the specialty coffee markets. We report the development of a chromosome-level, well-annotated, genome assembly of Coffea arabica var. Geisha. Geisha is considered an Ethiopian landrace that represents germplasm from the Ethiopian center of origin of coffee. We used a hybrid de novo assembly approach combining 2 long-read single molecule sequencing technologies, Oxford Nanopore and Pacific Biosciences, together with scaffolding with Hi-C libraries. The final assembly is 1.03 Gb in size with BUSCO assessment of the assembly completeness of 97.7% of single-copy orthologs clusters. RNA-Seq and Iso-Seq data were used as transcriptional experimental evidence for annotation and gene prediction revealing the presence of 47,062 gene loci encompassing 53,273 protein-coding transcripts. Comparison of the assembly to the progenitor subgenomes separated the set of chromosome sequences inherited from Coffea canephora from those of Coffea eugenioides. Corresponding orthologs between the 2 Arabica varieties, Geisha and Red Bourbon, had a 99.67% median identity, higher than what we observe with the progenitor assemblies (median 97.28%). Both Geisha and Red Bourbon contain a recombination event on chromosome 10 relative to the 2 progenitors that must have happened before the geographical separation of the 2 varieties, consistent with a single allopolyploidization event giving rise to C. arabica. Broadening the availability of high-quality genome assemblies of C. arabica varieties paves the way for understanding the evolution and domestication of coffee, as well as the genetic basis and environmental interactions of why a variety like Geisha is capable of producing beans with such exceptional and unique high quality."
"RNA-lipid interactions directly influence RNA activity, which plays a crucial role in the development of new applications in medicine and biotechnology. However, while specific preferential behaviors between RNA and lipid bilayers have been identified experimentally, their molecular origin remains unexplored. Here we use molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the interaction between RNA and membranes composed of zwitterionic lipids at the atomistic level. Our data reproduce and rationalize previous experimental observations, including that short-chain RNAs rich in guanine have a higher affinity for gel-phase membranes compared to RNA sequences rich in other nucleotides and that RNA prefers gel-phase membranes to fluid bilayers. Our simulations reveal that RNA order is a key molecular determinant of RNA-zwitterionic phospholipid interactions. Our data provide a wealth of information at the atomic level that will help accelerate research on RNA-lipid assemblies for task-specific applications such as designing lipid-based nanocarriers for RNA delivery."
"Management of pressure sores can have various environmental effects; moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic notably affected efforts towards effective management of pressure sores. Some cases of COVID-19 infections require long-term hospitalization in the intensive care unit. Moreover, special protective equipment worn by physicians owing to the pandemic complicate wound management. In this study, we compared the pressure ulcer characteristics between isolated patients with and those without COVID-19 and evaluated the effects of isolation on pressure sores. From November 2022 to February 2023, patients who had pressure sores were included and their medical records were reviewed retrospectively. The experimental group included patients with confirmed COVID-19 infections, who received clinical treatment in an isolated unit. Wound characteristics in each group and associated risk factors were analysed. Fifty-four isolated patients with COVID-19 and 58 control patients were included. The Braden Scale score and Korea patient classification system-1 did not vary significantly between the two groups. However, the number of Grade I pressure sores in the COVID-19 isolation group was significantly lower than those in the control group (p < 0.001), while the number of lesions was significantly higher (p = 0.034). The mortality rate in the COVID-19 isolation group was higher than that in the control group (p = 0.008), and more patients were discharged with unhealed wounds (p = 0.004). A higher treatment effect on pressure sores may be expected if the disease is more actively managed. Moreover, the wound care systems for isolated patients with COVID-19 require further attention."

"This study investigates the metabolic disruptions caused by nicotine (NIC) exposure, with a particular focus on amino acid and lipid metabolism, and evaluates resveratrol (RSV) as a potential protective agent. Mice were divided into four groups: control (CON), NIC-exposed, NIC + RSV-treated, and RSV-only. NIC exposure resulted in significant weight loss, elevated glucose levels, altered lipid profiles, and organ damage, particularly in the liver and kidneys. Increased inflammation was evidenced by elevated levels of IL-6 and CRP. In contrast, RSV treatment mitigated these effects by improving lipid profiles, glycemic indices, and reducing inflammatory markers. Histopathological analysis confirmed reduced tissue damage in the NIC + RSV group compared to the NIC-alone group. Metabolomics analysis using LC-MS/MS revealed significant dysregulation in lipid, amino acid, and nucleotide metabolism in NIC-exposed mice. Fold-change analysis identified altered metabolites, including sphingomyelin 36:1;02 (p < 0.001), valine (p < 0.001), triacylglycerol 4:0-18:1 (p < 0.001), and ceramide 32:1;02 (p < 0.001). Amino acids such as arginine, phenylalanine, glutamic acid, tyrosine, and lysine, as well as NIC metabolites like nornicotine and cotinine, were identified, underscoring molecular fragmentation analysis findings. RSV treatment partially restored metabolic balance, highlighting its role as a metabolic modulator. This study underscores the therapeutic potential of RSV in alleviating NIC-induced metabolic dysfunctions by restoring lipid homeostasis and reducing inflammation. Additionally, it emphasizes the importance of RSV in addressing NIC-related metabolic impairments and the need for noninvasive biomarkers for early disease detection."
"Coral reefs are critical ecosystems, fostering biodiversity and sustaining the livelihoods of millions globally. Nonetheless, they confront escalating threats, with infectious diseases emerging as primary catalysts for extensive damage, surpassing the impacts of other human-induced stressors. Disease transmission via biotic factors, particularly during fish predation, is a crucial yet often overlooked pathway. While their feeding can spread infectious diseases through spores, it also controls the growth of macroalgae, a major competitor for space on the reef. Given this dual effect, the precise impact of fish on coral disease remains ambiguous and requires additional investigation. In this study, we addressed this gap for the first time by employing a mathematical model. Our analyses unveil intricate interactions between fish predation and coral health, revealing potential benefits and drawbacks for coral reef ecosystems. Coral survival hinges on a delicate balance of fish predation, with extremes (both low and high) offering some protection against disease outbreaks compared to moderate predation, which can cause sudden die-offs. More specifically, as fish predation intensifies, the ecosystem undergoes a tipping point, transitioning from a disease-dominated state to a healthier one. Moreover, the interplay between transmission rate and virulence in coral populations is significantly shaped by fish predation rates. Specifically, the threshold ratio of transmission to virulence, signalling a regime shift from a healthy to a disease-dominated state, exhibits a linear increase with fish predation rate. Overall, our findings emphasize the importance of considering biotic interactions in coral disease ecology and offer insights essential for effective reef conservation strategies."
"Today, an increasing number of Canadian adults are providing unpaid care to their family members and friends while working full or part-time. We conducted a national survey of unpaid caregiving for older people in 2022 to learn who these people are, why they care, and to identify the social, economic, and health impacts of unpaid caregiving. Our findings show that many of these caregivers are also employees. While most research shows that women caregivers and carer-employees experience work-care tension that results in negative mental and physical health outcomes, our results are more mixed. This paper provides descriptive findings of carer-employee's health and well-being, and compares them to previous research in Canada and abroad. I conclude with policy options for governments and employers to support the health and well-being of carer-employees."

"A previously isolated lipopeptide biosurfactant-producing bacterium Bacillus licheniformis SCV1 was investigated for the production of the biosurfactant using wastewater from parboiled paddy rice. The biosurfactant thus produced was evaluated for its antifungal property against dermatophyte fungi Trichophyton ajelloi and Microsporum fulvum. Results revealed that the bacterial strain reduced surface tension of the media from 56.16 ± 1 mN/m to 35 ± 0.9 mN/m within 12 h, which further shrank to 29.3 ± 1 mN/m in 24 h of incubation. The yield of the biosurfactant was 3.15 ± 0.25 g/L at 48 h of incubation. The obtained biosurfactant exhibited efficient emulsifying activity against a wide range of hydrophobic substrates such as crude oil, olive oil, engine oil, and kerosene oil used in the study. The critical micelle concentration of the biosurfactant was found to be 80 mg/L. Structural characterization using FT-IR and TLC revealed that the biosurfactant produced by the strain in the wastewater is a lipopeptide consisting of surfactin and iturin. LCMS analysis revealed that the surfactin homologs range from C12 to C17-surfactin while the iturin contains C13 to C17-iturin homologs. It also revealed an in vitro study that the biosurfactant has antifungal properties against dermatophyte fungi Trichophyton ajelloi and Microsporum fulvum. Microscopic observation of the hyphae of the treated dermatophyte revealed disruption and fissure of the mycelia. The chemical composition of the wastewater revealed that it contains adequate nutritional composition and micronutrients to support bacterial growth. This is the first report that the wastewater of parboiled paddy could be used as a low-cost substrate for the production of lipopeptide biosurfactant, and the biosurfactant could be used for preventing dermatophytes fungi."

"Strong peer relationships are an essential component of a healthy, happy, and long lifetime. Given that there is little understanding of the impact of COVID-19 on peer relationships, this study explored the effects of the COVID waves on peer relationships for clinically referred children and youth while controlling for age, sex, and income. 11,281 children and youth between the ages of 4 and 18 years, who were receiving services from mental health agencies across Ontario from January 2018-March 2022, were assessed using the interRAI ChYMH. Chi-square tests of independence and logistic regression analysis was performed. Overall, as expected, there were significantly fewer peer relationship difficulties during COVID-19 compared to the pre-pandemic period. Despite the general decline of peer issues, individuals between the ages of 8-18, particularly males, were more likely to experience peer relationship difficulties compared to those 4-7 years old. Additionally, children from the lowest income households experienced greater peer relationship difficulties during COVID-19 when compared to those from the highest income households. The findings from this study demonstrate the nuanced changes in social behaviours due to the ongoing pandemic for children and youth and highlight those youth who are most in need of social and behavioural interventions."
"Research into the biology of plant viruses, their mechanisms of pathogenicity, and the induction of host resistance has laid a solid foundation for the discovery of antiviral agents and their targets and the development of effective control technologies. Additionally, recent advancements in fields such as chemical biology, cheminformatics, bioinformatics, and synthetic biology have provided valuable methods and tools for the design of antiviral drugs, the synthesis of drug molecules, assessment of their activity, and investigation of their modes of action. Compared with drug development for human viral diseases, the control of plant viral diseases presents greater challenges, including the cost-benefit of agents, simplification of control technologies, and the effectiveness of treatments. Therefore, in the current context of complex outbreaks and severe damage caused by plant viral diseases, it is crucial to delve deeper into the research and development of antiviral agents. This review provides a detailed overview of the biological characteristics of current targets for antiviral agents, the mode of interaction between plant virus targets and antivirals, and insights for future drug development. We believe this review will not only facilitate the in-depth analysis of the development of antivirals for crops but also offer valuable perspectives for the development of antiviral agents for use in human and veterinary medicine."
"Electronic noses (eNose) and gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) are two important breath analysis approaches for differentiating between respiratory diseases. We evaluated the performance of a novel electronic nose for different respiratory diseases, and exhaled breath samples from patients were analyzed by GC-MS."
"Osseointegration is essential for successful implant treatment. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we focused on decorin (DCN), which was hypothesized to be present in the proteoglycan (PG) layer at the interface between bone and the titanium oxide (TiOx) surface. We utilized DCN RNA interference in human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) to investigate its effects on PG layer formation, proliferation, initial adhesion, cell extension, osteogenic capacity, fibrotic markers, and immunotolerance to TiOx in vitro. After 14 days of cultivation, we observed no PG layer was detected, and the osteogenic capacity was suppressed in DCN-depleted hBMSCs. Furthermore, the conditioned medium upregulated the expression of M1 macrophage markers in human macrophages. These results suggest that endogenous DCN plays a crucial role in PG layer formation and that the PG layer alters inflammation around Ti materials."
"Burkholderia pseudomallei, causative agent of melioidosis, is a One Health concern as it is acquired directly from soil and water and causes disease in humans and agricultural and wild animals. We examined B. pseudomallei in soil and goats at a single farm in the Northern Territory of Australia where >30 goats acquired melioidosis over nine years."
"Failure in the elongation of the cardiac outflow tract (OFT) results in congenital heart disease due to the misalignment of the great arteries with the left and right ventricles. The OFT lengthens via the accretion of progenitors from the second heart field (SHF). SHF cells are exquisitely regionalized and organized into an epithelial-like layer, forming the dorsal pericardial wall (DPW). Tissue tension, cell polarity, and proliferation within the DPW are important for the addition of SHF-derived cells to the heart and OFT elongation. However, the genes controlling these processes are not completely characterized. Using conditional mutagenesis in the mouse, we show that fibronectin (FN1) synthesized by the mesoderm coordinates multiple cellular behaviors in the anterior DPW. FN1 is enriched in the anterior DPW and plays a role in OFT elongation by maintaining a balance between pro- and anti-adhesive cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions and controlling DPW cell shape, polarity, cohesion, proliferation, and mechanotransduction."
To evaluate the role of hypothalamic inflammation and gliosis in human obesity pathogenesis and other disease processes influenced by obesity.
"Autonomous cortisol secretion (ACS) is not uncommon in patients with primary aldosteronism (PA). However, the cardiovascular burden of ACS due to its dysregulated cortisol secretion remains poorly understood. Thus, we examined the effects of ACS on vascular calcification in a hyperaldosteronism environment in vitro and in vivo. A total of 339 patients with PA with adrenal incidentaloma and low-dose dexamethasone suppression test data (cutoff level: cortisol > 1.8 μg/dL) from a prospectively maintained database were enrolled; abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) scores were quantitatively estimated. Human aortic smooth muscle cells (HAOSMCs) were used as in vitro model of vascular calcification. In this study, 65 of the 339 patients with PA had ACS; 274 did not. Patients with PA/ACS had a higher AAC score (1171.0 ± 2434.0 vs. 489.5 ± 1085.3, P = 0.012) than patients without ACS. ACS was independently associated with AAC score (β = 0.139, P = 0.004) in multivariate analysis, and post-suppression cortisol level was significantly correlated with the AAC score (P = 0.004). In the HAOSMC model, co-treatment with cortisol synergistically stimulated alkaline phosphatase activity and calcium deposition in a hyperaldosteronism environment. The stimulatory effect of cortisol was abolished by the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonist eplerenone, but not glucocorticoid receptor antagonist mifepristone, indicating a MR-dependent mechanism. In conclusion, the presence of ACS is associated with heavier vascular calcification in patients with PA. Aldosterone and cortisol synergistically activate HAOSMC calcification via MR signaling, via a process that can be attenuated by eplerenone."
"A longstanding body of public enquiries and research identifies people living with dementia experience systemic inequalities within hospital settings, concluding a focus on improving care cultures is required. Drawing on a 3-year multi-sited hospital ethnography, this paper examines everyday cultures of care in NHS acute hospital wards to interrogate how ethnicity, gender and social class intersects to shape the care of people living with dementia. Drawing on Collins' concept of intersectionality and the relational nature of power, the analysis reveals that while cared for by diverse teams of healthcare professionals, a patients' age, ethnicity, gender and social class, as interconnected categories, influences the tightening of ward rules for some people living with dementia and the granting of significant privileges for others. Focussing on walking within the ward, with a large number of people living with dementia classified as 'wandering', we explore ways in which intersectional identities informed who was granted privileges to leave the bedside and 'wander' the ward, and who experienced further control. The paper concludes that institutional racism and attitudes to gender, social class and ageing permeate the routine organisation and delivery of care within NHS acute hospital wards to significantly impact people living with dementia, and in turn, increases the consideration of care pathways that emphasise their discharge to institutional settings."
"Monitoring the symptoms of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) patients is now frequently made in the form of patient reported outcomes (PRO), rather than historical clinical activity scores. Unlike several chronic diseases, the role of telemonitoring in IBD has not yet been defined, particularly in terms of patient compliance with remote monitoring; the aim of our study was to assess patient compliance with digital monitoring of PRO as part of routine medical follow-up."
"Salvianolic acid B (SalB) demonstrates diverse clinical applications, particularly in cardiovascular and cerebral protection. This study primarily investigated the effects of SalB on sepsis."
"Splenic metastases (SM) from breast cancer (SMBC) are exceedingly rare. To date, the relevant literature is primarily based on pan-tumour species, with only a few studies exploring SM specifically in relation to breast cancer. As such, the present retrospective study explored the clinicopathological characteristics and prognoses of patients with SMBC at the breast care centre of the authors' hospital."
"The gut-brain axis plays an integral role in maintaining overall health, with growing evidence suggesting its impact on the development of various neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression. This review explores the complex relationship between gut microbiota and glutamate (Glu) regulation, highlighting its effect on brain health, particularly in the context of depression following certain neurological insults. We discuss how microbial populations can either facilitate or limit Glu uptake, influencing its bioavailability and predisposing to neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity. Additionally, we examine the role of gut metabolites and their influence on the blood-brain barrier and neurotransmitter systems involved in mood regulation. The therapeutic potential of microbiome-targeted interventions, such as fecal microbiota transplantation, is also highlighted. While much research has explored the role of Glu in major depressive disorders and other neurological diseases, the contribution of gut microbiota in post-neurological depression remains underexplored. Future research should focus on explaining the mechanisms linking the gut microbiota to neuropsychiatric outcomes, particularly in conditions such as post-stroke depression, post-traumatic brain-injury depression, and epilepsy-associated depression. Systematic reviews and human clinical studies are needed to establish causal relationships and assess the efficacy of microbiome-targeted therapies in improving the neuropsychiatric sequalae after neurological insults."
"The subcellular compartment-specific molecular interactions (SCSIs) are the building blocks for most molecular functions, biological processes and disease pathogeneses. Extensive experiments have therefore been conducted to accumulate the valuable information of SCSIs, but none of the available databases has been constructed to describe those data. In this study, a novel knowledge base SubCELL is thus introduced to depict the landscape of SCSIs among DNAs/RNAs/proteins. This database is UNIQUE in (a) providing, for the first time, the experimentally-identified SCSIs, (b) systematically illustrating a large number of SCSIs inferred based on well-established method and (c) collecting experimentally-determined subcellular locations for the DNAs/RNAs/proteins of diverse species. Given the essential physiological/pathological role of SCSIs, the SubCELL is highly expected to have great implications for modern molecular biological study, which can be freely accessed with no login requirement at: https://idrblab.org/subcell/."
This study aims to identify factors predicting recurrence and unfavorable prognosis in cN+ patients who have undergone sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) following neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC).
"The NIH Pragmatic Trials Collaboratory supports the design and conduct of 32 embedded pragmatic clinical trials, and many of these trials rely on data from the electronic health record (EHR) to monitor outcomes and/or use functionality provided by the EHR platform to deliver the intervention. Given the complexity and dynamic nature of EHR systems, study teams have encountered challenges in use of the EHR for these purposes, including challenges related to local implementation of trial interventions, rapid technology evolution, EHR updates, and transitions in EHR systems. In this article, we share case examples and lessons learned, and suggest that teams need to be aware of-and perhaps proactively investigate- possible changes to EHR systems and data that will affect the delivery of interventions and the integrity and safety of pragmatic clinical trials."
The effect of sarcopenia on depressive mood during geriatric rehabilitation remains unclear. This study investigated the potential influence of sarcopenia on depressive mood among geriatric patients in a rehabilitation setting.
"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 85% of lung cancers, and KRAS mutations occur in 25% to 30% of NSCLC. Our approach to developing a therapeutic with the potential to target KRAS-mutant NSCLC was to identify a new target involved in modulating signaling proteins in the RAS pathway. Glutathione S-transferase P (GSTP), known as a phase II detoxification enzyme, has more recently been identified as a modulator of MAPK-related cell signaling pathways. Therefore, developing a GSTP siRNA may be an effective therapeutic approach to treat KRAS-mutant NSCLC. The lead drug product candidate (NBF-006) is a proprietary siRNA-based lipid nanoparticle comprising GSTP siRNA (NDT-05-1040). Here, studies using a panel of KRAS-mutant NSCLC cell lines demonstrated that NDT-05-1040 is a very potent and selective GSTP siRNA inhibitor. Our Western blot analysis showed that NDT-05-1040 effectively decreased the phosphorylation of MAPK and PI3K pathway components while upregulating apoptotic signaling cascade. Our in vivo studies revealed statistically significant higher distribution of NBF-006 to the lungs and tumor as compared with the liver. In the subcutaneous and orthotopic tumor models, NBF-006 led to a statistically significant and dose-dependent antitumor growth inhibition. Furthermore, quantitative image analysis of proliferating cell nuclear antigen and PARP staining showed that NBF-006 decreased proliferation and induced apoptosis, respectively, in tumors. Additionally, in a surgically implanted orthotopic lung tumor model, the survival rate of the NBF-006 treatment group was significantly prolonged (P < 0.005) as compared with the vehicle control group. Together, these preclinical studies supported advancement of NBF-006 into clinical studies."
"The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of sasX, arginine catabolic mobile element (ACME) genes, biofilm formation and some biofilm related virulence factor genes in causative and contaminant coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS) strains isolated from blood cultures. Of the 150 CNS strains included in the study, 50 were grouped as infectious agents and 100 as contaminants. Biofilm formation of the strains was investigated by microplate method and the presence of sasX, ACME, mecA and biofilm associated virulence factor genes icaA, icaD, aap, bhp and IS256 were investigated by inhouse polymerase chain reaction method. While 52% of the strains in the infectious agents group and 57% of the strains in the contamination group phenotypically formed biofilm; when the levels of biofilm positivity were compared, it was observed that the strains in the infectious agents group (30%) formed biofilm at a stronger level than the strains in the contamination group (14%) (p= 0.027). Biofilm-associated icaA, icaD, IS256, aap and bhp genes were found positive in 33%, 45%, 43%, 74% and 6% of the strains in the contamination group and 64%, 62%, 64%, 74% and 8% of the strains in the infectious agents group, respectively. ACME gene regions arcA, kdpA and opp3B and sasX related gene region were found positive in 30%, 7%, 8% and 14% of the strains in the contamination group and in 12%, 2%, 6% and 10% of the strains in the infectious agents group, respectively. The positivity of icaA, icaD and IS256 genes alone or together in the infectious agents group (p< 0.001, p= 0.050, p= 0.015, respectively) and the positivity of ACME and arcA in the contamination group (p= 0.008, p= 0.015, respectively) were statistically significantly higher. No significant difference was found between the two groups for sasX, aap and bhp genes. In conclusion, among the CNS strains isolated from blood cultures, strains that form a strong biofilm and are positive for biofilm-associated gene regions alone or together can be considered as infectious agents, while strains that are found to be arcA positive in the absence of clinical signs of infection can be considered as contaminants."
The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlation of the volume and minimum axial area (MAA) measurements between different upper and lower boundaries used for oropharyngeal airway assessment.
"Leprosy reactions being closely related to damage to peripheral nerves and physical disabilities associated with disease progression.

We followed up the progression of leprosy reactions in children identifying associated factors with the emergence and/or worsening of nerve damage."
To assess characteristics of increased intracranial pressure (ICP) in myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease (MOGAD).
"Population-based studies on the association between cadmium (Cd) exposure and thyroid function are limited and have shown conflicting results. Two independent cross-sectional studies using different Cd biomarkers were carried out in six rural areas with different soil Cd levels in China. Thyroid dysfunction was defined based on levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (FT4). Multivariable linear regression, multiple logistic regression, and restrictive cubic splines models were used to estimate the association between Cd and thyroid dysfunction. For both of the two independent studies, higher Cd levels were observed to be associated with lower TSH levels and higher risk of thyroid dysfunction. The negative relationship between urinary Cd and TSH was found in both total participants (β =  - 0.072, p = 0.008) and males (β =  - 0.119, p = 0.020) but not in females; however, the negative relationship between blood Cd and TSH was only found in females (β =  - 0.104, p = 0.024). Higher urinary Cd was associated with higher risk of thyroid dysfunction (OR = 1.77, p = 0.031), while higher blood Cd was associated with higher risk of thyroid dysfunction (OR = 1.95, p = 0.011). Results from the two independent cross-sectional studies consistently suggested that higher Cd levels were associated with sex-specific thyroid dysfunction."
"Semilunar valve regurgitation in single ventricular physiology is rare but portends a poor prognosis. Medical therapy is often ineffective particularly in the context of structural valve abnormality, and surgical valve repair or replacement can be associated with poor outcomes. We report an innovative use of a highly occlusive and conformable Gore Septal Occluder for transcatheter treatment of severe native aortic regurgitation in a symptomatic patient with hypoplastic left heart syndrome and severe systemic right ventricular dysfunction, resulting in safe and complete occlusion of the aortic regurgitant orifice and clinical benefit."
We aimed to determine the prevalence of genes associated with high-level mupirocin and biocide resistance in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates among hospitalized patients and to characterize their genomic and epidemiologic features.
"Second primary malignancies are being increasingly detected in the setting of thyroid cancer, because of adoption of the advanced imaging modalities including PET/CT. Herein, we present a patient of papillary thyroid carcinoma who initially underwent total thyroidectomy with bilateral neck dissection followed by 131 I radioactive iodine therapy. A prostatic lesion was incidentally detected on 18 F-FDG PET/CT scan, which was intensely 18 F-FDG avid and also showed intense focal 68 Ga-prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) uptake on 68 Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT scan. This led to the diagnosis of prostatic adenocarcinoma as a second primary cancer in this patient with papillary thyroid carcinoma."
"The aim of this study was to analyze the association between circulating amino acids and central and peripheral body temperature in subjects with and without fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). A total of 47 patients with FMS and 59 healthy subjects were included in the study. The concentration of amino acids was determined in serum samples using a fluorimeter coupled with a high-performance liquid chromatography system. An infrared thermography camera was used to estimate peripheral hand temperatures. The core temperature of the body was estimated using an infrared thermometer, which was applied to the axillary and tympanic areas. Correlations between several thermographic variables of the hands and tryptophan, methionine, 3-methylhistidine, histidine, glutamic acid, and tyrosine were identified exclusively within the FMS group. In contrast, correlations between aminoadipic acid and serine and thermographic variables were observed only in the healthy control group. The concentrations of asparagine and lysine correlated with thermographic variables in both groups. The essential amino acid leucine was found to correlate with axillary temperature in FMS patients. However, it should be noted that the observed associations between aminoadipic acid and tryptophan blood concentrations and axillary temperature were limited to the control group. Several correlations were identified between circulating amino acids and different body temperatures in both healthy controls and patients with FMS. However, the correlation pattern differs significantly between FMS patients and healthy controls. These findings suggest the possibility of a change in the function of several amino acids in the thermoregulatory process in patients with FMS."
"Nicotine-exacerbated atherosclerosis significantly increases global mortality. Endothelial cells, which line the interior of blood vessels, are crucial for maintaining vascular function. How nicotine is involved in vascular remodeling in atherosclerosis via modulating endothelial dysfunction remains unknown."
"The discipline of ecology and evolutionary biology (EEB) has long grappled with issues of inclusivity and representation, particularly for individuals with systematically excluded and marginalized backgrounds or identities. For example, significant representation disparities still persist that disproportionately affect women and gender minorities; Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC); individuals with disabilities; and people who are LGBTQIA+. Recent calls for action have urged the EEB community to directly address issues of representation, inclusion, justice, and equity. One aspect of this endeavor is to examine the use of EEB's discipline-specific language and terminology, which may have the potential to perpetuate unjust systems and isolate marginalized groups. Through a mixed-methods survey, we examined how members of the EEB community perceive discipline-specific terminology, including how they believe it can be harmful and which terms they identified as problematic. Of the 795 survey respondents, we found that almost half agreed that there are harmful terms in EEB and that many individuals from marginalized groups responded that they have been harmed by such terminology. Most of the terms identified as harmful relate to race, ethnicity, and immigration; sex and gender; geopolitical hierarchies; and historical violence. Our findings suggest there is an urgent need for EEB to confront and critically reassess its discipline-specific terminology. By identifying harmful terms and their impacts, our study represents a crucial first step toward dismantling deeply rooted exclusionary structures in EEB. We encourage individuals, communities, and institutions to use these findings to reevaluate language used in disciplinary research, teaching and mentoring, manuscripts, and professional societies. Rectifying current harms in EEB will help promote a more just and inclusive discipline."
"The lack of label information for the pediatric population has been a global issue, leading to the introduction of several countermeasures by major health authorities. Despite various efforts by Japanese health authorities, some drugs are approved only for adults in Japan, while the United States (US) label includes information on pediatric usage for the same drugs. This suggests a potential for pediatric-specific drug loss in Japan, where overall drug loss has recently become a major concern."
"Climate change can impact marine ecosystems through many biological and ecological processes. Ecosystem models are one tool that can be used to simulate how the complex impacts of climate change may manifest in a warming world. In this study, we used an end-to-end Atlantis ecosystem model to compare and contrast the effects of climate-driven species redistribution and projected temperature from three separate climate models on species of key commercial importance in the California Current Ecosystem. Adopting a scenario analysis approach, we used Atlantis to measure differences in the biomass, abundance, and weight at age of pelagic and demersal species among six simulations for the years 2013-2100 and tracked the implications of those changes for spatially defined California Current fishing fleets. The simulations varied in their use of forced climate-driven species distribution shifts, time-varying projections of ocean warming, or both. In general, the abundance and biomass of coastal pelagic species like Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax) and northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax) were more sensitive to projected climate change, while demersal groups like Dover sole (Microstomus pacificus) experienced smaller changes due to counteracting effects of spatial distribution change and metabolic effects of warming. Climate-driven species distribution shifts and the resulting changes in food web interactions were more influential than warming on end-of-century biomass and abundance patterns. Spatial projections of changes in fisheries catch did not always align with changes in abundance of their targeted species. This mismatch is likely due to species distribution shifts into or out of fishing areas and emphasizes the importance of a spatially explicit understanding of both climate change effects and fishing dynamics. We illuminate important biological and ecological pathways through which climate change acts in an ecosystem context and end with a discussion of potential management implications and future directions for climate change research using ecosystem models."
"CORUM (https://mips.helmholtz-muenchen.de/corum/) is a public database that offers comprehensive information about mammalian protein complexes, including their subunits, functions and associations with human diseases. The newly released CORUM 5.0, encompassing 7193 protein complexes, is the largest dataset of manually curated mammalian protein complexes publicly available. This update represents the most significant upgrade to the database in >15 years. At present, the molecular processes in cells that are influenced by drugs are only incompletely understood. In this latest release, we have begun systematically investigating the impact of drugs on protein complexes. Our studies are based on a dataset from DrugCentral comprising 725 protein drug targets with approved drugs and known mechanisms of action. To date, we have identified 1975 instances from the literature where a drug affects the formation and/or function of a protein complex. Numerous examples highlight the crucial role of understanding drug-protein complex relationships in drug efficacy. The expanded dataset and the inclusion of drug effects on protein complexes are expected to significantly enhance the utility and application potential of CORUM 5.0 in fields such as network medicine and pharmacological research."

"Functional abdominal pain disorders (FAPDs) are common in young people and are characterized by persistent or recurrent abdominal symptoms without apparent structural or biochemical abnormalities. FAPDs are associated with diminished quality of life, school absence, increased health care use, and comorbid anxiety and depression. Exposure-based internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) has demonstrated efficacy in alleviating abdominal symptoms and improving quality of life. However, a deeper understanding of effect mechanisms and identification of possible additional treatment targets could refine treatment."
"The role of dairy products in cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention remains controversial. This study investigates the association between dairy consumption and CVD incidence using data from the China Kadoorie Biobank and the UK Biobank, complemented by an updated meta-analysis. Among Chinese participants, regular dairy consumption (primarily whole milk) is associated with a 9% increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) and a 6% reduced risk of stroke compared to non-consumers. Among British participants, total dairy consumption is linked to lower risks of CVD, CHD, and ischemic stroke, with cheese and semi-skimmed/skimmed milk contributing to reduced CVD risk. Meta-analysis reveals that total dairy consumption is associated with a 3.7% reduced risk of CVD and a 6% reduced risk of stroke. Notably, inverse associations with CVD incidence are observed for cheese and low-fat dairy products. Current evidence suggests that dairy consumption, particularly cheese, may have protective effects against CVD and stroke."
"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), as a new type of targeted therapeutic drugs, have demonstrated durable efficacy in cancer treatment. However, some patients receiving ICI treatment may be affected by immune-related adverse events (irAE). Compared with irAE in skin tissues, gastrointestinal system, etc., irAE in the neuro-ophthalmic efferent system are relatively rare. The reported irAE in the neuro-ophthalmic efferent system mainly include myasthenia gravis, orbital extraocular myositis, thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy-like conditions, internuclear ophthalmoplegia, Miller-Fisher syndrome, and cranial nerve adverse events. Exploring the possible mechanisms and potential intervention measures of irAE in the neuro-ophthalmic efferent system is crucial for predicting the risk of irAE in patients, formulating preventive measures, and implementing more effective clinical treatments. This review aims to summarize the occurrence mechanisms, clinical features, and prevention and treatment measures of irAE in the neuro-ophthalmic efferent system, so as to assist ophthalmologists and oncologists in the early diagnosis and management of such patients."
"While the beneficial effects of physical fitness on general health are well-documented, the specific relationship between different types of physical fitness, particularly cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and muscular endurance fitness (MEF), and lung function in physically active young adults remains less explored."
"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an emergent threat due to the antimicrobial resistance crisis. Bacteriophages (phages) are promising agents for phage therapy approaches against P. aeruginosa. It has been proposed that metazoans harbor phages on their mucosal surfaces, and this could be exploited for the rational design of prophylactic phage therapy. The goal of this study was to evaluate the potential of phage-mucus interaction to prevent infections caused by P. aeruginosa. We isolated two phages capable of infecting P. aeruginosa. Both are similar in morphology and closely related genetically. However, phage VAC3 is more efficient in replicating in mucin-exposed P. aeruginosa in vitro and is preferentially held in the respiratory tract of C57BL/6 mice. Pre-treatment with VAC3 phage protects mice from a lethal dose of P. aeruginosa while VAC1 does not. This shows that phages adapted to mucosal conditions have potential to be applied as prophylactic measures against an ESKAPE pathogen."
"Australia is an ethnically diverse nation with large numbers of migrants and refugees entering the country yearly. Despite research demonstrating that individuals from culturally and linguistically diverse (CaLD) communities experience an elevated risk of developing a mental illness, mental health services uptake is consistently low. To improve the mental health outcomes of these CaLD individuals in Australia, there is an urgent need to understand barriers to treatment, such as stigma. Research has noted that gender may play a role in mental health stigma and help-seeking. Using a qualitative approach as part of the Embrace Multicultural Mental Health Project, the aim of this study was to explore gender perspectives in mental health stigma and help-seeking among Arabic-speaking and Swahili-speaking individuals in Sydney. A total of five focus group discussions and 18 interviews were undertaken online using Zoom, digitally recorded, transcribed, and thematically analysed. Three major themes were identified. The first theme related to stigma and the fears regarding mental illness being discovered by others. The second theme related to the different approaches to confronting stigma. The last theme related to the various issues considered when identifying sources of help. Our findings suggest that a nuanced approach using the 'what matters most' framework can explain how men and women within each community may experience stigma and emphasise different aspects of help-seeking. These findings can help to guide clinical practitioners in delivering gender-specific and culturally sensitive and effective treatment sessions with these CaLD individuals, in addition to offering directions for stigma-reduction initiatives."
"Obese adults are often reported to have smaller brain volumes than their non-obese peers. Whether this represents evidence of accelerations in obesity-driven atrophy or is instead a legacy of developmental differences established earlier in the lifespan remains unclear. This study investigated whether early-life differences in adiposity explain differences in numerous adult brain traits commonly attributed to mid-life obesity. We used a two-sample life course Mendelian randomization study in 37 501 adults recruited to UK Biobank (UKB) imaging centres from 2014, with secondary analyses in 6996 children assessed in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study (ABCD) recruited from 2018. Exposures were genetic variants for childhood (266 variants) and adult (470 variants) adiposity derived from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 407 741 UKB participants. Primary outcomes were: adult total brain volume; grey matter volume, thickness and surface area; white matter volume and hyperintensities; and hippocampus, amygdala and thalamus volumes at mean age 55 in the UKB. Secondary outcomes were equivalent childhood measures collected at mean age 10 in ABCD. In the UKB, individuals who were genetically predicted to have had higher levels of adiposity in childhood were found to have multiple smaller adult brain volumes relative to intracranial volume [e.g. z-score difference in normalized brain volume per category increase in adiposity-95% confidence interval (CI) = -0.20 (-0.28, -0.12); P = 4 × 10-6]. These effect sizes remained essentially unchanged after accounting for birthweight or current adult obesity in multivariable models, whereas most observed adult effects attenuated towards null [e.g. adult z-score (95% CI) for total volume = 0.06 (-0.05, 0.17); P = 0.3]. Observational analyses in ABCD showed a similar pattern of changes already present in those with a high body mass index by age 10 [z-score (95% CI) = -0.10 (-0.13, -0.07); P = 8 × 10-13], with follow-up genetic risk score analyses providing some evidence for a causal effect already at this early age. Sensitivity analyses revealed that many of these effects were likely due to the persistence of larger head sizes established in those who gained excess weight in childhood [childhood z-score (95% CI) for intracranial volume = 0.14 (0.05, 0.23); P = 0.002], rather than smaller brain sizes per se. Our data suggest that the persistence of early-life developmental differences across the life course may underlie numerous neuroimaging traits commonly attributed to obesity-related atrophy in later life."
"Carbon dots (CDs) with intrinsic bioactivities are candidates for bioimaging and disease therapy due to their diverse bioactivities, high biocompatibility, and multiple functionalities in multimodal theranostics. It is a multidisciplinary research hotspot that includes biology, physics, materials science, and chemistry. This progress report discusses the CDs with intrinsic bioactivities and their applications in multimodal theranostics. The relationship between the synthesis and structure of CDs is summarized and analyzed from a material and chemical perspective. The bioactivities of CDs including anti-tumor, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory etc. are discussed from biological points of view. Subsequently, the optical and electronic properties of CDs that can be applied in the biomedical field are summarized from a physical perspective.

"Monolepta hieroglyphica, in view of its wide-ranging host and highly polyphagous characteristics, has become an important agricultural pest in East and Southeast Asian countries. To better understand its biology and develop control strategies, we present a high-quality chromosome-level genome assembly of M. hieroglyphica, with contig N50 of 18.62 Mb and scaffold N50 of 241.916 Mb. Using 156x Hi-C data, we anchored a total length of 2,313 Mb (91.9% of the genome) to nine chromosomes. We predicted 46,561 genes using an integrated approach. The completeness of the final reported genome and proteome were assessed by BUSCO and show high values of 99.4% and 95.2%, respectively. The high-quality chromosome-level genome assembly of M. hieroglyphica will be a useful molecular resource for the communities of both beetle and crop protection."
"Cucumaria frondosa (Gennerus, 1767) or orange-footed sea cucumbers are traditional food and are used as natural sources of anti-diabetic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-angiogenic, antimicrobial, and anticancer agents. Currently, the introduction of value-added sea cucumber products to the global market has inspired basic research on frondoside A and other saponins in sea cucumbers. These saponins serve as a means of their chemical defence. However, recent studies revealed that exposure to these saponins can lead to irritating symptoms from aerosolization of various holothurins. Moreover, extraction methods are critical to the bioavailability of various bioactive compounds found in sea cucumbers. Therefore, we have critically reviewed recent studies on the chemistry, biosynthesis, and pharmacological properties of frondoside A. Furthermore, the mechanism of actions of frondoside A was postulated and further studies are required for applications in functional foods, nutraceuticals, and pharmaceuticals. Frondoside A was first discovered from Cucumaria frondosa, and it is involved in protein kinase (PI3K/AKT/ERK1/2/p38 MAPK, RAC/CDC42 PAK1, NFκB/MAPK/JNK, and LXR-β) signalling pathways. It is also involved in the suppression of MYC oncogene transcriptional factors implicated and upregulated in over 70% of cancer types. Future research needs to be aimed at optimized green extraction techniques, efficient delivery methods, safety, and efficacy."
Personality traits and affective disorders are both related to functional limitations. It is unknown whether personality traits have an additional effect on functioning in older adults with affective disorders. We studied the association between personality traits and functioning within this group.

"Currently, women make up only 5% of the prison population, with 3604 women in prison in the UK compared to 74,981 men. Risky drinking is highly prevalent in both the male and female prison population, however, significantly more females drink in a risky way prior to prison (24% compared to 18% of men). In addition to risky drinking, those entering the criminal justice system (CJS), particularly women, are more likely to suffer from inequalities in society. Such inequalities can be linked to the pains of imprisonment for women. The overall research methods discussed in this paper are qualitative interviews. The interviews were designed after two systematic reviews exploring: the gendered pains of imprisonment and the feasibility and acceptability of women and alcohol brief interventions (ABI) were conducted. Interviews were conducted in an open prison setting, with both female residents and relevant staff and stakeholders. To date there is a dearth of evidence in relation to delivering ABI's in prison, specifically with women. This research explored the feasibility and acceptability of delivering ABI to women in prison and found that when delivering ABI's in a prison setting, by underpinning the research with criminological theory, could help women capitalise on the ""teachable moment"" necessary to induce behaviour change. The findings of the interviews found the intervention was both feasible and acceptable and identified five themes highlighting the women's journey through prison chronologically to enable a more holistic ABI to be developed in future."
Refractory malignant ascites (RMA) is a manifestation of end-stage cancer disease with a major impact on quality of life due to the symptom burden and need for repeated hospitalisations. We previously described the implantation of the permanent PleurX catheter as a treatment of RMA. The present study aimed to evaluate and describe our experience with the permanent PleurX catheter system in the largest cohort to date.
Pexidartinib is effective in patients with tenosynovial giant cell tumor (TGCT) for whom surgery is not feasible. Durability of response after discontinuation of pexidartinib and the safety and efficacy of restarting pexidartinib have not been previously recorded. This phase 4 study was designed to mimic the real-world experience with pexidartinib to evaluate the effects of discontinuation of and retreatment with pexidartinib in patients with TGCT who previously benefited from the drug.
"Human action recognition using WiFi channel state information (CSI) has gained attention due to its non-intrusive nature and potential applications in healthcare, smart environments, and security. However, the reliability of methods developed for CSI-based action recognition is often contingent on the quality of the datasets and evaluation protocols used. In this paper, we uncovered a critical data leakage issue, which arises from improper data partitioning, in a widely used WiFi CSI benchmark dataset. Specifically, the benchmark fails to separate individuals between the training and test sets, leading to inflated performance metrics as models inadvertently learn individual-specific features rather than generalizable action patterns. We analyzed this issue in depth, retrained several benchmarked models using corrected data partitioning methods, and demonstrated a significant drop in accuracy when individuals were properly separated across training and testing. Our findings highlight the importance of rigorous data partitioning in CSI-based action recognition and provide recommendations for mitigating data leakage in future research. This work contributes to the development of more robust and reliable human action recognition systems using WiFi CSI."

"We have adopted the classification Read-Across Structure-Activity Relationship (c-RASAR) approach in the present study for machine-learning (ML)-based model development from a recently reported curated dataset of nephrotoxicity potential of orally active drugs. We initially developed ML models using nine different algorithms separately on topological descriptors (referred to as simply ""descriptors"" in the subsequent sections of the manuscript) and MACCS fingerprints (referred to as ""fingerprints"" in the subsequent sections of the manuscript), thus generating 18 different ML QSAR models. Using the chemical spaces defined by the modeling descriptors and fingerprints, the similarity and error-based RASAR descriptors were computed, and the most discriminating RASAR descriptors were used to develop another set of 18 different ML c-RASAR models. All 36 models were cross-validated 20 times with a fivefold cross-validation strategy, and their predictivity was checked on the test set data. A multi-criteria decision-making strategy - the Sum of Ranking Differences (SRD) approach-was adopted to identify the best-performing model based on robustness and external validation parameters. This statistical analysis suggested that the c-RASAR models had an overall good performance, while the best-performing model was also a c-RASAR model (LDA c-RASAR model derived from topological descriptors, with MCC values of 0.229 and 0.431 for the training and test sets, respectively). This model was used to screen a true external data set prepared from the known nephrotoxic compounds of DrugBankDB, demonstrating good predictivity."

"This research delves into Primary Hyperoxaluria Type 2 (PH2), an autosomal recessive disorder precipitated by a unique case of compound heterozygous deleterious mutations in the GRHPR gene, specifically the intron2/3 c.214-2 T > G and the exon8 c.864-865delTG, leading to a premature stop codon at p.Val289fsTer22. The intron 2/3 variant (c.214-2 T > G) is a novel finding and is reported for the first time. These mutations are associated with profound alterations in protein structure and function. Employing patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), we have successfully generated a patient-specific model that exhibits the hallmarks of pluripotency, including typical stem cell morphology, expression of pluripotency markers, and a normal karyotype. The iPSCs are capable of differentiating into all three germ layers, underscoring their potential for regenerative medicine. The established iPSC line offers a promising platform for drug screening and regenerative medicine approaches for PH2."
"Neurodegenerative diseases (ND) are complex diseases of still unknown etiology. Lately, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have become increasingly popular and implicated in several pathologies as they have several roles and appear to be involved in all biological processes such as cell signaling and cycle control as well as translation and transcription. MEG3 is one of these and acts by binding proteins or directly or competitively binding miRNAs. It has a crucial role in controlling cell death, inflammatory process, oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, epithelial-mesenchymal transition and other processes. Recent reports showed that MEG3 is a major driving force of the necrosis phenomena in AD, causing the death of neurons, and its upregulation in cancer patients was linked to tumor suppression. Dysregulation of MEG3 affects neuronal cell death, inflammatory process, smooth muscle cell proliferation and consequently leads to the initiation or the acceleration of the disease. This review examines the current state of knowledge concerning the level of expression and the regulatory function of MEG3 in relation to several NDs. In addition, we examined the relation of MEG3 with neurotrophic factors such as Tumor growth factor β (TGFβ) and its possible mechanism of action. A comprehensive and in-depth analysis of the role of MEG3 in ND could give a clearer picture about the initiation of the process of neuronal death and help develop an alternative therapy that targets MEG3."
"In this work we analytically investigate the alignment mechanism of self-propelled ellipse-shaped cells in two spatial dimensions interacting via overlap avoidance. By considering a two-cell system and imposing certain symmetries, we obtain an analytically tractable dynamical system, which we mathematically analyse in detail. We find that for elongated cells there is a half-stable steady state corresponding to perfect alignment between the cells. Whether cells move towards this state (i.e., become perfectly aligned) or not is determined by where in state space the initial condition lies. We find that a separatrix splits the state space into two regions, which characterise these two different outcomes. We find that some self-propulsion is necessary to achieve perfect alignment, however too much self-propulsion hinders alignment. Analysing the effect of small amounts of self-propulsion offers an insight into the timescales at play when a trajectory is moving towards the point of perfect alignment. We find that the two cells initially move apart to avoid overlap over a fast timescale, and then the presence of self-propulsion causes them to move towards a configuration of perfect alignment over a much slower timescale. Overall, our analysis highlights how the interaction between self-propulsion and overlap avoidance is sufficient to generate alignment."
"There is currently no clinically valid biomarker for predicting the growth and prognosis of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). The most promising candidates with the highest diagnostic values are plasma D-dimers and markers of activated neutrophils, i.e., myeloperoxidase (MPO) or cell-free DNA. So far, case-control studies on these markers have been performed almost exclusively using healthy individuals as controls. To validate the value of these markers in the clinical setting of a vascular surgery department, we analysed the diagnostic and prognostic potential of plasma D-dimers and MPO in 177 AAA patients versus 138 non-AAA patients with different vascular diseases. Significantly elevated levels of D-dimers were recorded for AAA patients compared with non-AAA patients, although the difference between the two groups was significantly smaller than that in other studies comparing AAA patients with healthy controls. Surprisingly, MPO levels were significantly higher in non-AAA patients than in those with AAA. After adjusting for the confounding factors of sex, peripheral artery disease (PAD) and internal carotid stenosis in multivariate regression models, neither D-dimers nor MPO remained independent correlates of AAA. In contrast, D-dimer plasma levels correlated well with the maximal aortic diameter. Combined analysis of D-dimers and circulating cell-free DNA levels derived from a previous study failed to improve the predictive values for the maximal aortic diameter. In conclusion, our data show that D-dimers and MPO are not suitable biomarkers for monitoring AAA in a real-world setting of mixed vascular surgery patients."
"As cervical cancer (CC) caused more than 300,000 deaths in the world, it is urgent to identify therapeutic targets to improve survival. Though RUNX1 is overexpressed in CC, its specific role and underlying molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Here we presented that RUNX1 was upregulated in CC and associated with poor prognosis. Functional studies demonstrated that RUNX1 acts as an oncogene in CC, with overexpression accelerating cell cycle progression and promoting cell proliferation. Mechanistically, RUNX1 regulates the MAPK pathway by modulating TGFB2 expression, while TGFB2 inhibition impaired MAPK pathway activation and the proliferation driven by RUNX1 overexpression. Comprehensive analyses also suggested that RUNX1 may modulate the immune microenvironment in CC through TGFB2. These findings indicate that RUNX1 promotes CC progression by activating the MAPK pathway through upregulation of TGFB2. Our study provides new insights into the role of RUNX1 in CC proliferation and suggests RUNX1 as a potential therapeutic target in CC."
"Despite significant advancements in multiple myeloma (MM) treatment, including novel therapies and combination strategies, the translation of findings from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) into real-world clinical practice has been associated with several challenges. Specifically, the principles and criterion that shape the current design of MM RCTs have left out a sizable portion of patients that would particularly benefit from trial inclusion. In addition, RCTs may use primary outcomes which only partially cover patient-relevant endpoints important for evaluating treatment efficacy and quality of life. In this review, we explore the current MM RCT landscape and suggest possible solutions to improve generalizability of trial results, mitigate logistical pitfalls, and integrate real-world evidence into trials. Together, these strategies are designed to refine MM treatment guidelines and improve outcomes for all patient populations."
"For a long time, traditional medicine has acknowledged the gut's impact on general health. Contemporary science substantiates this association through investigations of the gut microbiota, the extensive community of microorganisms inhabiting our gastrointestinal system. These microscopic residents considerably improve digestive processes, nutritional absorption, immunological function, and pathogen defense. Nevertheless, a variety of gastrointestinal and extra-intestinal disorders can result from dysbiosis, an imbalance of the microbial composition of the gut microbiota. A groundbreaking discovery is the gut-brain axis, a complex communication network that links the enteric and central nervous system (CNS). This bidirectional communication allows the brain to influence gut activities and vice versa, impacting mental health and mood disorders like anxiety and depression. The gut microbiota can influence this communication by creating neurotransmitters and short-chain fatty acids, among other biochemical processes. These factors may affect our mental state, our ability to regulate our emotions, and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. This study aimed to explore the complex interrelationships between the brain and the gut microbiota. We also conducted a thorough examination of the existing understanding in the area of how microbiota affects social behaviors, including emotions, stress responses, and cognitive functions. We also explored the potential of interventions that focus on the connection between the gut and the brain, such as using probiotics to treat diseases of the CNS. This research opens up new possibilities for addressing mental health and neurological conditions in an innovative manner."
"This study aimed to investigate the prognostic relevance of cytogenetic risk in 9826 adults with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) during the first or second complete remission. The 5-year probabilities of overall survival (OS) were 66%, 61%, and 47% (P < 0.001), the cumulative incidences of relapse were 14%, 19%, and 32% (P < 0.001), and the cumulative incidences of non-relapse mortality (NRM) were 23%, 23%, and 25% (P = 0.208) in patients with favorable (n = 1418), intermediate (n = 6747), and poor cytogenetic risk (n = 1661), respectively. The significant effect of cytogenetic risk on OS was strong in all subgroups stratified by age, sex, performance status, disease status, donor type, conditioning intensity, graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis, and transplantation period (P < 0.001 for all). The evaluation of trends in posttransplant outcomes for patients in each cytogenetic risk category indicated that the risk of relapse declined in patients with favorable and intermediate cytogenetics and that the risk of NRM decreased in those with intermediate and poor cytogenetics. Therefore, patients with intermediate cytogenetics experienced the best OS improvement. These results confirm cytogenetic risk as a universal prognostic factor in patients with AML undergoing allogeneic HCT while highlighting the requirement for further improvements in posttransplant OS by reducing NRM in patients with favorable cytogenetics and by reducing relapse in patients with poor cytogenetics."
"Monitoring animal populations is crucial for assessing the health of ecosystems. Traditional methods, which require extensive fieldwork, are increasingly being supplemented by time-lapse camera-trap imagery combined with an automatic analysis of the image data. The latter usually involves some object detector aimed at detecting relevant targets (commonly animals) in each image, followed by some postprocessing to gather activity and population data. In this paper, we show that the performance of an object detector in a single frame of a time-lapse sequence can be improved by including spatio-temporal features from the prior frames. We propose a method that leverages temporal information by integrating two additional spatial feature channels which capture stationary and non-stationary elements of the scene and consequently improve scene understanding and reduce the number of stationary false positives. The proposed technique achieves a significant improvement of 24% in mean average precision (mAP@0.05:0.95) over the baseline (temporal feature-free, single frame) object detector on a large dataset of breeding tropical seabirds. We envisage our method will be widely applicable to other wildlife monitoring applications that use time-lapse imaging."

"The lack of knowledge about the mechanism of hyperoxia-induced intestinal injury has attracted considerable attention, due to the potential for this condition to cause neonatal complications. This study aimed to explore the relationship between hyperoxia-induced oxidative damage and ferroptosis in intestinal tissue and investigate the mechanism by which hyperoxia regulates inflammation through ferroptosis. The study systematically evaluated the effects of hyperoxia on oxidative stress, mitochondrial damage, ferroptosis, and inflammation of intestinal epithelial cells both in vitro and in vivo. The results showed that ferroptosis was involved in intestinal oxidative damage caused by hyperoxia and was regulated by Nrf2. Moreover, hyperoxia-induced oxidative damage regulated inflammation through ferroptosis by upregulating the COX-2/PGE2/EP2 signaling pathway. These findings have important implications for future clinical prevention and therapeutic approaches to neonatal organ injury caused by hyperoxia treatment."
"The split trehalase biosensor has potential as a versatile diagnostic technology. Split enzymes are engineered proteins, divided into inactive fragments, which can reassemble and regain activity when brought together by an analyte. The split TreA biosensor requires no sample processing and produces stable signals (in the form of glucose). Split trehalase reagents can function in blood, but periplasmic trehalase of E. coli requires blood acidification for maximal activity. The objective of this study was to obtain split trehalase with near physiological pH optimum. For this purpose, periplasmic trehalases of Cellvibrio spp. with higher activity at neutral pH, were split in analogy with the E. coli TreA into hood and catalytic domains. However, these split trehalases displayed self-complementation due to spontaneous reassembly. In contrast, when catalytic domains of Cellvibrio trehalases were combined with E. coli hood domains, these hybrids displayed conditional complementation capacity when split trehalase fragments fused to immunoglobulin-binding protein G (STIGA) were used to quantify immunoglobulin concentrations. Other hybrid combinations of Cellvibrio spp. had increased activity compared to the cognate pairs, albeit with strong self-complementation. A mutagenesis analysis of residues responsible for self-complementation led to uncoupling of self-complementation from allostery. The Michaelis-Menten kinetics of Cellvibrio enzymes and fragment pairs confirmed improved activity of a mutated hybrid pair of Cellvibrio hood and catalytic domains at physiological pH. In conclusion, the improvements in pH optimum and activity, demonstrated with STIGA, can now be leveraged to enhance other variations of the split trehalase biosensor platform, broadening its utility for testing clinical samples."
"Human cognition is reflected in gaze behavior, which involves eye movements to fixate or shift focus between areas. In natural interactions, gaze behavior serves two functions: signal transmission and information gathering. While expert gaze as a tool for gathering information has been studied, its underlying cognitive processes remain insufficiently explored. This study investigated differences in gaze behavior and cognition between expert physicians and novice medical students during a simulated medical interview with a simulated patient, drawing implications for medical education. This study employed an exploratory sequential mixed methods design. During the simulated medical interview, participants' gaze behavior was measured across five areas: the patient's eyes, face, body trunk, medical chart, and medical questionnaire. A hierarchical Bayesian model analyzed differences in gaze behavior between expert physicians and novice medical students. Then, a semi-structured interview was conducted with participants to discern their perceptions during their gaze behavior; their recorded gaze behavior was presented to them, and analyzed using a qualitative descriptive approach. Model analyses indicated that experts looked at the simulated patient's eyes less frequently compared to novices during the simulated medical interview. Expert physicians stated that because of the potential for discomfort, looking at the patient's eyes was less frequent, despite its importance for obtaining diagnostic findings. Conversely, novice medical students did not provide narratives for obtaining such findings, but increased the number of times they did so to improve patient satisfaction. This association between different perceptions of gaze behavior may lead to new approaches in medical education. This study highlights the importance of understanding gaze behavior in the context of medical education and suggests that different motivations underlie the gaze behavior of expert physicians and novice medical students. Incorporating training in effective gaze behavior may improve the quality of patient care and medical students' learning outcomes."
Desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT) as a subtype of sarcoma is rare and aggressive. We present the case of a 23-year-old man with a histologically confirmed DSRCT who underwent 18F-PSMA PET/CT before prostate biopsy and surgical resection of the tumor. It is well known that PSMA PET has a high accuracy for detecting clinically significant prostate adenocarcinoma and is useful in guiding prostate biopsy. This case signifies DSRCT can also exhibit intermediate PSMA expression on 18F-PSMA PET/CT.
"Virtually all multicellular organisms on Earth live in symbiotic associations with complex microbial communities: the microbiome. This ancient relationship is of fundamental importance for both the host and the microbiome. Recently, the analyses of numerous microbiomes have revealed an incredible diversity and complexity of symbionts, with different mechanisms identified as potential drivers of this diversity. However, the interplay of ecological and evolutionary forces generating these complex associations is still poorly understood. Here we explore and summarise the suite of ecological and evolutionary mechanisms identified as relevant to different aspects of microbiome complexity and diversity. We argue that microbiome assembly is a dynamic product of ecology and evolution at various spatio-temporal scales. We propose a theoretical framework to classify mechanisms and build mechanistic host-microbiome models to link them to empirical patterns. We develop a cohesive foundation for the theoretical understanding of the combined effects of ecology and evolution on the assembly of complex symbioses."
"From a young age, children have advanced social perceptual and reasoning abilities. However, the neural development of these abilities is still poorly understood. To address this gap, we used fMRI data collected while 122 3-12-year-old children (64 females) and 33 adults (20 females) watched an engaging and socially rich movie to investigate how the cortical basis of social processing changes throughout development. We labeled the movie with visual and social features, including motion energy, presence of a face and a social interaction, theory of mind (ToM) events, valence, and arousal. Using a voxel-wise encoding model trained on these features, we found that models based on visual (motion energy) and social (faces, social interaction, ToM, valence, and arousal) features can both predict brain activity in children as young as 3 years old across the cortex, with particularly high predictivity in motion-selective middle temporal region and the superior temporal sulcus (STS). Furthermore, models based on individual social features showed that while there may be some development throughout childhood, social interaction information in the STS is present in children as young as 3 years old and appears adult-like by age 7. The current study, for the first time, links neural activity in children to predefined social features in a narrative movie and suggests social interaction perception is supported by early developing neural responses in the STS."
"The HIV-1 protease is a critical enzyme for viral replication. Because protease activity is necessary to generate mature infectious virions, it is a primary target of antiretroviral treatment.

"Despite significant advancements in achieving high recanalization rates (80%-90%) for large vessel occlusions through mechanical thrombectomy, the issue of ""futile recanalization"" remains a major clinical challenge. Futile recanalization occurs when over half of patients fail to experience expected symptom improvement after vessel recanalization, often resulting in severe functional impairment or death. Traditionally, this phenomenon has been attributed to inadequate blood flow and reperfusion injury. More recently, ongoing neuronal death after reperfusion, which leads to the progression of the ischemic penumbra into the core infarct, has been termed ""futile reperfusion."" This review explores the complex role of autophagy mechanisms in futile reperfusion following ischemic stroke, with a focus on its relationship to neuronal survival. We also examine the regulation of autophagic activity by epigenetic mechanisms. By investigating autophagy's role in ischemic stroke, we aim to identify novel pathways for precision treatment."
"Ageing is one of the most important risk factors for chronic health conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases. Inflammation is a feature of ageing, as well as a key pathophysiological mechanism for degenerative diseases. Microglia play multiple roles in the central nervous system; their states entail a complex assemblage of responses reflecting the multiplicity of functions they fulfil both under homeostatic basal conditions and in response to stimuli. Whereas glial cells can promote neuronal homeostasis and limit neurodegeneration, age-related inflammation (i.e. inflammaging) leads to the functional impairment of microglia and astrocytes, exacerbating their response to stimuli. Thus, microglia are key mediators for age-dependent changes of the nervous system, participating in the generation of a less supportive or even hostile environment for neurons. Whereas multiple changes of ageing microglia have been described, here we will focus on the neuron-microglia regulatory crosstalk through fractalkine (CX3CL1) and CD200, and the regulatory cytokine Transforming Growth Factor β1 (TGFβ1), which is involved in immunomodulation and neuroprotection. Ageing results in a dysregulated activation of microglia, affecting neuronal survival, and function. The apparent unresponsiveness of aged microglia to regulatory signals could reflect a restriction in the mechanisms underlying their homeostatic and reactive states. The spectrum of functions, required to respond to life-long needs for brain maintenance and in response to disease, would progressively narrow, preventing microglia from maintaining their protective functions. This article is part of the Special Issue on ""Microglia""."

"NETosis is recognized as an important source of autoantigens. Therefore, we hypothesized whether the pristane-induced lupus mice model shows early activation of neutrophils, the presence of low-density granulocytes (LDGs), and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) release, which could contribute to the development of a lupus phenotype."
"Our study investigated the effects of terbuthylazine (TBA) and metribuzin (MT) on rice and radish at field application concentrations. Both herbicides induced oxidative stress and severely inhibited growth in the two crops. However, the radish cultivar T-33 exhibited significantly lower stress levels compared to the sensitive cultivar S-24, suggesting its higher tolerance to TBA and MT. To explore the potential role of metabolism in this tolerance, we developed a novel HPLC-Q-TOF-MS method, which demonstrated excellent performance and identified 18 TBA and 20 MT metabolites, most of which were discovered in plants for the first time. The results revealed significantly higher accumulation of both herbicides in rice compared to radish, especially in the aerial parts, with increasing translocation in rice and the opposite trend in radish. Quantitative analysis revealed significantly higher levels of glycosylated MT products and amino acid conjugates in T-33 compared to S-24, suggesting their crucial role in detoxification and tolerance mechanisms. Our findings have significant implications for food safety, crop protection, and sustainable agricultural practices in regions employing vegetable-crop rotation systems."

"Given the variability in the effectiveness of immune checkpoint blocking therapy among patients and tumor types, development of noninvasive methods for longitudinal assessment of immune cell function and early tumor response is crucial for precision immunotherapy. CD137 (4-1BB), a marker of activated T cells, plays a significant role in immunotherapy. However, its potential as an imaging biomarker for activated T cells in the tumor microenvironment has not been explored. This study introduces a bicyclic peptide-based probe that targets CD137 for noninvasive PET imaging of tumor-infiltrating activated T cells."

"The Complex Portal (www.ebi.ac.uk/complexportal) is a manually curated reference database for molecular complexes. It is a unifying web resource linking aggregated data on composition, topology and the function of macromolecular complexes from 28 species. In addition to significantly extending the number of manually curated complexes, we have massively extended the coverage of the human complexome through the incorporation of high confidence assemblies predicted by machine-learning algorithms trained on large-scale experimental data. The current content of the portal comprising 2150 human complexes has been augmented by 14 964 machine-learning (ML) predicted complexes from hu.MAP3.0. We have refactored the website to enable easy search and filtering of these different classes of protein complexes and have implemented the Complex Navigator, a visualisation tool to facilitate comparison of related complexes in the context of orthology or paralogy. We have embedded the Rhea reaction visualisation tool into the website to enable users to view the catalytic activity of enzyme complexes."

"Orthopaedic surgery has a higher risk of iatrogenic nerve injury than other surgical specialties. The initial management depends on the etiology, which requires early recognition and an appreciation for the injury. Three perspectives are given to guide the surgeon through the initial management of these devastating complications. An orthopaedic surgeon with a knowledge of case law emphasizes the importance of clear documentation and frequent communication with the patient. An anesthesiologist discusses the improvements in regional anesthesiology and the risks inherent in motor-sparing blocks. Finally, a peripheral nerve surgeon offers next steps in confirming the diagnosis and the importance of prompt referral."
"The shared genetic basis offers very valuable insights into the etiology, diagnosis and therapy of complex traits. However, a comprehensive resource providing shared genetic basis using the accessible summary statistics is currently lacking. It is challenging to analyze the shared genetic basis due to the difficulty in selecting parameters and the complexity of pipeline implementation. To address these issues, we introduce GWAShug, a platform featuring a standardized best-practice pipeline with four trait level methods and three molecular level methods. Based on stringent quality control, the GWAShug resource module includes 539 high-quality GWAS summary statistics for European and East Asian populations, covering 54 945 pairs between a measurement-based and a disease-based trait and 43 902 pairs between two disease-based traits. Users can easily search for shared genetic basis information by trait name, MeSH term and category, and access detailed gene information across different trait pairs. The platform facilitates interactive visualization and analysis of shared genetic basic results, allowing users to explore data dynamically. Results can be conveniently downloaded via FTP links. Additionally, we offer an online analysis module that allows users to analyze their own summary statistics, providing comprehensive tables, figures and interactive visualization and analysis. GWAShug is freely accessible at http://www.gwashug.com."
"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) disproportionately affects certain sub-populations, including people with experience of incarceration (PWEI). Little is known about how perceptions of HCV and treatment have changed despite simplifications in testing and treatment in carceral settings. Nineteen semi-structured interviews were conducted with people living with or having a history of HCV infection released from Quebec provincial prison. Interviews were guided by the Common Sense Self-Regulation Model (CS-SRM) and aimed to explore cognitive and emotional representations of HCV and coping strategies. Among the 19 participants, seven (37%) were diagnosed with HCV in prison and 14 (74%) had previously received HCV treatment. Participants' HCV illness perceptions were influenced by fear (of HCV transmission, death, and the well-being of family) and stigma (related to HCV, injection drug use, and incarceration). While some sought education and social and professional support, others self-isolated or engaged in high-risk behaviors to cope. Despite advances in HCV treatment, PWEI continue to experience various forms of stigma and fear surrounding their HCV diagnosis, resulting in delayed HCV care. These findings provide insights into how prison-based healthcare providers can better utilize HCV illness perceptions to evaluate willingness to engage in HCV care among PWEI."
IPMN consensus guidelines make implicit judgments on what cancer risk level should prompt surgery. We used decision modeling to estimate this cancer risk threshold (CRT) for BD-IPMN patients.
"The widespread use of sub-therapeutic antibiotics may lead to treatment failures, increased resistance to antibiotics, and even the encouragement of the formation of superbugs. Fraudulent herbal medicines that actually contain unlabeled active ingredients are a global problem. Therefore, streamlined and accurate analytical techniques that can identify and quantify a variety of antimicrobials in suspected illegal products are required. In the present work, we developed a sensitive, robust, and accurate method that involves multi-step extraction, EMR-lipid-based pass-through cleanup, and UHPLC-Q/HRMS with an orbital ion trap instrument analysis for the simultaneous detection of ten illicit antifungal drugs (flucytosine, fluconazole, ketoconazole, naftifine hydrochloride, griseofulvin, bifonazole, econazole nitrate, elubiol, clotrimazole, and miconazole nitrate) in herbal disinfection products. This validated method was then applied to 210 authentic samples, resulting in 25% of the samples being positive for the drugs. The results suggested the need to strengthen controls in this field to detect illicit antifungal drugs in herbal bacteriostatic products, which represents a potential health risk for the consumer. On a global scale, more and more frequent routine monitoring is being carried out in this area. This study provides valuable insights into large-scale complex sample chemical profiling, and the method developed appears to be promising and applicable for high-throughput routine multiple antibiotic analysis in a complex sample matrix."
Anakinra was approved by the European Medicines Agency and received Emergency Use Authorization by the United States Food and Drug Administration for patients with COVID-19 pneumonia at risk for severe respiratory failure (SRF) with blood levels of soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) ≥ 6 ng/mL. We report the final results of the phase II open-label single-arm SAVE trial in a large population.
"This study examined long-term mediating effects of the smalltalk parenting intervention on children's effortful control at school age (7.5 years; 2016-2018). In 2010-2012, parents (96% female) of toddlers (N = 1201; aged 12-36 months; 52% female) were randomly assigned to either: standard playgroup, smalltalk playgroup (group-only), or smalltalk playgroup with additional home coaching (smalltalk plus). Multi-informant data indicated that smalltalk plus had unique indirect effects on children's effortful control, through parents' capacity to 'maintain and extend' children's focus during joint interactions. Possible mediating pathways via parent verbal responsivity, home learning activities, and descriptive language use were not supported. When parents received a structured playgroup program with additional home coaching, sustainable benefits were evident in children's self-regulation, assessed in the early school years."

"This study investigates the gender-specific genetic influence of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1111875 on diabetes risk within the Taiwanese population using data from the Taiwan Biobank. Diabetes mellitus, particularly type 2 diabetes (T2D), is influenced by genetic factors, and the rs1111875 SNP near the hematopoietically expressed homeobox (HHEX) gene has been linked to T2D susceptibility."
"Axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) is a chronic inflammatory disorder affecting the sacroiliac joints and axial spine. Along with pharmacotherapy, non-pharmacological interventions for axSpA are crucial and constitute the cornerstone of treatment. Here, we review the evidence for non-pharmacological treatment of axSpA as a basis for the 2023 Korean treatment recommendations for patients with axSpA. The effectiveness of the core non-pharmacological approaches, such as education, smoking cessation, and exercise, has been reaffirmed. High-quality research on surgical treatment is limited. However, total hip replacement is advised in patients with ongoing pain or disability and visible structural damage to the hip on imaging. Urgent spinal intervention should be considered in cases of acute spinal pain with neurological deficiency or concurrent unstable fractures. Evidence for complementary therapies, including spas and acupuncture, remains insufficient."
The evolving surgical techniques in thoracoscopic surgery necessitate the exploration of anesthesiological techniques. This study aimed to investigate whether incorporating a continuous erector spinae plane (ESP) block into a multimodal analgesia regimen is non-inferior to continuous thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) in terms of quality of postoperative recovery for patients undergoing elective unilateral video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery.
"Staphylococcus aureus is a significant human pathogen causing acute life-threatening, and chronic infections often linked to biofilms. This study conducted a comparative lipidomic analysis of a methicillin-resistant (MRSA) and a methicillin-susceptible (MSSA) S. aureus strain in both planktonic and biofilm cultures using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The developed protocol successfully differentiates between the strains in various living states (planktonic and biofilm) and growth media (Tryptic Soy Broth and Brain Heart Infusion) using S. aureus USA300 LAC (MRSA) and S. aureus Newman (MSSA). LC-MS and NMR lipidomics profiles revealed global differences and particular ones among the following classes of bacterial lipids: phosphatidylglycerols, diacylglycerols, monoglycosyldiacylglycerols, diglycosyldiacylglycerols, and cardiolipins. Lipid content was higher in the biofilm states for most of these classes. Growth media differences were significant, while differences between MRSA and MSSA were less pronounced but still detectable. Additionally, we provide data on hundreds of unknown compounds that differ based on living state, strain background, or growth media. This study offer insights into the dynamic nature of S. aureus lipid composition and the used methods are adaptable to other organisms."
"Loss of heterozygosity in chromosome 9p21, common in urothelial carcinoma (UC), typically involves deletion of CDKN2A and MTAP genes.

This review summarizes 191 angucyclines and angucyclinones derived from marine actinomycetes reported in the literature from 2014 to 2023 and introduced the latest developments in actinomycete-silenced biosynthetic gene cluster activation, including heterologous recombination and in situ activation. The key role of redox post-modifications in the biosynthetic process of atypical angucyclines. This review provides insights into the discovery and biosynthesis of valuable angucyclines and angucyclinones from marine-associated actinomycetes and potential lead compounds for the research and development of new drugs."
"HLA-E is a nonclassical, nonpolymorphic, class Ib HLA molecule. Its primary function is to present a conserved nonamer peptide, termed VL9, derived from the signal sequence of classical MHC molecules to the NKG2x-CD94 receptors on NK cells and a subset of T lymphocytes. These receptors regulate the function of NK cells, and the importance of this role, which is conserved across mammalian species, probably accounts for the lack of genetic polymorphism. A second minor function is to present other, weaker binding, pathogen-derived peptides to T lymphocytes. Most of these peptides bind suboptimally to HLA-E, but this binding appears to be enabled by the relative stability of peptide-free, but receptive, HLA-E-β2m complexes. This, in turn, may favor nonclassical antigen processing that may be associated with bacteria infected cells. This review explores how the structure of HLA-E, bound to different peptides and then to NKG2-CD94 or T-cell receptors, relates to HLA-E cell biology and immunology. A detailed understanding of this molecule could open up opportunities for development of universal T-cell and NK-cell-based immunotherapies."
"Epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive breast cancer (HER2+ BC) is a highly invasive and malignant type of tumor. Due to its resistance to HER2-targeted therapy, HER2+ BC has a poor prognosis and a tendency for metastasis. Understanding the mechanisms underlying this resistance and developing effective treatments for HER2+ BC are major research challenges. The phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) pathway, which is frequently altered in cancers, plays a critical role in cellular proliferation and drug resistance. This signaling pathway activates various downstream pathways and exhibits complex interactions with other signaling networks. Given the significance of the PI3K/AKT pathway in HER2+ BC, several targeted drugs are currently in development. Multiple drugs have entered clinical trials or gained market approval, bringing new hope for HER2+ BC therapy. However, new drugs and therapies raise concerns related to safety, regulation, and ethics. Populations of different races and disease statuses exhibit varying responses to treatments. Therefore, in this review, we summarize current knowledge on the alteration and biological roles of the PI3K/AKT pathway, as well as its clinical applications and perspectives, providing new insights for advancing targeted therapies in HER2+ BC."
"This study investigates the behavioral choices of manufacturers, recyclers, and customers in Trade-In Programs designed to promote recycling and environmental sustainability. Using a manufacturer-led evolutionary game model, the research explores how factors such as government policies, market demand, financial incentives, and the simplicity of participation impact stakeholder engagement in these programs. Numerical simulations were conducted to analyze the effects of specific parameters on each participants' willingness to participate. Results show that increased subsidies and investment in innovation by manufacturers significantly enhance recycler and customer participation in ethic Trade-In Programs. Conversely, higher revenue-sharing by manufacturers tends to reduce engagement from both parties, while manufacturers receiving substantial brand and social benefits alongside government subsidies to encourage broader stakeholder involvement. These findings offer critical insights for designing effective Trade-In Programs, supporting sustainable recycling practices and circular economy principles. The study provides actionable guidance for policymakers and industry leaders aiming to boost participation in environmentally focused recycling initiatives, laying a foundation for more sustainable industrial practices."
"The objective of this study was to optimize the utilization of deposited fat in Sunit sheep, with a focus on dietary nutrition. This study also elucidated variations in lipid metabolism among subcutaneous fat (SF), perirenal fat (PF), and tail fat (TF) in sheep of different ages using non-targeted lipidomic techniques. In total, 173 different lipids were identified, of which triacylglycerol (TG) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) were prominent. The relative intensity of TG was highest at 6 months of age in three adipose depots. Glycerophospholipids (PLs) were expressed at peak levels in TF and SF at 18 months of age. Pathway analysis revealed that biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, linoleic acid metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, and fatty acid biosynthesis were the main pathways involved in the metabolism of adipose depots. These findings provide a comprehensive reference for the metabolic characteristics and pathways of adipose tissue in sheep and the utilization of its by-products."
"There is emerging evidence for an increased prevalence of autism in children of mothers with a migration background. To date, the mechanisms underlying this relationship are poorly understood.

"The longitudinal relation between toddlers' behaviors in uncertain situations (e.g., information seeking, hesitation) and preschoolers' uncertainty monitoring was investigated (between 2014 and 2019 in Northern California; Time 1: N = 183, M = 28.99 months, 53% female, 67.8% White; Time 2: N = 159, M = 41.64 months, 52.2% female). Eye movements and response latencies were recorded as children identified a target from two partially occluded (Time 1) or degraded (Time 2) images. Confidence ratings for identifications were collected at Time 2. At Time 1, gaze transitions between response options, but not response latencies and mental state language, predicted Time 2 uncertainty monitoring. Overall, these findings provide the first direct evidence of connections between toddlers' uncertainty behaviors and preschoolers' uncertainty monitoring."
"This study examined the effect of simulation on readiness for collaborative practice and learning using a randomized-controlled trial design that used the same education protocol with interprofessional and uniprofessional groups. The sample consisted of 43 students from four different majors. The students were assessed with the Readiness for Interprofessional Learning Scale, and a care plan measurement instrument. The interprofessional group showed a small increase (0.1 ± 0.43; p = .02) in readiness for teamwork and collaboration; the uniprofessional group showed a smaller increase for teamwork and collaboration (0.04 ± 0.31; p = .04) and for patient-centred care (0.0 ± 0.35; p = .01). The enriching work of interprofessional learning was evident within the care plan activity, suggesting that interprofessional simulation is an effective learning method for interprofessional education."

"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a global health problem, causing an estimated 20 million infections annually. Thus, the management of HEV requires special consideration. In developed countries, hepatitis E is mainly recognized as a foodborne disease (mainly transmitted via undercooked meat consumption) that is generally caused by genotype 3 and 4 circulating in various animals, including pigs and wild boars. The current absence of officially recognized protocols for the analysis of HEV in foods and the lack of awareness of this disease among healthcare workers, together with the high percentage of asymptomatic cases, make HEV infection highly underestimated. Most HEV-3 infections in immunocompetent individuals are self-limited. Nevertheless, the possibility of serious forms of liver disease, especially in patients with co-morbidities, should be considered because it can lead to a fatal outcome. Here, we report a case of fatal hepatitis related to HEV-3 infection in a 67-year-old male patient with underlying chronic liver disease (CLD) and living in a region where a high prevalence and genetic heterogeneity of HEV-3 in wild boar has been recently demonstrated. Our case report describes the interdisciplinary approach used (from the diagnosis to the virus phylogenetic characterization) in order to improve epidemiologic HEV surveillance in central Italy."
"This study was aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab with chemotherapy (pembrolizumab combination therapy) and compare it with standard-of-care platinum-based chemotherapy (chemotherapy alone) as a first-line treatment for metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC from the perspective of Taiwan's third-party-payer public health-care system. We used a partitioned survival model with an estimated time horizon of 10 years. The partitioned survival model uses Kaplan-Meier estimates of progression-free and overall survival from the KEYNOTE-189 clinical trial. The quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) values were based on utility values by progression status calculated from the KEYNOTE-189 trial. This study examined costs related to treatment regimens, disease management, second-line therapy, end-of-life care, and adverse event management. Cost and utility were discounted at 3% per year. Probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the results. The willingness-to-pay threshold was set at 3 × Taiwan's gross domestic product (GDP), equivalent to NT$2,788,290. In the base-case scenario, pembrolizumab combination therapy resulted in an expected gain of 0.89 QALYs and an incremental cost of NT$2,201,203 relative to chemotherapy alone. The ICER was NT$2,478,601/QALY. In the analysis of the PD-L1 tumor proportion score (TPS) ≥ 50% subgroup, the patients who received pembrolizumab combination therapy gained 1.12 QALYs more than those who received chemotherapy alone, and the incremental cost was NT$2,522,528. Therefore, the ICER for this subset of patients was NT$2,258,358/QALY. In conclusion, pembrolizumab combination therapy is a cost-effective option for first-line treatment of metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC. The relative cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab combination therapy is greatest for patients with PD-L1 TPS ≥50%."

"There is a rich tradition of research on the neuroanatomical correlates of spoken language production in aphasia using constrained tasks (e.g. picture naming), which offer controlled insights into the distinct processes that govern speech and language (i.e. lexical-semantic access, morphosyntactic construction, phonological encoding, speech motor programming/execution). Yet these tasks do not necessarily reflect everyday language use. In contrast, naturalistic language production (also referred to as 'connected speech' or 'discourse') more closely approximates typical processing demands, requiring the dynamic integration of all aspects of speech and language. The brain bases of naturalistic language production remain relatively unknown, however, in part because of the difficulty in deriving features that are salient, quantifiable and interpretable relative to both speech-language processes and the extant literature. The present cross-sectional observational study seeks to address these challenges by leveraging a validated and comprehensive auditory-perceptual measurement system that yields four explanatory dimensions of performance-Paraphasia (misselection of words and sounds), Logopenia (paucity of words), Agrammatism (grammatical omissions) and Motor speech (impaired speech motor programming/execution). We used this system to characterize naturalistic language production in a large and representative sample of individuals with acute post-stroke aphasia (n = 118). Scores on each of the four dimensions were correlated with lesion metrics, and multivariate associations among the dimensions and brain regions were then explored. Our findings revealed distinct yet overlapping neuroanatomical correlates throughout the left-hemisphere language network. Paraphasia and logopenia were associated primarily with posterior regions, spanning both dorsal and ventral streams, which are critical for lexical-semantic access and phonological encoding. In contrast, agrammatism and motor speech were associated primarily with anterior regions of the dorsal stream that are involved in morphosyntactic construction and speech motor planning/execution, respectively. Collectively, we view these results as constituting a brain-behaviour model of naturalistic language production in aphasia, aligning with both historical and contemporary accounts of the neurobiology of spoken language production."
"In clinical practice, the emergence of ST11-K64 carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (ST11-K64 CRKP) has become increasingly alarming. Despite this trend, limited research has been conducted to elucidate the clinical and molecular characteristics of these strains."
"We demonstrate that a short oligonucleotide complementary to a G-quadruplex domain can invade this iconic, noncanonical DNA secondary structure in ways that profoundly influence the properties and differential occupancies of the resulting DNA polymorphic products. Our spectroscopic mapping of the conformational space of the associated reactants and products, both before and after strand invasion, yield unanticipated outcomes which reveal several overarching features. First, strand invasion induces the disruption of DNA secondary structural elements in both the invading strand (which can assume an iDNA tetrad structure) and the invaded species (a G-quadruplex). The resultant cascade of coupled alterations represents a potential pathway for the controlled unfolding of kinetically trapped DNA states, a feature that may be characteristic of biological regulatory mechanisms. Furthermore, the addition of selectively designed, exogenous invading oligonucleotides can enable the manipulation of noncanonical DNA conformations for biomedical applications. Secondly, our results highlight the importance of metastability, including the interplay between slower and faster kinetic processes in determining preferentially populated DNA states. Collectively, our data reveal the importance of sample history in defining state populations, which, in turn, determine preferred pathways for further folding steps, irrespective of the position of the thermodynamic equilibrium. Finally, our spectroscopic data reveal the impact of topological constraints on the differential stabilities of base-paired domains. We discuss how our collective observations yield insights into the coupled and uncoupled cascade of strand-invasion-induced transformations between noncanonical DNA forms, potentially as components of molecular wiring diagrams that regulate biological processes."
"The brown planthopper (BPH) Nilaparvata lugens (Stål) is a major insect pest of Oryza sativa that causes crop yield loss in tropical regions, including Thailand. In this study, the crude ethanolic extract of the leaves and branches of Combretum trifoliatum , its active isolated components, apigenin and camphor, and Finopril were tested for their ability to control the first to fifth instars of N. lugens. The C. trifoliatum crude extract and both allelochemicals showed insecticide potential (24 h-LC50 ~ 8.83-95.96 mg/L against each instar for crude extract), and their toxicity depended on the time of exposure. Camphor showed the higher efficacy (LD50 ~ 4.43 mg/L) and not different compared to Finopril. All plant compounds tested reduced carboxylesterase (CE) and glutathione-s-transferase (GST) activities. Camphor caused the greatest decreases in CE and GST activities after exposure, whereas apigenin induced a slight change in acetylcholinesterase activity. The results of the present study suggest that C. trifoliatum extract can be used as an insecticide to manage N. lugens populations."

"Osteoarthritis of the wrist presents complex surgical challenges. A wide variety of surgical options are available when conservative management fails to provide adequate pain relief. Despite advancements in management, such as modifications of partial wrist arthrodesis techniques and increasing use of total wrist replacements, in most scenarios there is no single preferred option. The surgeon's role is crucial in assessing the patient and creating a bespoke treatment strategy that will provide an optimal outcome. This article presents an approach to management of the degenerate wrist based on current evidence."

Secondary goals were to characterize the demographic information of children with shoulder dislocations as well as trends in management."
"Obstructive sleep apnea is a globally prevalent concern with significant health impacts, especially when coupled with comorbidities. Accurate detection and localization of airway obstructions are crucial for effective diagnosis and treatment, which remains a challenge for traditional sleep monitoring methods. Here, we report a catheter-based flexible pressure sensor array that continuously monitors soft tissue pressure in the upper airway and facilitates at the millimeter level. The sensor's design and versatile 3D femtosecond laser fabrication process enable adaptation to diverse materials and applications. In vitro testing demonstrates high sensitivity (38.1 Ω/mmHg) and excellent stability. The sensor array effectively monitors distributed airway pressure and accurately identifies obstructions in an obstructive sleep apnea animal model. In this work, we highlight the potential of this catheter-based sensor array for long-term, continuous upper airway pressure monitoring and its prospective applications in other medical devices for pressure measurement in human body cavities."
"A sexually transmitted bacterium, Mycoplasma genitalium has varying rates of reported resistance to macrolide and some fluoroquinolone group antimicrobials recommended for the treatment of its infections. It is currently recommended that the treatment of these must be planned according to macrolide resistance status. The aim of this study was to determine the presence of macrolide resistance associated mutations (MRM) and fluoroquinolone resistance associated mutations (QRM) in patients infected with M.genitalium. Sixty-one patients who were ≥ 18 years old, presented to our outpatient clinic between March 2017-March 2022, had symptoms of urethritis/cervicitis according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention definition were included in the study. By nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT), the presence of M.genitalium (Mycoplasma-Ureaplasma-OSR for BD MAX, BioGX, the Netherlands) as well as Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis and Trichomonas vaginalis (BDMAX system, BD Diagnostics, USA) in the first stream urine samples was determined. Patients' age, gender, sexual orientation if indicated, diagnostic test results for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and syphilis, history of antibiotic use in the last three months, presence of concomitant microorganisms detected by NAAT and urine culture results of the symptomatic period were also recorded. Urine samples in which M.genitalium was detected were stored at -80 °C until the study day. On the study day, they were thawed and a modified real-time polymerase chain reaction (Rt-PCR) test was performed targeting the V region (147 bp) of the 23S rRNA gene for MRM and gyrA (nucleotides 172-402), gyrB (nucleotides 1256-1480), parC (nucleotides 164-483) and parE (nucleotides 1210-1489) gene regions for QRM. IBM SPSS 25 (IBM Inc., Armonk, NY, USA) software was used for descriptive statistical analysis of the patient data. Of the patients; 49 were male, 12 were female. The age range was 20-57 years. Sexual orientation of 15 (30.6%) male patients was men who have sex with men (MSM). Sixteen (26.2%) were individuals living with HIV and 14 (87.5%) were MSM. Four patients had previous syphilis infection. By NAAT, a second microorganism was present in 30 patients with M.genitalium; Ureaplasma urealyticum in 27 (90%), C.trachomatis in two (6.7%) and N.gonorrhoeae in one (3.3%) patient. Urine cultures performed in 42 (68.8%) of 61 patients during the symptomatic period yielded Lactobacillus delbrueckii in one patient. Eighteen (29.5%) patients had a history of antimicrobial use in the last three months. Macrolide resistance associated mutations was detected in 45 (73.8%) and QRM in 20 (32.8%) of M.genitalium infected individuals. Of those with MRM, 17 (37.8%) had concurrent QRM. Macrolide resistance associated mutations were detected at positions A2071G (75.6%) and A2072G (24.4%) in the 23S rRNA gene. The presence of QRM was detected in parC (85%) and gyrA regions (15%). C234T mutation in parC was detected in nine patients (45%), C184T in four, A248T in three and A248A in one, while A288G mutation in gyrA was detected in two patients and G285T mutation in one. Chi-square test showed no significant correlation between the presence of mutations associated with resistance and MSM, HIV/syphilis infection status and antimicrobial use in the last three months (p> 0.05). To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first study on antimicrobial resistance of M.genitalium in Türkiye and emphasizes the importance of macrolide resistance in symptomatic patients infected with M.genitalium. Further studies are needed for the clinical significance of mutations associated with fluoroquinolone resistance. Determination of antimicrobial resistance in M.genitalium diagnostic tests will be useful in terms of guiding treatment and preventing inappropriate treatment approaches in the early period."

"Protein-carbohydrate interactions govern a wide variety of biological processes and play an essential role in the development of different diseases. Here, we present DIONYSUS, the first database of protein-carbohydrate interfaces annotated according to structural, chemical and functional properties of both proteins and carbohydrates. We provide exhaustive information on the nature of interactions, binding site composition, biological function and specific additional information retrieved from existing databases. The user can easily search the database using protein sequence and structure information or by carbohydrate binding site properties. Moreover, for a given interaction site, the user can perform its comparison with a representative subset of non-covalent protein-carbohydrate interactions to retrieve information on its potential function or specificity. Therefore, DIONYSUS is a source of valuable information both for a deeper understanding of general protein-carbohydrate interaction patterns, for annotation of the previously unannotated proteins and for such applications as carbohydrate-based drug design. DIONYSUS is freely available at www.dsimb.inserm.fr/DIONYSUS/."
"Interleukin-12 (IL-12) holds significant potential in cancer therapy; however, its clinical applicability is hindered by dose-limiting toxicity. Delivery of the IL-12 gene directly to tumours for constitutive IL-12 expression is a possible strategy to enhance its effectiveness while minimizing systemic toxicity. In this study, we investigate the potential of red blood cell-derived extracellular vesicles (RBCEVs) as a carrier for Il-12 plasmid delivery. We demonstrate that RBCEVs can be loaded with minicircle plasmid encoding IL-12 and delivered to MB49 bladder cancer cells for IL-12 expression. The expression of transgenes from minicircles was significantly higher than from the parental plasmids. RBCEV-mediated IL-12 expression stimulated immune responses in mouse splenocytes. Intratumoral delivery of Il-12 plasmid-loaded RBCEVs suppressed bladder cancer tumour growth, stimulated immune responses and promoted immune cell infiltration. In conclusion, our study demonstrates the promising potential of RBCEVs as an effective, safe and redosable nucleic acid drug delivery platform for IL-12."
"Balance control deficits resulting from ankle sprains are central to chronic ankle instability (CAI) and its persistent symptoms. This study aimed to identify differences in balance control between individuals with CAI and healthy controls (HC) using challenging single-leg balance tasks. Twenty-three CAI and 23 HC participants performed balance tasks on a force plate that either remained static or moved mediolaterally. Force and kinematic data were recorded to measure balance and joint movements. The CAI group showed significantly shorter time-to-boundary during static conditions but no significant differences during moving conditions compared to HC. During moving conditions, CAIs exhibited greater proximal compensations, with greater range of motion and higher angular velocity in the knee, hip, and torso. while no significant differences were observed in these parameters during static conditions. Principal component analysis indicated specific kinetic chain in CAI during one-leg balance under both static and moving conditions compared to HC. These findings suggest an altered movement strategy in CAI, that ankle injuries impair the ability to stabilize both distal and proximal joints, and an altered kinetic chain from ankle to torso. Rehabilitation programs for CAI might benefit from considering the integration of the entire kinetic chain, addressing both distal and proximal joint dynamics to support effective recovery and prevent secondary injuries."
"Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) is a common intervention for managing coronary artery disease, which is often accompanied by postoperative psychological challenges such as anxiety and depression. This systematic review aims to evaluate the benefits of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in reducing anxiety and depression symptoms and improving overall health outcomes in patients' post-coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery."
"Polyethylene glycol (PEG) consolidation treatment is a widely used conservation strategy for wooden culture relics. However, the consolidation mechanism of PEG is still open to interpretation. PEG-cellulose, the representative component of wood cell wall, interactions are governed by various coupled multi-scale mechanisms which require nano-scale investigation. In this study, a hybrid molecular dynamics and grand canonical Monte Carlo (MD/GCMC) simulation combined with rule of mixture (RoM) analyses are employed to reveal the underlying mechanisms of PEG-induced consolidation. We found that PEG200 reduces moisture adsorption and swelling at museological conditions, confirming its consolidation effect. At high PEG content, a crossover behavior is identified at humid conditions (RH > 80) where excessive sorption and swelling are observed surpassing the untreated sample. The molecular modeling results are found to be consistent with experimental observations. Furthermore, the structural and mechanical properties of the hydrated samples are assessed by examining the porosity distribution, mechanical properties, and hydrogen bonding network. Results indicate mechanical softening induced by PEG treatment. A modified mixture model is proposed based on molecular modeling results that incorporate sorption and swelling coupling, porosity filling and mechanical softening behaviors. Two key mechanisms are identified explaining the consolidation effect of PEG: first, the PEG fills the porosities of amorphous structure thus diminishing sorption sites; second, the polymer structure prohibits PEG from further swelling thus constraining water sorption. The model and theoretical framework can serve as a guide for the design of novel consolidant materials by identifying the key molecular features of an ideal consolidant."
"The AlphaFold Protein Structure Database (AFDB) is the largest repository of accurately predicted structures with taxonomic labels. Despite providing predictions for over 214 million UniProt entries, the AFDB does not cover viral sequences, severely limiting their study. To address this, we created the Big Fantastic Virus Database (BFVD), a repository of 351 242 protein structures predicted by applying ColabFold to the viral sequence representatives of the UniRef30 clusters. By utilizing homology searches across two petabases of assembled sequencing data, we improved 36% of these structure predictions beyond ColabFold's initial results. BFVD holds a unique repertoire of protein structures as over 62% of its entries show no or low structural similarity to existing repositories. We demonstrate how a substantial fraction of bacteriophage proteins, which remained unannotated based on their sequences, can be matched with similar structures from BFVD. In that, BFVD is on par with the AFDB, while holding nearly three orders of magnitude fewer structures. BFVD is an important virus-specific expansion to protein structure repositories, offering new opportunities to advance viral research. BFVD can be freely downloaded at bfvd.steineggerlab.workers.dev and queried using Foldseek and UniProt labels at bfvd.foldseek.com."

"This study aims to investigate the intricacies of inpatient psychosocial rehabilitation by examining a community-based mental health inpatient rehabilitation service in Nova Scotia, Canada. It provides a comparative analysis with national standards using the Quality Indicator for Rehabilitative Care (QuIRC) and offers recommendations for improvement. The study will link findings to research on enhancing specific domains, focusing on strategies to address identified challenges and leverage opportunities to meet or exceed national benchmarks in promoting recovery and social inclusion. This study utilizes the QuIRC as a primary assessment tool to evaluate the quality of care in psychiatric and psychosocial rehabilitation care unit. The QuIRC assessment findings reveal crucial insights across several domains, including the living and therapeutic environment, treatments and interventions, self-management and autonomy, social interface, human rights, and recovery-based practices. The study identifies strengths and areas for improvement by comparing unit scores with national averages in Canada, offering a detailed examination of the quality of care provided in a community-based psychosocial rehabilitation service. Using the QuIRC identifies strengths and areas for improvement of current care provided, opening opportunities for positive change and improved quality of care. By highlighting the critical indicators of the quality of care and best practices derived from the QuIRC assessment, this study provides practical insights that can be directly applied by practitioners, policymakers, and stakeholders, fostering an understanding of essential elements that support effective mental health rehabilitation within community settings."
"Transcranial neurosurgery assisted by endoscopy and intraoperative ultrasound (IOUS) has become an effective approach for real-time visualization and guidance during tumor resection. This study explores the application of these techniques in falcine meningioma (FM) resection, assessing their feasibility and safety. Eleven FM patients underwent transcranial endoscopic resection with IOUS assistance. Preoperative neuroimaging, including magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, computed tomography, MR angiography, and MR venography, guided surgical planning. IOUS provided real-time tumor localization, boundary visualization, adjacent structure assessment, and guidance throughout the resection. Tumors were located in the anterior, middle, and posterior falx in 4, 5, and 2 patients, respectively. Of the 11 cases, 8 involved unilateral falx tumors and 3 involved bilateral falx tumors. Simpson grade 1 resection was achieved in 12 patients; one case involved a deeply located tumor closely associated with the deep venous plexus. Pathologically, 10 patients had World Health Organization (WHO) grade 1 meningiomas, and 1 had a WHO grade 3 anaplastic meningioma. Postoperative complications included temporary contralateral hemiplegia in one patient and pulmonary infection in another. The average follow-up period was 19.3 months, with all patients achieving Karnofsky Performance Status scores of > 90. In conclusion, endoscopic resection with IOUS assistance is both feasible and safe for FM patients."
"Elderly patients with lymphoproliferative diseases (LPD) are vulnerable to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Here, we retrospectively described the clinical features and outcomes of the first time infection of Omicron SARS-CoV-2 in 364 elderly patients with lymphoma enrolled in Jiangsu Cooperative Lymphoma Group (JCLG) between November 2022 and April 2023 in China. Median age was 69 years (range 60-92). 54.4% (198/364) of patients were confirmed as severe and critical COVID-19 infection. In univariable analysis, Age > 70 years (OR 1.88, p = 0.003), with multiple comorbidities (OR 1.41, p = 0.005), aggressive lymphoma (OR 2.33, p < 0.001), active disease (progressive or relapsed/refractory, OR 2.02, p < 0.001), and active anti-lymphoma therapy (OR 1.90, p < 0.001) were associated with severe COVID-19. Multiple (three or more) lines of previous anti-lymphoma therapy (OR 3.84, p = 0.021) remained an adverse factor for severe COVID-19 in multivariable analysis. Moreover, CD20 antibody (Rituximab or Obinutuzumab)-based treatments within the last 6 months was associated with severe COVID-19 in the entire cohort (OR 3.42, p < 0.001). Continuous BTK inhibitors might be protective effect on the outcome of COVID-19 infection (OR 0.44, p = 0.043) in the indolent lymphoma cohort. Overall, 7.7% (28/364) of the patients ceased, multiple lines of previous anti-lymphoma therapy (OR 3.46, p = 0.016) remained an adverse factor for mortality."

"Acacetin (AC) is a flavonoid compound with antiperoxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiplasmodial activity. However, the solubility of AC is poor and nano acacetin (Nano AC) was synthesized. The intestinal mucosal barrier is impaired in sepsis rats, and the protective effects and mechanism of AC and Nano AC on the intestinal mucosal barrier are unclear."
"Multiple myeloma (MM) is a disease which remains incurable. One of the main reasons is a weakened immune system that allows MM cells to survive. Therefore, the current research is focused on the study of immune system imbalance in MM to find the most effective immunotherapy strategies. Aiming to identify the key points of immune failure in MM patients, we analysed peripheral lymphocytes subsets from MM patients (n = 57) at various stages of the disease course and healthy individuals (HI, n = 15) focusing on T, NK, iNKT, B cells and NK-cell cytokines. Our analysis revealed that MM patients exhibited immune alterations in all studied immune subsets. Compared to HI, MM patients had a significantly lower proportion of CD4 + T cells (19.55% vs. 40.85%; p < 0.001) and CD4 + iNKT cells (18.8% vs. 40%; p < 0.001), within B cells an increased proportion of CD21LCD38L subset (4.5% vs. 0.4%; p < 0.01) and decreased level of memory cells (unswitched 6.1% vs. 14.7%; p < 0.001 and switched 7.8% vs. 11.2%; NS), NK cells displaying signs of activation and exhaustion characterised by a more than 2-fold increase in SLAMF7 MFI (p < 0.001), decreased expression of NKG2D (MFI) and NKp46 (%) on CD16 + 56 + and CD16 + 56- subset respectively (p < 0.05), Effective immunotherapy needs to consider these immune defects and monitoring of the immune status of MM patients is essential to define better interventions in the future."

"Tezepelumab is a human monoclonal antibody that blocks thymic stromal lymphopoietin, which has shown increased expression in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) compared with healthy individuals. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of tezepelumab in patients with moderate to very severe COPD despite receiving triple inhaled therapy."
"T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive hematological tumor that requires novel treatment strategies, especially for relapsed/refractory cases. Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), a key enzyme in the de novo pyrimidine synthesis pathway, has been identified as a potential target for tumors. Besides, Teriflunomide (TRF) is a DHODH inhibitor with anticancer effects; however, its role in T-ALL remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the potential anticancer effects of TRF on T-ALL cells, and the results showed that TRF inhibited cell proliferation, caused S-phase cell cycle arrest, and promoted apoptosis of T-ALL (MOLT4 and JURKAT) cell lines. In addition, TRF reduced the infiltration capacity of T-ALL cells in T-ALL xenograft mice while up-regulating the expression of P53 and BTG2. The BTG2 knockdown significantly attenuated the inhibitory effect of TRF on cellular growth and suppressed the TRF-mediated elevated expression of P53 in T-ALL cells. Moreover, combined treatment with TRF and daunorubicin (DNR) significantly reduced cell viability and promoted apoptosis in DNR-resistant T-ALL cells. Our study provides valuable insights into the critical role of TRF in treating T-ALL while increasing the sensitivity of DNR-resistant T-ALL cells to DNR."
"Altered tissue mechanics is vital for cancer development and malignancy, whether targeting the mechanical microenvironment could retard the initiation and progression of tumor is less explored. In this study, an orthotopic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) rat model was constructed to reproduce the mechanical and pathophysiological microenvironment of HCC development. LpMSN@CLG, a liver-targeted (L) and pH-sensitive (p) mesoporous silica nanoparticle (MSN) encapsulated with collagenase type-I (CLG), and DOX-LpMSN@CLG, on the basis of LpMSN@CLG, encapsulated with CLG and doxorubicin (DOX), were prepared to reduce matrix stiffness by degrading collagen in liver and HCC tumor. LpMSN@CLG, and DOX-LpMSN@CLG were respectively injected (i.v.) into rats at the stage of fibrosis and HCC, resulting in decreased collagen content in liver and HCC tissue, as well as reduced matrix stiffness. In addition, LpMSN@CLG treatment at the fibrosis stage retarded HCC initiation, and DOX-LpMSN@CLG treatment inhibited the growth of HCC tumor when compared with that of the rats treated by DOX alone, suggesting that reducing matrix stiffness in HCC tumor can improve the therapeutic efficacy of DOX. Taken together, our study demonstrated that mechanical intervention of tissue stiffness by CLG-loaded nanoparticles could retard the initiation and progression of HCC, suggesting the promising of mechanical intervention of hepatocellular carcinoma."
"The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly challenged healthcare systems worldwide, particularly in India, a country already burdened with a high prevalence of Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs). This perspective examines the pandemic's direct and indirect impacts on the prevalence, diagnosis, and management of NTDs in India. Using a narrative review approach, we analyzed literature published between January 2020 and September 2023 from databases such as PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar, along with grey literature. The focus was on studies reporting the pandemic's influence on NTDs, especially among vulnerable populations in both rural and urban settings. The review incorporated 49 studies, revealing a twofold impact of COVID-19 on India's healthcare. Directly, the surge in COVID-19 cases strained healthcare resources, disrupted services, and overwhelmed healthcare personnel. Indirectly, the pandemic exacerbated the burden of NTDs by delaying diagnoses, limiting access to treatment, and redirecting resources toward pandemic response efforts. These findings highlight the urgent need for resilient healthcare strategies that address both the immediate and long-term impacts of the pandemic on NTDs. By understanding and mitigating these effects, policymakers and public health experts can better protect vulnerable populations from the compounded challenges posed by these neglected diseases."
"Laparoscopic partial splenectomy (LPS) is gradually becoming the preferred method for treating benign splenic lesions. However, due to the abundant blood supply and its soft, fragile tissue texture, especially when the lesion is located near the splenic hilum or is particularly large, performing partial splenectomy (PS) in clinical practice is extremely challenging. Therefore, we have been continuously exploring and optimizing hemorrhage control methods during PS, and we here propose a method to perform LPS with complete spleen blood flow occlusion. This study describes an optimized approach to control intraoperative hemorrhage during LPS. First, it involves the thorough dissection of the splenic ligaments and careful separation of the pancreatic tail from the spleen. With complete exposure to the splenic hilum, we temporarily occlude the entire blood supply of the spleen using a laparoscopic bulldog clip. Subsequently, we employ intraoperative ultrasound to identify the boundary of the lesion and resect the corresponding portion of the spleen under complete blood flow control. This approach embodies the essence of 'spleen preservation' through effective hemorrhage control and precise resection. It is particularly suitable for laparoscopic surgery and deserves further clinical promotion."
"COVID-19 has proved to be a global health crisis during the pandemic, and the emerging JN.1 variant is a potential threat. Therefore, finding alternative antivirals is of utmost priority. In the current report, we present the synthesis of new and potential anti-viral pyrazoline compounds. Here we report a chemical scheme where β-aryl β-anilino ketones react with phenyl hydrazine in potassium hydroxide to give the corresponding 3,5-diarylpyrazoline. The protocol is applicable to a variety of β-amino ketones and tolerates several functional groups. This method is efficient and proceeds regioselectivity since the β-Anilino group acts as a protecting group for alkenes of chalcones. We identified the NSP3-microdomain (Mac-1) of SARS-CoV-2 as a putative target for newly synthesized triaryl-2-pyrazoline compounds. The molecular dynamics simulation-based free energy estimation suggests compounds 7a, 7d, 7 g, 7i, 7k, and 7 L as promising Mac-1 inhibitors. The detailed structural inspection of MD simulation trajectories sheds light on the structural and functional dynamics involved in the SARS-CoV-2 Mac-1. The data presented here is expected to guide the design and development of better anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapies."
"α-Klotho (KLA) is a type-1 membranous protein that can associate with fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) to form co-receptor for FGF23. The ectodomain of unassociated KLA is shed as soluble KLA (sKLA) to exert FGFR/FGF23-independent pleiotropic functions. The previously determined X-ray crystal structure of the extracellular region of sKLA in complex with FGF23 and FGFR1c suggests that sKLA functions solely as an on-demand coreceptor for FGF23. To understand the FGFR/FGF23-independent pleiotropic functions of sKLA, we investigated biophysical properties and structure of apo-sKLA. Single particle cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) revealed a 3.3 Å resolution structure of apo-sKLA that overlays well with its counterpart in the ternary complex with several distinct features. Compared to the ternary complex, the KL2 domain of apo-sKLA is more flexible. Three-dimensional variability analysis revealed that apo-sKLA adopts conformations with different KL1-KL2 interdomain bending and rotational angles. Mass photometry revealed that sKLA can form a stable structure with FGFR and/or FGF23 as well as sKLA dimer in solution. Cryo-EM supported the dimeric structure of sKLA. Recent studies revealed that FGF23 contains two KLA-binding sites. Our computational studies revealed that each site binds separate KLA in the dimer. The potential multiple forms and shapes of sKLA support its role as FGFR-independent hormone with pleiotropic functions. The ability of FGF23 to engage two KLA's simultaneously raises a potential new mechanism of action for FGF23-mediated signaling by the membranous klotho."
"This study evaluates whether the implementation of an in-hospital care pathway (CP) improves interprofessional teamwork across countries and tests whether improved communications (""relational coordination"") is the mechanism of action. A hospital-based cluster randomized controlled trial in Ireland, Belgium, Italy, and Portugal was performed. Fifty-six interprofessional teams caring for patients admitted with an exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or for patients with a proximal femur fracture were included and randomly assigned to an intervention group (31 teams and 567 team members), where a CP was implemented, and a control group (25 teams and 417 team members) representing usual care. Multilevel regression and mediation analysis were applied. First, although no significant effect was found on our primary outcome relational coordination, our CP significantly improved several team inputs, team processes (team climate for innovation) and team output (the level of organized care, level of competence) indicators. Second, our team process indicator of team climate for innovation partially mediated the association between CP implementation and team output indicator of better level of organized care. In conclusion, a CP sets in motion various mechanisms that improve some but not all aspects of interprofessional teamwork. Relational coordination does not appear to be the mechanism by which team outputs are enhanced."

"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a progressive degenerative disease that leads to visual impairment, predominantly affecting the elderly. Despite significant advancements in treatment, a definitive cure remains elusive. Current therapeutic strategies only slow down disease progression, inhibiting abnormal blood vessels growth, and preserving or improving vision. Among these strategies, photodynamic therapy (PDT) has emerged as a promising treatment, particularly for neovascular form, the most severe form of the disease. Although several photosensitizers (PS) have been developed, only one has received clinical approval for use in AMD. This treatment involves the intravenous administration of a photosensitizing agent that preferentially accumulates in the abnormal blood vessels beneath the macula. Upon activation by targeted laser light, the PS triggers photochemical reactions, leading to vascular occlusion and the reduction of choroidal neovascularization. This review provides a comprehensive overview of both experimental and clinical studies on PDT for AMD, discussing the current state of research, challenges in treatment optimization, and potential future directions to enhance this therapeutic approach."
"Routine outcome monitoring (ROM) has become an increasingly utilized tool in therapeutic practice that has the potential to improve therapy outcomes. This study aimed to synthesize the findings of existing qualitative studies investigating how clinicians use ROM in their work with clients. A systematic search of qualitative studies on clinicians' experience with the use of ROM in mental health services was conducted via PsycInfo, PsycArticles, Medline, Web of Science, and Scopus databases. Qualitative meta-analysis was used to synthesize the finding of the primary studies. Forty-seven studies met the inclusion criteria. The analysis resulted in 21 meta-categories organized into six clusters, namely (1) obtaining clinically relevant information, (2) adapting treatment, (3) facilitating communication, (4) enhancing the therapeutic relationship, (5) facilitating change in clients, and (6) personalized usage of ROM. The meta-analysis revealed that clinicians utilized ROM in diverse ways, including both informational and communicational functions. From the clinicians' perspective, ROM was an element that, on the one hand, introduced additional structure and standardization in treatment and, on the other hand, allowed for greater flexibility and tailoring of treatment."
"This review presents current opinions on an uncommon condition called catamenial pneumothorax (CP), which is usually associated with thoracic endometriosis syndrome (TES). TES is characterized by the presence of endometriotic lesions in pleura and lung parenchyma and presents with various clinical signs and symptoms, including catamenial pneumothorax. Their diagnosis is often delayed. Pulmonary endometric lesions, however, often detected in patients with hemothorax and hemoptysis, may be absent in a proportion of cases of pneumothorax. The typical presentation of CP includes signs and symptoms of pneumothorax, which occur along with menstruation, most commonly around 24 h before and 48-72 h after its onset. However, they may not occur during every menstrual cycle. Suggestive CP lesions on conventional radiography (RTG) include pneumoperitoneum accompanying right-sided pneumothorax, lung opacities, pleural effusion, and nodular infiltrates. Chest and abdomen computed tomography (CT), particularly contrast-enhanced, may additionally show pneumoperitoneum and diaphragmatic lesions. The management of CP includes supportive treatment of acute symptoms and causal treatment to prevent recurrent disease. This article presents the pathophysiology of CP, an overview of the diagnostic methods, and the current therapeutic approaches. The necessity for a multidisciplinary approach to the diagnosis of CP and to the choice of the best treatment modality is underlined (promising new therapeutic options are also mentioned); however, international guidelines are still missing."
"A current study by Kitai et al. found that ovariectomy before estrogen/female sex hormone sensitization at puberty provided protection against kidney ischemia reperfusion injury, challenging the general consensus within the field that estrogen provides renoprotective function. These results are intriguing and could have important clinical implications, while requiring some clarification and substantiation of the conclusions reported."
"Hypertension exerts a profound impact on the microcirculation, causing both structural and functional alterations that contribute to systemic and organ-specific vascular damage. The microcirculation, comprising arterioles, capillaries, and venules with diameters smaller than 20 μm, plays a fundamental role in oxygen delivery, nutrient exchange, and maintaining tissue homeostasis. In the context of hypertension, microvascular remodeling and rarefaction result in reduced vessel density and elasticity, increasing vascular resistance and driving end-organ damage. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying hypertensive microvascular dysfunction include endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and excessive collagen deposition. These changes impair nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability, increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and promote inflammation and fibrosis. These processes lead to progressive vascular stiffening and dysfunction, with significant implications for multiple organs, including the heart, kidneys, brain, and retina. This review underscores the pivotal role of microvascular dysfunction in hypertension-related complications and highlights the importance of early detection and therapeutic interventions. Strategies aimed at optimizing blood pressure control, improving endothelial function, and targeting oxidative stress and vascular remodeling are critical to mitigating the systemic consequences of hypertensive microvascular damage and reducing the burden of related cardiovascular and renal diseases."

"Levels of adherence to recommended protocols in an intervention trial can affect outcomes and confound the results. To broaden the evidence about the selection and utility of adherence measures in varying contexts, we describe the level of adherence to the Mycotoxin Mitigation Trial (MMT) randomized intervention using caregiver-reported survey questions and compare inferences of adherence between multi-module surveys and interactive 24 h dietary recalls based on our program theory."
"Systems of reproduction differ with respect to the magnitude of neutral genetic diversity maintained in a population. In particular, the partitioning of reproductive organisms into mating types and regular inbreeding have long been recognized as key factors that influence effective population number. Here, a range of reproductive systems are compared with respect to the maintenance of neutral genetic diversity. This study addresses full gonochorism, full hermaphroditism, androdioecy (male and hermaphroditic reproductives), and gynodioecy (female and hermaphroditic reproductives)."
"Transition clinics are conceived as programs dedicated to the active, multidimensional development of a process that addresses the medical, psychosocial, educational, and vocational needs of pediatric patients suffering from a chronic disease that will persist into adulthood. Their understanding is justified in physiological, psychological, and sociocultural terms on the basis of the differential morbidity and mortality associated with a chronic disease that begins in childhood and prevails into adulthood."
"Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is frequently used in the management of brain metastasis patients. However, there is an urgent need to evaluate post-treatment outcomes and quality of life metrics for patients undergoing SRS for brain metastases."
The relation between various types of plant-based diets and cancer risk is still unclear. We examined the association of the overall plant-based diet index (PDI) and healthy (hPDI) and unhealthy plant-based diet indices (uPDI) with the risk of selected digestive cancers.
"Professionals who provide essential social services often face high levels of stress and the suffering of others. Self-care is key to preventing the negative consequences of these working conditions, but it is mostly defined as a personal responsibility. This individualist interpretation may contribute to exacerbating the costs of work stress by ignoring the existence of barriers that do not depend on the professionals. This study aims to develop and validate a new instrument to assess barriers to self-care among social workers, as well as their association with self-compassion and self-care practices. The sample comprised 325 social workers from Spain. Participants were predominantly female (87.4 percent) and worked in public social services (52 percent). Confirmatory factor analysis revealed a four-factor structure (""lack of information,"" ""self-care is unprofessional,"" ""self-care is not a priority,"" and ""noninvolvement of organizations"") consisting of 17 items with adequate psychometric properties. Considering self-care to be unprofessional was associated with less involvement in self-care practices. The social workers who considered the barriers to be more limiting were also those who reported more uncompassionate responses. The Barriers to Professional Self-Care Scale can be used to identify the barriers to professionals' self-care, examining what maintains them and advancing in its prevention."
"Mutualistic mycorrhiza fungi that live in symbiosis with plants facilitates nutrient and water acquisition, improving tree growth and performance.

"Podocytes possess immune system components allowing for a variety of innate responses to endogenous and exogenous stimuli. Recently, several groups have linked inappropriate innate immune signaling to podocyte injury, particularly chronic, sustained injury; however, the immune capabilities of podocytes have not been fully elucidated. Damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) are endogenous danger molecules released from damaged cells, including podocytes, and can elicit an inflammatory response and recruit immune cells to areas of injury. This is performed through binding to pattern recognition receptors. Believed largely to be protective and responsive to injury or infection, recent evidence suggests signaling through DAMP pathways can aggravate and promote chronic diseases already associated with inflammation. The purpose of this narrative review was to highlight current knowledge with respect to specific podocyte DAMPs and pattern recognition receptors and to provide insight into ongoing work and possible future research avenues to advance our understanding of podocyte immune mechanisms."
"This study aims to explore the coding sequence (CDS) of the putative DUS gene in Eimeria media and assess its potential biological functions during the parasite's lifecycle. Initially, oocysts were isolated from fecal samples of rabbits infected with E. media, from which DNA and RNA were extracted. These extractions were used as templates for PCR to successfully amplify the CDS of the DUS gene, confirming its presence within the E. media genome. Further analysis using quantitative PCR (qPCR) demonstrated significantly higher expression of the DUS gene in the precocious line (PL) compared to the wild type (WT). This differential expression highlights a potential functional role for the DUS gene in influencing the development and sporulation processes of E. media, which may contribute to the precocious phenotype. Additionally, bioinformatics analysis provided insights into the evolutionary trends and structural characteristics of the DUS gene across different species, suggesting a broader biological significance. The elevated expression of the DUS gene in the PL suggests its critical involvement in the growth and reproductive processes of the parasite. This finding opens new avenues for research aimed at controlling E. media infection through targeted interventions in the DUS gene expression pathways."
"Cryptorchidism, the absence of one or both testicles in the scrotum, is the most common anomaly of genitourinary tract in males. The pathogenesis of undescended testes is unknown however the role of inflammation, tissue remodeling and oxidative stress is postulated. The aim of this study was to explore the role of HSP-70, MMP-3, MMP-17 and IL-8 in possible pathogenic pathways connected with cryptorchidism. Cryptorchid patients with high scrotal and inguinal canal localization were included. The study group consisted of 63 patients aged 12-24 months, whereas the control group included 17 healthy infants with the same demographic characteristics. The analysis of plasma samples was carried out using ELISA enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique. The plasma concentration of MMP-17 in boys with cryptorchidism was significantly higher compared to the control group (p = 0.0365). The concentration of plasma IL-8, MMP-3, and HSP-70 in boys with cryptorchidism increased in comparison to the control group but these increases were not statistically significant (p > 0.05). A positive correlation was found between plasma MMP-17 and HSP-70 concentration (r = 0.5153; p < 0.0001). Our results demonstrate that MMP-17 and HSP-70 might be involved in pathogenesis of cryptorchidism and are in line with current knowledge that high temperature has a negative influence on male gonads."
"Breast reconstruction consists primarily of two methods: autologous breast reconstruction (ABR) and implant-based breast reconstruction (IBR). Each of these methods has its advantages and disadvantages. The current study used the National Inpatient Sample (NIS), the largest inpatient database in the United States, to explore the trends, complications, and disparities in the use of IBR and ABR."

"The quantification of different structures, isoforms and types of damage in plasmid DNA is of importance for applications in radiation research, DNA based bio-dosimetry, and pharmaceutical applications such as vaccine development. The standard method for quantitative analysis of plasmid DNA damage such as single-strand breaks (SSB), double-strand breaks (DSB) or various types of base-damage is Agarose gel electrophoresis (AGE). Despite being well established, AGE has various drawbacks in terms of time consuming handling and analysis procedures. A more modern, faster, cheaper and more reliable method is capillary gel electrophoresis (CGE). However, to establish this method in biotechnology, radiation-research and related fields, certain criteria in terms of accuracy, repeatability and linearity have to be tested and protocols have to be established. This study performs the relevant tests with a common model plasmid (pUC19, double-stranded DNA with 2686 basepairs) to establish a CGE based methodology for quantitative analysis with readily available commercial CGE systems. The advantages and limitations of the methods are evaluated and discussed, and the range of applicability is presented. As a further example, the kinetics of enzyme digestion of plasmid DNA by capillary gel electrophoresis was studied. The results of the study show for a model system consisting out of pUC19, the suitability of CGE for the quantification of different types of DNA damage and the related isoforms, such as supercoiled, open-circular and linear plasmid DNA."

Specific studies on the impact of ulcerative colitis (UC) and bowel urgency (BU) on disability and quality of life (QoL) of patients on advanced therapies are missing.
Military personnel face an increased risk of developing mental disorders owing to the stressful environments they encounter. Effective stress management strategies are crucial to mitigate this risk. Mindfulness training (MT) is promising as a stress management approach in such demanding settings. This study uses a quantitative approach to investigate the impact of MT on the relationship between the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and emotional regulation.
"Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE) is a global threat. We evaluate the prevalence of CPE among isolates categorized as meropenem-susceptible, but that meet the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) screening cut-off values for carbapenemase detection, and analyze the susceptibility of these isolates to new available drugs."

"The understanding of cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic syndrome remains difficult despite recently performed large scale genome-wide association studies. Here, we identified beta-lactamase (LACTB), a novel gene whose expression is targeted by genetic variations causing kidney dysfunction and hyperlipidemia. Mice with LACTB deletion developed impaired glucose tolerance, elevated lipid levels, and increased sensitivity to kidney disease, while mice with tubule-specific overexpression of LACTB were protected from kidney injury. We show that LACTB is a novel mitochondrial protease cleaving and activating phospholipase A2 group VI (PLA2G6), a kidney-metabolic risk gene itself. Genetic deletion of PLA2G6 in tubule-specific LACTB-overexpressing mice abolished the protective function of LACTB. Via mouse and human lipidomic studies, we show that LACTB and downstream PLA2G6 convert oxidized phosphatidylethanolamine to lyso-phosphatidylethanolamine and thereby regulate mitochondrial function and ferroptosis. In summary, we identify a novel gene and a core targetable pathway for kidney-metabolic disorders."
"Previous research has shown that apoptosis of nucleus pulposus (NP) cells contributes to intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) progression. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is a reaction to diverse stimuli in eukaryotes and is tightly contacted with apoptosis. Quercetin, a naturally occurring flavonoid, exerts protective effects against degenerative diseases via ER stress. However, the effect of quercetin on NP cell apoptosis remains unclear."
"Polo-like kinases (Plks) are essential for spindle attachment to the kinetochore during prophase and the subsequent dissociation after anaphase in both mitosis and meiosis. There are structural differences in the spindle apparatus among mitosis, male meiosis, and female meiosis. It is therefore possible that alleles of Plk genes could improve kinetochore attachment or dissociation in spermatogenesis or oogenesis, but not both. These opposing effects could result in sexually antagonistic selection at Plk loci. In addition, Plk genes have been independently duplicated in many different evolutionary lineages within animals. This raises the possibility that Plk gene duplication may resolve sexual conflicts over mitotic and meiotic functions. We investigated this hypothesis by comparing the evolution, gene expression, and functional effects of the single Plk gene in Drosophila melanogaster (polo) and the duplicated Plks in D. pseudoobscura (Dpse-polo and Dpse-polo-dup1). Dpse-polo-dup1 is expressed primarily in testis, while other Drosophila Plk genes have broader expression profiles. We found that the protein-coding sequence of Dpse-polo-dup1 is evolving significantly faster than a canonical polo gene across all functional domains, yet the essential structure of the encoded protein has been retained. We present additional evidence that the faster evolution of Dpse-polo-dup1 is driven by the adaptive fixation of amino acid substitutions. We also found that over or ectopic expression of polo or Dpse-polo in the D. melanogaster male germline resulted in greater male infertility than expression of Dpse-polo-dup1. Last, expression of Dpse-polo or an ovary-derived transcript of polo in the male germline caused males to sire female-biased broods, suggesting that some Plk transcripts can affect the meiotic transmission of the sex chromosomes in the male germline. However, there was no sex bias in the progeny when Dpse-polo-dup1 was ectopically expressed, or a testis-derived transcript of polo was overexpressed in the D. melanogaster male germline. Our results therefore suggest that Dpse-polo-dup1 may have experienced positive selection to improve its regulation of the male meiotic spindle, resolving sexual conflict over meiotic Plk functions. Alternatively, Dpse-polo-dup1 may encode a hypomorphic Plk that has reduced deleterious effects when overexpressed in the male germline. Similarly, testis transcripts of D. melanogaster polo may be optimized for regulating the male meiotic spindle, and we provide evidence that the untranslated regions of the polo transcript may be involved in sex-specific germline functions."
"Adequate copper (Cu) status has been associated with improved glycemic control, partly because of its role in reducing oxidative stress through superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. Thus, the aim was to investigate the relationship between plasma Cu concentration and markers associated with glycemic control in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This observational and cross-sectional study was conducted in individuals with T2DM of both sexes, aged between 19 and 59 years. Plasma Cu levels were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). Fasting glucose and insulin concentrations, C-peptide levels, SOD activity, and glycated hemoglobin (%HbA1c) were measured. Homeostatic model assessments (HOMA%B, HOMA%S, and HOMA-IR) were also performed. Additionally, %body fat and waist circumference were measured, and body mass index was calculated. Participants were categorized based on their plasma Cu concentrations (< 70 µg/dL and ≥ 70 µg/dL). The associations between variables were analyzed using chi-squared or Fisher's test and binary logistic regression models. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05. Of the 97 participants (74.2% women), 85.5% had Cu deficiency. Cu-deficient individuals showed elevated C-peptide concentrations and HOMA%B values compared to those with adequate Cu levels (2.8 ng/mL vs. 1.8 ng/mL, P = 0.011; and 71.4 vs. 31.0, P = 0.003), respectively. Cu deficiency was associated with insulin resistance (P = 0.044) and decreased likelihood of exceeding the target serum glucose level (OR = 0.147, P = 0.013). However, no significant association was found between SOD activity and plasma Cu concentration. Consequently, Cu deficiency was linked to improved glycemic control, although it was not associated with the other markers."
"Maternal deprivation (MD) is a potent stressor during early life and can lead to behavioral changes during adulthood. Several neurochemical mechanisms underlying MD-induced stress have been proposed; among them is the damage caused to dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). We hypothesized that pharmacological stimulation of dopaminergic neurons in VTA by the infusion of an N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) receptors agonist (used considering the wide distribution of these glutamatergic receptors in the VTA neurons) can reverse MD-induced memory deficits. Here, we demonstrated that MD affects male and female rats distinctly, with females being more resilient to early-life stress. Furthermore, NMDA pharmacological stimulation of the VTA promotes object recognition (OR) memory persistence in male and female non-MD rats. In males, infusion of NMDA into the VTA immediately after the learning session reverses recognition memory deficits related to MD. Although MD female rats have not shown deficits in OR memory consolidation, the NMDA infusion immediately after the learning session promotes memory persistence. We verified that MD leads to memory deficits in adult male rats, while the females are resilient to early life stress. Furthermore, NMDA pharmacological stimulation of dopaminergic VTA neurons reveals the dopaminergic modulation of OR memory in MD rats, even in females that did not exhibit memory deficits."
"Spike train modeling across large neural populations is a powerful tool for understanding how neurons code information in a coordinated manner. Recent studies have employed marked point processes in neural population modeling. The marked point process is a stochastic process that generates a sequence of events with marks. Spike train models based on such processes use the waveform features of spikes as marks and express the generative structure of the unsorted spikes without applying spike sorting. In such modeling, the goal is to estimate the joint mark intensity that describes how observed covariates or hidden states (e.g., animal behaviors, animal internal states, and experimental conditions) influence unsorted spikes. A major issue with this approach is that existing joint mark intensity models are not designed to capture high-dimensional and highly nonlinear observations. To address this limitation, we propose a new joint mark intensity model based on a variational autoencoder, capable of representing the dependency structure of unsorted spikes on observed covariates or hidden states in a data-driven manner. Our model defines the joint mark intensity as a latent variable model, where a neural network decoder transforms a shared latent variable into states and marks. With our model, we derive a new log-likelihood lower bound by exploiting the variational evidence lower bound and upper bound (e.g., the χ upper bound) and use this new lower bound for parameter estimation. To demonstrate the strength of this approach, we integrate our model into a state space model with a nonlinear embedding to capture the hidden state dynamics underlying the observed covariates and unsorted spikes. This enables us to reconstruct covariates from unsorted spikes, known as neural decoding. Our model achieves superior performance in prediction and decoding tasks for synthetic data and the spiking activities of place cells."
"The NCBI Taxonomy resource (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy) has long been a trusted, curated hub for organism names, classifications, and links to related data for all taxonomic nodes. NCBI Datasets (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/) is an improved way to leverage the rich data available at NCBI so users can effectively browse, search, and download information. While taxonomy data has been a cornerstone of NCBI Datasets since its inception, we recently extended the taxonomy information available via NCBI Datasets by updating the existing NCBI Datasets taxonomy page, implementing a new taxonomy name details page, expanding programmatic access to taxonomic information via command-line tools and APIs and improving the way we handle taxonomic queries to connect users to gene and genome data. This paper highlights these improvements and provides examples to help users effectively harness these new features."
"Salicylic acid (SA) is a prominent defense hormone whose basal level, organ-specific accumulation, and physiological role vary widely among plant species. Of the 2 known pathways of plant SA biosynthesis, the phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) pathway is more ancient and universal but its biosynthetic and physiological roles in diverse plant species remain unclear. Studies in which the PAL pathway is specifically or completely inhibited, as well as a direct comparison of diverse species and different organs within the same species, are needed. To this end, we analyzed the PAL pathway in rice (Oryza sativa) and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), 2 distantly related model plants whose basal SA levels and distributions differ tremendously at the organism and tissue levels. Based on our recent identification of the rice peroxisomal cinnamate:CoA ligases (CNLs), we identified 2 peroxisomal CNLs from Arabidopsis and showed CNL as the most functionally specific enzyme among the known enzymes of the PAL pathway. We then revealed the species- and organ-specific contribution of the PAL pathway to benzoic and salicylic acid biosynthesis and clarified its physiological importance in rice and Arabidopsis. Our findings highlight the necessity to consider species and organ types in future SA-related studies and may help to breed new disease-resistant crops."

"Multiple myeloma is a rare haematologic malignancy, representing about 1-2% of all cancers and 17% of haematologic malignancies in the US, predominantly affecting older adults and more common in African Americans (AAs) and men. Light-chain multiple myeloma, a subtype accounting for 15% of multiple myeloma cases, often has a more aggressive clinical course. This case report discusses a rare case of an AA female in her early 30s, diagnosed with light-chain multiple myeloma following a pathological rib fracture. Initial symptoms were atypical, and diagnosis was delayed due to her young age and lack of common multiple myeloma signs, such as anaemia and hypercalcaemia. Treatment included induction chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant, leading to complete remission. This case underscores the need for heightened clinical suspicion and thorough investigation in young patients presenting with unexplained bone lesions, highlighting the diverse presentations and challenges in diagnosing multiple myeloma in younger populations."
"Infertility is a prevalent problem among 10% of people within their reproductive years. Sometimes, even advanced treatment options like assisted reproduction technology have the potential to result in failed implantation. Because of the expected changes in gene expression during both in vitro and in vivo fertilization processes, these methods of assisting fertility have also been associated with undesirable pregnancy outcomes related to infertility. In this aspect, Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play a crucial role as epigenetic modifiers in a wide range of biological and pathological activities, including problems with fertility. CircRNAs are integral pieces in multiple cellular functions, including moving substances within the nucleus, silencing one X chromosome, cell death, the ability of stem cells to differentiate into different cell types, and the process of gene expression inherited from parental genes. Due to the progress made in high-speed gene sequencing, a large amount of circRNA molecules have been detected, revealing their significant functions in diverse biological functions like enhancing testicular development, preserving the differentiation and renewal of spermatogonial cells, and controlling spermatocyte meiosis. Moreover, these non-coding RNAs contribute in different aspects of female reproductive system including pregnancy-related diseases, gynecologic cancers, and endometriosis. In conclusion, there is no denying that circRNAs have immense potential to be used as biomarkers and treatments for reproductive disorders in males and females. In this research, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the multiple circRNAs associated with women's infertility."
"Sex is a key variable in the regulation of human physiology and pathology. Many diseases disproportionately affect one sex: autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, are more common in women but more severe in men, whereas the incidence of other disorders such as gouty arthritis and malignant cancers is higher in men. Besides the pathophysiology, sex may also influence the efficacy of therapeutics; participants in clinical trials are still predominately men, and the side effects of drugs are more common in women than in men. Sex dimorphism is a prominent feature of kidney physiology and function, and consequently affects the predisposition to many adult kidney diseases. These differences subsequently influence the response to immune stimuli, hormones, and therapies. It is highly likely that these responses differ between the sexes. Therefore, it becomes imperative to consider sex differences in translational science from basic science to preclinical research to clinical research and trials. Under-representation of one sex in preclinical animal studies or clinical trials remains an issue and key reported outcomes of such studies ought to be presented separately. Without this, it remains difficult to tailor the management of kidney disease appropriately and effectively. In this review, we provide mechanistic insights into sex differences in rodents and humans, both in kidney health and disease, highlight the importance of considering sex differences in the design of any preclinical animal or clinical study, and propose guidance on how to optimal design and conduct preclinical animal studies in future research."
"Diabetes prevalence is high among Arab populations, where cultural practices present barriers to effective glycemic control. Despite guidelines recommending the involvement of dietitians in diabetes management, evidence of the effectiveness of dietitian-involved interventions in these populations remains limited. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the effectiveness of dietitian-involved lifestyle interventions among Arab populations with prediabetes or diabetes."

"Osteoporosis, characterized by decreased bone mineral density due to an imbalance between osteoblast and osteoclast activity, poses significant challenges in bone healing, particularly in postmenopausal women. Current treatments, such as bisphosphonates, are effective but associated with adverse effects like medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw, necessitating safer alternatives."
"The maintenance of healthy mitochondria is essential for neuronal survival and relies upon mitochondrial quality control pathways involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, mitochondrial dynamics, and mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy). Mitochondrial dysfunction is critically implicated in Parkinson's disease (PD), a brain disorder characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Consequently, impaired mitochondrial quality control may play a key role in PD pathology. This is affirmed by work indicating that genes such as PRKN and PINK1, which participate in multiple mitochondrial processes, harbor PD-associated mutations. Furthermore, mitochondrial complex-I-inhibiting toxins like MPTP and rotenone are known to cause Parkinson-like symptoms. At the heart of PD is alpha-synuclein (αS), a small synaptic protein that misfolds and aggregates to form the disease's hallmark Lewy bodies. The specific mechanisms through which aggregated αS exerts its neurotoxicity are still unknown; however, given the vital role of both αS and mitochondria to PD, an understanding of how αS influences mitochondrial maintenance may be essential to elucidating PD pathogenesis and discovering future therapeutic targets. Here, the current knowledge of the relationship between αS and mitochondrial quality control pathways in PD is reviewed, highlighting recent findings regarding αS effects on mitochondrial biogenesis, dynamics, and autophagy."
"This study explores FD/MAS patient's perceptions about their disease and its impact on their quality of life. We have evaluated quality of life (QoL) in French Fibrous Dysplasia/MacCune-Albright Syndrome (FD/MAS) patients using a qualitative approach with focus groups to explore perceptions, symptoms and limitations associated with FD/MAS and a quantitative method with the Short Form-36 (SF36) to quantify QoL. Focus groups revealed the heterogeneity of FD forms and allowed for understanding the reasons of reduced QoL. Patients identified pain as the dominant symptom. The impact on mental health was explained by diagnostic uncertainty, disease chronicity and rarity and the inconsistent effectiveness of therapies. Patients talked about disability but also of coping strategies. They expressed their need for comprehensive and multi-disciplinary care from medical and paramedical professionals familiar with their pathology. The quantitative questionnaire SF36 confirmed reduced QoL in these patients compared with the French general population in all sub-domains: physical function (72.1 versus 84.4, p = 0.0001), physical role (60.5 versus 81.1, p = 0.0004), body pain (58.7 versus 72.4, p = 0.0004), general health (50.08 versus 67.6, p < 0.0001), energy (44.58 versus 57.2, p < 0.0001), social function (61.34 versus 80.5, p < 0.0001), emotional role (57.98 versus 81.3, p = 0.0002) and emotional well-being (57.98 versus 81.3, p = 0.0097). Polyostotic patients had poorer QoL compared with monostotic patients. A better understanding of the disease experience and expectations of FD patients will enable practitioners to provide care better adapted to patients' needs, and pave the way for optimizing DF care."
"Mental health and capacity laws applicable to children and young people in Northern Ireland (NI) lack clarity and coherence, with significant gaps in service provision and safeguarding. Drawing on an examination of such laws, we argue that law reform is needed. In the short term, we suggest there is merit in publishing statutory guidance, such as a Code of Practice, to address both the issue of evolving capacity in children and to facilitate best practice in policy and practice. This modest reform in the short term should be accompanied by a firm political commitment to ensuring that NI's innovative fusion mental capacity legislation is fully brought into force in the medium term. Meanwhile, law reform should form part of a holistic approach on the part of NI's policy-makers towards improving mental healthcare provision for children and young people in line with a human rights-based approach. This would include the following: increased allocation of funding and resources to facilitate more timely access to suitable treatment and related services; enhancing participation in policy, judicial, and clinical decision-making that impacts their lives; and employing a range of executive accountability mechanisms to drive improvements in such provision over time."
"The primary objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the effect of enteral insulin supplementation provided to premature newborns on the time to achieve full enteral feeding.

"Young adults with early psychosis are at higher risk of violent behavior, but no studies have explored using CBT-based interventions to reduce violence in specialized early intervention services (EIS) settings. This study describes formative research about the acceptability and feasibility of the Psychological Intervention for Complex PTSD and Schizophrenia-Spectrum disorder (PICASSO) to reduce violence, using interviews with EIS participants and staff. Generated themes regarding acceptability included negative experiences of violence and the desire to control and minimize violence. Themes regarding feasibility raised concerns about time constraints, consistency of participation in the intervention, and implementation issues in the context of stigma related to both psychosis and perpetration of violence. Findings from this study suggest there is a need for an intervention addressing violence risk. If adequate resources are devoted to addressing implementation issues, a CBT intervention for violence like PICASSO appears both acceptable and feasible for EIS participants and staff."
"Paid domestic work (PDW) is an important source of employment for the global female workforce. It is frequently performed under precarious working conditions and occupational risks that are often associated with depressive symptoms (DSs). Although 10% (2.2 million) of Mexican working women are paid domestic workers (PDWs), their mental health has remained understudied. This article analyzes the occurrence and factors associated with DSs in a sample of Mexican workers segmented into six workforce groups, including PDWs. A three-stage statistical analysis was performed on national health survey data from Mexico (ENSANUT 2012): 1. Tabulation of inferential statistics; 2. Multiple logistic regression modeling of DSs; 3. Postestimation of DSs prevalence. Our findings suggest a context of social disadvantages based on gender, education, and labor market segregation that manifests in PDWs having the highest adjusted prevalence of DSs (14.1%, 95%CI = 9.7-18.4). Significant differences in prevalence were observed when compared with other workforce groups, such as formal employees. Among working women, after adjusting for relevant covariates, the odds of DSs were higher among PDWs as compared with formal employees (OR = 1.65, 95%CI = 1.04-2.61). Ongoing efforts for PDW formalization should be maintained in Mexico as an employment policy and mechanism to achieve PDWs' social well-being and mental health."
"Green tea made from the albino tea plant cultivar 'Huangjinya' is highly popular due to its umami taste. However, its cultivation and economic value are restricted by late sprouting, low yields, and insufficient aroma. In this study, we sprayed 0, 0.025, 0.1 or 1 mM theanine on 'Huangjinya' tea plants before sprouting in spring. We observed 1 mM theanine spray accelerated sprouting and new shoot growth which leading to a 25.4% increase in yield. Moreover, the exogenous theanine spraying increased amino acids and decreased polyphenols in the green tea made from the new shoots of 'Huangjinya'. In addition, the 0.025 and 1 mM theanine sprays also improved the overall aroma profile, particularly the contents of fruity, fatty, and minty volatiles. In summary, theanine application elevates the fresh leaf yield and quality of Huangjinya, holding great potential for expanding its consumer base and increasing the economic value of albino tea."
"Denosumab is widely used for osteoporosis and cancer treatment. However, hypocalcemia induced by denosumab is a frequent adverse event.

"Although previous studies have reported the dysregulation of respiratory tract microbiota in infectious diseases, insufficient data exist regarding respiratory microbiota imbalances in the lower respiratory tracts of children with pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB). In this study, we assessed the value of mNGS in the pathogen diagnosis and microbiome analysis of PTB patients using bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples."
"In cases of large mandibular continuity defects resulting from malignancy resection, the current standard of care involves using patient-specific/custom titanium reconstruction plates along with autogenous grafts (fibula, scapula, or iliac crest segments). However, when grafts are not feasible or desired, only the reconstruction plate is used to bridge the gap. Unfortunately, metal osteosynthesis and reconstruction plates, including titanium, exhibit adverse effects such as stress-shielding and limitations in accurate postoperative irradiation (especially with proton-beam therapy). To address these issues, in this study we explore, develop and validate a non-metallic solution: a topology-optimized polyetheretherketone (PEEK) load-bearing implant for large non-grafted mandibular continuity defects. In order to thoroughly validate the developed PEEK reconstruction, a dedicated MANDYBILATOR testing apparatus was developed. Using the MANDYBILATOR finite element analysis results of the implant were confirmed and the PEEK implant was mechanically validated for both static and dynamic loading. Results show that the PEEK reconstructed mandible is comparably strong as the unreconstructed mandible and is unlikely to fail due to fatigue. Our PEEK implant design has the mechanical potential to act as a substitute for the current titanium plates used in the reconstruction of continuity defects of the mandible. This may potentially lead to optimised patient-specific reconstructions, with the implants matching the bone's stiffness and possessing radiolucent properties which are useful for radiographic follow-ups and radiotherapy. Furthermore, the addition of the dynamic/cyclic MANDYBILATOR apparatus allows for more realistic application of the in-vivo loading of the mandible and can provide added insights in biomechanical behaviour of the mandible."
"The nucleus serves as a pivotal regulatory and control hub in the cell, governing numerous aspects of cellular functions, including DNA replication, transcription, and RNA processing. Therefore, any deviations in nuclear morphology, structure, or organization can strongly affect cellular activities. In this review, we provide an updated perspective on the structure and function of nuclear components, focusing on the linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton complex, the nuclear envelope, the nuclear lamina, and chromatin. Additionally, nuclear size should be considered a fundamental parameter for the cellular state. Its regulation is tightly linked to environmental changes, development, and various diseases, including cancer. Hence, we also provide a concise overview of different mechanisms by which nuclear size is determined, the emerging role of the nucleus as a mechanical sensor, and the implications of altered nuclear morphology on the physiology of diseased cells."
"Canada has the fourth highest per capita rate of opioid prescriptions in the world, contributing to the country's opioid crisis. Due to both their pain-relieving and euphoric properties, opioids can be highly addictive, leading to potential overdose and death. Deprescription is an endorsed and organized method of discontinuing a drug but very little is known about the barriers that Canadian physicians face when attempting to deprescribe opioids, particularly those who practice in rural areas (which have some of the highest rates of opioid users)."
"Using data from an online, cross-sectional U.S. nationally representative survey, we analyzed participants' responses to an open-ended item that asked them to look back on their entire lives and to describe their favorite aspects of being sexual with a partner. These text responses (n = 2755) were grouped into 22 codes, the most common of which were closeness/intimacy, specific sex acts, feels good, love/caring, satisfying/pleasing a partner, and orgasm. The present study extends the existing literature on positive aspects of sexuality."
"Thyroid cancer is a common malignancy that requires comprehensive clinical evaluation prior to adequate surgical management. Over the last three decades thyroid surgery has tripled and is considered one of the most commonly performed procedures in general surgery. These procedures are associated with potential postoperative complications with significant deterioration in the patient's quality of life. While the current rates of recurrent laryngeal nerve injury following thyroidectomy have decreased secondary to intraoperative neuromonitoring, thyroid surgery remains the leading cause of iatrogenic injury. The authors herein present a case of a thyroid nodule with cervical lymph node involvement undergoing total thyroidectomy guided by near-ultraviolet (NUV) imaging nerve auto-fluorescent technology to visualize, identify and protect vital structures."
"Near the C-terminus of histone H2A in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, there are 2 serines (S122 and S129) that are targets of phosphorylation. The phosphorylation of serine 129 in response to DNA damage is dependent on the Tel1 and Mec1 kinases. In Schizosaccharomyces pombe and S. cerevisiae, the phosphorylation of serine 122 is dependent on the Bub1 kinase, and S. pombe strains with an alanine mutation of this serine have elevated levels of lagging chromosomes in mitosis. Strains that lack both Tel1 and Mec1 in S. cerevisiae have very elevated rates of nondisjunction. To clarify the functional importance of phosphorylation of serines 122 and 129 in H2A, we measured chromosome loss rates in single-mutant strains and double-mutant combinations. We also examined the interaction of mutations of BUB1, TEL1, and MEC1 in combination with mutations of serines 122 and 129 in H2A. We conclude that the phosphorylation state of S129 has no effect on chromosome disjunction whereas mutations that inactivate Bub1 or a S122A mutation in the histone H2A greatly elevate the rate of chromosome nondisjunction. Based on this analysis, we suggest that Bub1 exerts its primary effect on chromosome disjunction by phosphorylating S122 of histone H2A. However, Tel1, Mec1, and Bub1 are also functionally redundant in a second pathway affecting chromosome disjunction that is at least partially independent of phosphorylation of S122 of H2A."
"The probing of small molecules with heterocyclic scaffolds covering unexplored chemical space and the evaluation of their biological relevance are essential parts of forward chemical genetics approaches and for the development of potential small-molecule therapeutics. In this study, we profiled sets of chromenopyrazoles (CMPs) and tetrahydroquinolines (THQs), originally developed to target the protein-RNA interaction of LIN28-let-7, in a cell painting assay (CPA) measuring cellular morphological changes. Selected LIN28-inactive CMPs and THQs induced cellular morphological changes to different extents. The most CPA-active CMPs 2 and 3 exhibited high bio-similarity with the LCH and BET clusters, while the most CPA-active THQs 13 and 20 indicated a mechanism of action beyond the currently established biosimilarity clusters. Overall, this work demonstrated that CPA is useful in revealing ""hidden"" biological targets and mechanisms of action for biologically inactive small molecules, which are CMPs and THQs targeting the RNA-binding protein LIN28 in this case, evaluated in target-based strategies. When compared with annotated reference compounds, CMP 3 exhibited a high biosimilarity with the dual BRD7/9 degrading PROTAC VZ185, suggesting that CPA could potentially function as a new phenotypic approach to identify degrader molecules."
"This study compared the safety and efficacy of osimertinib, a third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), with those of other TKIs and its use alongside bevacizumab in patients with EGFR mutation-positive advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang, and VIP databases were used to conduct extensive searches for relevant randomized controlled trials until January 30, 2024. Osimertinib monotherapy favored disease control rate, whereas the comparator treatment arm favored overall survival. Using subgroup analysis, the objective response rate and progression-free survival (PFS) were significantly elevated by Osimertinib monotherapy compared with pemetrexed combined with carboplatin or cisplatin. The comparator treatment arm receiving gefitinib or erlotinib significantly favored progression-free survival and overall survival compared with osimertinib monotherapy. In patients treated with osimertinib monotherapy, the incidence of all adverse events (AEs) decreased compared with comparator treatment arm. Anemia was the only AE associated with osimertinib monotherapy. Pemetrexed combined with carboplatin or cisplatin resulted in greater loss of appetite than osimertinib monotherapy. The most associated AE of osimertinib monotherapy was diarrhea, according to network analysis. Although its efficacy is not consistent with other EGFR TKIs, osimertinib was associated with a decrease in AEs in patients with EGFR mutation-positive advanced non-small-cell lung cancer."
"Patients undergoing perineal defect reconstruction with the internal pudendal artery perforator (IPAP) flap traditionally face 5 days of postoperative bed rest (BR) to minimize surgical risks. However, prolonged BR can exacerbate postoperative physiologic changes such as increased fatigue, reduced body mass, and declining lung function, while also leading to complications such as pneumonia, delirium, deep vein thrombosis, and pressure injuries. This study assessed the effectiveness, feasibility, and safety of an adapted early mobilization (EM) program for these patients."
"The EQ-5D VAS is a widely used measure for health-related quality of life (HRQol). The EQ-5D health states often weighted using the time trade-off (TTO). The assessment of the EQ-5D, VAS, TTO psychometric properties is necessary to inform adaption across countries and populations due to cross-cultural and language diversity. The objective of the study is to evaluate validity, reliability, and feasibility of the Arabic version of the EQ-5D-3L, VAS, and TTO among a broad sample of Arabic-speaking Jordanians."
"Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) patients and Somatization Symptom Disorder (SSD) patients experience somatization symptoms relative to their corresponding processes. IBS patients may also have a diagnosis of both IBS and SSD. Somatization symptoms cause significant psychological, emotional and social distress. Conversely, stress in any form is believed to contribute to IBS symptoms. Whether stress mediated somatization symptoms in patients with IBS provide a pathway for these IBS symptoms is not as well understood. This cross-sectional study was performed at Shifa International Hospital, Islamabad between March 1st, 2023, and January 14th, 2024. Purposeful sampling was done to recruit study participants from three different populations as somatization is common in all three populations. As a result, there were three different samples in the study. Participants were eligible to participate if they had a diagnosis of IBS, somatic symptom disorder (SSD), or IBS with somatization (IBS-SSD) and were currently receiving treatment at the gastroenterology outpatient clinic and/or psychiatric outpatient clinic. Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-15) and Somatic Stress Response Scale (SSRS) were used to assess somatic symptoms and their association of stress-related somatic symptoms. Data was entered and analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Data was self-reported by the participants. The largest sample size 67(100%) was from the IBS patient population. Two other samples were small i.e., there were 21 (100%) participants in SSD sample, and a very few numbers of participants 12 (100%) in the IBS diagnosis with a comorbidity of SSD sample. Majority of the patients were young i.e., 50≤ (77.7%), (71.4%), (74.99%); and male (59.7%), (66.6%), (50.0%) from the IBS, SSD, and IBS-SSD samples. Majority of the participants in the IBS (56.7%) and SSD (61.9%) samples had a high school diploma or the equivalent. In the IBS-SSD sample, the largest percentage (41.7%) of participants had more than a bachelor's degrees. M = 85.67 (+/-23.26) for SSRS scores and M = 17.81(+/-5.28) for PHQ-15 scores in SSD patients. M = 75.21 (+/-19.59) for SSRS scores and M = 14.76 (+/-5.07) for PHQ-15 scores in IBS patients. M = 75.17 (+/-20.55) for SSRS scores and M = 14.92 (+/-6.27) for PHQ-15 scores in IBS-SSD patients. Many participants had somatization symptoms in the severe range (≥ 15) i.e., 34(50.7%), 17(81.0%), 6(50.0%) in IBS, SSD, and IBS-SSD samples respectively. Considering the PHQ scores by age in the IBS sample, highest mean scores were observed for the highest age group (60-69 years) i.e., 16.50 (+/- 5.68) despite fewer number of participants in this age group. PHQ scores also significantly differed by education groups i.e., significant differences were observed between education group 1 and 2 as well as group 2 and 3, p<0.05. On simple linear regression, PHQ-15 scores significantly predicted variations in SSRS scores, p <0.05, R2 = 69.6% for IBS sample, R2 = 68.7% for the SSD sample, and R2 = 66.0% for patients with IBS, SSD and IBS with somatization respectively. Stress related somatic symptoms are positively correlated with somatization complaints in IBS patients. Increased somatization scores were observed in the elderly. Targeted psycho-social interventions could help mitigate the negative effects of somatization in IBS patients."
"Nerve injury can be caused by a variety of factors. It often takes a long time to repair a nerve injury and severe nerve injury is even difficult to heal. Therefore, increasing attention has focused on nerve injury and repair. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) is a newly discovered non-coding RNA with a wide range of biological activities. Numerous studies have shown that a variety of lncRNAs undergo changes in expression after nerve injury, indicating that lncRNAs may be involved in various biological processes of nerve repair and regeneration. Herein, we summarize the biological roles of lncRNAs in neurons, glial cells and other cells during nerve injury and regeneration, which will help lncRNAs to be better applied in nerve injury and regeneration in the future."

"The Economy of action hypothesis postulates that bodily states rescale the perception of the individual's environment's spatial layout. The estimation of distances and slopes in navigation space (i.e. the space reachable by locomotion) is influenced by sensations relating to body condition and the metabolic cost of the actions. The results of the studies investigating the impact of pain on distance estimation remain inconclusive. 28 women suffering from chronic pain and fibromyalgia (FM), and 24 healthy women (HC) were assessed for musculoskeletal, neuropathic, and visceral pain by means of the Widespread Pain Index, the Symptom Severity Scale and an ad-hoc devised questionnaire for pain (the Verona Pain Questionnaire). In a VR-mediated task, they observed a 3D scenario and estimated the distance of a flag positioned at different distances (1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 m) on virtual ramps with either a 4% or 24% inclination in two different conditions: sitting and standing. Overestimation of distances in the steeper ramp condition was expected, if participants executed the task by internally simulating the movement. The results showed a dissociation between the effects of musculoskeletal and visceral-neuropathic pain on distance estimations. While, according to the Economy of Action hypothesis, the HCs estimated the distances as being farther away when the ramp was more inclined (i.e. with a 24% inclination), there was no effect related to the different ramp inclinations in the FM group. Furthermore, visceral and neuropathic pain were found to affect the performance of the FM group. These results suggest that chronic and widespread pain conditions, that typically characterize fibromyalgia, can affect space representations. In line with the Economy of Action hypothesis, bodily based estimation of distances is compromised in these patients."
"Cardiogenic shock complicating acute myocardial infarction is associated with a high mortality rate. Cardiogenic shock after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) can be due to transient myocardial stunning but also reflect the increasing severity of ongoing heart failure. The Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI) proposed a division of cardiogenic shock into 5 phenotypes, with cardiac arrest being a modifier. The objective was to apply SCAI shock classification to a well-characterized OHCA population and describe the hemodynamic characteristics and prognostic significance of increasing SCAI classes."
"Technological innovations in genomics and related fields have facilitated large sequencing efforts, supported new biological discoveries in cancer, and spawned an era of liquid biopsy biomarkers. Despite these advances, precision oncology has practical constraints, partly related to cancer's biological diversity and spatial and temporal complexity. Advanced imaging technologies are being developed to address some of the current limitations in early detection, treatment selection and planning, drug delivery, and therapeutic response, as well as difficulties posed by drug resistance, drug toxicity, disease monitoring, and metastatic evolution. We discuss key areas of advanced imaging for improving cancer outcomes and survival. Finally, we discuss practical challenges to the broader adoption of precision imaging in the clinic and the need for a robust translational infrastructure."
"The National Policy for the Care of Indigenous Peoples (NPCIP) faces an enormous challenge in operationalization regarding the training and qualification of health professionals to work in an intercultural context. In this article, we open a dialogue with the proposal of a Meeting of Knowledges (MK) as a teaching and learning strategy capable of promoting a critical intercultural education. We seek to reflect on the possible impact of MK in the health field for transforming the university environment, as well as healthcare for Indigenous communities, towards an entrenched, democratic, pluriepistemic, and transdisciplinary perspective."
"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), such as pembrolizumab, have revolutionized cancer treatment by enhancing the immune system's response to malignancies. However, these therapies are associated with immune-related adverse events (irAEs), including neuromuscular complications such as myasthenia gravis, myositis, and myocarditis. We describe two male patients, aged 67 and 68, with small cell and non-small cell lung cancers, who developed progressive neuromuscular symptoms, including ptosis, diplopia, and generalized weakness, after receiving pembrolizumab. Clinical, biochemical, imaging, and electrophysiological findings confirmed the diagnosis of myositis with myastheniform features, with one case also involving myocarditis. Both patients underwent treatments with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), pyridostigmine, and corticosteroids. The first patient, despite aggressive treatment including plasma exchange and rituximab, succumbed to complications from aspiration pneumonia. The second patient showed partial response to pyridostigmine and IVIg but later died due to metastatic cancer progression. A literature review revealed 52 cases of pembrolizumab-associated myositis with myastheniform symptoms, emphasizing its high morbidity and the need for vigilant monitoring. Pembrolizumab-associated myositis with myastheniform symptoms, especially when accompanied by myocarditis, presents a significant clinical challenge with high mortality. Early recognition and aggressive management of these irAEs are crucial to improving outcomes in cancer patients receiving ICIs."
"Extracellular vesicles (EVs)-mediated communication by cancer cells contributes towards the pro-tumoral reprogramming of the tumor microenvironment. Viral infection has been observed to alter the biogenesis and cargo of EVs secreted from host cells in the context of infectious biology. However, the impact of oncolytic viruses on the cargo and function of EVs released by cancer cells remains unknown. Here we show that upon oncolytic virotherapy with Semliki Forest virus-based replicon particles (rSFV), metastatic melanoma cells release EVs with a distinct biochemical profile and do not lead to suppression of immune cells. Specifically, we demonstrate that viral infection causes a differential loading of regulatory microRNAs (miRNAs) in EVs in addition to changes in their physical features. EVs derived from cancer cells potentially suppress splenocyte proliferation and induce regulatory macrophages. In contrast, EVs obtained from rSFV-infected cells did not exhibit such effects. Our results thus show that rSFV infection induces changes in the immunomodulatory properties of melanoma EVs, which may contribute to enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of virotherapy. Finally, our results show that the use of an oncolytic virus capable of a single-round of infection allows the analysis of EVs secreted from infected cells while preventing interference from extracellular virus particles."
"Air pollution is strongly associated with autoimmune diseases (ADs), however, the genetic causality between them remains poorly understood. Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine the relationship between common air pollutants and ADs through Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. We conducted a MR study using aggregated data from publicly available genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with 5 common air pollutants are used as instrumental variables. Random-effects inverse variance weighted (IVW) is used as the primary method to assess causal relationships, with results reported in terms of odds ratios (OR). In addition, we used a two-step MR to assess the mediating role of common risk factors for ADs in the effects of air pollution on ADs. Our analysis revealed causal associations between selected air pollutants and specific ADs. Exposure to nitrogen oxides was positively associated with the risk of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (OR = 1.47,95% CI 1.01-2.14, P = 0.043), Sjogren's syndrome (SS) (OR = 2.29,95% CI 1.08-4.89, P = 0.032), and systemic lupus erythematosus (OR = 7.26,95% CI 2.25-23.40, P = 9.10E-04). Genetically predicted PM2.5 and PM10 were risk factors for ulcerative colitis (OR = 1.68,95% CI 1.05-2.68, P = 0.032) and psoriasis (OR = 1.34,95% CI 1.02-1.76, P = 0.037), respectively. Our results also suggest a negative causal relationship between PM2.5-10 and SS (OR = 0.29, 95% CI 0.10-0.90, P = 0.032). In risk factor-related mediation analyses, BMI and smoking mediated 6% (95% CI 1-10%) and 9% (95% CI 2-17%) of the effect of nitrogen oxides on RA, respectively. This study provides evidence of a causal relationship between air pollutants and specific ADs risks, suggesting that improving air pollution may be important in preventing ADs."

"Children are highly sensitive to toxins which can damage their organs and lead to death. Investigating the main causes of intoxication could reduce mortality and morbidity in children. In this cross-sectional study, the documents of all poisoned patients (214 cases) admitted to the emergency department of Taleghani children`s Hospital between April 2020 and 2023 were investigated. Approximately 51% of them were females. There were 87 cases (45.3%) of illicit drug poisoning, which included methadone 43.8%, opium 41.4%, amphetamine 8.2%, cannabis 3.3%, buprenorphine 2.2%, and tramadol 1.1%. Children who were poisoned by illicit drugs presented with impaired level of consciousness (92.5%), unstable vital signs and abnormal laboratory results. The level of serum glucose was higher in methadone toxicity. Three and two cases, due to methadone and opium poisoning died. Children with illicit drugs poisoning in terms of vital signs and laboratory data were worse compared to other poisonings and mortality is high in this group. In this study, the blood sugar in methadone poisoning cases was statistically significantly different from other drugs, and it is suggested that in cases of children suspected of poisoning with illicit drugs and high blood sugar, methadone poisoning should be considered in the differential diagnosis."
"This study aimed to investigate whether driving pressure-guided ventilation can reduce postoperative pulmonary complications in patients who have undergone heart transplantation. Patients who underwent orthotopic heart transplantation were divided into two groups according to the perioperative ventilation strategy: (1) conventional lung-protective ventilation (group C) and (2) driving pressure-guided ventilation (group D). The primary outcome was the occurrence of postoperative pulmonary complications within 30 days of surgery. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the independent risk factors associated with postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs). Compared with group C, patients in group D exhibited lower driving pressure. Oxygenation improved significantly in the early period after surgery in patients in group D. Group C exhibited a higher number of patients with postoperative pulmonary complications, especially respiratory infections and atelectasis. Patients in group D experienced a shorter duration of postoperative mechanical ventilation and a shorter stay in the intensive care unit. The conventional ventilation strategy, the high driving pressure level and the low PaO2 value at the end of the surgery were the independent risk factors for PPCs in heart transplantation. Compared with conventional lung-protective ventilation, driving pressure-guided ventilation was associated with improved pulmonary oxygenation and lower incidences of pulmonary complications among patients after heart transplantation."
"Endophytes are microorganisms residing in plant tissues without causing harm and their relevance in medicinal plants has grown due to their biomolecules used in pharmaceuticals. This study isolated two endophytic bacterial strains from the leaves of M. oleifera and P. betel collected from Junagadh Agricultural University. The isolates were characterized morphologically and physio-biochemically, confirming them as gram-positive or gram-negative rods and cocci. Identification using 16S rRNA gene sequencing identified isolates belonging to various genera, including Priestia aryabhattai and Kocuria rhizophila The SEM characterization of the five selected isolates revealed diverse morphological structures, including coccus and rod shapes, organized in various formations. Isolates varied in size, with N3 (Kocuria rhizophila) cocci and S5 (Priestia aryabhattai) rods. Metabolomic analysis using GC/MS and LC-MS revealed diverse metabolic profiles with key compounds like n-Hexadecanoic acid, Pyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrazine-1,4-dione, Dihydrocapsaicin, and β-Homoproline, highlighting the potential of these endophytic bacteria in agricultural applications due to their roles in membrane integrity, antioxidant properties, stress response, and antibacterial activity."

Short diagnosis-to-treatment interval (DTI) is associated with high-risk disease and poor survival in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). There is a paucity of literature on DTI and survival in DLBCL treated with first-line DA-R-EPOCH. We hypothesized that rapid initiation of DA-R-EPOCH in aggressive and high-risk DLBCL mitigates the adverse prognostic implication of short DTI.
"Phospholipids are the most abundant component in lipid membranes and are essential for the structural and functional integrity of the cell. In eukaryotic cells, phospholipids are primarily synthesized de novo through the Kennedy pathway that involves multiple enzymatic processes. The terminal reaction is mediated by a group of cytidine-5'-diphosphate (CDP)-choline /CDP-ethanolamine-phosphotransferases (CPT/EPT) that use 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG) and CDP-choline or CDP-ethanolamine to produce phosphatidylcholine (PC) or phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) that are the main phospholipids in eukaryotic cells. Here we present the structure of the yeast CPT1 in multiple substrate-bound states. Structural and functional analysis of these binding-sites reveal the critical residues for the DAG acyl-chain preference and the choline/ethanolamine selectivity. Additionally, we present the structure in complex with a potent inhibitor characterized in this study. The ensemble of structures allows us to propose the reaction mechanism for phospholipid biosynthesis by the family of CDP-alcohol phosphotransferases (CDP-APs)."
"Environmental changes may alter gene expression in depression and anxiety disorders through epigenetic regulation, including via small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) and their major subclass, microRNAs (miRNAs). However, underlying mechanisms mediating miRNA regulation in response to changing environmental stimuli are unclear. Using the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) knockout (KO) mouse model of depression/anxiety, this study aimed to compare the effects of voluntary exercise (EX) versus chronic treatment with the stress hormone corticosterone (CT), on hippocampal miRNA transcriptome and proteome in five comparison groups: WT-SH vs. KO-SH; WT-SH vs. WT-EX; KO-SH vs. KO-EX; WT-SH vs. WT-CT; KO-SH vs. KO-CT. We hypothesized that treatment with stress hormone will result in miRNA and proteomics changes observed in genetic model of depression, while exercise will have beneficial effects similar to antidepressant treatment. Using high-throughput sequencing of miRNAs and mass spectrometry (MS)-based approaches for protein expression, we revealed 337 differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs and 67 proteins in 5-HTT KO mice compared to wild-type (WT) control mice in standard-housing conditions. After exercise, there were 200 DE miRNAs and 3 DE proteins in WT mice, and 20 DE miRNAs and 95 DE proteins in 5-HTT KO mice, while corticosterone treatment led to 168 DE miRNAs and 1 DE protein in WT, and 21 DE miRNAs and 21 DE proteins in 5-HTT KO mice. Serotonergic dysfunction (due to the 5-HTT KO gene mutation) induced altered expression of miRNAs and proteins involved in regulation of neurodevelopment, neurogenesis and neuroinflammatory responses. Treatment with the stress hormone corticosterone in WT mice activated pathways which were also found altered in 5-HTT KO mice, while exercise caused antidepressant-like effects. These findings suggest that functional 5-HTT might be required for the beneficial effects of exercise on miRNA expression. Our study is the first to explore how gene-environment interactions affect miRNA/proteomic composition in a mouse model of depression/anxiety, and extends our understanding of gene-environmental interactions underlying these affective disorders."
"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common rheumatic disease that most commonly affects joints and negatively impacts individuals' health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Although some studies have explored HRQoL of RA patients, existing studies treated RA patients as a homogeneous group based on their overall HRQoL and ignore the heterogeneity of patients' HRQoL patterns. This study aimed to identify subgroups of RA patients based on their HRQoL and variables associated with group membership."

Three-year follow-up reveals stable fixation without any failure."
"Makeup modifies facial textures and colors, impacting the precision of face anti-spoofing systems. Many individuals opt for light makeup in their daily lives, which generally does not hinder face identity recognition. However, current research in face anti-spoofing often neglects the influence of light makeup on facial feature recognition, notably the absence of publicly accessible datasets featuring light makeup faces. If these instances are incorrectly flagged as fraudulent by face anti-spoofing systems, it could lead to user inconvenience. In response, we develop a face anti-spoofing database that includes light makeup faces and establishes a criterion for determining light makeup to select appropriate data. Building on this foundation, we assess multiple established face anti-spoofing algorithms using the newly created database. Our findings reveal that the majority of these algorithms experience a decrease in performance when faced with light makeup faces. Consequently, this paper introduces a general face anti-spoofing algorithm specifically designed for light makeup faces, which includes a makeup augmentation module, a batch channel normalization module, a backbone network updated via the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) method, an asymmetric virtual triplet loss module, and a nearest neighbor supervised contrastive module. The experimental outcomes confirm that the proposed algorithm exhibits superior detection capabilities when handling light makeup faces."
"A 70-year-old man experienced an epileptic seizure. Subsequent MRI performed on close examination revealed high signal in the left occipital cortex on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery. Gadolinium contrast indicated enhancement along the cortex. 11C-Methionine PET/CT scan, performed to differentiate from a brain tumor, showed high uptake mainly along the left occipital lobe cortex. Spinal fluid examination revealed Cryptococcus neoformans, leading to a diagnosis of Cryptococcus meningoencephalitis."
"Spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies enable dissecting the tissue architecture in spatial context. To perceive the global contextual information of gene expression patterns in tissue, the spatial dependence of cells must be fully considered by integrating both local and non-local features by means of spatial-context-aware. However, the current ST integration algorithm ignores for ST dropouts, which impedes the spatial-aware of ST features, resulting in challenges in the accuracy and robustness of microenvironmental heterogeneity detecting, spatial domain clustering, and batch-effects correction. Here, we developed an STMGraph, a universal dual-view dynamic deep learning framework that combines dual-remask (MASK-REMASK) with dynamic graph attention model (DGAT) to exploit ST data outperforming pre-existing tools. The dual-remask mechanism masks the embeddings before encoding and decoding, establishing dual-decoding-view to share features mutually. DGAT leverages self-supervision to update graph linkage relationships from two distinct perspectives, thereby generating a comprehensive representation for each node. Systematic benchmarking against 10 state-of-the-art tools revealed that the STMGraph has the optimal performance with high accuracy and robustness on spatial domain clustering for the datasets of diverse ST platforms from multi- to sub-cellular resolutions. Furthermore, STMGraph aggregates ST information cross regions by dual-remask to realize the batch-effects correction implicitly, allowing for spatial domain clustering of ST multi-slices. STMGraph is platform independent and superior in spatial-context-aware to achieve microenvironmental heterogeneity detection, spatial domain clustering, batch-effects correction, and new biological discovery, and is therefore a desirable novel tool for diverse ST studies."
"In amblyopia, abnormal binocular interactions lead to an overwhelming dominance of one eye. One mechanism implied in this imbalance is the suppression between the inputs from the two eyes. This interocular suppression involves two components: an overlay suppression and a surround suppression. Here, we propose a new method for measuring surround suppression which has been demonstrated in both strabismic and anisometropic amblyopes, based on a novel interocular contrast scaling task, suitable for use as a clinical tool. We compare the results obtained with this method against those from another method designed to measure overlay suppression: the Dichoptic Letter Test. We find a strong correlation between the results obtained with the two methods. Additionally, we observe strong correlations between the imbalance measured with the two tests and visual acuity and stereopsis. Altogether this suggests that amblyopic suppression is spatially broad and has direct relevance in global vision. So our new method is a relevant, clinically suitable tool to track the disease state in amblyopia."
Post stroke hyperglycemia has been shown to deter functional recovery. Earlier findings have indicated the cap-dependent translation regulator 4E-BP1 is detrimentally upregulated in hyperglycemic conditions. The present study aims to test the hypothesis that hyperglycemic ischemic reperfusion injury (I/R) affects normal protein translation poststroke.

"Hypertension and tobacco smoking pose independent risks for cardiovascular diseases, but their association is unclear especially in Japanese. We investigated the impact of smoking status on the risk of new-onset hypertension in male and female Japanese workers. We evaluated 5439 subjects without hypertension who participated in medical check-ups in 2007-2018. The outcome was the development of hypertension (blood pressure ≥140/90 mmHg or initiation of antihypertensive drugs). Cox's proportional hazards models were used to assess the association between smoking status and the hypertension incidence. During the average 6.0-year follow-up, 1395 individuals (25.6%) developed hypertension. The crude incidence rates of hypertension (per 100 person-years) were: current non-smokers (n = 3033), 3.4; quitters (n = 445), 4.2; and sustained smokers (n = 1961), 5.7. The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio was 1.34 (1.20-1.50) for sustained smokers and 1.03 (0.86-1.24) for quitters compared to current non-smokers (P for trend <0.01). In stratified analyses, the risk of incident hypertension was significantly higher in the sustained smokers with lower blood pressure or without diabetes at baseline versus the current non-smokers. A significant risk reduction of hypertension development due to smoking cessation was revealed in the subjects with higher blood pressure levels at baseline or without body weight gain after smoking cessation. Smoking was an independent risk factor for incident hypertension. Smoking cessation reduced the risk of hypertension development compared to sustained smoking, especially among the subjects with higher blood pressure levels. Maintaining one's body weight after smoking cessation would also help prevent hypertension development."
"Ibiza (Eivissa) is one of the main Balearic Islands in the western Mediterranean. Recent studies have highlighted the genetic distinctiveness of present-day Eivissans within the region and suggested it could be attributed to the genetic drift caused by recent demographic events. Whether this distinctiveness emerged from a differential demographic history, or rather from a bias for sampling in a small geographic region such as Eivissa, remains an open question, together with the understanding of the functional consequences of demography in the island. In order to clarify these questions and further characterize the distinctiveness of Eivissa within the Balearic and Mediterranean context, we generated whole exome sequences for 31 and 20 individuals from Eivissa and Menorca respectively, a subset of which were also genotyped with the Human Origins array. Our results show that Eivissans present signs of putatively recent genetic isolation that are shared to a lesser extent with Menorca such as more and longer runs of homozygosity and high numbers of intra-population shared IBD segments. Regarding the functional consequences of recent demography, although Eivissans do not present an excess of deleterious alleles or homozygotes comparing to other populations, genetic drift seems to have increased the allele frequencies of neutral and deleterious variants, which can have various medical implications."
"Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) is one of the major pathogens responsible for severe foodborne infections, and the common serotypes include E. coli O157, O26, O45, O103, O111, O121, and O145. Vaccination has the potential to prevent STEC infections, but no licensed vaccines are available to provide protection against multiple STEC infections. In this study, we constructed an engineered S. Typhimurium to rapidly produce the outer membrane vesicle (OMV) with low endotoxic activity to deliver the O-antigen of E. coli. S. Typhimurium OMV (STmOMV), which displays mixed heterologous O-antigens, was systematically investigated in mice for immunogenicity and the ability to prevent wild-type STEC infection. Animal experiments demonstrated that STmOMV displaying both E. coli O111 and O157 O-antigens by intraperitoneal injection not only induced robust humoral immunity but also provided effective protection against wild-type E. coli O111 and O157 infection in mice, as well as long-lasting immunity. Meanwhile, the O-antigen polysaccharides of E. coli O26 and O45, and O145 and O103 were also mixedly exhibited on STmOMV as O-antigens of the O111 and O157 did. Three mixed STmOMVs were inoculated intraperitoneally to mice, and confer effective protection against six E. coli infections. The STmOMV developed in this study to display mixed heterologous O-antigens provides an innovative and improved strategy for the prevention of multiple STEC infections."
"Research on the consequences of experiencing intimate partner violence (IPV) has predominantly focused on specific physical and mental health outcomes and have emphasized the impacts for women. Fewer studies have comprehensively documented IPV impacts on other aspects of psychosocial well-being and examined effects for both women and men. A sample of 1133 veterans (52.3% women) completed two web-based surveys approximately one year apart. Women did not differ from men with respect to their odds of experiencing past year overall IPV (OR = 1.06, 95% CI [0.81, 1.38]) but were more likely to experience overall IPV prior to the past year (OR = 1.52, 95% CI [1.19, 1.95]). Gender-stratified multivariate regressions revealed that greater frequency of past year IPV experiences was associated with lower psychosocial well-being with respect to finances (β = -0.22, p < 0.001), health (β = -0.19, p < 0.001), intimate relationships (β = -0.14, p = 0.007), and broader social relationships (β = -0.17, p = 0.018), whereas greater frequency of IPV prior to the past year was associated with lower psychosocial well-being with respect to employment (β = -0.17, p = 0.002), finances (β = -0.14, p = 0.020), and health (β = -0.16, p = 0.012) among women. For men, nonsignificant associations were observed for all associations of IPV with psychosocial well-being outcomes. Results point to the importance of attending to broader aspects of psychosocial well-being that may represent modifiable intervention targets among women who have experienced IPV. Further research is needed to better understand the psychosocial well-being impacts of IPV for men."
"microRNAs (miRNAs) are active in various biological processes by mediating gene expression, and the full investigation of miRNA transcription is crucial for understanding the mechanisms underlying miRNA deregulation in pathological conditions. Here an updated TransmiR v3.0 database is presented with more comprehensive miRNA transcription regulation information, which contains 5095 transcription factor (TF) -miRNA regulations curated from 2285 papers and >6 million TF-miRNA regulations derived from ChIP-seq data. Currently, TransmiR v3.0 covers 3260 TFs, 4253 miRNAs and 514 433 TF-miRNA regulation pairs across 29 organisms. Additionally, motif scanning of TF loci on promoter sequences of miRNAs from multiple species is employed to predict TF-miRNA regulations, generating 284 527 predicted TF-miRNA regulations. Besides the significant growth of data volume, we also improve the annotations for TFs and miRNAs by introducing the TF family, TFBS motif, and expression profiles for several species. Moreover, the functionality of the TransmiR v3.0 online database is enhanced, including allowing batch search for flexible queries and offering more extensive disease-specific, as well as newly sex-specific TF-miRNA regulation networks in the 'Network' module. TransmiR v3.0 provides a useful resource for studying miRNA biogenesis regulation and can be freely accessed at http://www.cuilab.cn/transmir."
This research quantitatively explored the prevalence of NANDA-I nursing diagnoses related to the care of patients experiencing heart failure.
"Numerous host factors function as intrinsic antiviral effectors to attenuate viral replication. MARCH8 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that has been identified as a host restriction factor that inhibits the replication of various viruses. This study elucidated the mechanism by which MARCH8 restricts respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) replication through selective degradation of the viral small hydrophobic (SH) protein. We demonstrated that MARCH8 directly interacts with RSV-SH and catalyzes its ubiquitination at lysine 13, leading to SH degradation via the ubiquitin-lysosomal pathway. Functionally, MARCH8 expression enhances RSV-induced apoptosis through SH degradation, ultimately reducing viral titers. Conversely, an RSV strain harboring the SH-K13R mutation exhibited prolonged SH protein stability and attenuated apoptosis in infected cells, even in the presence of MARCH8. Targeted depletion of MARCH8 enhances cellular survival and potentially increases viral persistence. These findings demonstrate that MARCH8 promotes the early elimination of virus-infected cells by abrogating the anti-apoptotic function of SH, thereby reducing viral transmission. Our study provides novel insights into the interplay between host restriction factors and viral evasion strategies, potentially providing new therapeutic approaches for RSV infections."
"Epidemiological studies associate an increase in breast cancer risk, particularly triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), with lack of breastfeeding. This is more prevalent in African American women, with significantly lower rate of breastfeeding compared to Caucasian women. Prolonged breastfeeding leads to gradual involution (GI), whereas short-term or lack of breastfeeding leads to abrupt involution (AI) of the breast. Our previous study utilizing a murine model demonstrated precancerous changes, specifically hyperplasia, a non-obligate precursor of breast cancer in the mammary glands of AI mice. Here we investigated mechanisms during early events of AI that prompts precancerous changes in mouse mammary glands."

"Working memory plays an important role in cognitive science and is a basic process for learning. While working memory is limited in regard to capacity and duration, different cognitive tasks are designed to overcome these difficulties. This study investigated information flow during a novel visual working memory task in which participants respond to exaggerated and normal pictures. Ten healthy men (mean age 28.5 ± 4.57 years) participated in two stages of the encoding and retrieval tasks. The electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are recorded. Moreover, the adaptive directed transfer function (ADTF) method is used as a computational tool to investigate the dynamic process of visual working memory retrieval on the extracted event-related potentials (ERPs) from the EEG signal. Network connectivity and P300 sub-components (P3a, P3b, and LPC) are also extracted during visual working memory retrieval. Then, the nonparametric Wilcoxon test and five classifiers are applied to network properties for features selection and classification between exaggerated-old and normal-old pictures. The Z-values of Ge is more distinctive rather than other network properties. In terms of the machine learning approach, the accuracy, F1-score, and specificity of the k-nearest neighbors (KNN), classifiers are 81%, 77%, and 81%, respectively. KNN classifier ranked first compared with other classifiers. Furthermore, the results of in-degree/out-degree matrices show that the information flows continuously in the right hemisphere during the retrieval of exaggerated pictures, from P3a to P3b. During the retrieval of visual working memory, the networks associated with attentional processes show greater activation for exaggerated pictures compared to normal pictures. This suggests that the exaggerated pictures may have captured more attention and thus required greater cognitive resources for retrieval."
"Despite bold commitments to reduce anaemia, little change in prevalence was observed over the past decade. We aimed to generate subnational maps of anaemia among women of reproductive age (WRA), malaria transmission and hemoglobinopathies to identify priority areas but also explore their geographical overlap."
"Emerging evidence suggests that TGFβ1 can inhibit angiogenesis, contradicting the coexistence of active angiogenesis and high abundance of TGFβ1 in the tumor microenvironment. Here, we investigated how tumors overcome the antiangiogenic effect of TGFβ1. TGFβ1 treatment suppressed physiologic angiogenesis in chick chorioallantoic membrane and zebrafish models but did not affect angiogenesis in mouse hepatoma xenografts. The suppressive effect of TGFβ1 on angiogenesis was recovered in mouse xenografts by a hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α) inhibitor. In contrast, a HIF1α stabilizer abrogated angiogenesis in zebrafish, indicating that hypoxia may attenuate the antiangiogenic role of TGFβ1. Under normoxic conditions, TGFβ1 inhibited angiogenesis by upregulating antiangiogenic factor thrombospondin 1 (TSP1) in endothelial cells (EC) via TGFβ type I receptor (TGFβR1)-SMAD2/3 signaling. In a hypoxic microenvironment, HIF1α induced miR145 expression; miR145 abolished the inhibitory effect of TGFβ1 on angiogenesis by binding and repressing SMAD2/3 expression and subsequently reducing TSP1 levels in ECs. Primary ECs isolated from human hepatocellular carcinoma displayed increased miR145 and decreased SMAD3 and TSP1 compared with ECs from adjacent nontumor livers. The reduced SMAD3 or TSP1 in ECs was associated with increased angiogenesis in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues. Collectively, this study identified that TGFβ1-TGFβR1-SMAD2/3-TSP1 signaling in ECs inhibits angiogenesis. This inhibition can be circumvented by a hypoxia-HIF1α-miR145 axis, elucidating a mechanism by which hypoxia promotes angiogenesis. Significance: Suppression of angiogenesis by TGFβ1 is mediated by TSP1 upregulation in endothelial cells and abrogated by HIF1α-miR145 activity in the hypoxic tumor microenvironment, providing potential targets to remodel the tumor vasculature."
"Background Generalised lichen planus (GLP) is a chronic disease with an overall prevalence of 1% requiring longer treatment. Limited studies are available on GLP and its treatment in the literature, unlike oral lichen planus. Objectives To determine the best steroid-sparing treatment modality for GLP by comparing the efficacy, response, safety, side effects, and remission with azathioprine, dapsone, and narrowband UV-B (NB-UVB) along with their impact on itching severity and life quality. Methodology Open-label, prospective, comparative, interventional study on generalised lichen planus patients treated with systemic steroids along with one of three steroid-sparing modalities. Totally 90 patients were studied including 30 patients each who received azathioprine (Group A), dapsone (Group B), and narrow band UVB (NB-UVB) (Group C), respectively, for 16 weeks. Itch severity index (ISI) and Dermatology life quality Index (DLQI) were assessed at baseline and week 24. All patients received oral prednisolone until there was no more active disease. Response was assessed in terms of occurrence of new lesions, flattening of lesions, post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH), and grading of lesions two weeks once for 6 months followed by six months of follow-up after treatment completion. Results Females outnumbered males in all 3 groups. Mean patient ages (34, 38, and 34) and the presence of one or more co-morbidities (50%, 42.3%, 37.5%) in Groups A, B, and C, respectively, were comparable. ISI and DLQI improvement at 24 weeks were greatest with NB-UVB, followed by azathioprine and dapsone in that order; the differences in improvement between groups showed high statistical significance. At week 24, occurrence of new lesions (0%, 0%, 3.8%), flattening (100% - all groups), PIH (100% - all groups), grade 3 lesions i.e. poor response, resolution of 20-50% of lesions (7.1%, 11.5%, 0%), grade 2 lesions i.e. partial response, resolution of 50-90% of lesions (35.7%, 76.9%, 8.3%) and grade 1 lesions i.e. complete response, resolution of >90% lesions (57.1%, 11.5%, 91.3%) were noted in Groups A, B and C, respectively; the differences in the extent of resolution of lesions between the groups were highly significant statistically. Remission was seen in 100%, 76.9%, and 87.5% in Groups A, B, and C, respectively, after six months. Limitations The sample size was small. Only 3 treatment options were compared in this study but many more options have been used for lichen planus. Long term follow-up is required. Conclusions NB-UVB with oral steroids showed a better response in terms of improvement in DLQI, ISI, disease control, and side effects than azathioprine and dapsone. Azathioprine showed a faster response and more prolonged remission. Dapsone showed poor response with multiple side effects."

"Inhibition of mitochondrial pyruvate transport via the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) has shown beneficial effects in treating metabolic diseases, certain cancers, various forms of neurodegeneration, and hair loss. These benefits arise either from the direct inhibition of mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism or from the metabolic rewiring when pyruvate entry is inhibited. However, current MPC inhibitors are either nonspecific or possess poor pharmacokinetic properties. To address this, approximately 50 pyrazole-based MPC inhibitors were synthesized to explore the structure-activity relationship for MPC inhibition, evaluated through inhibition of mitochondrial pyruvate respiration. These inhibitors were designed with increased steric hindrance around electron-deficient double bonds, allowing for refined structural modifications that reduce their potential to act as Michael acceptors. Additionally, the new MPC inhibitors directly inhibited stellate cell activation, indicating their potential as therapeutic candidates for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). Unlike the thiazolidinedione class of MPC inhibitors, these compounds did not activate the nuclear receptor PPARγ. Molecular modeling was conducted to explore interactions between these novel inhibitors and the MPC complex. We have identified the chemical determinants critical for MPC inhibition and successfully developed novel inhibitors that are potent, specific and possess excellent physicochemical properties, high solubility, and outstanding metabolic stability in human liver microsomes."
"An increasing number of multicomponent workplace interventions are being developed to reduce sedentary time and promote physical activity among office workers. The Physical Activity at Work (PAW) trial was one of these interventions, but it yielded an inconclusive effect on sedentary time after 6 months, with a low uptake of movement breaks, the main intervention component."
"During inner ear semicircular canal morphogenesis in zebrafish, patterned canal-genesis zones express genes for extracellular matrix component synthesis. These include hyaluronan and the hyaluronan-binding chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan Versican, which are abundant in the matrices of many developing organs. Charged hyaluronate polymers play a key role in canal morphogenesis through osmotic swelling. However, the developmental factor(s) that pattern the synthesis of the matrix components and regulation of hyaluronate density and swelling are unknown. Here, we identify the transcription factor Lmx1b as a positive transcriptional regulator of hyaluronan, Versican, and chondroitin synthesis genes crucial for canal morphogenesis. We show that Versican regulates hyaluronan density through its protein core, whereas the charged chondroitin side chains contribute to the hydration of hyaluronate-containing extracellular matrices. Versican-tuned properties of hyaluronate matrices may be a broadly used mechanism in morphogenesis with important implications for understanding diseases in which these matrices are impaired, and for hydrogel engineering for tissue regeneration."
"Predeath grief conceptualizes complex feelings of loss experienced for someone who is still living and is linked to poor emotional well-being. The Road Less Travelled program aimed to help carers of people with rarer dementias identify and process predeath grief. This study evaluated the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness of this program."
"The patient was a 21-year-old man with a shadow on a chest roentgenogram taken during a medical checkup. According to blood testing, thoracoabdominal computed tomography, head magnetic resonance imaging, and lung tumor biopsy, we diagnosed a primary retroperitoneal germ cell tumor with multiple lung and brain metastases. Induction chemotherapy (4 courses of Bleomycin, Etoposide and Cisplatin) was started immediately. Because tumor markers remained elevated, salvage chemotherapy (4 courses of paclitaxel, ifosfamide cisplatin) was administered. Since the tumor markers remained elevated third-line chemotherapy was considered. However, because the tumor markers continued to decrease gradually and the tumor continued to shrink on imaging, expectant management was given. Three months later, the tumor markers turned negative, and retroperitoneal lymph node dissection and resection of lung metastases were performed. No cancer cells were found in any of the tissue samples. Careful monitoring after completion of chemotherapy may spare unnecessary chemotherapy."
"Recent genomic studies have allowed the subdivision of intracranial ependymomas into molecularly distinct groups with highly specific clinical features and outcomes. The majority of supratentorial ependymomas (ST-EPN) harbor ZFTA-RELA fusions which were designated, in general, as an intermediate risk tumor variant. However, molecular prognosticators within ST-EPN ZFTA-RELA have not been determined yet. Here, we performed methylation-based DNA profiling and transcriptome RNA sequencing analysis of 80 ST-EPN ZFTA-RELA investigating the clinical significance of various molecular patterns. The principal types of ZFTA-RELA fusions, based on breakpoint location, demonstrated no significant correlations with clinical outcomes. Multigene analysis disclosed 1892 survival-associated genes, and a metagene set of 100 genes subdivided ST-EPN ZFTA-RELA into favorable and unfavorable transcriptome subtypes composed of different cell subpopulations as detected by deconvolution analysis. BGN (biglycan) was identified as the top-ranked survival-associated gene and high BGN expression levels were associated with poor survival (Hazard Ratio 17.85 for PFS and 45.48 for OS; log-rank; p-value < 0.01). Furthermore, BGN immunopositivity was identified as a strong prognostic indicator of poor survival in ST-EPN, and this finding was confirmed in an independent validation set of 56 samples. Our results indicate that integrating BGN expression (at mRNA and/or protein level) into risk stratification models may improve ST-EPN ZFTA-RELA outcome prediction. Therefore, gene and/or protein expression analyses for this molecular marker could be adopted for ST-EPN ZFTA-RELA prognostication and may help assign patients to optimal therapies in prospective clinical trials."
"Available evidence from animal studies suggests that placental serotonin plays an important role in proper fetal development and programming by altering brain circuit formation, which later translates into altered abnormal adult behaviors. Several environmental stimuli, including stress and maternal inflammation, affect placental and, hence, fetal serotonin levels and thus may disturb fetal brain development. We investigated the effect of prenatal stress of varying intensities on the formation of adaptive behaviors in mouse offspring and the role of placental serotonin in these processes. Mild prenatal stress increased placental serotonin synthesis, whereas exposure to moderate stress decreased it. Prenatal stress of varying intensities also resulted in multidirectional changes in animal behavior in progeny, consistent with changes in serotonin levels in the placenta and fetal tissues. Mice exposed to mild prenatal stress showed higher sociality and exploratory activity, whereas, after moderate stress, in contrast, they avoided contact with other individuals of their species and had reduced exploratory activity, with no effect on locomotor activity. Thus, in mice, stressors of varying intensities during the critical period of intrauterine development can affect the synthesis of serotonin by the placenta and lead to multidirectional changes in animal behavior in postnatal life."
"Rubber accelerators are used in the vulcanization of rubber. However, rubber accelerators for example tetraethylthiuram disulfide (TETD) and zinc diethyldithiocarbamate (ZDEC) may cause contact allergy. Concomitant reactions between ZDEC and TETD have been observed in patients which could be explained by co- or cross-reactivity."
"Patients with liver cirrhosis who are candidates for liver transplantation must be evaluated both clinically and socially in order to obtain the optimal outcomes and avoid futile therapeutic measures. For the evaluation of the social aspects in these patients, no validated scale in Spanish is available. The SIPAT (Stanford Integrated Psychosocial Assessment for Transplantation) scale is an instrument that measures the social, family and psychological aspects in candidates for solid organ transplantation. The objective of this study is to adapt and validate an abbreviated version of the SIPAT scale in Spanish for patients with liver cirrhosis."
"In the present study, we sought to better understand how MSM make decisions about HIV disclosure when using hook-up apps/websites and how these decisions relate to condom use during app/website-facilitated sexual encounters. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 60 MSM (30% living with HIV) who had used hook-up apps and websites to meet sexual partners within the past three months. Results demonstrated a variety of approaches to HIV status disclosure. Some men reported usually discussing HIV status, but others discussed HIV status selectively (e.g., only when asked, when a relationship became more serious). Some men reported that listing one's status in a profile precluded the need to discuss it further. Others noted that leaving an HIV status blank ""hinted"" at their own or others' HIV positive or negative status. These approaches were closely linked to decisions about condom use. Many men reported serosorting based on inferences or assumptions about partners' HIV status. Together, results highlighted potential gaps in communication that can lead to faulty assumptions about HIV status and subsequent serodiscordant condomless sex and suggest that interventions that promote HIV status disclosure address these potential faulty assumptions."

"Endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) with M2 segment occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) is debatable. This study assessed the efficacy, safety, and functional outcomes of EVT in M2 occlusion patients, examining differences in outcomes based on the dominance of the occluded segment (DomM2 vs. Non-DomM2)."
"Leishmaniasis, caused by Leishmania protozoan parasites transmitted by Phlebotomine sand flies, is a significant public health concern in the Mediterranean basin. Effective monitoring of Leishmania-infected sand flies requires standardized tools for comparing their distribution and infection prevalence. Consistent quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) parameters and efficient DNA extraction protocols are crucial for reliable results over time and across regions. However, the absence of standardized technical recommendations for Leishmania DNA detection hinders effective surveillance. This study aimed to compare different DNA extraction protocols and conduct a qPCR-based External Quality Assessment (EQA) through a multicenter study involving nine reference laboratories, with a focus on optimizing Leishmania DNA detection in sand fly."
"The escalating costs of healthcare had prompted countries to undertake reforms, and in recent years China had focused on overhauling its outpatient healthcare system. China implemented the outpatient mutual-aid policy which had led to a change in the costs associated with outpatient treatment from being fully self-paid by the patient to being partially self-paid."
"Chronic tic disorder (CTD) is characterized by the presence of motor and/or phonic tics, and is often accompanied by comorbidities, where obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are the most predominant. The aim of this study was to investigate a correlation between comorbidities and variability of tics in children with CTD."
"Large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) exhibits striking clinical and molecular heterogeneity. New approaches have emerged to explore tumor heterogeneity and classify LBCL into biological categories. Consequently, the informational requirements from diagnostic samples to provide the necessary information have increased, but the adequacy of single-site biopsies to provide such information is largely unknown. Here we describe spatial and temporal intra-patient variations in the mutational landscape of paired biopsies."
"The role of imaging in acute pyelonephritis (APN) in the ED is poorly understood, with variability among clinical guidelines for when patients should be imaged, and the modality of imaging.

"A 54-year-old woman presented with a 55 × 64-mm tumor in the ovary with high [ 18 F]FDG uptake on [ 18 F]FDG PET/CT highly suggestive of ovarian cancer. Prior to surgery, the patient underwent [ 68 Ga]-Ga- fibroblast activation protein inhibitor (FAPI)-46 PET/CT, which revealed low [ 68 Ga]-Ga-FAPI-46 tumor uptake. Histopathology revealed a borderline ovarian tumor, which has low malignant potential and a 10-year survival rate greater than 93%. High [ 18 F]FDG uptake is considered a fair predictor of malignancy in adnexal tumors. The present case demonstrates the potential superiority of [ 68 Ga]-Ga-FAPI-46 PET/CT over [ 18 F]-FDG PET/CT in differentiating malignant adnexal tumors from borderline ovarian tumors."
"Micelles formed by bile salts in aqueous solution are important for the solubilization of hydrophobic molecules in the gastrointestinal tract. The molecular level information about the mechanism and driving forces for primary-to-secondary micelle transition is still missing. In the current study, the micelle formation of 50 mM solutions of taurodeoxycholate (TDC) is studied by atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. It is shown that primary micelles with an aggregation number of 8-10 emerge and persist within the first 50 ns. Then, they coalesce to form secondary micelles with an aggregation number of 19 molecules. This transition is governed by hydrophobic interactions, which significantly decrease the solvent-accessible surface area per molecule in the secondary micelles. The addition of monomers of the sodium salt of fatty acids (FAs), as agents aiding hydrophobic drug delivery, to secondary TDC micelles results in the co-existence of mixed FA-TDC and pure FA micelles. The studied saturated FAs, with chain lengths of C14:0 and C18:0, are incorporated into the micelle core, whereas TDC molecules position themselves around the FAs, forming a shell on the micelle surface. In contrast, the tails of the C18:1 unsaturated fatty acid mix homogeneously with TDC molecules throughout the entire micelle volume. The latter creates a very suitable medium for hosting hydrophobic molecules in the micelles containing unsaturated fatty acids."
"Neutrophils have a pivotal role in safeguarding the host against pathogens and facilitating tissue remodeling. They possess a large array of tools essential for executing these functions. Neutrophils have a critical role in cancer, where they are largely associated with negative clinical outcome and resistance to therapy. However, the specific role of neutrophils in cancer is complex and controversial, owing to their high functional diversity and acute sensitivity to the microenvironment. In this Perspective, we discuss the accumulated evidence that suggests that the functional diversity of neutrophils can be ascribed to two principal functional states, each with distinct characteristics: classically activated neutrophils and pathologically activated immunosuppressive myeloid-derived suppressor cells. We discuss how the antimicrobial factors in neutrophils can contribute to tumor progression and the fundamental mechanisms that govern the pathologically activated myeloid-derived suppressor cells. These functional states play divergent roles in cancer and thus require separate consideration in therapeutic targeting."
"Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) have malignant potential, and treatment varies according to risk. However, no specific protocols exist for preoperative assessment of the malignant potential of gastric GISTs (gGISTs). This study aimed to use machine learning (ML) to develop and validate clinically relevant preoperative models to predict the malignant potential of gGISTs."

"Endometriosis is a common yet morbid disease. Imaging plays an important role in diagnosis and treatment planning. Both ultrasound (US) and MRI are used to detect disease. We performed a literature review to assess whether one is superior. A total of 33 studies from the 4482 identified in the initial search were found to assess the efficacy of US and/or MRI in detecting pelvic endometriosis. Most studies were performed at centers with extensive experience with endometriosis, using dedicated US and MRI protocols. A wide range of sensitivities and specificities were reported, but overall weighted means of diagnostic statistics for US and MRI were similar. The choice of dedicated US versus dedicated MRI in the evaluation of endometriosis should therefore be based on the expertise in the region. The data also showed US had better accuracy than MRI for identifying the depth of wall invasion in bowel-wall disease, whereas MRI better depicted pelvic-wall and extraperitoneal disease than US. Routine US and MRI protocols performed worse than dedicated US and MRI protocols, which may account for delays in diagnoses. Clinical and research efforts directed at improving the sensitivity of routine imaging for diagnosing deep endometriosis could improve patient access to appropriate care."
Transpedicular screw (TPS) misplacement is still a nightmare for spine surgeons. Preoperative planning is one of the methods that a surgeon could use to minimize this complication. This study aims to compare the efficacy of three-dimensional (3D) and two-dimensional (2D) preoperative planning in posterior lumbar TPSs placement performed using the freehand technique.
"Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a multifaceted cytokine essential in many immune system processes and their regulation. It also plays a key role in hematopoiesis, and in triggering the acute phase reaction. IL-6 overproduction is critical in chronic inflammation associated with autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and contributes to cytokine storms in COVID-19 patients. Over 20 years ago, researchers proposed that IL-6, which is typically monomeric, can also form dimers via a domain-swap mechanism, with indirect evidence supporting their existence. The physiological significance of IL-6 dimers was shown in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia. However, no structures have been reported so far. Here, we present the crystal structure of an IL-6 domain-swapped dimer that computational approaches could not predict. The structure explains why the IL-6 dimer is antagonistic to the IL-6 monomer in signaling complex formation and provides insights for IL-6 targeted therapies."
"Lid retraction is one of the most common symptoms of Thyroid-Associated Ophthalmopathy (TAO), which potentially precipitates various complications, such as dry eyes, exposure keratopathy, and cosmetic concerns. Local corticosteroid injections, such as triamcinolone, have been proposed as a choice of treatment for TAO. This approach may be a favorable alternative for patients intolerant to the systemic effects of high-dose methylprednisolone. However, the efficacy of this intervention remains unestablished. Hence, our review aims to evaluate the efficacy of triamcinolone injection in reducing lid retraction."
"Understanding how genetic variants influence molecular phenotypes in different cellular contexts is crucial for elucidating the molecular and cellular mechanisms behind complex traits, which in turn has spurred significant advances in research into molecular quantitative trait locus (xQTL) at the cellular level. With the rapid proliferation of data, there is a critical need for a comprehensive and accessible platform to integrate this information. To meet this need, we developed xQTLatlas (http://www.hitxqtl.org.cn/), a database that provides a multi-omics genetic regulatory landscape at cellular resolution. xQTLatlas compiles xQTL summary statistics from 151 cell types and 339 cell states across 55 human tissues. It organizes these data into 20 xQTL types, based on four distinct discovery strategies, and spans 13 molecular phenotypes. Each entry in xQTLatlas is meticulously annotated with comprehensive metadata, including the origin of the tissue, cell type, cell state and the QTL discovery strategies utilized. Additionally, xQTLatlas features multiscale data exploration tools and a suite of interactive visualizations, facilitating in-depth analysis of cell-level xQTL. xQTLatlas provides a valuable resource for deepening our understanding of the impact of functional variants on molecular phenotypes in different cellular environments, thereby facilitating extensive research efforts."
Preventing uptake of nicotine products among youth remains a central objective of tobacco control policy. Comparing trends in the use of nicotine across countries provides an opportunity to identify emergent product trends and to evaluate 'natural experiments' in policies.
"Targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis with small-molecular inhibitors is a promising approach for immunotherapy. Here, we identify a natural pentacyclic triterpenoid, Pygenic Acid A (PA), as a PD-1 signaling inhibitor. PA exerts anti-tumor activity in hPD-1 knock-in C57BL/6 mice and enhances effector functions of T cells to promote immune responses by disrupting the PD-1 signaling transduction. Furthermore, we identify SHP-2 as the direct molecular target of PA for inhibiting the PD-1 signaling transduction. Subsequently, mechanistic studies suggest that PA binds to a new druggable site in the phosphorylated PD-1 ITSM recognition site of SHP-2, inhibiting the recruitment of SHP-2 by PD-1. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that PA has a potential application in cancer immunotherapy and occupying the phosphorylated ITSM recognition site of SHP-2 may serve as an alternative strategy to develop PD-1 signaling inhibitors. In addition, our success in target recognition provides a paradigm of target identification and confirmation for natural products."
"Neuron death is caused primarily by apoptosis after spinal cord injury (SCI). Autophagy, as a cellular response, can maintain cellular homeostasis to reduce apoptosis. We aimed to investigate the effect and the mechanism of vimentin knockdown on autophagy and neural recovery after SCI."
"Research into the mechanisms by which gravity influences spermatozoa has implications for maintaining the species in deep space exploration and may provide new approaches to reproductive technologies on Earth. Changes in the speed of mouse spermatozoa after 30 min exposure to simulated weightlessness (by 3D-clinostat) and 2 g hypergravity (by centrifugation) were studied using inhibitory analysis. Simulated microgravity after 30 min led to an increase in the speed of spermatozoa and against the background of an increase in the relative calcium content in the cytoplasm. This effect was prevented by the introduction of 6-(dimethylamino) purine, wortmannin, and calyculin A. Hypergravity led to a decrease in the speed of spermatozoa movement, which was prevented by sodium orthovanadate and calyculin A. At the same time, under microgravity conditions, there was a redistribution of proteins forming microfilament bundles between the membrane and cytoplasmic compartments and under hypergravity conditions-proteins forming networks. The obtained results indicate that even a short exposure of spermatozoa to altered gravity leads to the launch of mechanotransduction pathways in them and a change in motility."

"A series of novel derivatives of Poliacetylene Glycosides (PAGs) were synthesized, and their antiproliferative and antiviral properties were evaluated. Starting from D-(+)-glucose pentaacetate as a precursor, a commercially available and low-cost starting material, three different strategies were attempted to synthesize the new PAGs, and the desired compounds were obtained in high overall yields after only three steps. The synthesized PAGs exhibited antitumoral activity in concentrations ranging from 68-878 μM and antiviral activities in concentrations ranging from 71-794 μM. Some preliminary structure-activity relationships are also discussed."
"Categorizing breast neoplasia as ductal or lobular is a daily exercise that relies on a combination of histologic and immunohistochemical tools. The historically robust link between loss of the E-cadherin molecule and lobular neoplasia has rendered staining for E-cadherin by immunohistochemistry a staple of this diagnostic process. Unfortunately, discordances between E-cadherin expression and histomorphology, and variations in E-cadherin staining patterns and intensities abound in clinical practice, but are often neglected in favour of a binary interpretation of the E-cadherin result. In this article, we highlight the complexities of E-cadherin expression through a review of the E-cadherin protein and its associated gene (CDH1), the mechanisms leading to aberrant/absent E-cadherin expression, and the implications of these factors on the reliability of the E-cadherin immunohistochemical stain in the classification of ductal versus lobular mammary neoplasia."

"Next Generation Sequencing-based subtyping and interim- and end of treatment positron emission tomography (i/eot-PET) monitoring have high potential for upfront and on-treatment risk assessment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients. We performed Dana Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) and LymphGen genetic subtyping for the HOVON84 (n = 208, EudraCT-2006-005174-42) and PETAL (n = 204, EudraCT-2006-001641-33) trials retrospectively combined with DFCI genetic data (n = 304). For all R-CHOP treated patients (n = 592), C5/MCD- and C2/A53-subtypes show significantly worse outcome independent of the international prognostic index. For all subtypes, adverse prognostic value of i/eot-PET-positive status is confirmed. Consistent with frequent primary refractory disease, only 67% C2 patients become eot-PET-negative versus 81-88% for other subtypes. Indicative of high relapse rates, outcome of C5 i/eot-PET-negative patients remains significantly worse in HOVON-84, which trend validates in the PETAL and SAKK38-07 trials (NCT00544219). These results show the added value of integrated genetic subtyping and PET monitoring for prognostic stratification and subtype-specific trial design."
"Cardiac rehabilitation, a comprehensive exercise-based lifestyle and medical management, is effective in decreasing morbidity and improving life quality in patients with coronary heart disease. Endothelial function, an irreplaceable indicator in coronary heart disease progression, is measured by various methods in traditional cardiac rehabilitation pathways, including medicinal treatment, aerobic training, and smoking cessation. Nevertheless, studies on the effect of some emerging cardiac rehabilitation programs on endothelial function are limited. This article briefly reviewed the endothelium-beneficial effects of different cardiac rehabilitation pathways, including exercise training, lifestyle modification and psychological intervention in patients with coronary heart disease, and related experimental models, and summarized both uncovered and potential cellular and molecular mechanisms of the beneficial roles of various cardiac rehabilitation pathways on endothelial function. In exercise training and some lifestyle interventions, the enhanced bioavailability of nitric oxide, increased circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), and decreased oxidative stress are major contributors to preventing endothelial dysfunction in coronary heart disease. Moreover, the preservation of endothelial-dependent hyperpolarizing factors and inflammatory suppression play roles. On the one hand, to develop more endothelium-protective rehabilitation methods in coronary heart disease, adequately designed and sized randomized multicenter clinical trials should be advanced using standardized cardiac rehabilitation programs and existing assessment methods. On the other hand, additional studies using suitable experimental models are warranted to elucidate the relationship between some new interventions and endothelial protection in both macro- and microvasculature."
"Betulinic acid (BA) is a natural compound obtained from plant extracts and is known for its diverse pharmacological effects, including anti-tumor, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and anti-atherosclerotic properties. Its potential in anti-tumor therapy has garnered considerable attention, particularly for the treatment of breast, lung, and liver cancers. However, the clinical utility of BA is greatly hindered by its poor water solubility, low bioavailability, and off-target toxicity. To address these issues, researchers have developed various BA-loaded nanoformulations, such as nanoparticles, liposomes, micelles, and nanofibers, aiming to improve its solubility and bioavailability, prolong plasma half-life, and enhance targeting ability, thereby augmenting its anti-cancer efficacy. In preparing this review, we conducted extensive searches in well-known databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect, using keywords like ""betulinic acid"", ""nanoparticles"", ""drug delivery"", ""tumor"", and ""cancer"", covering the literature from 2014 to 2024. The review provides a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in the application of BA-loaded nano-delivery systems for anti-tumor therapy and offers insights into their future development prospects."

"Measuring social value has always been a challenge for organizations that generate such value, including foundations, NGOs, social enterprises, and governmental entities. Often, the benefits of these initiatives are perceived as intangible or long-term, making them difficult to quantify. Assessing social value demonstrates the impact of investments and accountability to stakeholders.Healthcare organizations should be evaluated from a broad perspective, where the quality of healthcare services is an integral part of the social value with multiple beneficiaries.This study aims to determine the economic and social impact of Hospital Santa Marina on the Bizkaia (Basque Country) population in 2023, as well as to evaluate the evolution of the hospital's social value from 2018 to 2023."
"The recent development of genetic lineage recorders, designed to register the genealogical history of cells using induced somatic mutations, has opened the possibility of reconstructing complete animal cell lineages. To reconstruct a cell lineage tree from a molecular recorder, it is crucial to use an appropriate reconstruction algorithm. Current approaches include algorithms specifically designed for cell lineage reconstruction and the repurposing of phylogenetic algorithms. These methods have, however, the same objective: to uncover the hierarchical relationships between cells and the sequence of cell divisions that have occurred during development. In this chapter, I will use the phylogenetic software FastTree to reconstruct a lineage tree, in a step-by-step manner, using data from a simulated CRISPR-Cas9 recorder. To ensure reproducibility, the code is presented as a Jupyter Notebook, available (together with the necessary input files) at https://github.com/irepansalvador/lineage_reconstruction_chapter ."

"High mortality and low response rates in lung cancer patients call for novel therapeutic targets. Data mining of whole-genome genetic dependency screens suggest Cell Division Cycle 40 (CDC40) to be an essential protein for lung cancer cell survival. We characterized CDC40 knockdown effects in multiple lung cancer cell lines, revealing induced cell cycle defects that resulted in strong growth inhibition and activation of apoptosis. Global transcriptional and splicing changes were also investigated, where CDC40 knockdown resulted in perturbation of splicing- and translation-related genes as well as more transcripts with intron retention. In the transcript of the cell cycle regulatory protein CDCA5, CDC40 knockdown was shown to induce retention of the first intron, leading to an increase in the unspliced CDCA5 transcript and subsequent decrease in CDCA5 protein expression. Additionally, protein-protein interactions of CDC40 were explored and spliceosome components were found to be its main binding partners, further highlighting the role of CDC40 in splicing. CDC40 mutation analysis suggests that it may be difficult to disrupt key interactions using small molecules within a large complex. Our results demonstrate that CDC40 is essential for lung cancer cell growth, and that its inhibition may represent a viable therapeutic strategy for lung cancer."

"Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) is a condition in which hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) acquire mutations seen in leukemia. While individuals with CH generally do not show signs of hematologic disease, the condition becomes more common with age and correlates with age-related diseases, especially cardiovascular disease (CVD). JAK2 mutations in HSCs can lead to CH and correlate with atherosclerosis, but the condition has been difficult to study because of challenges modeling the mutant cells at very low frequency. In this issue of the JCI, Liu et al. developed a low-allele-burden (LAB) mouse model in which a small number of bone marrow cells carrying the Jak2VF mutation were transplanted into mice predisposed to hyperlipidemia. Along with recapitulating features of plaque development, the authors identified the phagocytic receptors MERTK and TREM2 in WT cells as downstream of the inflammatory cytokine IL-1. These findings provide potential targets for preventing or treating patients at risk for CH-associated CVD."

Wnt信号通路分为经典通路和非经典通路，其对生物的发育、组织再生及细胞增殖等发挥着关键作用。散乱蛋白（dishevelled）作为Wnt/β-catenin信号通路的核心蛋白，可以促进经典Wnt通路的激活，调控Wnt通路的分支。新近研究发现散乱蛋白在消化系统肿瘤中异常表达。本文将对散乱蛋白在食管鳞状细胞癌、胃癌、结直肠癌中的表达、潜在作用机制及其病理意义进行综述，并探讨其在消化系统肿瘤中的诊断、治疗及预后价值。.
"The selection of information by individuals is a basic process in democratic institutions, including journalism. Publishers attempt to attract readers with ""curiosity gap"" headlines that offer vague descriptions rather than summarize an article. Lab and field experiments that compare the influence of these two styles have found conflicting results on their efficacy. In this registered report, we propose a theory, based on the psychology of curiosity, to harmonize these results. We introduce and validate an automated linear scale of headline concreteness to differentiate summary and curiosity gap headlines. In a meta-analysis of 8977 headline experiments, we confirm that the effects of headline concreteness on clickthrough rates vary with the overall concreteness of other headlines. When the baseline headline is too vague, higher headline concreteness increases clickthrough rates. When headlines are too concrete, higher headline concreteness decreases clickthrough rates. These findings suggest a curvilinear relationship between information selection decisions and the amount of information conveyed in text, implying that headlines that convey just the right amount of information maximize clickthrough rates at scale.

"ITK-SYK and TEL-SYK (also known as ETV6-SYK) are human tumor-causing chimeric proteins containing the kinase region of SYK, and the membrane-targeting, N-terminal, PH-TH domain-doublet of ITK or the dimerizing SAM-PNT domain of TEL, respectively. ITK-SYK causes peripheral T cell lymphoma, while TEL-SYK was reported in myelodysplastic syndrome. BTK is a kinase highly related to ITK and to further delineate the role of the N-terminus, we generated the corresponding fusion-kinase BTK-SYK. By generating and analyzing these fusion kinases, we aim to understand the contribution of N-terminal domains to their distinct cellular behavior and oncogenic properties. The fusion kinases were found to behave differently. TEL-SYK showed stronger oncogenic capacity when compared with ITK-SYK and BTK-SYK. Furthermore, ITK-SYK and BTK-SYK triggered IL-3-independent growth of BAF3 pro-B cells. In contrast to BTK-SYK and TEL-SYK, which predominantly localized in perinuclear region and cytoplasm respectively, ITK-SYK exhibits a more diverse cellular distribution, being present in the nucleus, cytoplasm and membrane-bound compartments. Notably, we observed that ITK-SYK undergoes activation-mediated nuclear translocation, a phenomenon that is uncommon among kinases. This unique feature of ITK-SYK is therefore of particular interest due to its potential connection to its transforming capability."
"People with opioid use disorder (OUD) are a vulnerable population who face unique risks of harm when participating in research. Despite a long-standing dialogue, written research codes of ethics, and institutional review board oversight for the conduct of ethical research in vulnerable populations, protections for study populations with OUD is rarely mentioned. Nurse practitioners who conduct research using participants with OUD, especially when recruiting their own patients (i.e., dual role), must be aware of the unique ethical considerations necessary to protect their patients and participants from increased risks. This article explores vulnerabilities and influences that can affect participant recruitment and consent, imbalances in the distribution of risk and benefits to participants participating in research, and the concerns of coercions, undue influence, and unjustifiable pressure contributing to vulnerabilities. Strategies to reduce the risks of influences that are of concern in the vulnerable population of research participants with opioid disorder are suggested. The goal of this article was to raise awareness of the unique potential risks of harm when using people with OUD as research participants and to explore strategies to minimize potential risks of various levels of influence in this vulnerable population."
"The orf virus is one of the parapoxviruses. It occurs worldwide and its natural reservoir are sheep and goats. Infections in humans can occur through direct or indirect contact with affected animals. The infectious ulcerations usually heal spontaneously after a few weeks in immunocompetent patients. An infection must be reported to the responsible professional association if the exposure occurs in the occupational environment, for example in farmers."
"Skeletal muscle relaxants have their place in everyday use in numerous anesthesiological procedures, such as preparing a patient for surgery, supporting mechanical ventilation, and performing effective intubation. These drugs can be divided, based on their mechanism of action, into depolarizing skeletal relaxants, such as succinylcholine, and non-depolarizing skeletal muscle relaxants. Non-depolarizing agents are further categorized, based on their structure, into steroidal (eg, rocuronium) and benzylisoquinoline (eg, atracurium) compounds. To gain better control over neuromuscular blockade and patient recovery, a group of drugs known as reversal agents was developed. The effectiveness of skeletal muscle relaxants can be influenced by factors such as acid-base imbalances, impaired metabolism, and excretion, due to kidney or liver dysfunction, age, and sex. Skeletal muscle relaxants have also been used in neurosurgical procedures. It is believed that these drugs do not cross the blood-brain barrier. By reducing intrathoracic pressure and central venous pressure, they can lower intracranial pressure. However, in some studies, an increase in intracranial pressure has been observed. Therefore, selecting the appropriate drug is crucial, particularly for patients with suspected or confirmed elevated intracranial pressure, which is defined as the pressure within the intracranial space relative to atmospheric pressure. Elevated intracranial pressure above normal levels can occur in various conditions, such as sinus thrombosis, aneurysm rupture, brain tumors, intraventricular hemorrhage, and meningitis.In this article, we aim to review the role of muscle relaxants and reversal agents in neurosurgical procedures."
"Antibody repertoire sequencing and display library screening are powerful approaches for antibody discovery and engineering that can connect DNA sequence with antibody function. Antibody display and screening studies have made a tremendous impact on immunology and biotechnology over the last decade, accelerated by technological advances in high-throughput DNA sequencing techniques. Indeed, bioinformatic analysis of antibody DNA library data has now taken a central role in modern antibody drug discovery, and is also critical for many ongoing studies of human immune development. Here, we describe current trends in antibody DNA library screening and analysis, and introduce a selection of protocols describing fundamental bioinformatic techniques to enable scientists to efficiently study antibody DNA libraries."
"Ovarian adenomyoma is a rare gynecological tumor with a high misdiagnosis rate, leading many patients to undergo unnecessary surgeries that may affect fertility. Menstrual abdominal pain is the most common symptom, and auxiliary examinations often cannot clarify its nature. It often relies on intraoperative diagnosis, and surgical resection can achieve good therapeutic effects."
"Despite an emphasis on the prognostic impact of serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) at diagnosis in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), whether the prognostic impact of elevated sIL-2R is linear remains unclear. To verify the presence of a non-linear association between sIL-2R level at diagnosis and overall survival (OS) in patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL, we conducted a multi-center, observational retrospective study. Among 488 analyzable patients, Cox proportional hazards modeling identified serum sIL-2R level at diagnosis as an independent predictor of OS. Multivariate Cox hazard modeling with restricted cubic spline model demonstrated that the relationship between serum sIL-2R level and OS was clearly non-linear (P for effect of sIL-2R = 0.002; P for non-linearity = 0.015). Mortality risk increased gradually as sIL-2R levels increased and plateaued at approximately 5,000 U/mL. Segmented regression analysis revealed that the trend in negative prognostic impact from a gradual increase in serum sIL-2R level changed significantly, with a breakpoint at approximately 2,000 U/mL. Multivariate receiver operating characteristic curves showed a significant improvement in prediction ability when serum sIL-2R level was added to the International Prognostic Index (IPI). Serum sIL-2R level at diagnosis was not only a prognostic factor, but also improved predictive accuracy for OS when incorporated with the IPI. However, the negative correlation between increasing sIL-2R and prognosis was non-linear."

"Continuous respiration monitoring is an important tool in assessing the patient's health and diagnosing pulmonary, cardiovascular, and sleep-related breathing disorders. Various techniques and devices, both contact and contactless, can be used to monitor respiration. Each of these techniques can provide different types of information with varying accuracy. Thermal cameras have become a focal point in research due to their contactless nature, affordability, and the type of data they provide, i.e., information on respiration motion and respiration flow. Several studies have demonstrated the feasibility of this technology and developed robust algorithms to extract important information from thermal camera videos. This paper describes the current state-of-the-art in respiration monitoring using thermal cameras, dividing the system into acquiring data, defining and tracking the region of interest, and extracting the breathing signal and respiration rate. The approaches taken to address the various challenges, the limitations of these methods, and possible applications are discussed."
"Spatial omics technologies have enabled the creation of intricate spatial maps that capture molecular features and tissue morphology, providing valuable insights into the spatial associations and functional organization of tissues. Accurate annotation of spot or domain types is essential for downstream spatial omics analyses, but this remains challenging. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a manually curated spatial omics database (SpatialRef, https://bio.liclab.net/spatialref/), to provide comprehensive and high-quality spatial omics data with known spot labels across multiple species. The current version of SpatialRef aggregates >9 million manually annotated spots across 17 Human, Mouse and Drosophila tissue types through extensive review and strict quality control, covering multiple spatial sequencing technologies and >400 spot/domain types from original studies. Furthermore, SpatialRef supports various spatial omics analyses about known spot types, including differentially expressed genes, spatially variable genes, Gene Ontology (GO)/KEGG annotation, spatial communication and spatial trajectories. With a user-friendly interface, SpatialRef facilitates querying, browsing and visualizing, thereby aiding in elucidating the functional relevance of spatial domains within the tissue and uncovering potential biological effects."
"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) represent recently discovered novel regulatory non-coding RNAs. While they are present in many eukaryotes, there has been limited research on plant circRNAs. We developed PlantCircRNA (https://plant.deepbiology.cn/PlantCircRNA/) to fill this gap. The two most important features of PlantCircRNA are (i) it incorporates circRNAs from 94 plant species based on 39 245 RNA-sequencing samples and (ii) it imports the original AtCircDB and CropCircDB databases. We manually curated all circRNAs from published articles, and imported them into the database. Furthermore, we added detailed information of tissue as well as abiotic stresses to the database. To help users understand these circRNAs, the database includes a detection score to measure their consistency and a naming system following the guidelines recently proposed for eukaryotes. Finally, we developed a comprehensive platform for users to visualize, analyze, and download data regarding specific circRNAs. This resource will serve as a home for plant circRNAs and provide the community with unprecedented insights into these mysterious molecule."
"Caused by both eukaryotic dinoflagellates and prokaryotic cyanobacteria, harmful algal blooms are events of severe ecological, economic, and public health consequence, and their incidence has become more common of late. Despite coordinated research efforts to identify and characterize the genomes of harmful algal bloom-causing organisms, the genomic basis and evolutionary origins of paralytic shellfish toxins produced by harmful algal blooms remain at best incomplete. The paralytic shellfish toxin saxitoxin has an especially complex genomic architecture and enigmatic phylogenetic distribution, spanning dinoflagellates and multiple cyanobacterial genera. Using filtration and extraction techniques to target the desired cyanobacteria from nonaxenic culture, coupled with a combination of short- and long-read sequencing, we generated a reference-quality hybrid genome assembly for Heteroscytonema crispum UTEX LB 1556, a freshwater, paralytic shellfish toxin-producing cyanobacterium thought to have the largest known genome in its phylum. We report a complete, novel biosynthetic gene cluster for the paralytic shellfish toxin saxitoxin. Leveraging this biosynthetic gene cluster, we find support for the hypothesis that paralytic shellfish toxin production has appeared in divergent Cyanobacteria lineages through widespread and repeated horizontal gene transfer. This work demonstrates the utility of long-read sequencing and metagenomic assembly toward advancing our understanding of paralytic shellfish toxin biosynthetic gene cluster diversity and suggests a mechanism for the origin of paralytic shellfish toxin biosynthetic genes."
"Submacular haemorrhage (SMH) is an emergency, and the most important immediate action in the treatment of SMH is the early displacement or evacuation of subretinal heme from below the fovea, followed by simultaneous or sequential treatment of the underlying cause. Photoreceptor damage can occur immediately after the onset of SMH for a variety of reasons, including toxins released from the blood, the diffusion barrier created by the blood for oxygen delivery and nutrition to the outer retinal layers, and shearing forces on the outer retinal layers, resulting in permanent visual deterioration. A clinician's decision to treat SMH is influenced by a number of factors, including presenting visual acuity, duration of visual symptoms, SMH aetiology and characteristics, availability of intraocular gases and tissue plasminogen activator, and pars plana vitrectomy facilities. For many clinicians, the duration of visual symptoms is the most important and first consideration when planning SMH treatment. Very little emphasis is given to the SMH's imaging characteristics. Currently, there are several treatment options for SMH removal. There is a need to develop a simplified treatment algorithm for SMH that is less reliant on the patient's visual complaints, considers heme characteristics on basic retinal imaging, and has the potential to achieve uniform and predictable treatment outcomes in real-world situations. In this short article, we discuss the various factors that can assist clinicians in the management of SMH and present a simplified treatment algorithm based on the SMH's retinal imaging characteristics."

"Cholecystitis presents significant treatment challenges, especially in elderly patients with high surgical or anesthetic risks. While cholecystectomy remains the standard intervention, its feasibility is sometimes limited, leading to reliance on cholecystostomy, which has a high recurrence rate and does not address the underlying cause. The aim was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of chemical gallbladder ablation as a minimally invasive treatment option for acute cholecystitis in elderly and comorbid patients."
"Mitochondrial dysfunction is implicated in the pathogenesis of the neurological condition autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay (ARSACS), yet precisely how the mitochondrial metabolism is affected is unknown. Thus, to better understand changes in the mitochondrial metabolism caused by loss of the sacsin protein (encoded by the SACS gene, which is mutated in ARSACS), we performed mass spectrometry-based tracer analysis, with both glucose- and glutamine-traced carbon. Comparing the metabolite profiles between wild-type and sacsin-knockout cell lines revealed increased reliance on aerobic glycolysis in sacsin-deficient cells, as evidenced by the increase in lactate and reduction of glucose. Moreover, sacsin knockout cells differentiated towards a neuronal phenotype had increased levels of tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolites relative to the controls. We also observed disruption in the glutaminolysis pathway in differentiated and undifferentiated cells in the absence of sacsin. In conclusion, this work demonstrates consequences for cellular metabolism associated with a loss of sacsin, which may be relevant to ARSACS."
"Late side effects of head and neck cancer treatment commonly affect swallowing function. Late radiation-associated dysphagia (late-RAD) often presents years post-treatment when patients have been discharged from their multidisciplinary team. Timely symptom management may provide important physical and emotional support, potentially reducing the overall healthcare burden. Speech and language therapists (SLTs) are key in the assessment and management of dysphagia but there is no current guidance in the late-RAD setting."
"During the COVID-19 pandemic, major events with immune-modulating effects at population-level included COVID-19 infection, lockdowns, and mass vaccinations campaigns. As immune responses influence many immune-mediated diseases, population scale immunological changes may have broad consequences."
"In cell line perturbation experiments, a collection of cells is perturbed with external agents and responses such as protein expression measured. Due to cost constraints, only a small fraction of all possible perturbations can be tested in vitro. This has led to the development of computational models that can predict cellular responses to perturbations in silico. A central challenge for these models is to predict the effect of new, previously untested perturbations that were not used in the training data. Here we propose causal structural equations for modeling how perturbations effect cells. From this model, we derive two estimators for predicting responses: a Linear Regression (LR) estimator and a causal structure learning estimator that we term Causal Structure Regression (CSR). The CSR estimator requires more assumptions than LR, but can predict the effects of drugs that were not applied in the training data. Next we present Cellbox, a recently proposed system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) based model that obtained the best prediction performance on a Melanoma cell line perturbation data set (Yuan et al. in Cell Syst 12:128-140, 2021). We derive analytic results that show a close connection between CSR and Cellbox, providing a new causal interpretation for the Cellbox model. We compare LR and CSR/Cellbox in simulations, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches. Finally we compare the performance of LR and CSR/Cellbox on the benchmark Melanoma data set. We find that the LR model has comparable or slightly better performance than Cellbox."
"Gliomas are a major cause of cancer-related death among children, adolescents, and young adults (age 0-40 years). Primary mismatch repair deficiency (MMRD) is a pan-cancer mechanism with unique biology and therapeutic opportunities.

"This experiment aimed to evaluate the beneficial and toxic properties of synthetic zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) on the liver of normal and high-fat diet (HFD) fed-rats. The ZnO NPs were synthesized and, its characterizations were determined by different techniques. Effect of ZnO NP on cell viability, liver enzymes and lipid accumulation were measured in HepG2 cells after 24 h. After that, rats orally received various dosages of ZnO NPs for period of 4 weeks. Toxicity tests were done to determine the appropriate dose. In the subsequent step, the hepatoprotective effects of 5 mg/kg ZnO NPs were determined in HFD-fed rats (experiment 2). The oxidative stress, NLRP3 inflammasome, inflammatory, and apoptosis pathways were measured. Additionally, the activity of caspase 3, nitric oxide levels, antioxidant capacity, and various biochemical factors were measured. Morphological changes in the rat livers were also evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) and Masson trichrome. Liver apoptosis rate was also approved by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay. Treatment of animals with 5 mg/ZnO NPs revealed potential hepatoprotective properties, while ZnO NPs at the doses of above 10 mg/kg showed toxic effects. Antioxidant enzyme gene expression and activity were significantly augmented, while apoptosis, NLRP3 inflammasome, and inflammation pathways were significantly reduced by 5 mg/kg ZnO NPs. Liver histopathological alterations were restored by 5 mg/kg ZnO NPs in HFD. Our study highlights the hepatoprotective effects of ZnO NPs against the HFD-induced liver damage, involving antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic pathways, indicating their promising therapeutic potential."
"Lnc-CHAF1B-2, a newly discovered long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), plays a significant role in the evolution and prognosis of diverse neoplasms. However, its role in the development of gastric cancer is not yet fully understood. Using bioinformatics analysis of gastric cancer RNA-seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, we investigated the expression of lnc-CHAF1B-2 in gastric carcinoma and its associated molecular signalling pathways. Verification through an array of in vivo and in vitro experiments-namely, EdU incorporation, flow cytometry, trans-well migration and invasion assays, subcutaneous tumour formation in nude mice, and western blot analysis-was conducted. We revealed notable upregulation of lnc-CHAF1B-2 in gastric cancer tissues. Furthermore, a positive correlation was detected between lnc-CHAF1B-2 levels and the occurrence of distant metastases in patients, which was inversely related to their prognostic outlook and survival rates. Moreover, our findings confirmed that lnc-CHAF1B-2 enhanced the proliferation, invasion, and migration of gastric cancer cells while inhibiting apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, lnc-CHAF1B-2 promoted the progression of gastric cancer through activating the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway. Thus, lnc-CHAF1B-2 and its regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway have emerged as prospective therapeutic targets in gastric cancer management."
"The incidence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) is increasing in Spain. Suppurative STIs are one of the most frequent reasons for consultation in specialized centers. The reason for suppurative STIs is multiple and their empirical treatment varies with the currently growing problem of antimicrobial resistance. Dermatologists are trained and prepared to treat these diseases, but their correct management requires active knowledge of national and international guidelines. The present document updates, reviews and summarizes the main expert recommendations on the management and treatment of these STIs."
"Aquaculture, a cornerstone of global food production, confronts myriad challenges including disease outbreaks and environmental degradation. Achieving nutritionally balanced aquafeed is critical for sustainable production, prompting exploration into innovative solutions like selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs). SeNPs offer potent antimicrobial, antioxidant, and growth-promoting properties, bolstering gut immunity and digestive capacity in aquatic animals. Their high bioavailability and ability to traverse gut barriers make them promising candidates for aquafeed supplementation. This study investigates SeNPs as a cutting-edge solution to enhance nutrient supply in aquaculture, addressing key challenges while promoting environmental stewardship and food security. By synthesizing current research and highlighting future directions, this review provides valuable insights into sustainable aquaculture practices. SeNPs hold promise for revolutionizing aquaculture feed formulations, offering a pathway to improved production outcomes and environmental sustainability."
"Asthma is the most common chronic medical condition among children ≥5 years of age with invasive pneumococcal disease. How asthma or its management affects pneumococcal colonization is not fully understood. Our objective was to compare pneumococcal colonization rates between children with persistent asthma and children without asthma, and to characterize the pneumococcal serotype distribution."
"Zone 2 anastomosis with total cervical branch reconstruction for acute type A aortic dissection and aortic arch aneurysms became possible after stent-graft introduction. This may be an easier procedure and reduce the risk of recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the outcomes between Zone 2 and Zone 3 distal anastomoses."

Postoperative delirium (POD) is a common and serious complication after surgery. It is associated with postoperative neurocognitive disorder (PNCD). The vagal cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP) has been hypothesized to play a role in POD/PNCD and may be a target for interventions such as transcutaneous auricular stimulation (taVNS). We aim to review associations of heart rate variability (HRV) as an indicator of vagal function with POD and postoperative immune reaction as well as taVNS as a potential preventive intervention for POD.
"Patients with glomerular disease are at high risk of cardiovascular disease but the contribution of immunosuppression to this risk is unclear. In this retrospective cohort study of 1912 patients (comprised of 759 with IgA nephropathy, 540 with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, 387 with membranous nephropathy and 226 with minimal change disease) from British Columbia, Canada, we evaluated the association between exposure to specific immunosuppressive medications and a composite outcome including coronary artery, cerebrovascular and peripheral arterial events. Survival models were adjusted for baseline cardiovascular risk factors, type of glomerular disease, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and proteinuria over time. During a median follow-up of 6.8 years, 212 patients (11.1%) experienced the primary outcome. Corticosteroid exposure was not significantly associated with the primary outcome after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors. In fully adjusted models, cumulative calcineurin inhibitor exposure at modest (150-300 defined daily doses [DDD]) and higher (300 or more DDD) doses were associated with a 2-fold higher risk of cardiovascular events (hazard ratio 2.98, 95% confidence interval 1.27-6.95) and (2.78, 1.32-5.84), respectively. A peak daily dose of antimetabolite (azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil and mycophenolate sodium) of 0.5 or more DDD was associated with higher risk of cardiovascular events after adjustment for baseline risk factors and type of glomerular disease, but not after adjusting for time-varying eGFR and proteinuria (1.70, 0.91-3.20). Each 10 grams of cumulative cyclophosphamide exposure was associated with a 1.5-fold higher risk of cardiovascular events in a fully adjusted model (1.46, 1.22-1.75) Thus, our findings suggest that immunosuppressive therapies used in the treatment of glomerular disease may have different cardiovascular risk profiles, which should be considered when deciding on immunosuppression for individual patients and as a safety endpoint in future clinical trials."
"Family physicians play a crucial role in healthcare delivery systems worldwide. In Iran, the family physician program has been introduced in only two provinces, with its expansion to other regions currently stalled due to various challenges. This study aims to identify the barriers and challenges hindering the effective implementation of the family physician program in urban areas of Iran."
"Reproduction by perennial plants varies from being relatively constant over years to the production of massive and synchronous seed crops at irregular intervals, a reproductive strategy called mast seeding. The sources of interspecific differences in the extent of interannual variation in seed production are largely unknown. We conducted a global meta-analysis of animal-dispersed species to quantify how the interannual variability in seed crops produced by plants can be explained by the seed mass, dispersal mode, phylogeny, and climate. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the interannual variations in seed production and seed mass tended to be similar in related species due to their shared evolution. The interannual variation in seed production was 1.22 times higher in synzoochorous species dispersed by scatter-hoarders compared with endozoochorous species dispersed by frugivores. Furthermore, the production of small seeds was associated with higher interannual variation in seed production, although synzoochorous species produced larger seeds than endozoochorous species. Precipitation rather than temperature had a significant positive effect on the interannual variation in seed production. The seed mass and dispersal mode contributed more to the interannual variation in seed production than phylogeny, climate, and fruit type. Our findings support a long-standing hypothesis that interspecific variation in the masting intensity is largely shaped by interactions between plants and animals."
"In infants and children, postoperative respiratory complications are leading causes of perioperative morbidity, mortality, and increased healthcare utilisation. We aimed to develop a novel score for prediction of postoperative respiratory complications in paediatric patients (SPORC for children)."
"The utilization of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in complex thoracic surgery has become more frequent in recent years due to advances in technology, increased availability, and improved outcomes. ECMO has emerged as a vital tool to facilitate thoracic surgery for patients who would have otherwise been deemed unsuitable candidates. It has redefined the boundaries of surgical possibility where conventional methods fall short. ECMO is typically employed in specific thoracic surgery where conventional ventilation is either inadequate or it interferes with the surgical field, and in procedures demanding both ventilatory and hemodynamic support."
"Physical activity plays a fundamental role in human health and disease. Exercise has been shown to improve a wide variety of disease states, and the scientific community is committed to understanding the precise molecular mechanisms that underlie the exquisite benefits. This review provides an overview of molecular responses to acute exercise and chronic training, particularly energy mobilization and generation, structural adaptation, inflammation, and immune regulation. Furthermore, it offers a detailed discussion of known molecular signals and systemic regulators activated during various forms of exercise and their role in orchestrating health benefits. Critically, the increasing use of multiomic technologies is explored with an emphasis on how multiomic and multitissue studies contribute to a more profound understanding of exercise biology. These data inform anticipated future advancement in the field and highlight the prospect of integrating exercise with pharmacology for personalized disease prevention and treatment."
"One of the most debatable phlebology community's issue is the choice of the optimal tactics for endovenous varicose tributaries correction after truncal ablation. Which tactic will be most effective? There is practically no data concerning treatment tactics' choice for varicose tributary depending on its diameter. Therefore, the comparison of staged versus one-stage treatment of varicose veins is relevant problem in modern phlebology. Research on this topic will make possible determination of advantages and potential disadvantages of the proposed tactics."
"Animal models of nerve injury are important for studying nerve injury and repair, particularly for interventions that cannot be studied in humans. However, the vast majority of gait analysis in animals has been limited to univariate analysis even though gait data is highly multi-dimensional. As a result, little is known about how various spatiotemporal components of the gait relate to each other in the context of peripheral nerve injury and trauma. We hypothesize that a multivariate characterization of gait will reveal relationships among spatiotemporal components of gait with biological relevance to peripheral nerve injury and trauma. We further hypothesize that legitimate relationships among said components will allow for more accurate classification among distinct gait phenotypes than if attempted with univariate analysis alone."
"Severe disruption of lipid metabolism in vivo is one of the central mechanisms in the development of atherosclerotic vascular injury (AVI). Reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) plays a pivotal role in eliminating excess cholesterol, preventing lipid deposition in the aorta, and reducing plaque formation associated with AVI. Floralozone (FL) reduces endothelial cell injury in AVI rats by regulating sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) expression. However, FL's potential to prevent AVI by modulating cholesterol metabolism remains unknown."
People experiencing homelessness suffer from deficient access to health care and disproportionately poor health outcomes. The American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN) maintains learning competencies for prelicensure nursing students. Shelters are rich environments for students to garner experiences with the inequities plaguing our health care system and to fulfill AACN competencies.
"Animal cells build actin-based surface protrusions to enable diverse biological activities, ranging from cell motility to mechanosensation to solute uptake. Long-standing models of protrusion growth suggest that actin filament polymerization provides the primary mechanical force for ""pushing"" the plasma membrane outward at the distal tip. Expanding on these actin-centric models, our recent studies used a chemically inducible system to establish that plasma membrane-bound myosin motors, which are abundant in protrusions and accumulate at the distal tips, can also power robust filopodial growth. How protrusion resident myosins coordinate with actin polymerization to drive elongation remains unclear, in part because the number of force generators and thus, the scale of their mechanical contributions remain undefined. To address this gap, we leveraged the SunTag system to count membrane-bound myosin motors in actively growing filopodia. Using this approach, we found that the number of myosins is log-normally distributed with a mean of 12.0 ± 2.5 motors [GeoMean ± GeoSD] per filopodium. Together with unitary force values and duty ratio estimates derived from biophysical studies for the motor used in these experiments, we calculate that a distal tip population of myosins could generate a time averaged force of ∼tens of pN to elongate filopodia. This range is comparable to the expected force production of actin polymerization in this system, a point that necessitates revision of popular physical models for protrusion growth."
Vepdegestrant (ARV-471) is an oral PROteolysis TArgeting Chimera (PROTAC) estrogen receptor (ER) degrader.
"Ribosomes are responsible for the synthesis of proteins, the major component of cellular biomass. Classical experiments have established a linear relationship between the fraction of resources invested in ribosomal proteins and the rate of balanced growth of a microbial population. Very little is known, however, about how the investment in ribosomes varies over individual cells in a population. We therefore extended the study of ribosomal resource allocation from populations to single cells, using a combination of time-lapse fluorescence microscopy and statistical inference. We found a large variability of ribosome concentrations and growth rates in conditions of balanced growth of the model bacterium Escherichia coli in a given medium, which cannot be accounted for by the population-level growth law. A large variability in the allocation of resources to ribosomes was also found during the transition of the bacteria from a poor to a rich growth medium. While some cells immediately adapt their ribosome synthesis rate to the new environment, others do so only gradually. Our results thus reveal a range of strategies for investing resources in the molecular machines at the heart of cellular self-replication. This raises the fundamental question whether the observed variability is an intrinsic consequence of the stochastic nature of the underlying biochemical processes or whether it improves the fitness of Escherichia coli in its natural environment."
"Sorghum anthracnose is one of the major diseases that have negative impacts on sorghum production in Ethiopia. This study was conducted to evaluate the resistance response of sorghum genotypes against sorghum anthracnose and to determine yield performances of sorghum genotypes under field conditions in two consecutive cropping years. Forty-nine sorghum genotypes were tested for their reactions to anthracnose in the East and West Hararghe Zones, East Ethiopia, during the 2017 and 2018 main cropping seasons. The design of the experiment was laid out in triple lattice square design with three replications. Anthracnose severity was assessed on 16 randomly selected and pre-tagged sorghum plants in the middle two rows of each plot. The eight subsequent times of severity assessments were used to evaluate the response of the genotypes to sorghum anthracnose. The ranges of the mean severity of anthracnose in 2017 and 2018 were 35 to 91% and 38 to 93%, respectively. In 2017 and 2018, the area under disease progress curve varied from 1744 to 3865% of days and from 2354 to 4908% of days, respectively. During the two growing seasons, the genotype ETSL 101469 displayed the highest anthracnose severity, followed by BTX-623. In both experimental years, anthracnose had very strong negative relationships with grain yield and thousand seed weight. The current study demonstrated how Ethiopian sorghum genotypes affect anthracnose development in the field conditions. Throughout the two experimental years, the sorghum genotypes ETSL 100335, ETSL 100395, ETSL 10474, ETSL 100523, ETSL 100498, ETSL 100989, ETSL 100597, and ETSL 101000 continuously exhibited lower disease levels than the other genotypes. Therefore, it is advised to use these genotypes as alternate sources of sorghum anthracnose resistance. Nonetheless, further research across location is necessary to validate their anthracnose resistance in a variety of agro-ecologies."
"Hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) is an established treatment for patients with unresectable colorectal liver metastases (uCRLM). Until recently, HAI was only performed at a limited number of centers.

"Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a severe disease with a grim prognosis. This study aims to investigate the potential role of albumin to urea nitrogen ratio (AUR) as a predictor of 30-day mortality in adult HLH patients. This retrospective analysis involved patients admitted to the hospital with a first-time diagnosis of HLH between January 2015 and September 2021. The primary outcome was defined as 30-day all-cause mortality. Patients were categorized as survivors and non-survivors, as well as test and validation cohorts. Clinical signs and laboratory biomarkers on admission were picked up. A total of 467 patients were included in the study, with a 30-day mortality rate of 31.0% (n = 145). There were no significant differences observed between the test and validation cohorts. Surviving patients exhibited significantly higher levels of AUR. Multivariate analysis indicated that an AUR < 3.40 was deemed to be an independent risk factor (test cohort: HR: 3.663, P < 0.001; validation cohort: 2.475, P = 0.013; total cohort: 2.976, P < 0.001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values were 0.734 in the test cohort, 0.690 in the validation cohort, and 0.711 in the total cohort. AUR emerged as an independent and reliable risk indicator for 30-day mortality in adults with HLH, offering clinicians a tool to identify high-risk patients efficiently."
"The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the IGRA, TST, and TBST by combining diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) analysis and network meta-analysis (NMA) to increase the reliability and accuracy of diagnostic methods and promote the eradication of TB. An electronic search of the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases was conducted, from the date of establishment to September 30, 2024. Data were synthesized with frequentist random-effects network meta-analyses, a single-group rate meta-analysis algorithm, and a bivariate mixed-effects logistic regression model. Summarized receiver operating characteristic curves and Fagan nomograms were used to assess diagnostic accuracy and clinical utility. Deeks' funnel plots and the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 tools were used to assess publication bias and risk of bias. Sources of heterogeneity were investigated using subgroup analyses. Forty-nine studies were identified. The diagnostic performance of the three diagnostic methods for TB infection is summarized as follows: the pooled sensitivity was 77.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.69-0.856), and the pooled specificity was 80.3% (95% CI, 0.75-0.86). The sensitivity and specificity of the IGRA were 82.1% (95% CI, 0.78-0.86) and 81.1% (95% CI, 0.75-0.86), respectively, both higher than the TST. However, the TBST exhibited the highest specificity, at 98.5% (95% CI, 0.96-1.00), with a sensitivity of 78.7% (95% CI, 0.68-0.88), which was between that of the IGRA and TST. Subgroup analysis found that population categories and reference standards, among other factors, may be attributed to heterogeneity. In addition, the TST and IGRA add-on TBST can significantly improve diagnostic accuracy. In our study, the IGRA showed higher sensitivity, whereas the TBST showed higher specificity. Interestingly, under certain conditions, TST add-on TBST and IGRA add-on TBST showed better accuracy than TST and IGRA alone and could provide more effective guidance for clinical practice (PROSPERO CRD42023420136)."
"A sequential extraction process combining supercritical fluid extraction (SFE: 25.0 MPa, 75 min, 50.0 °C, and 10.0 mL/min flow) with pulsed electric fields (PEF: 3.0 kV/cm, 300 kJ/kg for head/backbones, 124.8 kJ/kg for viscera) or conventional extraction (CE: 60 min, 300 rpm) was optimized to enhance the recovery of high-added-value compounds, including proteins, bioactive peptides, minerals, heavy metals, and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) from salmon side streams. Protein levels increased notably with PEF, particularly in viscera liquid extracts, reaching 15.5 g/100 g. Bioactive peptides displayed anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, anticancer, hypolipidemic, and antithrombotic potential. Viscera liquid extracts showed high TAC (402.8 and 3263.6 μM). ICP-MS analysis revealed PEF treatment helps solid matrices retaining more minerals and heavy metals. Principal component analysis (PCA) on proteins, peptides, minerals, and heavy metals elucidated PEF's impact, identifying two main components affecting the salmon matrix and extract composition."

"Drug development for children presents unique challenges and is highly regulated. Novel approaches, such as the use of extrapolation to address, for example, the need to avoid unethical studies, whilst supporting robust evidence generation have been developed in support of benefit/risk considerations by regulatory authorities. This is only one step in the decision-making process towards access, which in Europe also includes health technology assessment (HTA) bodies. Discussions related to evidentiary requirements in small populations using scientific evidence transfer have been identified as a priority action by European Medicines Agency/European Network for Health Technology Assessment 21 (EMA/EUnetHTA 21). We describe the outcome of this work and reflect on the discussions that had taken place on how to leverage prior knowledge through identifying and addressing uncertainties during life cycle management to support regulatory and HTA decision-making. Using examples, we explore the range of applications for evidence generation and offer regulatory and HTA insights on key design considerations for producing better evidence, reflecting our shared ambition. Early interactions with all respective stakeholders, particularly between regulators and HTA bodies are key to optimise data generation and utility in children. In Europe, the HTA regulation will offer opportunities for collaborations, which are important for all development efforts. We collaboratively explored the unique specific challenges relating to paediatric drug development, ethically and in its ability to leverage prior knowledge, as exemplified using extrapolation. Learnings from these offer opportunities to further develop methodology on how to leverage uncertainties across a product's life cycle for small populations generally."
Increased arterial stiffness is associated with the severity of cerebral small-vessel disease (SVD) and may predict incident dementia. This study investigated the predictive value of brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (ba-PWV) for dementia and cognitive decline.
"The placenta is the critical interface between mother and fetus, and consequently, placental dysfunction underlies many pregnancy complications. Placental formation requires an adequate expansion of trophoblast stem and progenitor cells followed by finely tuned lineage specification events. Here, using single-cell RNA sequencing of mouse trophoblast stem cells during the earliest phases of differentiation, we identify gatekeepers of the stem cell state, notably Nicol1, and uncover unsuspected trajectories of cell lineage diversification as well as regulators of lineage entry points. We show that junctional zone precursors and precursors of one of the two syncytial layers of the mouse placental labyrinth, the Syncytiotrophoblast-I lineage, initially share similar trajectories. Importantly, our functional analysis of one such lineage precursor marker, CXADR, demonstrates that this cell surface protein regulates the differentiation dynamics between the two syncytial layers of the mouse labyrinth, ensuring the correct establishment of the placental exchange surface. Deciphering the mechanisms underlying trophoblast lineage specification will inform our understanding of human pregnancy in health and disease."
"Introduction - Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic immune-mediated inflammatory disease, which causes local and systemic bone damage. The main goal of this work was to analyze, how treatment intervention with Ab501 (certolizumab mice equivalent) prevents the disturbances on bone structure and mechanics induced by arthritis. Methods - Thirty DBA/1 collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice were randomly housed in experimental groups, as follows: arthritic untreated (N=9), preventive intervention (N=10) and treatment intervention (N=11). A non-induced group (N=5) was used as a control. Mice were monitored during 70 days after disease induction for the inflammatory score, ankle perimeter and body weight. After 70 days of disease progression mice were sacrificed and bone samples were collected for histology, micro-computed tomography (µCT) and 3-point bending analysis. In addition, blood samples were also collected for bone turnover markers quantification. Results - Results showed that Ab501 administration was able to control and abrogate disease development both in preventive and early therapeutic intervention. µCT results revealed that Ab501 was able to preserve trabecular bone structure when delivered before arthritis induction. Conclusion - Ab501 preventive administration was able to control inflammation and prevent the degradative effects of arthritis on trabecular bone structure in a CIA DBA/1 mice model."

"Although preoperative antibiotics are used routinely in ankle fracture surgery, there is considerable variability in postoperative antibiotic dosing regimens amongst surgeons. The aim of this study is to compare the rate of surgical site infection (SSI) in patients receiving one dose of preoperative antibiotics to patients who received more than one dose of antibiotics. A single-center Level I Trauma Center retrospective review of patients with isolated closed ankle fractures who underwent open reduction internal fixation over a 10-year period was performed. Demographics data and risk factors were obtained from the electronic medical record. SSI was detected using a text-mining algorithm on all postoperative clinic notes. Factors associated with the development of SSI or increased antibiotic dosing were evaluated. Eight-hundred and twenty-six patients were included in the analysis. There was no correlation between infection rate and any of the potential risk factors evaluated. Two-hundred and ninety-two patients received only one dose of antibiotics preoperatively and 534 patients received more than one antibiotic dose. The rate of SSI was not significantly different between the single-dose cohort (5.8 %) and the multi-dose cohort (3.9 %) (p=0.215). Routine use of postoperative antibiotics in open reduction internal fixation of closed ankle fractures did not decrease the rate of SSI, regardless of associated comorbidities."
"Efficient delivery of therapeutic proteins remains a major challenge in developing effective immunotherapies and treatments for genetic disorders due to the limited tissue targeting capability of native proteins. In this study, the design and synthesis of protein nanocapsules (NCs) that achieve lung-specific delivery of therapeutic proteins are reported. These NCs are synthesized through a surface modification process that involves coating protein with functional monomers and cross-linkers, followed by in situ polymerization to create a protective shell on the protein surface with tailored surface chemistry. This approach preserves protein integrity and significantly enhances delivery efficiency and tissue specificity. Notably, it is shown that protein@NC with guanidine-rich surfaces exhibit exceptional lung-targeting capabilities. This is likely attributed to the formation of a vitronectin-rich protein corona, which facilitates receptor-mediated endocytosis by lung cells. The platform effectively delivers various proteins, such as ovalbumin, to antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in the lung, thereby enhancing antigen presentation and offering a promising strategy for cancer immunotherapy. These findings provide a significant advancement in tissue-specific protein delivery and hold the potential for targeted cancer immunotherapy."

"The B-cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6) transcription factor plays a key role in the establishment of germinal center (GC) formation. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) originates from the GC reaction due to dysregulation of BCL6. Disrupting BCL6 and its corepressors' interaction has become the foundation for rationally designing lymphoma therapies. However, BCL6 inhibitors with good activities in vitro and in vivo are rare, and there are no clinically approved BCL6 inhibitors. In this study, we discovered and developed a novel range of [1,2,4] triazolo[1,5-a] pyrimidine derivatives targeting BCL6/SMRT interaction. The lead compound WK692 directly bound BCL6BTB, disrupted BCL6BTB/SMRT interaction and activated the expression of BCL6 downstream genes inside cells, inhibited DLBCL growth and induced apoptosis in vitro, inhibited GC formation, decreased the proportion of follicular helper T cells, and impaired Ig affinity maturation. Further studies showed that WK692 inhibits DLBCL growth without toxic effects in vivo and synergizes with the EZH2 and PRMT5 inhibitors. Our results demonstrated that WK692 as a BCL6 inhibitor may be developed as a novel potential anticancer agent against DLBCL."
"This study describes the seroconversion and serodynamics of IgG antibodies against the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 in the general population of Sleman District, Yogyakarta Special Province.

"Automated large-scale farmland preparation operations face significant challenges related to path planning efficiency and uniformity in resource allocation. To improve agricultural production efficiency and reduce operational costs, an enhanced method for planning land preparation paths is proposed. In the initial stage, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are employed to collect data from the field, which is then used to construct accurate farm models. For single-field operations, a path planning approach is developed that minimizes energy consumption. The approach combines the selection of optimal operational angles with the implementation of efficient turning strategies, aiming to achieve full coverage. In addressing the issue of scheduling multiple machines across multiple fields, a two-stage optimization method, referred to as the BNSGA-III algorithm, is introduced. This algorithm integrates the NSGA-III algorithm with Beluga Whale Optimization (BWO), adaptive parameter adjustment, and Adaptive Inversion Crossover (AIC). The proposed method tackles the inherent complexity of agricultural environments, balancing operational efficiency and resource allocation through multi-objective optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to random operation directions, the proposed method reduces the path length by 1.9% to 3.1%, decreases the turning frequency by 19.5% to 24.0%, and improves coverage by 1.0% to 1.4%. In the context of multi-machine scheduling, the BNSGA-III algorithm outperforms the NSGA-II, NSGA-III, and MOEA/D algorithms, achieving improvements in total travel distance (12.3% to 34.4%), path balance (60.9% to 66.2%), and workload distribution (78.7% to 92.9%). Further evaluation shows that BNSGA-III excels in key metrics such as convergence (IGD), solution quality (HV), and diversity (Spread), thereby confirming its superiority in solution quality, convergence, and diversity. The findings of this study provide strong support for the advancement of intelligent agriculture."
"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease that leads to joint inflammation, progressive tissue damage and significant disability, severely impacting patients' quality of life. While the exact mechanisms underlying RA remain elusive, growing evidence suggests a strong link between intestinal microbiota dysbiosis and the disease's development and progression. Differences in microbial composition between healthy individuals and RA patients point to the role of gut microbiota in modulating immune responses and promoting inflammation. Therapies targeting microbiota restoration have demonstrated promise in improving treatment efficacy, enhancing patient outcomes and slowing disease progression. However, the complex interplay between gut microbiota and autoimmune pathways in RA requires further investigation to establish causative relationships and mechanisms. Here, we review the current understanding of the gut microbiota's role in RA pathogenesis and its potential as a therapeutic target."
"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a common neurodevelopmental condition mainly characterized by both a scarce aptitude for social interactions or communication and engagement in repetitive behaviors. These primary symptoms can manifest with variable severity and are often paired with a heterogeneous plethora of secondary complications, among which include anxiety, ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder), cognitive impairment, sleep disorders, sensory alterations, and gastrointestinal issues. So far, no treatment for the core symptoms of ASD has yielded satisfactory results in a clinical setting. Consequently, medical and psychological support for ASD patients has focused on improving quality of life and treating secondary complications. Despite no single cause being identified for the onset and development of ASD, many genetic mutations and risk factors, such as maternal age, fetal exposure to certain drugs, or infections have been linked to the disorder. In preclinical contexts, these correlations have acted as a valuable basis for the development of various murine models that have successfully mimicked ASD-like symptoms and complications. This review aims to summarize the findings of the extensive literature regarding the pharmacological and nutraceutical interventions that have been tested in the main animal models for ASD, and their effects on core symptoms and the anatomical, physiological, or molecular markers of the disorder."
"The amino acid composition of proteins depends on many factors. It varies in organisms that are distant in taxonomic position. The amino acid composition of proteins depends on the localization of proteins in cells and tissues and the structure of proteins. The question arises: is it possible to separate different proteomes using only the amino acid composition of proteins? Is it possible to determine, considering only its amino acid composition, to what structural class the protein under study will belong? We have developed a method and a measure that maximally separate two sets of proteins. As a result, we assign each protein an R-value, positive values of which are more characteristic of the first set, and negative ones-of the second. By studying the distribution of R in two sets, we can determine how much these sets differ in composition. Also, when examining a new protein, we can determine if it is more similar to the first set or the second. In this paper, we show that using only amino acid composition, it is possible to separate sets of proteins belonging to different organisms, as well as proteins that differ in function or structure. In all cases, we assign to proteins a measure R that maximally separates the studied sets. This approach can be further used to annotate proteins with unknown functions."

"The polyphenol extraction and evolution during a traditional 14-day fermentation of the Aglianico red grape, a variety widely cultivated across Southern Italy, was for the first time investigated, with the purpose of optimizing the phenolic profile in finished wines. Anthocyanins, BSA-reactive tannins, iron-reactive phenols, and vanillin-reactive flavans (VRFs) were analyzed in the free-run must, pressed pomace liquid, and in pomace extracts at different maceration times. Experimental evidence suggested that, instead of the typical 14-day maceration of Aglianico grapes, it is recommendable to choose an 11-day maceration in order to prevent the over-extraction of polyphenols that may detrimentally affect the sensory characteristics of wines. In fact, Aglianico wines, if not properly produced, can be affected by excessive astringency due to its high tannin contents. The findings of the present study can provide insightful knowledge to all the winemakers dealing with grape varieties characterized by high quantities of tannins. Also, an earlier racking would supply grape pomaces extremely rich in valuable phenolic compounds to be extracted and reused in several industrial segments in the frame of circular bioeconomy."
"How does one assess developmental change when the measures themselves change with development? Most developmental studies of word learning use either looking (infants) or pointing (preschoolers and older). With little empirical evidence of the relationship between the two measures, developmental change is difficult to assess. This paper analyzes 914 pointing, looking children (451 female, varied ethnicities, 2.5-6.5 years, dates: 2009-2019) in 36 word- or sound-learning experiments with two-alternative test trials. Looking proportions and pointing accuracy correlated strongly (r = .7). Counter to the ""looks first"" hypothesis, looks were not sensitive to incipient knowledge that pointing missed: when pointing is at chance, looking proportions are also. Results suggest one possible path forward for assessing continuous developmental change. Methodological best practices are discussed."

"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) can have orthopaedic manifestations related to decreased bone mineral density and increased fracture risk. The impact of IBD-spectrum diseases, including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), on the overall performance of total hip arthroplasty (THA), is not well understood. The present study sought to evaluate whether patients who have IBD were at an increased risk of THA failure compared to those who did not have IBD."
"Recently, we found DNA/RNA heteroduplex oligonucleotide-based antimiR (HDO-antimiR) can more efficiently inhibit the target miRNA than conventional antimiR after its cellular uptake. But the mechanism of HDO-antimiR about the target-silencing is unknown. We here tried to elucidate the interaction mechanism of HDO-antimiR to miRNA using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. When interaction of the conventional antimiR or HDO-antimiR and the target miRNA was simulated, they combined with each other in various forms. In the hydrogen bond analyses, base site of the antimiR formed hydrogen bond with miRNA. On the other hand, phosphate site of the HDO-antimiR formed hydrogen bond with miRNA. These results suggested that there were differences about the binding mechanisms between antimiR and HDO-antimiR to the target miRNA. In particular, there was a difference in the binding site between antimiR and HDO-antimiR. Additionally, it was found that guanine in the miRNA is mainly involved in the binding to the antimiR or HDO-antimiR. MD simulation method is useful in understanding the mechanism of oligonucleotide therapeutics."
"The Chemical Probes Portal (www.chemicalprobes.org) is a free, public resource, based on expert-reviews, that supports the assessment, selection and use of small-molecule compounds that qualify as chemical probes. These high-quality reagents are essential for exploring the function of individual proteins in complex biological systems, such as cells and organisms, and for validating proteins as potential therapeutic targets. The use of reliable chemical probes accelerates protein annotation in basic biological studies and informs drug discovery. However, the use of low-quality compounds has historically led to erroneous conclusions in biomedical research, and experience shows that failure to follow best practice continues, an issue which the Portal aims to address. Here, we describe the latest updates to the Chemical Probes Portal in both content and functionality. The number of chemical probes and human protein targets covered has increased significantly, with improvements in the processes for obtaining expert reviews and user engagement. Moreover, new functionalities and enhanced tools have been introduced to better support biological researchers in selecting and using the best chemical probes for their studies."
"This manuscript reports a rare case of CUX1::NUTM1-positive B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) in a 25-year-old female patient who experienced early relapse and a poor clinical outcome. Given the rarity of NUTM1 fusion-positive B-ALL in adults, this case contributes to the growing evidence that such cases may present with a more aggressive clinical course compared to the pediatric population. Our findings suggest the need for a re-evaluation of therapeutic strategies in adult patients with this subtype of B-ALL."
"Spectacles and contact lenses are important for conducting a normal life in a large part of the general population. The purpose of this study was to estimate the use of these refractive aids in a normal adult population, and to identify characteristics of persons who should be targeted in order to improve uncorrected refraction. In the FORSYN study, 10,350 citizens representative for the adult Danish population were invited for a non-cycloplegic eye examination. The examination was completed in 3,384 persons, and the data were adjusted to represent the frequencies in the originally invited population on the basis of age, sex and socio-economic factors. The frequencies were projected to estimates of absolute numbers in the total adult Danish population. Refractive aids were used by 72.6%, 95% CI: 71.7-73.5% of the adult population. Distance correction was used by 55.7% (95% CI: 54.8-56.7%), contact lenses alone or alternating with spectacles by 11.2% (95% CI: 10.6-11.8%) and reading glasses by 18.8% (95% CI: 18.0-19.5%). Uncorrected refractive error resulted in a reduction in distance visual acuity of 2.99 ETDRS letters per diopter of hyperopia and of 10.3 ETDRS letters per diopter myopia (p < 0.0001 for both regressions). Uncorrected refractive error reduced distance visual acuity significantly in persons using single vision spectacle lenses and progressive addition spectacle lenses that had been prescribed more than 3 years previously. Refractive aids were used in approximately 72% of the population and should be checked when more than 3 years have passed since the last visit with a dispensing optometrist."

"There is still an insufficient understanding of how the characteristics of protein drugs are maintained in the solid state of lyophilizates, including aspects such as protein distances, local environment, and structural preservation. To this end, we evaluated protein folding and the molecules' nearest environment by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. Double electron-electron resonance (DEER) probe distances of up to approximately 200 Å and is suitable to investigate protein folding, local concentration, and aggregation, whereas electron spin echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) allows the study of the near environment within approximately 10 Å of the spin label. We spin-labeled human serum albumin (HSA) and freeze-dried different concentrations with 100 g/L deuterated sucrose. DEER showed distinct local concentration behaviors for two folding states, directly correlating folding percentage with the interprotein distance, reaching 2 nm at an HSA concentration of 84 g/L. Interestingly, 50% of the HSA molecules showed partial structural perturbation already at 2.6 g/L, which corresponds to a molar ratio Suc/HSA of 7469. This percentage increased to 97% with an increase in the HSA concentration to 84 g/L. The degree of protein perturbation cannot be told, and no signs of unfolding are found after reconstitution. ESEEM demonstrated a higher sucrose concentration around the protein label compared to the HSA environment in highly concentrated sucrose solutions. The partial unfolding detected in DEER could lead to label exposure and explain the enhanced sucrose detection in the intimate shell. Our work provides new insights regarding sucrose enrichment in the nearest shell of proteins upon lyophilization. In addition, the results indicate substantial partial structural perturbation, even in the presence of enormous supplies of stabilizing sugars. Thus, pulse EPR spectroscopy allows additional understanding of the solid state of protein lyophilizates, which is complementary to SANS, FTIR, or ssNMR."

"In response to the restrictions imposed by their epiphytic habit, orchids have developed structural traits that allow greater efficiency in water uptake and use, such as a complex adventitious root system with velamen. The composition of cell wall of this specialized epidermis can be altered according to the substrate to which it is fixed, influencing wall permeability, absorption, and storage of water in roots. The current study aimed to evaluate the cell wall composition of adventitious roots of Vanilla phaeantha (Orchidaceae) that grow attached to the phorophyte, fixed in the soil, or hung free. Immunocytochemical analyses were used to determine the protein, hemicellulose, and pectin composition of the cell walls of aerial and terrestrial roots. We observed that pectins are present in the different tissues of the aerial roots, while in the terrestrial roots, they are concentrated in the cortical parenchyma. The deposition of xyloglucans, extensins, and arabinogalactans was greater in the epidermis of the free side of the roots attached to the phorophyte. The strong labeling of pectins in aerial roots may be related to the influx of water and nutrients, which are generally scarce in this environment. The arrangement of hemicelluloses and proteins with the pectins may be associated with increased cell rigidity and sustainability, a feature of interest for the aerial roots. In summary, the habit of roots can interfere with the non-cellulosic composition of the cell walls of V. phaeantha, possibly related to changes in cell functionality."
"The Covered Endovascular Reconstruction of the Aortic Bifurcation (CERAB) reconstruction is an endovascular technique, developed to reconstruct the aortic bifurcation in the most optimal anatomical and physiological manner.

"The psychedelic experience can be challenging. There is a need for a structured framework for providing psychological support to individuals with mental health conditions receiving investigational psilocybin treatment. The primary benefit of such a framework is to support a safe and meaningful psilocybin experience. It also enables future research on the facets of psychological support and/or psychotherapy that most optimally complement psilocybin treatment. The authors describe the Compass Psychological Support Model (CPSM), currently used to support participants with treatment-resistant depression in Compass-sponsored clinical trials of investigational COMP360 psilocybin treatment. The authors also outline the therapist training, mentoring, and fidelity assessment programs they have developed to ensure the quality and consistency of the CPSM delivery."
"Efforts to minimize narcotic usage following inflatable penile prosthesis (IPP) implantation are vital, considering the current opioid epidemic in the United States. We aimed to determine whether pudendal nerve block (PNB) utilization in a multiethnic population undergoing primary IPP implantation can decrease rates of post-operative opiate usage. A single-institution, retrospective study was conducted on patients who underwent primary IPP implantation between December 2015 and June 2022. PNB usage and intra- and post-operative outcomes were analyzed using multivariate binary logistic regression. 449 patients were included, with 373 (83.1%) in the PNB group. Median time (minutes) spent in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) (1499 [119-198] vs. 235 [169-322], p < 0.001) was significantly lower in the PNB group. There were no significant differences in intra-operative and PACU morphine milligram equivalents or post-operative safety outcomes between groups. However, fewer patients in the PNB group called for pain medications post-operatively (10.2% vs 19.7%, p = 0.019). Multivariate analysis revealed a significantly decreased operative time (B -6.23; 95%CI -11.28, -1.17; p = 0.016) and decreased time in recovery (B: -81.62; 95%CI: -106.49, -56.76, p < 0.001) in the PNB group. PNB decreases post-operative opioid analgesic requirements and time spent in PACU in patients undergoing a primary IPP implantation and thus may represent an attractive, non-opioid adjunct."
"Melasma, a symmetric pigmentary disorder, is more prevalent in women and individuals with darker skin tones. Despite its global prevalence, there is a notable gap in the understanding of gender, racial, and Fitzpatrick skin type (FST) representation in melasma clinical trials. We conducted a comprehensive search of the United States (US) National Library of Medicine clinical trials database (ClinicalTrials.gov) on March 2nd, 2024, to identify melasma clinical trials. The aim of this study was to assess the demographic representation of participants enrolled in melasma clinical trials. Out of 56 trials identified, 19 met the inclusion criteria, comprising 614 patients. Our analysis revealed a predominant representation of female patients (96.58%) and a diverse representation of racial and ethnic groups, with a majority of Hispanic or Latino patients (43.10%), followed by Asian (23.71%), White (15.52%), and Black or African American patients (14.66%). Fitzpatrick skin types III and IV were most common among trial participants, totaling over 75% of trial participants. The identified gender, racial, and FST representation suggest a deliberate effort towards more inclusive research practices in dermatology. This trend towards inclusivity sets a valuable precedent for improving representation in research for other dermatological conditions that disproportionately impact skin of color patients.

"Phyllodes tumors (PTs) are rare breast stroma neoplasms, and their accurate identification at various stages is essential for personalized patient treatment. In this study, multiphoton microscopy (MPM) with two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF) and second harmonic generation (SHG) imaging was used for label-free detection and differentiation of PTs and normal breast tissue. An automated image processing strategy was developed to quantify changes in collagen fiber morphology within the stroma and boundary of PTs, establishing optical diagnostic characteristics of PTs using MPM. The results demonstrated that MPM could be used for the detection of different stages of PTs, and the morphological alterations in collagen fibers could serve as critical indicators of PT malignancy, offering new insights for the diagnosis and grading of benign, borderline, and malignant PTs. It lays the groundwork for the future application of compact MPM for the rapid detection and diagnosis of PTs."
"Developmental toxicity (DevTox) tests evaluate the adverse effects of chemical exposures on an organism's development. Although current testing primarily relies on large mammalian models, the emergence of new approach methodologies (NAMs) is encouraging industries and regulatory agencies to evaluate novel assays. C. elegans have emerged as NAMs for rapid toxicity testing because of its biological relevance and suitability to high throughput studies. However, current low-resolution and labor-intensive methodologies prohibit its application for sub-lethal DevTox studies at high throughputs. With the recent advent of the large-scale microfluidic device, vivoChip, we can now rapidly collect 3D high-resolution images of ~ 1000 C. elegans from 24 different populations. While data collection is rapid, analyzing thousands of images remains time-consuming. To address this challenge, we developed a machine-learning (ML)-based image analysis platform using a 2.5D U-Net architecture (vivoBodySeg) that accurately segments C. elegans in images obtained from vivoChip devices, achieving a Dice score of 97.80%. vivoBodySeg processes 36 GB data per device, phenotyping multiple body parameters within 35 min on a desktop PC. This analysis is ~ 140 × faster than the manual analysis. This ML approach delivers highly reproducible DevTox parameters (4-8% CV) to assess the toxicity of chemicals with high statistical power."
"The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a highly selective structure that protects the central nervous system (CNS) while hindering the delivery of many therapeutic agents. This presents a major challenge in treating neurological disorders, such as multiple sclerosis, where effective drug delivery to the brain is crucial for improving patient outcomes. Innovative strategies are urgently needed to address this limitation."
This study aimed to develop a scale to assess public health nurses' (PHNs') advocacy practices in groups and communities in Japan and determine its reliability and validity.
"Radiation therapy is a common treatment modality for lung cancer, and resistance to radiation can significantly affect treatment outcomes. We recently described that lung cancer cells that express more germ cell cancer genes (GC genes, genes that are usually restricted to the germ line) can repair DNA double-strand breaks more rapidly, show higher rates of proliferation and are more resistant to ionizing radiation than cells that express fewer GC genes. The gene encoding TRIP13 appeared to play a large role in this malignant phenotype. However, the molecular regulatory mechanism of TRIP13 in radiation resistance remained largely unknown. Here, we show that TRIP13 is a key contributor to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treatment resistance, particularly in patients following radiation treatment, for whom levels of TRIP13 expression are correlated with a poor prognosis. Repeated irradiation of led to an increase of basal TRIP13 levels and radioresistance. This effect of radioresistance could be enhanced or abrogated by overexpressing or knocking out TRIP13. Elevated TRIP13 is also correlated with enhanced repair of radiation-induced DNA damage. We further showed the proteins NBS1 and RAD51 (homologous recombination. HR) and XRCC5 (non-homologous end-joining, NHEJ) to act downstream of TRIP13, although inhibition of TRIP13 mostly reduced the HR associated proteins in response to induced resistance to irradiation. This study elucidates a novel mechanism of treatment resistance in NSCLC cells, in which TRIP13 promotes HR mediated DNA repair and resistance to ionizing radiation."
"Mental health and substance use challenges are highly correlated in youth and have been speculated to be associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy.

"Patients with relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) transformed from indolent B-cell lymphomas, including Richter transformation, have a poor prognosis. PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies produce modest objective and complete response rates in B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma as monotherapy but may synergize with immunogenic chemotherapies such as gemcitabine and oxaliplatin (GemOx). Thus, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of atezolizumab plus rituximab and GemOx (R-GemOx+Atezo) in R/R transformed DLBCL, including Richter transformation. We conducted a phase I trial including patients with transformed DLBCL after ≥1 prior therapy. Patients received up to four cycles of R-GemOx+Atezo. Patients in complete remission could then proceed to R-Atezo maintenance until progression. A safety lead-in with evaluation of dose-limiting toxicity was performed to confirm the recommended phase II dose; subsequently the treatment was administered to two expansion cohorts: one with transformed follicular lymphoma (FL) and the other with non-FL transformed DLBCL, including Richter transformation. Twenty-seven patients were enrolled. One of the six patients in the safety lead-in had a dose-limiting toxicity attributed to atezolizumab, a grade 4 Stevens-Johnson syndrome. The most common grade ≥3 events were neutropenia (18.5%), lymphopenia (18.5%), and thrombocytopenia (14.8%). The overall and complete response rates were 59% and 33%, respectively. The overall and complete response rates in transformed FL were 79% and 43%, respectively, and 38% and 23% in transformed non-FL, respectively. The median progression-free survival and overall survival of the total population were 4.2 and 7.7 months, respectively. R-GemOx+Atezo was well tolerated and demonstrated promising preliminary efficacy in patients with relapsed/refractory transformed DLBCL."

"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is now known to be caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, has been a public health threat since early 2020 and has affected millions of people worldwide. Many studies have now shown that this virus exhibits a milder infection in children compared to adults. Acute COVID-19 infection, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), and long COVID have been recently well-established in the pediatric population with a myriad of systemic manifestations. This section of the review will focus on the following systems-neurology, psychiatry, endocrinology, hematology, and oncology-under three broad lenses, such as acute COVID-19, MIS-C, and long COVID."
"Lipidomic alterations have been associated with various neurological diseases. Examining temporal changes in serum lipidomic profiles, irrespective of injury type, reveals promising prognostic indicators. In this longitudinal prospective observational study, serum samples were collected early (46 ± 24 h) and late (142 ± 52 h) post-injury from 70 patients with ischemic stroke, aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, and traumatic brain injury that had outcomes dichotomized as favorable (modified Rankin Scores (mRS) 0-3) and unfavorable (mRS 4-6) three months post-injury. Lipidomic profiling of 1153 lipids, analyzed using statistical and machine learning methods, identified 153 lipids with late-stage significant outcome differences. Supervised machine learning pinpointed 12 key lipids, forming a combinatory prognostic equation with high discriminatory power (AUC 94.7 %, sensitivity 89 %, specificity 92 %; p < 0.0001). Enriched functions of the identified lipids were related to sphingolipid signaling, glycerophospholipid metabolism, and necroptosis (p < 0.05, FDR-corrected). The study underscores the dynamic nature of lipidomic profiles in acute brain injuries, emphasizing late-stage distinctions and proposing lipids as significant prognostic markers, transcending injury types. These findings advocate further exploration of lipidomic changes for a comprehensive understanding of pathobiological roles and enhanced prediction for recovery trajectories."
"Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles (30-150 nm in size) that play a critical role in cellular communication, transporting proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids between cells.

"Expansion of tandem repeats in genes often causes severe diseases, such as fragile X syndrome, Huntington's disease, and spinocerebellar ataxia. However, information on genes associated with repeat expansion diseases is scattered throughout the literature, systematic prediction of potential genes that may cause diseases via repeat expansion is also lacking. Here, we develop DRED, a Database of genes related to Repeat Expansion Diseases, as a manually-curated database that covers all known 61 genes related to repeat expansion diseases reported in PubMed and OMIM, along with the detailed repeat information for each gene. DRED also includes 516 genes with the potential to cause diseases via repeat expansion, which were predicted based on their repeat composition, genetic variations, genomic features, and disease associations. Various types of information on repeat expansion diseases and their corresponding genes/repeats are presented in DRED, together with links to external resources, such as NCBI and ClinVar. DRED provides user-friendly interfaces with comprehensive functions, and can serve as a central data resource for basic research and repeat expansion disease-related medical diagnosis. DRED is freely accessible at http://omicslab.genetics.ac.cn/dred, and will be frequently updated to include newly reported genes related to repeat expansion diseases."

"This study aimed to determine the incidence of traumatic dental injuries (TDIs) during oral tracheal intubation by traditional laryngoscopy in general anesthesia (GA) in pediatric patients aged 4-13 and the correlated risk factors in Damascus, Syria. The study included children at the Department of General Surgery, Damascus University. Each child was examined before, during, and after 12-24 h of entering the operation room. The examination aimed to obtain demographic data and information regarding anesthesia procedures and the oral cavity. This study demonstrated that the incidence of TDIs during oral tracheal intubation was 16.00%. Most of those injuries are intra-oral, which were related to soft tissue. Maxillary incisors were the most affected teeth. Concussion and tongue injury were the common types of hard and soft tissue injury, respectively. There is a relation between TDIs and the occlusal stage, the difficulty of intubation, the number of intubation attempts, the Mallampati score, inter-incisor distance, and the distance between the mental and thyroid cartilage (p < 0.05). TDIs during oral tracheal intubation in GA are injuries with many risk factors and can't be avoided even with skilled anesthetists. Careful Preoperative clinical examination of the oral cavity by anesthesiologists can reduce the incidence of TDIs."

Inferring the direction of image motion is an important component of visual processing. A study with in vivo dual electrophysiological recording now reveals that the sensitivity of visual cortical neurons to the direction of motion is established by specific neural connections from the visual thalamus.
"Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) continue to be the leading cause of deaths and disability worldwide and the major contributor is hypertension. Despite all the improvements in detecting hypertension together with technological advances and affordable, efficacious and relatively free of adverse effects anti-hypertensive agents, we continue to struggle to prevent the onset of hypertension and to control blood pressure (BP) to acceptable targets. The poor control of hypertension is commonly due to non-adherence to medications. Another reason is the failure to adopt diet and lifestyle changes. Reduction of dietary salt intake is important for lowering BP but the role of potassium intake is also important. Globally the intake of sodium is double that of the recommended 2 gm per day (equivalent to 5 gm of sodium chloride/salt) and half that of the daily recommended intake of potassium of 3500 mg/day, giving a sodium-to-potassium ratio of >1, when ideally it should be <1. Many studies have shown that a higher potassium intake is associated with lower BPs, particularly when coupled concurrently with a lower sodium intake giving a lower sodium to potassium ratio. Most hypertension guidelines, while recommending reduction of salt intake to a set target, do not specifically recommend a target for potassium intake nor potassium supplementation. Here we review the role of potassium and salt substitution with potassium in the management of hypertension. Hence, the focus of dietary changes to lower BP and improve BP control should not be on reduction of salt intake alone but more importantly should include an increase in potassium intake."
"Compromised male reproductive health, including reduced testosterone and sperm count, is one of the long COVID symptoms in individuals recovering from mild-severe disease. COVID-19 patients display testicular injury in the acute stage and altered serum fertility markers in the recovery phase, however, long-term implications on the testis remain unknown. This study characterized the consequences of SARS-CoV-2 on testis function. The K18-hACE2 mice that survived SARS-CoV-2 infection were followed for one month after infection and the testicular injury and function markers were assessed at different stages of infection and recovery. The long-term impact of infection on key testes function-related hormones and male fertility was measured. The efficacy of inflammation-suppressing drug in preventing testicular injury was also evaluated. The morphological defects like sloughing of spermatids into the lumen and increased apoptotic cells sustained for 2-4 weeks after infection and correlated with testicular inflammation and immune cell infiltration. Transcriptomic analysis revealed dysregulation of inflammatory, cell death, and steroidogenic pathways. Furthermore, reduced testosterone levels associated with a transient reduction in sperm count and male fertility. Most testicular impairments resolved within one month of infection. Importantly, dexamethasone treatment attenuated testicular damage, inflammation, and immune infiltration. Our results implicate virus-induced cytokine storm as the major driver of testicular injury and functional impairments, timely prevention of which limits testis damage. These findings serve as a model for evaluating therapeutics in long COVID patients and may guide clinical strategies to improve male reproductive health outcomes post-SARS-CoV-2 infection."
"Pathogenic bioaerosols are critical for outbreaks of airborne disease; however, rapidly and accurately identifying pathogens directly from complex air environments remains highly challenging. We present an advanced method that combines open-set deep learning (OSDL) with single-cell Raman spectroscopy to identify pathogens in real-world air containing diverse unknown indigenous bacteria that cannot be fully included in training sets. To test and further enhance identification, we constructed the Raman datasets of aerosolized bacteria. Through optimizing OSDL algorithms and training strategies, Raman-OSDL achieves 93% accuracy for five target airborne pathogens, 84% accuracy for untrained air bacteria, and 36% reduction in false positive rates compared to conventional close-set algorithms. It offers a high detection sensitivity down to 1:1000. When applied to real air containing >4600 bacterial species, our method accurately identifies single or multiple pathogens simultaneously within an hour. This single-cell tool advances rapidly surveilling pathogens in complex environments to prevent infection transmission."
"Since the early discovery of QRFP43, intensive research has been primarily focused on its role in the modulation of food intake. As is widely recognised, the regulation of the body's energy status is a highly complex process involving numerous systems, hormones and neurotransmitters. Among the most important regulators of energy status, alongside the satiety and hunger centre located in the hypothalamus, is the HPT axis, which directly and indirectly affects the regulation of metabolism in all cells of the body. Therefore, it seems highly important to conduct studies aimed at elucidating how QRFP43 may impact the secretory activity of the HPT axis. The objective of this work was to investigate the role of QRFP43 in modulating HPT axis activity in sheep. The study examined mRNA and peptide expression of TRH and TSH in the hypothalamus and pituitary, as well as plasma concentrations of TSH, free T4 (FT4) and free T3 (FT3). Moreover, the relationship between QRFP34 and mRNA expression of the Dio1, Dio2, and Dio3 genes was explored in selected tissues of the HPT axis. The animals (n = 48) were randomly divided into three experimental groups: a control group receiving an ICV infusion of Ringer-Locke solution, and two experimental groups receiving ICV infusions of QRFP43 at doses of 10 and 50 µg per day. Four 50-minute ICV infusions were administered to all sheep at 30 min intervals each of three consecutive days. Hypothalamic, pituitary and thyroid glands were collected and preserved for further immunohistochemical and molecular biological analyses. Additionally, blood samples were collected during the experiment for subsequent RIA determinations. In summary, the results of the experiment have indicated that QRFP43 modulates the secretory activity of the HPT axis at all organisational levels. Moreover, QRFP43 can alter the mRNA expression profiles of DIO1, DIO2 and DIO3 in HPT tissues, leading to discrete changes in the metabolism of the cells studied and their response to signals transmitted by T4 and T3."
"TP53 mutations in patients with AML and MDS frequently portend a poor prognosis, related to both p53 allele status and blast count. In 2022, the ICC and WHO released updated guidelines for classifying p53-mutated AML/MDS. The characteristics of p53 mutations, their associated co-mutations, and their effects on overall survival (OS) are not known in the context of these new guidelines. A retrospective chart review was undertaken for all patients with AML or MDS and at least one TP53 mutation detected on next generation sequencing (NGS) at Yale New Haven Hospital from 2015 to 2023. All patients (N = 210) met criteria for one of the 5 diagnostic classes based on WHO and ICC guidelines. Kaplan-Meier curves with associated log-rank testing and Cox proportional hazards model quantified the effects of clinical and molecular data on survival. Multi-hit pathogenic mutations were related to poorer OS in MDS but not AML using either the WHO (p = .02) or the ICC (p = .01) diagnostic criteria. The most significant predictors of OS in the sample overall were platelet count < 50 K (HR: 2.01, 95% CI [1.47, 2.75], p < .001) and TP53 VAF ≤ 40% (HR: 0.68, 95% CI[0.50, 0.91], p = .01). Blast count ranges, complex karyotype, and p53 mutation type or location, showed no association with OS. In our cohort defined by the 2022 ICC and WHO criteria, VAF and thrombocytopenia, rather than blast count or p53 mutation features, significantly predicted OS. These results speak to each criteria's ability to identify cases of similarly aggressive disease biology and prognosis."

"Our earlier studies identified that non-SMC condensin I complex subunit D2 (NCAPD2) induces inflammation through the IKK/NF-κB pathway in ulcerative colitis. However, its role in the development of Crohn's disease (CD) and the specific molecular mechanism still need to be further studied."
"Infectious diseases are often concomitant with symptoms of lassitude and emotional disturbances, including depression, the so-called sickness behavior. Kososan, a Kampo (traditional Japanese herbal) formula, has been clinically used for depressive mood, with demonstrated efficacy in stress-induced depressive-like behavior mouse models. Additionally, our previous study has shown that nobiletin-rich kososan (NKS) prevents aging-related depressive-like behaviors and neuroinflammation in mice. Here, we examined whether NKS alleviates depressive-like behavior and neuroinflammation in a mouse model of sickness behavior induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Repeated oral administration of NKS and the positive control antidepressant paroxetine (Paro) significantly prevented this behavior. NKS and Paro significantly increased the anti-inflammatory milieu in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC), as well as brain microglia, of LPS-injected mice. The expression of the vascular tight junction protein claudin-5 was also significantly increased by the treatment with NKS, but not with Paro, in the hippocampus and PFC of LPS-injected mice. In vitro analysis using brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMVECs) showed that incubation with 5% serum derived from mice orally administered NKS resulted in a significant increase in the expression of anti-inflammatory heme oxygenase 1 as well as autophagic flux markers. Moreover, the claudin-5 levels in BMVECs were also increased under LPS-stimulated conditions. These results suggest that NKS exerts prophylactic effects against the LPS-induced apathy-like behavior, partly mediated by the increase in the anti-inflammatory milieu and in the levels of tight junction proteins in the brain. This study provides scientific evidence supporting the potential efficacy of NKS in preventing post-infection depression."
"WHAT IS KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT?: Family resilience is an important determinant of family caregivers' coping with difficulties of life and stress effectively. Family resilience factors contribute to the family's adaptation to difficulties. From the perspective of the individual living with schizophrenia and family, family resilience focuses not on the losses experienced but on the strengths. WHAT DOES THIS PAPER ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: Many factors such as routines, positive cognitions, intra-family communication, family support and love as a healing force that contribute to family resilience were identified from the common perspective of the individual diagnosed with schizophrenia-family caregiver dyads. The climate of love within the family is an important strength both for the patient diagnosed with schizophrenia and for the family caregivers. Mutual support between family members, their listening to each other and sharing experiences with each other during this disease process are therapeutic for both parties and make them resilient. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: Family resilience factors should be considered in planning psychosocial interventions to be applied to individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia and family caregivers. The clinical use of psychosocial support interventions in family resilience which help both the individual diagnosed with schizophrenia and the family caregivers to gain a positive perspective, to improve their problem-solving skills, and to support each other within the family should be expanded. Displaying approaches aimed at increasing the climate of love and strengthening correct communication techniques within the family towards both the individual diagnosed with schizophrenia and the family caregiver should be supported. Psychiatric nurses' focusing on family resilience from a systemic perspective in chronic mental illnesses such as schizophrenia strengthens the patient and the family. This perspective focuses on functional dimensions and protects mental health despite existing problems."
"Poor-grade aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (PGASAH) is associated with high mortality and morbidity despite advanced treatments. Accurate prediction of prognosis remains a clinical challenge. This study aimed to identify independent risk factors and develop a predictive nomogram for unfavorable outcomes in PGASAH patients. This retrospective study included 348 PGASAH patients treated between 2003 and 2016. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the association of premorbid conditions, admission aSAH clinical parameters, admission laboratory parameters, and clinical complications with unfavorable outcomes, defined as mRS > 2 at 6 months. Independent predictors were identified, and a nomogram was constructed to assess predictive accuracy and clinical utility. The median age of PGASAH patients was 55.1 years, 64.9% were females. Independent predictors of unfavorable outcomes (mRS > 2) at 6 months included age > 55 years (aOR = 2.44), cardiac valve disease (aOR = 6.50), dilated pupils at admission (aOR = 2.64), early infarction (aOR = 5.56), and delayed cerebral ischemia (aOR = 5.09). The nomogram demonstrated good predictive performance with an AUC of 0.807. Decision curve analysis affirmed its clinical applicability. The intuitive nomogram helps physicians predict PGASAH prognosis at discharge, improving long-term management, optimizing resource allocation, and enhancing patient and family awareness and psychological preparedness. External validation is required for broader clinical use."
"A recent study in the British Journal of Anaesthesia examining trajectories of anxiety and depressive symptoms after diverse surgical procedures sheds light on an often overlooked, yet important, factor in postoperative recovery-mental health. The authors applied ecological momentary assessment to collect high-resolution data to identify and characterise a subgroup of vulnerable patients who experience worsening of psychological symptoms after surgery. The study prompts not only consideration of psychological factors, but also how best to leverage ecological momentary assessment to understand the perioperative experience."
"Sepsis-associated acute lung injury (SALI) is a common complication of sepsis, consisting of a dysfunctional host response to infection-mediated heterogenous complexes. SALI is reported in up to 50 % of patients with sepsis and causes poor outcomes. Despite high incidence, there is a lack of understanding in its pathogenesis and optimal treatment. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying SALI may help produce better therapeutics. The effects of altered cell-death mechanisms, such as non-apoptotic regulated cell death (RCD) (i.e., ferroptosis), on the development of SALI are beginning to be discovered, while targeting ferroptosis as a meaningful target in SALI is increasingly being recognized. Here, we outline how a susceptible lung alveoli may develop SALI. Then we discuss the general mechanisms underlying ferroptosis, and how it contributes to SALI. We then outline the chemical structures of the emerging agents or compounds that can protect against SALI by inhibiting ferroptosis, summarizing their potential pharmacological effects. Finally, we highlight key limitations and possible strategies to overcome them. This review suggests that a detailed mechanistic and biological understanding of ferroptosis can foster the development of pharmacological antagonists in the treatment of SALI."
This study aimed to quantitatively assess changes in lung perfusion after thoracic radiotherapy in lung cancer patients.
"Ancient DNA research has provided important insights into the evolutionary history of Yersinia pestis during the historical plague pandemics. Future work should prioritise a more diversified approach to sampling, to ensure a broader understanding of the factors underlying pandemic onset, spread, and impact across different regions and hosts."
"Emerging research suggests that the gut microbiome plays a crucial role in stress. We assess stress-microbiome associations in two samples of healthy adults across three stress domains (perceived stress, stressful life events, and biological stress /Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia; RSA). Study 1 (n = 62; mean-age = 37.3 years; 68% female) and Study 2 (n = 74; mean-age = 41.6 years; female only) measured RSA during laboratory stressors and used 16S rRNA pyrosequencing to classify gut microbial composition from fecal samples. Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States was used to predict functional pathways of metagenomes. Results showed differences in beta diversity between high and low stressful life events groups across both studies. Study 1 revealed differences in beta diversity between high and low RSA groups. In Study 1, the low perceived stress group was higher in alpha diversity than the high perceived stress group. Levels of Clostridium were negatively associated with RSA in Study 1 and levels Escherichia/Shigella were positively associated with perceived stress in Study 2. Associations between microbial functional pathways (L-lysine production and formaldehyde absorption) and RSA are discussed. Findings suggest that certain features of the gut microbiome are differentially associated with each stress domain."
"This article reports a patient with peripheral T cell lymphoma following treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma.The biopsy of cervical lymph node initially confirmed classic Hodgkin lymphoma,with Reed-Sternberg cells expressing CD30 and B cell-specific activator.After 2 years,the disease progressed and the patient was diagnosed with peripheral T-cell lymphoma (non-specific type) by lymph node biopsy,with the expression of CD3,CD4,and CD8.The patient was undergoing chemotherapy in November 2023."
"West Nile Virus (WNV) and Usutu virus (USUV) circulate through complex cryptic transmission cycles involving mosquitoes as vectors, birds as amplifying hosts and several mammal species as dead-end hosts. Both viruses can be transmitted to humans through mosquito bites, which can lead to neuroinvasive and potentially fatal disease. Notably, WNV can also be transmitted through blood donations and organ transplants. The high proportion of asymptomatic infections caused by these viruses and their cryptic enzootic circulation make their early detection in the environment challenging. Viral surveillance in France still heavily relies on human and animal surveillance, i.e. late indicators of viral circulation. Entomological surveillance is a method of choice for identifying virus circulation ahead of the first human and animal cases and to reveal their genetic identity, but performing molecular screening of vectors is expensive, and time-consuming. Here we show substantial WNV and USUV co-circulation in Atlantic seaboard of France between July and August 2023 using a non-invasive MX (Molecular Xenomonitoring) method that use trapped mosquito excreta. MX offers significant advantages over traditional entomological surveillance: it is cost-effective and efficient, enabling viral RNA screening from a community of trapped mosquitoes via their excreta, which can be transported at room temperature. Additionally, MX extends the longevity of trapped mosquitoes, enhancing virus detection and simplifying logistics, and is easy to implement without requiring specialized skills. At the crossroads between entomological and environmental surveillance, MX can detect the circulation of zoonotic pathogens in the environment before cases are observed in humans and horses, enabling the timely alerts to health policy makers, allowing them to take suitable control measures."
"CRM1 (XPO1) has been well-characterized as a shuttling receptor that mediates the export of protein and RNA cargos to the cytoplasm, and previous analyses have pinpointed several key residues (A541, F572, K568, S1055, and Q742) that modulate CRM1 export activity. CRM1 also has a less studied nuclear function in RNA biogenesis, which is reflected by its localization to the Cajal body and the nucleolus. Here, we have investigated how the mutation of these key residues affects the intranuclear localization of CRM1 and its ability to mediate export of endogenous cargos. We identify A541K as a separation-of-function mutant that reveals the independent nature of the Cajal body and nucleolar localizations of CRM1. We also show that the F572A mutation may have strikingly opposite effects on the export of specific cargos. Importantly, and in contrast to previous claims, our findings indicate that S1055 phosphorylation is not generally required for CRM1 function and that the Q742 is not a function-defining residue in human CRM1. Collectively, our findings provide new insights into an understudied aspect of CRM1 biology and highlight several important issues related to CRM1 function and regulation that need to be re-evaluated and addressed in more detail."
"The article is devoted to the creation of enzymatic nanoreactors based on polystyrene-block-poly(acrylic acid) (PS-b-PAA) copolymers containing bioscavengers capable of neutralizing toxic esters both in the body and in the environment. Block copolymers of different amphiphilicity, hydrophilicity and molecular weights were synthesized and characterized using gel permeation chromatography, NMR and UV spectroscopy. Polymeric nanocontainers in the absence and presence of human butyrylcholinesterase were made by film hydration and characterized by dynamic light scattering and microscopy methods. Enzyme activity was determined using the Ellman method. For the first time, factors that need to be taken into account for the creation of effective enzymatic nanoreactors based on PS-b-PAA are presented. The data obtained open up the possibility of PS-b-PAA nanoreactor use for future in vivo bioscavenger studies."
"This study investigated the comparative performance of ear, nose, and throat (ENT) physicians in correctly detecting ear abnormalities when reviewing digital otoscopy imaging using 3 different visualization methods, including computer-assisted composite images called ""SelectStitch,"" single video frame ""Still"" images, and video clips.

Individuals exposed to wildfires are at risk of developing adverse mental health conditions in the months following the event. Receiving supportive text interventions during and after a wildfire event can have a significant impact on reducing mental health conditions over time.
It has been well documented that men who identify with a sexual orientation other than heterosexual are at a greater risk for suicide-related outcomes. What is less known are the protective factors that can reduce such negative outcomes and contribute to their resilience.
"Mitochondrial diseases are severe, inherited metabolic disorders that affect the paediatric population. They affect the functioning of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) apparatus either directly or indirectly. Since mutations in mtDNA are responsible for only 25 % of paediatric cases and next-generation sequencing does not always provide a conclusive diagnosis, the biochemical approach still represents a valuable tool in diagnostics. Mitochondrial defects can be identified in tissue biopsies (muscle or skin). However, they also often manifest in peripheral blood cells. We developed a protocol for isolation and cryopreservation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 5 ml of children's blood using Ficoll centrifugation which can be utilised for subsequent functional measurements on thawed samples. Furthermore, we evaluated the diagnostic utility of the optimised high-resolution oxygraphy protocol using digitonin-permeabilized cryopreserved PBMCs on 47 samples from patients with confirmed or suspected mitochondrial disease. Overall, the diagnosis was confirmed in 72 % of cases, while the analysis of cryopreserved PBMCs provided a false negative outcome in 13 % of cases. Our study demonstrates a sensitive, fast, and non-invasive approach for the diagnostics of various types of mitochondrial disorders, especially those of nuclear genetic origin manifesting in paediatric patients."
"Trematodes are one of the most abundant and diverse groups of platyhelminths. They parasitize all major groups of vertebrates as definitive hosts and therefore play an important role in ecosystem composition. It is estimated that 18,000 to 25,000 species of trematodes exist worldwide, of which 685 have been reported in Mexico. Although this group is an integral part of ecosystems, there are still no studies that highlight the importance of parasites, especially in conservation approaches. Here, we recompiled information on the occurrence and available genetic data of trematodes in Mexico to estimate the specific richness of their representation across the Protected Areas (PAs) and provinces of Mexico. We consulted national and international databases (e.g., GBIF, CONABIO, CNHE-UNAM) and genetic repositories (e.g., GenBank) to generate curated datasets. We obtained 6,780 records that represent 99% of species reported in Mexico (680 species), of which only 10.2% are included in PAs. For genetic data, we found information from five nuclear regions (28S, 18S, ITS1, ITS2 and 5.8S) and two mitochondrial genes (COI and NAD1) for 118 species, of which only 3.5% were associated with PAs. With these results, we provide a spatial distribution of records (occurrence and genetic data) of trematodes present in Mexico and its PAs and identify poorly represented biogeographic provinces (e.g., Sierra Madre del Sur). We also highlight that this is the first study in Mexico to include this group in a conservation approach, and we record valuable information for future studies."
"Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an emerging, mosquito-borne arthritic alphavirus increasingly associated with severe neurological sequelae and long-term morbidity. However, there is limited understanding of the crucial host components involved in CHIKV replicase assembly complex formation, and thus virus replication and virulence-determining factors, within the central nervous system (CNS). Furthermore, the majority of CHIKV CNS studies focus on neuronal infection, even though astrocytes represent the main cerebral target. Heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K), an RNA-binding protein involved in RNA splicing, trafficking, and translation, is a regulatory component of alphavirus replicase assembly complexes, but has yet to be thoroughly studied in the context of CHIKV infection. We identified the hnRNP K CHIKV viral RNA (vRNA) binding site via sequence alignment and performed site-directed mutagenesis to generate a mutant, ΔhnRNPK-BS1, with disrupted hnRNPK-vRNA binding, as verified through RNA coimmunoprecipitation and RT-qPCR. CHIKV ΔhnRNPK-BS1 demonstrated hampered replication in both NSC-34 neuronal and C8-D1A astrocytic cultures. In astrocytes, disruption of the hnRNPK-vRNA interaction curtailed viral RNA transcription and shut down subgenomic RNA translation. Our study demonstrates that hnRNP K serves as a crucial RNA-binding host factor that regulates CHIKV replication through the modulation of subgenomic RNA translation."
This study aims to review and analyze factors associated with suicidal ideation to provide a rationale for subsequent effective interventions.
"The diet consumed by most Japanese people, which contains high amounts of carbohydrate and low levels of fat compared with the Western-style diet (WD), has been considered an effective diet for promoting glycogen recovery after exercise. However, there is no direct evidence to support this general belief, because no studies have examined the effect of whole, actually cooked Japanese-style diet (JD) on post-exercise glycogen replenishment. In this study, we comparatively examined the effects of a cooked typical JD and WD on glycogen accumulation in mouse skeletal muscle and liver after acute exercise. One-week menus (total 21 meals) of the JD and WD were reproduced based on national nutrition surveys in Japan and the U.S. All the meals were cooked, mixed and then fed to mice after acute 60-min running exercise. After the 4-h recovery period, mice given the JD had significantly higher muscle and liver glycogen concentrations than those fed the isoenergetic WD. Furthermore, even after the 24-h recovery period, the JD-fed mice also had significantly higher muscle glycogen concentration than the isoenergetic WD-fed group. Compared with the mice fed a WD, the JD-fed mice showed significantly higher plasma insulin level during the 4-h but not the 24-h recovery period. These results suggest that both short- and long-term feeding of the JD promote post-exercise muscle glycogen recovery compared to the WD, possibly through an insulin-dependent mechanism and non-insulin-dependent mechanism, respectively."
"Tc toxins are pore-forming virulence factors of many pathogenic bacteria. Following pH-induced conformational changes, they perforate the target membrane like a syringe to translocate toxic enzymes into a cell. Although this complex transformation has been structurally well studied, the reaction pathway and the resulting temporal evolution have remained elusive. We used an integrated biophysical approach to monitor prepore-to-pore transition and found a reaction time of ~30 hours for a complete transition. We show two asynchronous general steps of the process, shell opening and channel ejection, with the overall reaction pathway being a slow multistep process involving three intermediates. Liposomes, an increasingly high pH, or receptors facilitate shell opening, which is directly correlated with an increased rate of the prepore-to-pore transition. Channel ejection is a near-instantaneous process which occurs with a transition time of <60 milliseconds. Understanding the mechanism of action of Tc toxins and unveiling modulators of the kinetics are key steps toward their application as biomedical devices or biopesticides."
"Automatic segmentation of blood vessels in fundus images is important to assist ophthalmologists in diagnosis. However, automatic segmentation for Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) blood vessels has not been fully investigated due to various difficulties, such as vessel complexity. In addition, there are only a few publicly available OCTA image data sets for training and validating segmentation algorithms. To address these issues, we constructed a wild-field retinal OCTA segmentation data set, the Retinal Vessels Images in OCTA (REVIO) dataset. Second, we propose a new retinal vessel segmentation network based on spatial and frequency domain networks (SFNet). The proposed model are tested on three benchmark data sets including REVIO, ROSE and OCTA-500. The experimental results show superior performance on segmentation tasks compared to the representative methods."
"T-cell large granular lymphocyte clones that persist over time and that exhibit molecular and immunophenotypic features closely resembling those of T-cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia (T-LGLL) may be detectable in individuals who lack any clinical or laboratory features supporting a diagnosis of a T-cell malignancy. This condition represents a potential precursor state termed T-cell clones of uncertain significance (T-CUS). T-CUS represents the even more benign extreme of the wide spectrum of clonal T-large granular lymphocyte proliferations, emphasizing the need for an appropriate multiparametric diagnostic assessment that avoids misdiagnosis of T-cell neoplasia. This approach should overcome numerical cut-offs as the sole criteria to differentiate the benign condition from the related malignancies. In particular, genomic aberrancies might prospectively identify individuals who are at risk of progression to a full-blown T-cell malignancy. We herein discuss the significance of these T-cell clones in both healthy and disease states, suggesting molecular assays for tracking early steps of disease."
"Dyspnoea is often found months and years later in the ""long-covid"" syndrome, impairing quality of life and further perpetuating anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorders. Physiotherapy was recommended as a treatment in long-covid, but there is still insufficient evidence on its effectiveness."
"Due to the persistent threat of antibiotic resistance posed by Gram-negative pathogens, the discovery of new antimicrobial agents is of critical importance. In this study, we employed deep learning-guided directed evolution to explore the chemical space of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), which present promising alternatives to traditional small-molecule antibiotics. Utilizing a fine-tuned protein language model tailored for small dataset learning, we achieved structural modifications of the lipopolysaccharide-binding domain (LBD) derived from Marsupenaeus japonicus, a prawn species of considerable value in aquaculture and commercial fisheries. The engineered LBDs demonstrated exceptional activity against a range of Gram-negative pathogens. Drawing inspiration from evolutionary principles, we elucidated the bactericidal mechanism through molecular dynamics simulations and mapped the directed evolution pathways using a ladderpath framework. This work highlights the efficacy of explainable few-shot learning in the rational design of AMPs through directed evolution."
"Recent advances in emotion recognition through Artificial Intelligence (AI) have demonstrated potential applications in various fields (e.g., healthcare, advertising, and driving technology), with electroencephalogram (EEG)-based approaches demonstrating superior accuracy compared to facial or vocal methods due to their resistance to intentional manipulation. This study presents a novel approach to enhance EEG-based emotion estimation accuracy by emphasizing temporal features and efficient parameter space exploration. We propose a model combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) with an attention mechanism to highlight temporal features in EEG data while optimizing LSTM parameters through Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The attention mechanism assigned weights to LSTM hidden states, and PSO dynamically optimizes the vital parameters, including units, batch size, and dropout rate. Using the DEAP and SEED datasets, which serve as benchmark datasets for emotion estimation research using EEG, we evaluate the model's performance. For the DEAP dataset, we conduct a four-class classification of combinations of high and low valence and arousal states. We perform a three-class classification of negative, neutral, and positive emotions for the SEED dataset. The proposed model achieves an accuracy of 0.9409 on the DEAP dataset, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art accuracy of 0.9100 reported by Lin et al. The model attains an accuracy of 0.9732 on the SEED dataset, recording one of the highest accuracies among the related research. These results demonstrate that integrating the attention mechanism with PSO significantly improves the accuracy of EEG-based emotion estimation, contributing to the advancement of emotion recognition technology."
"Loneliness is intricately connected to social cognition, yet the precise brain mechanisms that underscore their relationship need further exploration. The present study employed a theory of mind processing task that engaged participants in assessing the trajectories of geometric shapes while undergoing fMRI scans. The comprehensive data pool encompassed loneliness assessments and brain imaging data from a cohort of 157 participants. Utilizing a machine learning approach, task-induced functional connectivity data was used to forecast individuals' loneliness scores. The findings unveil that specific patterns of task-induced alterations in brain functional connectivity hold a remarkable capability to anticipate loneliness scores. Further dissection of the data disclosed pivotal nodes, including the prefrontal cortex, temporoparietal junction, and amygdala, among other cerebral regions. Furthermore, functional connectivity among the social network, the default mode network, and somatomotor networks emerged as crucial factors in prediction. Brain regions contributed strongly in prediction are involved in a variety of social cognitive processes, including intention inference, empathy, and information integration. The results illuminate the association between brain functional connectivity induced by social cognition and loneliness, which enhance the comprehensive understanding of this complex emotional state and may have implications for its diagnosis and intervention."
"Piroplasmas (Babesia and Theileria) are protozoa transmitted from ticks to warm-blooded animals. Some species of them, such as Babesia microti, can cause zoonotic infections. Although B. microti infections in wild rodents and ticks in Japan have been frequently reported in Hokkaido, there are only older reports of zoonotic babesiosis in other areas of Japan. In this study, we investigated prevalence of piroplasma species in wild rodents and ticks collected in near Gifu City, a central region in Japan, between 2021 and 2023 using nested-PCR to detect the 18S rRNA gene sequences of various piroplasma species. Among 87 wild rodents, piroplasma gene sequences detected in four large Japanese field mice (Apodemus speciosus) were 100% identical to B. microti Otsu/Hobetsu type. Notably, the gene detected in one pool of nymphal Haemaphysalis ticks was closely related to Babesia motasi-like isolates recently detected in human patients in South Korea. Additionally, the deer Theileria species, which has been widely detected throughout Asia, including Japan, was detected from Haemapyhsalis ticks. Our results indicate that a variety of piroplasmas, including piroplasmas that are potentially pathogenic to humans, such as B. microti Otsu/Hobetsu types and protozoa closely related to B. motasi, are distributed in the Gifu City area."
The social identity approach offers a more parsimonious and more comprehensive explanation for historical myths' assumed coalition-building function than the target article's proposed mechanism based on fitness interdependence. Target article's assertion that social identity theory cannot explain certain characteristics of historical myths is based on a narrow interpretation of the social identity approach.
"Resveratrol and its glucoside, piceid, are the primary stilbenes present in wine. These compounds are well known for their pharmaceutical properties. However, these compounds can undergo chemical transformations in wines, such as polymerization in the presence of metallic reagents. This study investigates the oxidative coupling of resveratrol and piceid to form dimers, including δ-viniferin and δ-viniferin-diglucoside. These dimers were synthesized using silver acetate. The formation of these stilbenes was monitored in wine model solutions and red wines. The results indicated that resveratrol and piceid underwent transformation during heat treatment, forming their respective dimers. The polymerization of both compounds is temperature-dependent, with higher conversion rates at elevated temperatures. Notably, piceid was more reactive than resveratrol in wine. Finally, the anti-inflammatory effects of these compounds were evaluated on the RAW 264.7 macrophage cell line."
"Diagnosing chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) can be challenging, leading to delays in initiating therapy. As disability in CIDP is mainly dependent on axonal damage, the impact of delayed immunotherapy remains unclear. We multimodally investigated the clinical outcomes of patients with early CIDP regarding different treatment strategies and time points."
"The healthcare sector in the United States has increased its greenhouse gas emissions by 6% since 2010 and today has the highest per capita greenhouse gas emissions globally. Assessing the environmental impact and material use through the methods of life cycle assessment (LCA) and material flow analysis (MFA) of healthcare procedures, products, and processes can aid in developing impactful strategies for reductions, yet such assessments have not been performed in orthopaedic surgery. We conducted an LCA and an MFA on an ACL reconstruction (ACLR). The ACLR served as a test case on the assumption that lessons learned would likely prove relevant to other orthopaedic procedures."
"Spasticity is a common complication of stroke, which is related to poor motor recovery and limitations in the performance of activities. Both transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) are effective treatment methods for poststroke spasticity (PSS). However, there is no existing study exploring the safety and effectiveness of TMS combined with ESWT for PSS."
"Advanced imaging in the management of childhood bone and joint infection (BJI) has the potential to improve disease outcomes. Knowledge about the optimal timing for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in relation to both surgically and nonsurgically managed BJI is limited. This study examines the impact of MRI timing on number of surgeries, length of stay (LOS), hospitalization cost, and disease recurrence in childhood BJI."
"Multidisciplinary care is paramount in patient-specific decision making, especially as pertaining to oral cavity squamous cell cancer (OCSCC) treatment. Protracted surgery-postoperative-radiation (S-PORT) has a detrimental impact on OCSCC patients' outcomes. This study examined the impact of surgeon-radiation oncologist dyads on the treatment of OCSCC, focusing on S-PORT interval and disease specific outcomes."
"Engineering of the drug half-life in vivo has become an integral part of modern biopharmaceutical development due to the fact that many proteins/peptides with therapeutic potential are quickly cleared by kidney filtration after injection and, thus, circulate only a few hours in humans (or just minutes in mice)."
"Understanding the spatial ecology of commercially exploited species is vital for their conservation. Atlantic bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus, ABT) are increasingly observed in northeast Atlantic waters, yet knowledge of these individuals' spatial ecology remains limited. We investigate the horizontal and vertical habitat use of ABT (158 to 241 cm curved fork length; CFL) tracked from waters off the United Kingdom (UK) using pop-up satellite archival tags (n = 63). Analyses reveal distinctive movements from the UK to the Bay of Biscay (BoB) and Central North Atlantic between September and December, and size-specific habitat preferences in May and July-all ABT < 175 cm CFL inhabiting the BoB and 73% of ABT ≥ 175 the Mediterranean Sea. All ABT tracked for more than 300 days (n = 25) returned to waters off the UK the following year, where most stayed (n = 22; 88%) and three continuing north with deployments ending off northwest Ireland. ABT mostly occupied waters between 0 and 20 m (daytime 49 ± 6% of time; nighttime 71 ± 6%). Vertical habitat use was coupled with illumination, mean depth occupied, maximum depth reached, and vertical movement rate increased during the daytime and when moons were brightest. These data provide valuable insights into the spatial ecology of ABT reoccupying northerly foraging areas following decades of absence."
"Gastroparesis is a condition with a growing incidence and few effective treatments. In recent years, GPOEM has demonstrated its superiority to other existing treatments. We report here on our experience in which 34 patients underwent GPOEM, with 23 patients assessed for symptoms and quality of life before and after the procedure. We measured an average clinical success rate of 73.92% and an excellent risk profile with only two minor complications. The procedure was very well accepted by patients as all would be willing to undergo it again. Patients for whom GPOEM was successful saw a major improvement in their quality of life, which returned to normal, and, for those suffering from reflux, a significant reduction in their PPI treatment. As for the patients for whom the procedure was not a success, we found that they were at high risk of somatization, so screening questionnaires should be considered pre-intervention to screen these patients and avoid unnecessary procedures."
"Anakinra has dramatically improved the management of systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA) over the last decade. Nevertheless, management remains inconsistent; corticosteroids are still frequently used. We analyzed the course of SJIA in children treated with anakinra according to the time of treatment initiation after disease onset."
"This study introduces an innovative bio-based sorbent bead crafted by integrating chitosan (CS) biopolymers, Fe(NO3)3 and polydopamine nanoparticles (PDA NPs) via glutaraldehyde crosslinking. The primary focus of this study was the concurrent separation of diverse tetracycline antibiotics (TCs), followed by rigorous reversed-phase liquid chromatography analysis. The fabricated CS/Fe@PDA sorbent beads were comprehensively characterized using scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, revealing a surface rich in active carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and oxygen (O) moieties. The proposed method demonstrated substantial analytical robustness, enabling the sorbent bead to detect low concentrations of TCs, with limit of detection values ranging from 142 to 303 μg L-1. Notably, the established linear range of 450-2000 μg L-1 extended the applicability of this approach to food and pharmaceutical product analysis. This study anticipated a paradigm shift in sample pre-treatment methodologies for TC analysis and envisions CS/Fe@PDA beads as a valuable tool for further advancements in separation science. The proposed bio-sorbent introduced a promising avenue for optimizing TC analysis, contributing to broader goals of food safety and pharmaceutical quality assurance. The results and insights from this study are expected to provide valuable inputs for ongoing efforts of the Food and Drug Administration to enhance analytical methodologies for food and drug safety."
"Understanding sleep stages is crucial for diagnosing sleep disorders, developing treatments, and studying sleep's impact on overall health. With the growing availability of affordable brain monitoring devices, the volume of collected brain data has increased significantly. However, analyzing these data, particularly when using the gold standard multi-lead electroencephalogram (EEG), remains resource-intensive and time-consuming. To address this challenge, automated brain monitoring has emerged as a crucial solution for cost-effective and efficient EEG data analysis. A critical component of sleep analysis is detecting transitions between wakefulness and sleep states. These transitions offer valuable insights into sleep quality and quantity, essential for diagnosing sleep disorders, designing effective interventions, enhancing overall health and well-being, and studying sleep's effects on cognitive function, mood, and physical performance. This study presents a novel EEG feature extraction pipeline for the accurate classification of various wake and sleep stages. We propose a noise-robust model-based Kalman filtering (KF) approach to track changes in a time-varying auto-regressive model (TVAR) applied to EEG data during different wake and sleep stages. Our approach involves extracting features, including instantaneous frequency and instantaneous power from EEG, and implementing a two-step classifier for sleep staging. The first step classifies data into wake, REM, and non-REM categories, while the second step further classifies non-REM data into N1, N2, and N3 stages. Evaluation on the extended Sleep-EDF dataset (Sleep-EDFx), with 153 EEG recordings from 78 subjects, demonstrated compelling results with classifiers including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM). The best performance was achieved with the LGBM and XGBoost classifiers, yielding an overall accuracy of over 77%, a macro-averaged F1 score of 0.69, and a Cohen's kappa of 0.68, highlighting the efficacy of the proposed method with a remarkably compact and interpretable feature set."
"Individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD) and sickle cell trait (SCT) face an increased risk of complications from COVID-19 due to their susceptibility to infections and venous thromboembolism. We selected 28 studies from 3228 references in bibliographic databases to compare COVID-19 outcomes (hospitalization, ICU admission, need for ventilatory support, thromboembolic events, and mortality) between patients with SCD or SCT and control patients. Compared to control patients, the pooled risk of hospitalization was not significantly higher in those with SCT (odds ratio [OR] 1.13, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.94-1.34) but the pooled risk of death was higher (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.14-1.78). Compared to controls patients, those with SCD had a much higher pooled risk of hospitalization (OR 7.79, 95% CI 5.13-11.81) and a non-different risk of death once hospitalized (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.62-1.10), resulting in an overall increased risk of death (OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.26-2.98)."
"The discovery that homeotic genes in Drosophila are conserved and utilized for embryonic development throughout the animal kingdom, including humans, revolutionized the fields of developmental biology and evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo). In a pair of back-to-back papers published in Cell in 1984, researchers at the Biozentrum in Basel, Switzerland, showed that the homeobox - previously identified as a sequence shared by homeotic genes in Drosophila - was also present in the genome of diverse animals. The first paper (McGinnis et al., 1984a) showed that genomes of both invertebrates and vertebrates contain sequences that cross-hybridized with Drosophila homeobox probes. The second paper (Carrasco et al., 1984) identified a cross-hybridizing sequence in the model system Xenopus laevis. They then isolated the first vertebrate homeobox-containing gene by cloning and sequencing of the corresponding genomic region. Finally, they showed that this gene (AC1, later renamed HoxC6) was expressed during embryonic development, the first evidence that developmentally expressed Drosophila genes could be used to isolate regulators of vertebrate embryonic development. These findings led to a flurry of activity in the evo-devo field, initially focused on isolating Hox genes across diverse species, and then expanding to isolation of other gene families based on Drosophila orthologs, an approach that continues today. This led to the notion of a conserved genetic toolkit for embryonic development, currently accepted, but unexpected at the time of its discovery. We attempt to provide some context for the sea-change in thinking that these discoveries brought about by referring to Jean Piaget's theories about the sequential acquisition of scientific knowledge."
"The efficacy of rupatadine for the treatment of AR has been confirmed in numerous clinical studies, however there are very few studies on asian patients."
"Drought is one of the most devastating causes of yield losses in crops like maize, and the anticipated increases in severity and duration of drought spells due to climate change pose an imminent threat to agricultural productivity. To understand the drought response, phenotypic and molecular studies are typically performed at a given time point after drought onset, representing a steady-state adaptation response. Because growth is a dynamic process, we monitored the drought response with high temporal resolution and examined cellular and transcriptomic changes after rehydration at 4 and 6 days after leaf four appearance. These data showed that division zone activity is a determinant for full organ growth recovery upon rehydration. Moreover, a prolonged maintenance of cell division by the ectopic expression of PLASTOCHRON1 extends the ability to resume growth after rehydration. The transcriptome analysis indicated that GROWTH-REGULATING FACTORS (GRFs) affect leaf growth by impacting cell division duration, which was confirmed by a prolonged recovery potential of the GRF1-overexpression line after rehydration. Finally, we used a multiplex genome editing approach to evaluate the most promising differentially expressed genes from the transcriptome study and as such narrowed down the gene space from 40 to seven genes for future functional characterization."
"The score for prediction of postoperative respiratory complications in infants and children (SPORC-C) was recently reported. The score was developed using a large cohort of patients by applying a multivariate model, then internally and externally validated on a different cohort of patients. In order to encourage use of this score, an online calculator (https://sites.google.com/view/sporc-for-children/home) was also developed, allowing identification of patients at low and high risk for postoperative respiratory complications. We review current evidence on algorithms developed to predict postoperative respiratory complications, including how and when such scoring systems should be used in daily practice to improve the overall safety of paediatric patients."
"Previous research has established that juveniles who experience negative parental influence are more likely to engage in problem and offending behavior. Less attention has been given to the possibility that criminal thinking styles might partially explain this relationship. This study examined the negative parental influences and criminal thinking styles of 1,354 juvenile offenders to establish that both negative parental influences and criminal thinking are significantly associated with juvenile problem and offending behavior. Further, the analysis showed that juvenile criminal thinking (proactive, reactive, and general) might mediate the relationship between negative parental influences and problem behavior. Implications for such findings are discussed."
"This article aims to characterize Indigenous people aged 18-23 of the Xukuru do Ororubá ethnic group, Pernambuco state, Brazil, regarding the use of dental services, self-perceived oral health, oral hygiene practices and caries experience, and socioeconomic and demographic aspects. This population-based cross-sectional study is nested in a cohort study that started in 2010 and was conducted in the Indigenous territory in 2018. Oral examinations and questionnaires were conducted with 131 Indigenous people. Data were collected using Epi Info software and the SPSS 20.0 statistical program was used for descriptive statistics. R software was adopted to compare the caries experience results obtained with the National Oral Health Survey (SB Brasil 2010). The caries experience verified by the DMFT Index had a mean of 7.4, with the mean Index components corresponding to 22.8 for healthy teeth, 2.4 for decayed teeth, 0.2 for filled/carious teeth, 3.5 for filled teeth, and 1.4 for missing teeth. The oral health condition of Indigenous people is characterized by significant inequality when compared to the results of epidemiological surveys conducted in the country involving other population groups."

"Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy (PEG) tube insertion, a routine procedure for long-term enteral nutrition, serves as a crucial intervention for patients who are incapable of tolerating oral intake or meeting adequate nutritional requirements. PEG tube placement carries complications like bleeding and infection. Impact of PEG tubes on the 30-day and long-term mortality in HIV patients is unknown. Despite the ongoing utilization of PEG tubes in HIV patients, a comprehensive exploration of its outcomes is yet to be explored. We intended to study the impact of HIV positive status on post-PEG mortality and review other PEG tube related complications."
"Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) is a gut microbial metabolite derived from dietary l-carnitine and choline. High plasma TMAO levels are associated with cardiovascular disease and overall mortality, but little is known about the associations of TMAO and related metabolites with the risk of kidney function decline among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD)."
"Cognitive decline and late-onset dementia pose significant challenges in aging societies, and many dementia cases could be prevented or delayed through modification of associated risk factors, many of which are tied to cardiovascular and metabolic dysfunction. As individuals age, the blood-brain barrier becomes more permeable, easing the exchange of molecules between the bloodstream and the brain. Consequently, blood-based biological markers (so-called biomarkers) provide a minimally invasive and accessible means of accessing molecular changes associated with aging and neurodegeneration."
"Salinity stress disrupts water uptake and nutrient absorption, causing reduced photosynthesis, stunted growth, and decreased crop yields in plants. The use of indole acetic acid (IAA), arginine (AN), and mango fruit waste biochar (MFWB) can be effective methods to overcome this problem. Indole acetic acid (IAA) is a natural auxin hormone that aids cell elongation and division, thereby increasing plant height and branching. L-arginine, an amino acid, is crucial for plant defense mechanisms, forming proline, polyamines, and nitric oxide, which regulate biological activities and prevent oxidative damage. Mango fruit waste biochar enhances soil fertility and water retention, thereby enhancing fruit development and yield. This study investigates the effects of combining IAA and AN as amendments to fenugreek, with and without MFWB. Four treatments (control, 2mM IAA, 250 mg/L AN, and 250 mg/L AN + 2mM IAA) study were conducted in four replications using a completely randomized design. Results demonstrate that the 250 mg/L AN + 2mM IAA with MFWB treatment led to a significant rise in fenugreek plant length (30.26%), plant fresh weight (36.37%), and plant dry weight (15.78%) over the control under salinity stress. There was a notable increase in chlorophyll a (5.13%), chlorophyll b (14.06%), total chlorophyll (7.79%), and shoot N, P, K from the control under salinity stress also showing the potential of 250 mg/L AN + 2mM IAA with MFWB. In conclusion, applying 250 mg/L AN + 2mM IAA with MFWB is a strategy for alleviating salinity stress in fenugreeks."
"Polypharmacy is commonly encountered by providers caring for patients with medically complex and palliative care needs in many settings. The purpose of this quality improvement project was to measure the impact of an evidence-based educational deprescribing intervention on polypharmacy rate and provider confidence and knowledge in the nursing home. We invited providers working in 52 nursing homes to attend a 1-hour-long educational deprescribing session. Twenty-one nurse practitioners and 1 physician assistant across 11 states participated in the intervention. Provider confidence level related to deprescribing improved in all categories, with statistical significance demonstrated with both paired t test and Wilcoxon signed rank test ( P < .001). The polypharmacy rate 3 months after the intervention decreased more in centers where a provider had attended the training. Additional open-ended data about experiences with and barriers to deprescribing were collected and analyzed. The findings from this quality improvement project demonstrate that an educational intervention focused on providers practicing in the nursing home setting can improve deprescribing confidence and reduce polypharmacy rates. These findings may be used to implement similar deprescribing education programs for palliative care nurses and providers that prioritize goals of care for patients living with serious illness."
Available guidelines lack in indications on surgical standard in Ulcerative Colitis (UC) AIMS: To determine the role of surgical strategies of colectomy and proctectomy with pouch-anal-anastomosis (IPAA) on functional outcomes in a nationwide population multicenter study. The secondary aims consisted of perioperative outcomes and complications.
"Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) represent a response mechanism in which activated neutrophils release DNA-based webs, adorned with histones and neutrophil proteases, to capture and eliminate invasive microorganisms. However, when these neutrophils become excessively activated, much more proteases associated with NETs are liberated into surrounding tissues or bloodstreams, thereby altering the cellular milieu and causing tissue damage. Recent research has revealed that NETs may play significant roles in the emergence and progression of various diseases, spanning from infections, inflammation to autoimmune disorders and cancers. In this review, we delve deeply into the intricate and complex mechanisms that underlie the formation of NETs and their profound interplay with various clinical pathologies. We aim to describe the application perspectives of NETs related proteins in specific disease diagnosis and treatment."
"A recent paper claims that a newly proposed method classifies EEG data recorded from subjects viewing ImageNet stimuli better than two prior methods. However, the analysis used to support that claim is based on confounded data. We repeat the analysis on a large new dataset that is free from that confound. Training and testing on aggregated supertrials derived by summing trials demonstrates that the two prior methods achieve statistically significant above-chance accuracy while the newly proposed method does not."
The aim of this review was to summarise the current knowledge on host-related factors that contribute to the development and severity of staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS) in children.
"Tissue-level collaterals (TLC), which quantify the state of arterial blood flow transiting through cerebral ischemic tissue, have been shown to be related to the clinical outcomes of acute ischemic stroke (AIS), regardless of the arterial collateral status on computed tomography angiography(CTA). Herein, we investigated whether venous outflow (VO) profiles on computed tomographic perfusion (CTP) were linked to TLC, regardless of the arterial collateral status."
"Several limited midcarpal arthrodeses have been used in the treatment of midcarpal osteoarthritis as part of scapholunate advanced collapse and scaphoid nonunion advanced collapse. There is no consensus on whether two-carpal arthrodesis (2CA), three-carpal arthrodesis (3CA), bicolumnar arthrodesis, or four-carpal arthrodesis (FCA) results in the best outcomes. The objective of this study was to determine whether there is a difference in outcomes in patients undergoing FCA, 3CA, 2CA, or bicolumnar arthrodesis for midcarpal osteoarthritis."
"In the United States, sport is a common form of youth physical activity (PA) with demonstrated health benefits. However, limited longitudinal dataexists on the psychosocial determinants and consequences of youth sport participation. This study examined grade 6 (11-12-year-old) predictors of high school organized sport participation and effects of high school sport participation on age 26 behavior, mental health and wellbeing."
"During the last decade, artificial intelligence (AI) was applied to nearly all domains of human activity, including scientific research. It is thus warranted to ask whether AI thinking should be durably involved in biomedical research. This problem was addressed by examining three complementary questions (i) What are the major barriers currently met by biomedical investigators? It is suggested that during the last 2 decades there was a shift towards a growing need to elucidate complex systems, and that this was not sufficiently fulfilled by previously successful methods such as theoretical modeling or computer simulation (ii) What is the potential of AI to meet the aforementioned need? it is suggested that recent AI methods are well-suited to perform classification and prediction tasks on multivariate systems, and possibly help in data interpretation, provided their efficiency is properly validated. (iii) Recent representative results obtained with machine learning suggest that AI efficiency may be comparable to that displayed by human operators. It is concluded that AI should durably play an important role in biomedical practice. Also, as already suggested in other scientific domains such as physics, combining AI with conventional methods might generate further progress and new applications, involving heuristic and data interpretation."

"A 77-year-old professional gold craftsman ingested a white powder used in goldsmithing, mistaking the powder for a health supplement. He detected a strange taste and immediately fell sick, reported the incident to 911, and was taken to the emergency room. He died approximately 8.5 h post-ingestion despite treatment. There were no significant findings in the autopsy, the victim's heart blood sample, gastric contents, and the white powder the victim had taken were submitted to the department of forensic toxicology. Using scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive X-ray analysis, potassium and gold (Au) were detected in the white powder. Ion chromatography analysis detected cyanide. Concentrations of cyanide were 0.5 mg/L in heart blood and 13.3 mg/L in gastric contents. Qualitative and quantitative analyses of Au in the heart blood sample and gastric contents using inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry detected concentrations of 79.8 mg/L and 2010.1 mg/L, respectively. Au and cyanide synergistically enhance cytotoxicity through inhibition of detoxification and increasing intracellular accumulation. In the present case, the detected blood cyanide concentration was sub or minimally lethal, and the blood Au concentration was high. The cause of the victim's death was the combined toxicity of Au and cyanide."
"Sepsis, a leading cause of death in hospitals, can be defined as a dysregulated host inflammatory response to infection, which can lead to tissue damage, organ failure and cardiovascular complications. Although there is no cure for sepsis, the condition is typically managed with broad-spectrum antibiotics to eliminate any potential bacterial source of infection. However, a potential side effect of antibiotic treatment is the enhanced release of bacterial extracellular vesicles (BEVs), membrane-bound nanoparticles containing proteins and other biological molecules from their parent bacterium. Some of the Gram-negative extracellular vesicle (EV) cargo, including peptidoglycan associated lipoprotein and outer membrane protein A, have been shown to induce both acute and chronic inflammation in host tissue. It was hypothesized that the antibiotic concentration and mechanism of action may affect the amount of released BEVs, which could potentially exacerbate the host inflammatory response. This study evaluated nine clinically relevant antibiotics for their effect on EV release from Escherichia coli. Several beta-lactam antibiotics caused significantly more EV release, while quinolone and aminoglycoside antibiotics caused less vesiculation. Further study is warranted to corroborate the correlation between an antibiotic's mechanism of action and its effect on EV release, but these results underline the importance of antibiotic choice when treating patients with sepsis."
"Periprosthetic fractures and their associated complications present significant challenges for orthopaedic surgeons. It is important to provide an overview of the current management of periprosthetic fractures, including techniques for osteosynthesis and revision total hip and knee arthroplasty, as well as special considerations for periprosthetic acetabular fractures, periprosthetic tibial fractures, and interprosthetic femur fractures. In addition, the guiding principles for the management of potential subsequent complications including infection, nonunion, and instability are discussed."
"Liver cancer remains one of the most formidable challenges in modern medicine, characterized by its high incidence and mortality rate. Emerging evidence underscores the critical roles of the immune microenvironment in tumor initiation, development, prognosis, and therapeutic responsiveness. However, the composition of the immune microenvironment of liver cancer (LC-IME) and its association with clinicopathological significance remain unelucidated. In this review, we present the recent developments related to the use of artificial intelligence (AI) for studying the immune microenvironment of liver cancer, focusing on the deciphering of complex high-throughput data. Additionally, we discussed the current challenges of data harmonization and algorithm interpretability for studying LC-IME."
"Fathers remain under-represented in early childhood obesity prevention research and interventions, despite growing evidence that paternal biopsychosocial factors and behaviors from pre- and post-conception can influence lifelong offspring health. Informed by a literature review of high-quality evidence, ""CO-Parent"" (childhood obesity-Parent) is a new conceptual model underpinned by couple interdependence theory and a socioecological framework. Literature was searched for the concepts parental AND weight-related behaviors AND child weight or weight-related behaviors, in databases including MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Global Health, Scopus, and SocINDEX. Prior evidence syntheses were prioritized as source data to inform model development. ""CO-Parent"" illustrates the interdependent and independent effects of maternal and paternal weight, weight-related behaviors, and well-being, across preconception, pregnancy, postpartum, and the early years on child weight-related behaviors and weight up to age five. The influences of public policy, social, environmental, economic, community, and other complex modifiable mediating factors are included in the model. The ""CO-Parent"" conceptual model paves the way for a paradigm shift by recognizing fathers as key figures in early childhood obesity prevention initiatives, encouraging them to ""share the motherload."" It highlights both the independent and interdependent roles fathers play in the epidemiology of obesity starting from preconception. CO-Parent also provides the foundations necessary to guide future theory and research to be more inclusive of fathers to further understanding of the independent and interdependent influences of parents in early childhood obesity prevention."

"Computed tomography (CT) is the standard of care imaging in craniomaxillofacial (CMF) trauma. Despite the clear advantages of high-resolution multiplanar and three-dimensional reconstructions, which facilitate accurate diagnosis and provide intraoperative (IO) real-time visual feedback, CT's main drawbacks remain availability, cost, and high radiation exposure. The decision to perform a CT scan is based on the integration of the patient's trauma mechanism, clinical examination, subjective judgment of the CMF surgeon, and the complexity of the surgery if used IO. Handheld point-of-care ultrasound is a small, portable device that can provide valuable additional data directing clinical decisions for CT referral in minor trauma cases and assist IO maneuvers. We describe a novel handheld point-of-care ultrasound application concept as a clinical supplementary tool in CMF trauma diagnosis and surgery."

"Percutaneous auricular nerve stimulation (neuromodulation) is an analgesic technique involving the percutaneous implantation of multiple leads at various points on/around the ear followed by the delivery of electric current using an external pulse generator. A device is currently available within the USA cleared to treat symptoms from opioid withdrawal, and multiple reports suggest a possible postoperative analgesic effect. The current randomized, controlled pilot study was undertaken to (1) determine the feasibility and optimize the protocol for a subsequent definitive clinical trial and (2) estimate the treatment effect of auricular neuromodulation on postoperative pain and opioid consumption following total knee arthroplasty."
"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is characterized by poor responsiveness to immune evasion and immunotherapy. RNA 7-methylguanine (m7G) modification plays a key role in tumorigenesis. However, the mechanisms by which m7G-modified RNA metabolism affects tumor progression are not fully understood, nor is the contribution of m7G-modified RNA to the CRC immune microenvironment."
"Heterotrophic microbes rely on host-derived carbon sources for their growth and survival. Depriving pathogens of plant carbon is therefore a promising strategy for protecting plants from disease and reducing yield losses. Importantly, this carbon starvation-mediated resistance is expected to be more broad-spectrum and durable than race-specific R-gene-mediated resistance. Although sugars are well characterized as major carbon sources for bacteria, emerging evidence suggests that plant-derived lipids are likely to be an essential carbon source for some fungal microbes, particularly biotrophs. Here, we comprehensively discuss the dual roles of carbon sources (mainly sugars and lipids) and their transport processes in immune signalling and microbial nutrition. We summarize recent findings revealing the crucial roles of lipids as susceptibility factors at all stages of pathogen infection. In particular, we discuss the potential pathways by which lipids and other plant carbon sources are delivered to biotrophs, including protein-mediated transport, vesicle trafficking and autophagy. Finally, we highlight knowledge gaps and offer suggestions for clarifying the mechanisms that underlie nutrient uptake by biotrophs, providing guidance for future research on the application of carbon starvation-mediated resistance."

"Social workers are uniquely positioned to support clients in crisis to reduce firearm access. However, many report needing support in navigating conversations and awareness of available options. Authors sought to understand the decision-making process social workers use, to choose which interventions (e.g., out-of-home storage) are appropriate to reduce firearm access for clients in crisis. Ten individual and group semistructured interviews were conducted with 29 social workers in Washington State; participants discussed experiences with clients at risk of harming themselves and/or others with a firearm and responded to two case examples. Grounded theory was used to develop an action plan model describing how social workers choose which interventions to pursue. Participants described two categories that influence their decision-making process for reducing firearm access for clients in crisis. The first category, sociopolitical context, included structural intersectionality, policies, professional ethics, workplace environment, and values. These influenced the second category, collaborative safety planning intervention for reducing firearm access, a process that included considering client factors, social worker actions, and options for reducing firearm access. This model can be used to develop trainings for social workers to educate them on processes to reduce firearm access for clients in crisis."
"Age-related changes in the BOLD response could reflect neurovascular coupling modifications rather than simply impairments in neural functioning. In this study, we propose the use of a sparse dynamic causal model (sDCM) to decouple neuronal and vascular factors in the BOLD signal, with the aim of characterizing the whole-brain spatial pattern of hemodynamic sensitivity to healthy aging, as well as to test the role of hemodynamic features as independent predictors in an age-classification model. sDCM was applied to the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data of a cohort of 126 healthy individuals in a wide age range (31 females), providing reliable estimates of the hemodynamic response function (HRF) for each subject and each region of interest. Then, some features characterizing each HRF curve were extracted and used to fit a multivariate logistic regression model predicting the age class of each individual. Ultimately, we tested the final predictive model on an independent dataset of 338 healthy subjects (173 females) selected from the Human Connectome Project in Aging and Development cohorts. Our results entail the spatial heterogeneity of the age effects on the hemodynamic component, since its impact resulted to be strongly region- and population-specific, discouraging any space-invariant-corrective procedures that attempt to correct for vascular factors when carrying out functional studies involving groups with different ages. Moreover, we demonstrated that a strong interaction exists between certain right-hemisphere hemodynamic features and age, further supporting the essential role of the hemodynamic factor as independent predictor of biological aging, rather than a simple confounding variable."
"This study aimed to examine the adaptive functioning status and the impact of epileptic seizures on neurocognitive outcomes in KBG syndrome, a rare genetic neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by pathogenic variants in ANKRD11. A single clinician interviewed individuals and families with genetically confirmed cases of KBG syndrome. Trained professionals also conducted assessments using the Vineland-3 Adaptive Behavior Scales. The assessment covered the domains of communication, daily living skills, socialization, and maladaptive behaviors, and then compared individuals with and without epilepsy. Further comparisons were made with data from interviews and participants' medical records. Thirty-nine individuals (22 males, 17 females) with KBG syndrome, confirmed through genetic analysis, were interviewed via videoconferencing, followed by Vineland-3 assessment by trained raters. Individuals with KBG syndrome came from 36 unique families spanning 11 countries. While the KBG cohort displayed lower overall adaptive behavior composite scores compared with the average population, several members displayed standard scores at or higher than average, as well as higher scores compared with those with the neurodevelopmental disorder Ogden syndrome. Within the KBG cohort, males consistently scored lower than females across all domains, but none of these categories reached statistical significance. While the group with epilepsy exhibited overall lower scores than the nonseizure group in every category, statistical significance was only reached in the written communication subdomain. Our research provides insights that can aid in epilepsy screening and inform assessment strategies for neurocognitive functioning in those with this condition. The cohort performed overall higher than expected, with outliers existing in both directions. Although our results suggest that seizures might influence the trajectory of KBG syndrome, the approaching but overall absence of statistical significance between study groups underscores the need for a more extensive cohort to discern subtle variations in functioning."
"The ProQoL (30 items) is a widely used instrument of work-related quality of life for health care workers. Recently, a shorter 9-item version of the ProQoL was developed and validated among palliative care workers. The ProQoL-9 consists of three subscales: compassion satisfaction (CS), burnout (BO), and compassion fatigue (CF). Care aides (personal support workers, nursing assistants) are an understudied population in terms of their professional quality of life. It is critical to use validated instruments to measure their experiences. The purpose of this study was to examine the internal consistency and factorial structure of the ProQoL-9 among care aides working in LTC."
"In patients not infected by HIV, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) is characterized by rapid disease progression, difficulty in confirming the diagnosis, and poor prognosis. PCP has also been reported in immunocompromised patients receiving chemotherapy, most often for hematologic tumors, although some patients receiving treatment for breast cancer have been affected. Dose-dense chemotherapy (DDC) which is performed with shorter dosing intervals than standard chemotherapy and is now widely used in clinical practice. However, adverse events have been reported, including infections associated with decreased immune status. PCP infection is considerably more challenging to diagnose and treat than bacterial or viral infections. Furthermore, organizing pneumonia (OP), a pulmonary lesion of PCP, is infrequent and requires caution on the part of clinicians, as protozoan infections require different forms of treatment. Although we initially suspected bacterial, viral, and drug-induced pneumonia in our patient and started treatment with antibiotics, antifungals, and prednisolone, the final diagnosis was OP. The pulmonary lesion of PCP was treated with systemic corticosteroids, leading to recovery. There have been no similar reports of PCP during chemotherapy for malignant disease; however, the possibility of OP should be considered during chemotherapy. Herein, we report a case of PCP during preoperative DDC for advanced breast cancer."
"Inflatable penile prosthesis (IPP) is a surgical treatment for erectile dysfunction refractory to medical therapy or for those who desire permanent treatment. Complications like mechanical failure and infection may necessitate reoperation, and patients with certain risk factors remain predisposed to reoperation. We retrospectively analyzed 530 patients undergoing primary IPP implantation at a large, urban, multiethnic hospital with a high volume of IPP implantations. Primary outcomes were reoperation due to any reason and reoperation due to infection. Patient characteristics and intraoperative factors were compared between those requiring reoperation and those not requiring reoperation. Overall, 12.1% of patients underwent reoperation, primarily due to infection, with a median time to reoperation of 4 months. Analysis revealed an increased likelihood of reoperation with Peyronie's disease (OR = 2.47), hemoglobin A1c over 8 (OR = 2.25), active smoking (OR = 2.75), and estimated blood loss (EBL) ≥ 25cc (OR = 2.45). A decreased likelihood of reoperation was observed when Arista™ powder was used intraoperatively (OR = 0.38). Reoperation specifically due to infection was associated with an infrapubic approach (OR = 2.56) and hypertension (OR = 9.12). Our findings confirm smoking and diabetes as risk factors for reoperation, while also providing insights into factors like estimated blood loss and Arista™ powder use. However, long-term survival rates were limited by loss to follow-up. (Clinical trial registration N/A)."
"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is characterized by high rates of disability and death and has become a public health problem that threatens human life and health worldwide. HPA axis disorder and neuroinflammation are two common biological abnormalities in MDD patients. Hsp90 is an important molecular chaperone that is widely distributed in the organism. Hsp90 binds to the co-chaperone and goes through a molecular chaperone cycle to complete its regulation of the client protein. Numerous studies have demonstrated that Hsp90 regulates how the HPA axis reacts to stress and how GR, the HPA axis' responsive substrate, matures. In addition, Hsp90 exhibits pro-inflammatory effects that are closely related to neuroinflammation in MDD. Currently, Hsp90 inhibitors have made some progress in the treatment of a variety of human diseases, but they still need to be improved. Further insight into the role of Hsp90 in MDD provides new ideas for the development of new antidepressant drugs targeting Hsp90."
To (i) identify threshold values of presenteeism measurement instruments that reflect unacceptable work state in employed r-axSpA patients; (ii) determine whether those thresholds accurately predict future adverse work outcomes (AWO) (sick leave or short/long-term disability); (iii) evaluate the performance of traditional health-outcomes for r-axSpA; and (iv) explore whether thresholds are stable across contextual factors.
"Primary head and neck lymphoid neoplasms(PHNLN) are described as a series of lymphoid system-derived neoplasms which originally arising from head and neck region. Our study is aimed to present a panoramic view of PHNLN among adolescent and young adult(AYA) patients aged from 15 to 39 years-old. The individual patient information was obtained from Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results(SEER) database. Male patients outnumbered female patients in most pathological subtypes, with noticeable male predilection observed in Burkitt lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma(DLBCL). Classical Hodgkin lymphoma(CHL) accounted for 92.23% of Hodgkin lymphoma. Mature B-cell neoplasms constituted the majority of non-Hodgkin lymphoma(NHL). DLBCL was the most common pathological subtype, followed by follicular lymphoma(FL). Tonsil, salivary glands (especially parotid gland) and nasal cavity were the most three frequent extranodal organs involved. Patients with extranodal involvement exhibited worse prognosis compared to those with lymph node confinement. Patients who suffered from precursor NHL and mature T/NK-cell NHL exhibited prolonged disease-specific survival compared to those with HL, PCN and mature B-cell NHL. AYA patients with absence of other SPM showed dramatic lower risk of death than those with occurrence of SPM. Patients with HL had a favourable survival advantage over those with mature B-cell NHL. Patients with precursor NHL and mature T/NK-cell NHL were at remarkable higher risk of death than those with mature B-cell NHL. Our study elucidated the demographics, distribution of anatomic sites and pathological subtypes, and survival outcomes of PHNLN among AYA population, enhancing comprehension of this rare sort of cancer entities."
"Unruptured middle cerebral artery aneurysm (uMCAA) has traditionally been treated with open surgical clipping (SC). Endovascular treatments (EVTs) were designed to reduce surgical risks in these cases. Nevertheless, despite its potential benefits, many surgeons favor SC for uMCAA. This updated meta-analysis aimed to compare the safety, efficacy, and clinical outcomes of SC and EVT for uMCAA."
"Yellowstone National Park is home to the only plains bison population that has continually existed as wildlife, on the same landscape, through the population bottleneck of the late 19th century. Nevertheless, by the early 1900s, only 23 wild bison were known to have survived poaching. Salvation efforts included the addition of 18 females from Montana and 3 bulls from Texas to augment this population. A century later, nuclear microsatellite-based population-level assessment revealed two genetically distinct bison subpopulations. However, in 2016, an analysis of mitochondrial haplotypes showed the two founding lineages were distributed throughout the park. This study is designed to delineate any current substructure in the Yellowstone bison population by strategically sampling the two major summer breeding herds and the two major winter ranges. Population-level metrics were derived using the same microsatellite loci as the original study along with a newly developed set of highly informative bison-specific single nucleotide polymorphisms. Our analyses reveal that the modern bison in Yellowstone National Park currently consists of one interbreeding population, composed of two subunits."
"Fiber is essential for rumen health, microbial fermentation, and the energy supply of herbivores. Even though the study of fecal fiber contents (neutral detergent fiber NDF, acid detergent fiber ADF, and acid detergent lignin ADL) using near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) has allowed investigating nutritional ecology of different herbivore species, NIRS calibrations are species-specific and require a large number of samples for predictions. A multispecies calibration would be an advantage since samples from different herbivores could be used to calibrate a model capable of predicting the fecal fiber content of other herbivores. To date, however, multispecies models have not been developed to predict fiber contents in the feces of herbivores. Here, we fill this gap by calibrating three fiber multispecies models (NDF, ADF and ADL) using fecal samples from domestic and wild herbivore species. We also evaluated the effect of incorporating sodium sulfite in fiber determination protocol. The initial dataset consisting of 445 samples of six herbivore species was used to calibrate (80% of the samples) and validate (20% of the samples) the models. Subsequently, 63 samples of five herbivores not included in the calibration set were used for the external validation of the model. Since sodium sulfite did not significantly improve fecal fiber prediction, our model was developed without this compound. The multispecies models obtained were highly accurate determining NDF, ADF and ADL (R2CAL, coefficient of determination in calibration, ≥ 0.93, R2VAL, coefficient of determination in validation, ≥ 0.91) and independent of external confounders. For external validation, the accuracy in predicting fecal samples in other herbivore species was also satisfactory, with consistently better values for NDF (R2VAL, 0.86-0.94) and ADF (R2VAL, 0.80-0.95) than for ADL (R2VAL, 0.66-0.89). We show that multispecies NIRS calibrations can be used with high accuracy to assess fecal fiber contents across diverse herbivore species. This finding represents a significant advance in the study of the nutritional ecology of herbivores with contrasting foraging patterns. In the future, widening the data range (e.g., species and locations) of the initial dataset could further improve the accuracy of these models."
"The widespread use of wireless networks to transfer an enormous amount of sensitive information has caused a plethora of vulnerabilities and privacy issues. The management frames, particularly authentication and association frames, are vulnerable to cyberattacks and it is a significant concern. Existing research in Wi-Fi attack detection focused on obtaining high detection accuracy while neglecting modern traffic and attack scenarios such as key reinstallation or unauthorized decryption attacks. This study proposed a novel approach using the AWID 3 dataset for cyberattack detection. The retained features were analyzed to assess their transferability, creating a lightweight and cost-effective model. A decision tree with a recursive feature elimination method was implemented for the extraction of the reduced features subset, and an additional feature wlan_radio.signal_dbm was used in combination with the extracted feature subset. Several deep learning and machine learning models were implemented, where DT and CNN achieved promising classification results. Further, feature transferability and generalizability were evaluated, and their detection performance was analyzed across different network versions where CNN outperformed other classification models. The practical implications of this research are crucial for the secure automation of wireless intrusion detection frameworks and tools in personal and enterprise paradigms."
"Patients receiving endovascular treatment for unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs) face varying risks and benefits with antithrombotic management. This study aimed to evaluate the perioperative and long-term effects of antithrombotic strategies, identify the populations that would benefit, and explore the predictive factors affecting the long-term outcomes."
"Stem and progenitor cell mitosis is essential for tissue development and homeostasis. How these cells ensure proper chromosome segregation, and thereby maintain mitotic fidelity, in the complex physiological environment of a living animal is poorly understood. Here we use in situ live-cell imaging of C. elegans germline stem and progenitor cells (GSPCs) to ask how the signaling environment influences stem and progenitor cell mitosis in vivo. Through a candidate screen we identify a new role for the insulin/IGF receptor (IGFR), daf-2, during GSPC mitosis. Mitosis is delayed in daf-2/IGFR mutants, and these delays require canonical, DAF-2/IGFR to DAF-16/FoxO insulin signaling, here acting cell non-autonomously from the soma. Interestingly, mitotic delays in daf-2/IGFR mutants depend on the spindle assembly checkpoint but are not accompanied by a loss of mitotic fidelity. Correspondingly, we show that caloric restriction, which delays GSPC mitosis and compromises mitotic fidelity, does not act via the canonical insulin signaling pathway, and instead requires AMP-activated kinase (AMPK). Together this work demonstrates that GSPC mitosis is influenced by at least two genetically separable signaling pathways and highlights the importance of signaling networks for proper stem and progenitor cell mitosis in vivo."
"Family or friend carers of people with cancer report high levels of depression, anxiety, caregiving strain, and unmet needs. Limited strategies for identification and management of distress have been established among cancer carers. This paper describes the protocol of two linked studies: Study 1a, a distress screening and stepped care pathway feasibility study and Study 1b, a hybrid implementation-effectiveness Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) to assess the benefit of a comprehensive, carer-centred online Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (iCBT) program for carers with anxiety and depression."
We compared the effectiveness and safety of bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (BIC/FTC/TAF) and dolutegravir plus lamivudine (DTG + 3TC) in our cohort of treatment-naive people with HIV (PWH).
"Dietary exposure to aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is a risk factor for the development of hepatocellular carcinomas. Following metabolic activation, AFB1 reacts with guanines to form covalent DNA adducts, which induce high-frequency G > T transversions. The molecular signature associated with these mutational events aligns with the single-base substitution signature 24 (SBS24) in the Catalog of Somatic Mutations in Cancer database. Deficiencies in either base excision repair due to the absence of Nei-like DNA glycosylase 1 (NEIL1) or nucleotide excision repair due to the absence of xeroderma complementation group A protein (XPA) contribute to hepatocellular carcinomas in murine models. In the current study, ultra-low error duplex sequencing was used to characterize mutational profiles in liver DNAs of NEIL1-deficient, XPA-deficient, and DNA repair-proficient mice following neonatal injection of 1 mg/kg AFB1. Analyses of AFB1-induced mutations showed high cosine similarity to SBS24 regardless of repair proficiency status. The absence of NEIL1 resulted in an approximately 30% increase in the frequency of mutations, with the distribution suggesting preferential NEIL1-dependent repair of AFB1 lesions in open chromatin regions. A trend of increased mutagenesis was also observed in the absence of XPA. Consistent with the role of XPA in transcription-coupled repair, mutational profiles in XPA-deficient mice showed disruption of the transcriptional bias in mutations associated with SBS24. Implications: Our findings define the roles of DNA repair pathways in AFB1-induced mutagenesis and carcinogenesis in murine models, with these findings having implications in human health for those with base excision repair and nucleotide excision repair deficiencies."
"The oral pathogen, Porphyromonas gingivalis has a general O-glycosylation system which it utilises to modify hundreds of proteins localised outside of the cytoplasm. The O-glycan is a heptasaccharide that includes a putative L-fucose and N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) as the 5th and 6th sugar residues respectively. The putative L-fucose is expected to be synthesized as GDP-L-fucose involving the enzymes Gmd (PGN_1078) and Fcl (PGN_1079), while GalNAc is putatively epimerised from GlcNAc by GalE (PGN_1614). In this study we created mutants lacking each of these three enzymes and analysed the resultant glycosylation defects. Immunoblot analysis using antibodies against the model glycoproteins Mfa2, PGN_0742 and PGN_1037 detected bands of reduced size, consistent with glycan truncation. Mass spectrometry analysis of tryptic digests of whole cell lysate proteins revealed that O-glycans in the galE mutant were predominantly pentasaccharides consistent with the 6th sugar being GalNAc. For the gmd and fcl mutants, tetrasaccharides were observed confirming the 5th sugar as L-fucose. The confirmation of these sugars also confirmed PGN_1135 as a GalNAc transferase as the previously analysed PGN_1135 mutant produced the same O-glycan truncation as the galE mutant."
"Primary health care (PHC) services face operational challenges due to high patient volumes, leading to complex management needs. Patients access services through booked appointments and walk-in visits, with walk-in visits often facing longer waiting times. No-show appointments are significant contributors to inefficiency in PHC operations, which can lead to an estimated 3%-14% revenue loss, disrupt resource allocation, and negatively impact health care quality. Emirates Health Services (EHS) PHC centers handle over 140,000 visits monthly. Baseline data indicate a 21% no-show rate and an average patient wait time exceeding 16 minutes, necessitating an advanced scheduling and resource management system to enhance patient experiences and operational efficiency."
"Epigenetics plays a vital role in corneal health and diseases. Epigenetic changes regulate the expression of genes by altering the accessibility of chromatin via histone modifications, DNA methylation and miRNAs without altering DNA sequence. Ocular trauma and infections are common causes of corneal damage, vision impairment, and mono/bilateral blindness worldwide. Mounting literature shows that epigenetic modifications can modulate corneal clarity, function, and pathogenesis including inflammation, wound healing, fibrosis, and neovascularization. Additionally, epigenetic modifications can be targeted to reverse corneal pathologies and develop interventional therapies. However, current understanding on how epigenetic modifications lead to corneal abnormalities and diseases is limited. This review provides in-depth knowledge and mechanistic understanding of epigenetics alterations in corneal pathogenesis, and information on potential epigenetic targets for treatment of corneal diseases."
"The authors present a historical overview of NYU-Bellevue Neurosurgery, highlighting key events and influential faculty. Bellevue Hospital, the first public hospital in the US, was established in 1736 and has grown via its affiliation with New York University (now NYU Langone Health) from 1898 to the present. It maintains a strong commitment to serving disadvantaged populations of New York City and beyond. NYU-Bellevue Neurosurgery began as a department in 1951 under Dr. Thomas Hoen and has since fostered notable faculty and graduates while contributing to the development of clinical neuroscience."
"Habits are the behavioral output of two brain systems. A stimulus-response (S-R) system that encourages us to efficiently repeat well-practiced actions in familiar settings, and a goal-directed system concerned with flexibility, prospection, and planning. Getting the balance between these systems right is crucial: an imbalance may leave people vulnerable to action slips, impulsive behaviors, and even compulsive behaviors. In this review we examine how recent advances in our understanding of these competing brain mechanisms can be harnessed to increase the control over both making and breaking habits. We discuss applications in everyday life, as well as validated and emergent interventions for clinical populations affected by the balance between these systems. As research in this area accelerates, we anticipate a rapid influx of new insights into intentional behavioral change and clinical interventions, including new opportunities for personalization of these interventions based on the neurobiology, environmental context, and personal preferences of an individual."

"Bedřich Smetana's illness associated with complete hearing loss has been linked to various diseases in a long-running discussion. Senile dementia, atherosclerosis, progressive paralysis in lues are mentioned, while the ototoxicity of mercury is neglected. Its high concentration in the composer's skeletal remains was demonstrated by the authors of this article immunohistochemically and especially by the neutron activation analysis (NAA) method 23 years ago. The significance of this find has been neglected in connection with the dominant effort to prove the composer's venereal disease, the diagnosis of which, however, has not yet been unequivocally verified. Therefore, the existing results of the osteological examination were revised and the available sample was supplemented with an immunohistochemical examination using an antibody against treponemes and a silvering method with a negative result. On the other hand, an expert literature search focused on mercury ototoxicity confirmed our assumption that chronic intoxication with this metal, which was probably part of ointments applied not only in childhood but also later in adulthood, could contribute to hearing loss. This metal, until recently used in dermatology as a component of ointments, is resorbed and, as has recently been proven, causes various neuropsychic disorders, including disorders and even hearing loss. With this communication, we would like to initiate a new discussion on all aspects of the composer's illness."
"Chemical protein synthesis enables access to proteins that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to obtain with traditional means such as recombinant expression. Chemoselective ligations provide the ability to join peptide segments prepared by solid-phase peptide synthesis. While native chemical ligation (NCL) is widely used, it is limited by the need for C-terminal thioesters with suitable reaction kinetics, properly placed native Cys or thiolated derivatives, and peptide segment solubility at low mM concentrations. Moreover, repetitive purifications to isolate ligated products are often yield-sapping, hampering efficiency and progress. In this work, we demonstrate the use of Controlled Activation of Peptides for Templated NCL (CAPTN). This traceless multi-segment templated NCL approach permits the one-pot synthesis of proteins by harnessing selective thioester activation and orthogonal conjugation chemistries to favor formation of the full-length ligated product while minimizing side reactions. Importantly, CAPTN provides kinetic enhancements allowing ligations at sterically hindered junctions and low peptide concentrations. Additionally, this one-pot approach removes the need for intermediate purification. We report the synthesis of two E. coli ribosomal subunits S16 and S17 enabled by the chemical tools described herein. We anticipate that CAPTN will expedite the synthesis of valuable proteins and expand on templated approaches for chemical protein synthesis."
"As climate change advances, the looming threat of dengue fever, intricately tied to rising temperatures, intensifies, posing a substantial and enduring public health challenge in the Philippines. This study aims to investigate the historical and projected excess dengue disease burden attributable to temperature to help inform climate change policies, and guide resource allocation for strategic climate change and dengue disease interventions."
"Due to the diverse climate in Iran, there has been an opportunity for the emergence of different domestic sheep breeds. On the other hand, two of the seven wild sheep species have settled in the broad areas of Iran. This study investigated the introgression between wild and domestic Iranian sheep using the whole genome sequencing data for 55 domestic and 19 wild sheep. The study reveals introgression signals from Asiatic mouflon and urial in Iranian domestic breeds. The results of Treemix unveiled the introgression from the common ancestor of Iranian domestic sheep to Asiatic mouflons, which sheds light on the dynamics of gene flow between domestic and wild sheep in Iran. There were 36 genomic regions (containing 26 protein coding genes) introgressed from both Asiatic mouflon and urial into the genome of their domestic relatives. In the genomic windows containing 19 of the mentioned genes, we observed a noticeable drop in the dxy value of the urial vs. domestic and Asiatic mouflon vs. domestic sheep. Also, a decrease in nucleotide diversity was observed in these regions for wild and domestic sheep, suggesting the occurrence of a selective sweep in the mentioned genomic regions. The study found important genes in these regions that are involved in fertility (TTC29, STPG2), spatial memory and learning (CAMK1G), taste perception (OTOP1), visual system (DYRK2) and olfactory (LOC101110674). The results demonstrate that most genes affected by introgression between wild and domestic sheep are related to survival, reproduction and adaptation. This information can enhance our understanding of the impact of wild species on domesticated livestocks, providing us with clearer insights for management, breeding, and conservation of these species."
"Thanks to our predecessors and technical progress, we can nowadays offer our patients a safe and modern paranasal sinus surgery. This article provides an overview of the historical development of paranasal sinus surgery in Austria and Switzerland and to shed light on the dynamic progress of this discipline in an international context. Paranasal sinus surgery has undergone significant change in recent decades, driven by rapid technological advances that have significantly improved surgical procedures and operative outcomes. While indications were originally limited to treatment of inflammatory diseases, today, endoscopic procedures cover interventions in the area of the anterior skull base, the orbit and sinonasal tumors. The concept of functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) may seem simple, but the anatomic variability, especially in the area of the frontal sinus, as well as the wide spectrum and severity of diseases can be a challenge. Therefore, paranasal sinus surgery should not be a casual operation and should only be performed by well-trained surgeons to prevent disease recurrence as well as medical and economic follow-up costs. Standardized surgical training for aspiring paranasal sinus and skull base surgeons is critical. Preoperative planning through systematic analysis of CT images is an essential factor to achieve optimal results and to avoid intraoperative complications. The pathophysiological understanding of sinonasal disease and the recent developments of new drug therapies such as monoclonal antibodies also enable excellent results in the small subgroup of patients who do not benefit from a combination of surgical rehabilitation and long-term drug therapy. The dynamic development of endoscopic paranasal sinus surgery in recent decades shows the potential of the field for the coming decades."
"In humans and nonhuman primates, the central 1° of vision is processed by the foveola, a retinal structure that comprises a high density of photoreceptors and is crucial for primate-specific high-acuity vision, color vision and gaze-directed visual attention. Here, we developed high-spatial-resolution ultrahigh-field 7T functional magnetic resonance imaging methods for functional mapping of the foveolar visual cortex in awake monkeys. In the ventral pathway (visual areas V1-V4 and the posterior inferior temporal cortex), viewing of a small foveolar spot elicits a ring of multiple (eight) foveolar representations per hemisphere. This ring surrounds an area called the 'foveolar core', which is populated by millimeter-scale functional domains sensitive to fine stimuli and high spatial frequencies, consistent with foveolar visual acuity, color and achromatic information and motion. Thus, this elaborate rerepresentation of central vision coupled with a previously unknown foveolar core area signifies a cortical specialization for primate foveation behaviors."
"Considering the complexity of medical discourse, the enormous amount of information, including fake news, it becomes increasingly challenging to develop health literacy among the general population and to ensure efficient communication of scientific findings on the effects of health interventions to various types of recipients. We aimed to gain an in-depth understanding of how the various types of audiences perceive various formats for presenting data from Cochrane systematic reviews (SRs)."
"In the United States, the system for special pathogen patient care incorporates a network of federally funded US biocontainment units that maintain operational readiness to care for patients afflicted by high-consequence infectious diseases (HCIDs). This network has expanded in number of facilities and in scope, serving as a regional resource for special pathogen preparedness. Lessons learned for maintaining these units are shared with the intent of informing new and existing biocontainment units."
"High-quality primer design is essential for the success of all polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based experiments. We previously developed a thermodynamics-based gene-specific quantitative PCR (qPCR) primer database for 147 organisms, which has been used extensively in gene expression studies. However, the number of organisms and the imperfection of function in the database limits its potential applications. Here, we improved the functionality of qPrimerDB to create a more comprehensive primer resource. Specifically, we (i) developed an improved primer design tool, qPrimer, building upon the previous qPrimerDB pipeline, to enhance the efficiency and simplicity of genome-scale qPCR primer design; (ii) pre-computed qPCR primer resources from 1 308 genomes of 1172 organisms and (iii) introduced a complete system for identifying, designing, checking, marking, and submitting qPCR primers. qPrimerDB 2.0 is freely available at https://qprimerdb.biodb.org. The qPrimer source code is available at https://github.com/swu1019lab/qPrimer."
"On August 14, 2024, following a regional declaration by the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, the World Health Organization declared mpox a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, marking the second such declaration in two years. A series of outbreaks involving the more virulent clade I virus (compared to clade II, which caused a global outbreak in 2022), has now spread in 13 African countries, exposing the inadequacies of the public health infrastructure in these settings. There was significant investment during the 2022 global outbreak, but these efforts failed to address vaccine access and treatment in the Global South. Regulatory delays, unequal access to vaccines, and a lack of compassionate use treatments for severe cases have resulted in preventable cases and deaths, especially among vulnerable populations such as pregnant women, children, and the immunocompromised. The current outbreak also underscores critical knowledge gaps in our understanding of mpox, including its transmission, pathogenesis, and viral evolution. We join intensified calls for global solidarity and action to control mpox, emphasizing immediate containment measures and long-term local and international investment in African public health systems, to prevent future epidemics."
"Advanced technologies are becoming increasingly accessible in rehabilitation. Current research suggests technology can increase therapy dosage, provide multisensory feedback, and reduce manual handling for clinicians. While more high-quality evidence regarding the effectiveness of rehabilitation technologies is needed, understanding of how to effectively integrate technology into clinical practice is also limited. Current implementation of rehabilitation technology is inconsistent, with low uptake among clinicians and frequent reports of technology abandonment. An Australian rehabilitation provider opened a new technology therapy center in 2022, offering a unique opportunity to generate practice-based evidence to inform future technology implementation and research."
This real-world evidence study compared risks of cardiovascular events in hospital settings among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) with and without hyperkalemia.
"Sub-Saharan Africa has a high burden of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The lack of surveillance programs has led to low rates of diagnosis and treatment, particularly in rural areas. We conducted mobile HBV-HCC screening clinics in rural Tanzania between March 2021 and February 2023. After undergoing informed consent, patients completed a questionnaire about HBV. A rapid point-of-care (POC) assay measured HBV surface antigen (HBsAg), and HBsAg-positive patients underwent POC ultrasound to screen for HCC and POC hepatitis C (HCV) antibody testing. The primary outcome was number of HBV diagnoses, and the secondary outcome was prevalence of liver masses in HBsAg-positive individuals. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics. Five hundred and one patients were screened for HBV; 63% (n = 303) were female with median (interquartile range [IQR]) age of 40 (28-55) years. Only 6% (n = 30) reported being vaccinated against HBV, 92% (n = 453) reported no vaccination, and 2% (n = 12) did not know their vaccination status. Seventy-six percent (n = 340) did not know they should get vaccinated, and 4% (n = 16) reported that vaccination was too expensive. Two percent (n = 11) of patients were positive for HBsAg, with 55% (n = 6) of those being female with median (IQR) age of 36 (34-43) years. None of the HBsAg-positive patients reported being vaccinated against HBV, and all were negative for HCV. On ultrasound, one patient had a liver mass, and another had ascites. We demonstrated that community-based HBV and HCC screening can be implemented in Africa with local partnerships, and this model could be used to promote awareness and improve early detection of disease."
"Inguinal hernia repair is the most common operation in infants, with well recognized anesthetic and perioperative risks. The aim was to investigate if the combination of caudal block, high-flow nasal oxygen insufflation and intravenous dexmedetomidine sedation is suitable for infants undergoing inguinal hernia surgery."
"Introduction. The trans population in Argentina represents 0.43%. Our objective was to describe the characteristics of trans and non-binary children and adolescents. Population and methods. A cross-sectional study was designed. The population was all trans or nonbinary persons under 24 years of age seen by an interdisciplinary team in a tertiary university hospital from January 2019 to May 2023. The sample was obtained from the database of patients seen by reviewing electronic medical records (EMR). Results. The EMRs of 107 individuals were analyzed; the average age at first consultation was 15.3 years, and the age of self-perceived transgender identity was 11.1 years. Seventy-two percent perceived themselves as having a trans male identity; in 89.7%, their gender expression was by their self-perception, and 46.3% had a bisexual sexual orientation. Seventy-six percent acknowledged having family support; 87.3%, school support; and 92.5%, peer support. 44.8% had a hormonal strategy, 14.1% had surgery, 57.1% had mental health intervention, and 29.1% received psychiatric medication. Only three patients (2.8%) detransitioned their gender identity. Conclusion. Most individuals were trans men and perceived good support from their environments. Almost half received a hormonal strategy; less than a quarter received a surgical intervention; more than half received a mental health intervention. The detransition was infrequent."
"Progress in malaria control has stalled in recent years. With growing resistance to existing malaria vector control insecticides and the introduction of new vector control products, national malaria control programs (NMCPs) increasingly need to make data-driven, subnational decisions to inform vector control deployment. As NMCPs are increasingly conducting subnational stratification of malaria control interventions, including malaria vector control, country-specific frameworks and platforms are increasingly needed to guide data use for vector control deployment. Integration of routine health systems data, entomological data, and vector control program data in observational longitudinal analyses offers an opportunity for NMCPs and research institutions to conduct evaluations of existing and novel vector control interventions. Drawing on the experience of implementing 22 vector control evaluations across 14 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, as well as published and gray literature on vector control impact evaluations using routine health information system data, this article provides practical guidance on the design of these evaluations, makes recommendations for key variables and data sources, and proposes methods to address challenges in data quality. Key recommendations include appropriate parameterization of impact and coverage indicators, incorporating explanatory covariates and contextual factors from multiple sources (including rapid diagnostic testing stockouts; insecticide susceptibility; vector density measures; vector control coverage, use, and durability; climate and other malaria and non-malaria health programs), and assessing data quality before the evaluation through either on-the-ground or remote data quality assessments. These recommendations may increase the frequency, rigor, and utilization of routine data sources to inform national program decision-making for vector control."
"A 64-year-old male with no medical care over the last decade was transferred from his local emergency room to a level 1 trauma center following an unwitnessed fall. Upon ophthalmic evaluation, he was noted to have significant lethargy and bilateral large festoons with secondary ectropion. Laboratory workup revealed severe hypothyroidism, consistent with myxedema coma, and his lethargy improved with medical treatment. The festoons were surgically removed to address the ectropion, and the patient was satisfied with the results following a single procedure. This case report features the largest reported festoons to date in the literature and emphasizes the importance of balancing cosmesis with function during surgical excision and correction of ectropion."
"Most of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients will experience tumor progression with immunotherapy (IO). Preliminary data suggested an association between high plasma HGF levels and poor response to IO in advanced NSCLC. Our study aimed to evaluate further the role of the HGF/MET pathway in resistance to IO in advanced NSCLC. We included retrospectively 82 consecutive NSCLC patients from two academic hospitals. Among them, 49 patients received ICIs alone or in combination with chemotherapy (CT), while 33 patients received chemotherapy alone as the control group. We analyzed plasma HGF levels by ELISA and expression of PD-L1, MET/phospho-MET, and CD8+ T-Cell infiltration on lung tumor tissue by immunohistochemistry. We investigated the contribution of HGF/MET to IO response by culturing peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with or without pembrolizumab, with recombinant HGF, or cocultured with NSCLC patients-derived explants. Additionally, c-MET inhibitors were used to evaluate the contribution of MET activation in NSCLC-mediated immunosuppression. High HGF levels were associated with high progression rate with IO (p = 0.0092), but not with CT. ELISA analysis of supernatants collected from cultured NSCLC cells showed that HGF was produced by tumor cells. Furthermore, when activated PBMCs were cultured in the presence of recombinant HGF or on NSCLC monolayer, the proliferation of CD3+CD8+ lymphocytes was inhibited, even in the presence of pembrolizumab. The addition of HGF/MET inhibitors restored lymphocyte activation and induced IFNγ production. In conclusion, inhibiting the HGF/MET signaling pathway could be a promising approach to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy."
"Emergency laparotomy (EL) is associated with high morbidity and mortality, often exceeding 10%. This study evaluated the impact of the EMergency Laparotomy Audit (EMLA) interdisciplinary perioperative pathway on patient outcomes, hospital costs and length of stay (LOS) within a single centre."
"The delay and loss of drugs are serious problems in Japan. To overcome this issue, it is important to strengthen drug development capabilities. For drug development, the establishment and advancement of non-clinical testing methods are necessary for safe and effective clinical trials. Recently, the movement toward alternatives to animal testing has accelerated internationally. New Approach Methodologies (NAMs), such as human inducible pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) technology and in silico modeling & simulation, are considered valuable for drug development. It has been demonstrated that hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) are useful tools to assess drug-induced cardiotoxicity, including arrhythmia and cardiac contractile dysfunction, leading to the use of hiPSC-CMs in the drug review process. Advancing hiPSC technologies have enabled the generation of mature hiPSC-CMs and engineered heart tissues, which are expected to provide novel information in drug safety and efficacy evaluation. Furthermore, it would be possible to establish the non-clinical evaluation that takes into account individual differences by developing hiPSCs bearing characteristics specific to certain populations, such as pediatrics or rare disease patients. Here, we present the recent findings and future perspectives on non-clinical evaluation using hiPSC technology."
"Deep learning-based computed tomography (CT) ventilation imaging (CTVI) is a promising technique for guiding functional lung avoidance radiotherapy (FLART). However, conventional approaches, which rely on anatomical CT data, may overlook important ventilation features due to the lack of motion data integration."
"Recent studies have highlighted the critical role of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) overactivation in the pathogenesis of various cardiac arrhythmias. Ruxolitinib, a Janus kinase inhibitor widely used for the treatment of myelofibrosis and acute graft-vs-host disease, has expanded its research horizons to include its potential as a CaMKII inhibitor in the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias. This article reviews the basic pharmacologic properties of ruxolitinib and delves into the role of CaMKII in cardiac arrhythmias, including its structural fundamentals, activation mechanisms, and association with arrhythmic conditions. Furthermore, the current state of CaMKII inhibitor research is discussed, with a special focus on the advances and clinical potential of ruxolitinib in this field. Studies indicate that ruxolitinib effectively inhibits CaMKII activity and has therapeutic potential against cardiac arrhythmias in animal models and at the cellular level. In addition, we address the critical issues that need to be resolved before the clinical application of ruxolitinib in arrhythmia treatment, including dosage concerns, long-term inhibitory effects, potential impacts on the nervous system, and efficacy across different types of arrhythmias. Future research directions involve further exploration of the clinical application potential of ruxolitinib, particularly in diseases such as heart failure, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, and ischemic arrhythmias. In summary, the efficacy, low toxicity, and safety profile of ruxolitinib as a CaMKII inhibitor in the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias suggest a promising future for its development as a therapeutic drug in this domain."
"Although it has long been established that age and sex play a role in blood pressure levels across the lifespan, the extent to which educational attainment moderates these relationships has been understudied. Thus, the purpose of this study was to assess educational differences in SBP, DBP, and pulse pressure (PP) trajectories among men and women through the midlife years."
"Despite the advent of heated tobacco products (HTPs), their relationship to mental health remains unclear. This study aimed to determine associations between the use of combustible cigarettes (CCs) and HTPs with depressive symptoms."
"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are post-transcriptional gene regulators. In the miRNA pathway's cytoplasmic part, the miRNA is processed from a hairpin-structured precursor to a double-stranded (ds) mature RNA and ultimately to a single-stranded mature miRNA. In insects, ingesting these two ds forms can regulate the target gene expression; this inspired the trophic miRNA's use as a functional genomics and pest management tool. However, systematic studies enabling comparisons of pre- and mature forms, dosages, administration times and instar-wise effects on target transcripts and phenotypes, which can help develop a miRNA administration method, are unavailable due to the different focuses of the previous investigations. We investigated the impact of trophically delivered Px-let-7 miRNA on the lepidopteran pest Plutella xylostella, to compare the efficacies of its pre- and ds-mature forms. Continuous feeding on the miRNA-supplemented diet suppressed expressions of FTZ-F1 and E74, the target ecdysone pathway genes. Both the pre-let-7 and mature let-7 miRNA forms similarly downregulated the target transcripts in all four larval instars. Pre-let-7 and let-7 ingestions decreased larval mass and instar duration and increased mortality in all instars, exhibiting adverse effects on larval growth and development. miRNA processing Dicer-1 and AGO-1's upregulations upon miRNA ingestion denoted the systemic miRNA spread in larval tissues. The scrambled sequence controls did not affect the target transcripts, suggesting the sequence-specific targeting by the mature miRNA and hairpin cassette's non-involvement in the target downregulation. This work provides a framework for miRNA and target gene function analyses and potentiates the trophic miRNA's utility in pest management."
"The 2024 ACMT Ward and Ryan Donovan Memorial Fund lecture was presented by Dr. Nora Volkow, the director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). This article in an edited version of her keynote address during ACMT's 2024 Annual Scientific Meeting. During the course of her talk, Dr. Volkow discussed the historical factors contributing to the ongoing global opioid epidemic, examined the evidence behind different front-line and policy strategies used to battle the opioid epidemic, and highlighted the importance of recent cultural changes that support more deliberate screening for substance use disorders and pathways for initiating treatment of opioid use disorders in vulnerable populations. An urgent need exists to improve inclusion of social and structural determinants of health in implementation science addressing opioid use disorders, with better attention to special populations, including Native American Indians and Alaskan Natives, African Americans, those over 65 years of age, and teenagers."

"Squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), arising from the skin, head and neck, lungs, esophagus, and cervix, are collectively among the most common cancers and a frequent cause of cancer morbidity and mortality. Despite distinct stratified epithelial tissues of origin, converging evidence points toward shared biologic pathways across SCCs. With recent breakthroughs in molecular technologies have come novel SCC treatment paradigms, including immunotherapies and targeted therapy. This review compares commonalities and differences across SCCs from different anatomical sites, including risk factors and genetics, as well as cellular and molecular programs driving tumorigenesis. We review landmark discoveries of the ""cancer stem cells"" (CSCs) that initiate and propagate SCCs and their gene and translational regulation programs. This has led to an appreciation that interactions between CSCs and the immune system play key roles in invasion and therapeutic resistance. Here, we review the unifying principles of SCCs that have emerged from these exciting advances in our understanding of these epithelial cancers."
"Fit of N95/P2 half-face respirators is critical. No objective ways exist to evaluate their implementation at use. Previously, we showed 26% of health care workers achieve appropriate fit at point of use."
"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the highest grade of glioma. Tumours, including GBM, possess reprogrammed metabolism, such as altered aerobic glycolysis and aberrant energy production. Lycorine hydrochloride (LH) was extracted from the bulb of Lycoris radiata. The previous study indicated that LH exerts antiviral, anti-inflammatory and antitumour effects. However, the effect of LH on GBM and the underlying molecular mechanism remain unclear. Our study revealed that LH restrained chemoresistant GBM cells growth by inhibiting PDK3 expression in vitro and in vivo. Functionally, LH inhibited the proliferation and invasive capacity of chemoresistant GBM cells in dose-dependent manner. Metabolomics and cellular energy analyses showed that LH decreased extracellular acidification rates while increased oxidative respiration and ROS levels. Mechanistically, LH inhibits the growth of GBM chemoresistant cells by regulating the expression of apoptosis-related proteins, while overexpression of of PDK3 can reverse the antitumor effect of LH. In conclusion, our study revealed that LH could reprogramme cell energy metabolism, including aerobic glycolysis suppression and oxidative phosphorylation hyperactivation by inhibiting PDK3. PDK3 may be a candidate therapeutic target for chemoresistant GBM treatment with LH."
"Visibility of tobacco products at retail tobacco outlets is associated with smoking initiation.

"Esophageal cancer (ESCA) is a common tumor noted in the digestive tract, which is highly malignant due to unclear early symptoms and poor last‑stage treatment effects; its mortality rate is relatively high. MicroRNA (miR) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) are key components of cellular signaling pathways; their interaction forms a complex and intricate information network that controls several types of biological behaviors in the cells. In the tumor cell, these signal transduction pathways are abnormally active, indicating that the STAT3 signaling pathway mediated by miRs is involved in the progression of various cancer types. The present review introduces the biological characteristics of miR and STAT3 and their relationship with ESCA. It summarizes the regulation of ESCA by the miR and STAT3 signaling pathways and analyzes the effects of these pathways on proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, metastasis and immune escape of cancer cells, as well as the impact on patient survival and prognosis. The purpose of the present review is to assess the miR/STAT3 signaling pathway in ESCA, improve the understanding of the pathogenesis of ESCA and facilitate the identification of therapeutic targets for ESCA."
"The objectives of this minireview are two-fold. The first is to discuss the evolution of opioid analgesia in perioperative medicine in the context of thoracic non-cardiac surgery. Current standard-of-care, aiming to optimize analgesia and limit undesirable side effects, is discussed in the context of multimodal analgesia, specifically enhanced recovery after thoracic surgery pathways. The second is to review a developing research program that may ultimately add another element to the personalization of analgesic plans for individual cancer patients based on optimizing oncological outcomes. Termed ""precision oncoanalgesia,"" this emerging field aims to elucidate how individual patient-specific tumor omics (genomics, transcriptomics, etc.) may mediate the effects of analgesic drugs on oncological recurrence and survival."
"With the increase in international migration, the need for an equitable healthcare system in Canada is increasing. The current biomedical model of healthcare is constructed largely in the Eurocentric tradition of medicine, which often disregards the diverse health perspectives of Canada's racialized immigrant older adults. As a result, current healthcare approaches (adopted in the US and Canada) fall short in addressing the health needs of a considerable segment of the population, impeding their ability to access healthcare services. This study aimed to identify and understand the structural and systemic factors that influence healthcare experiences and well-being among South Asian older adults in Ontario, addressing a significant gap in empirical and theoretical knowledge in the Canadian context. We conducted in-depth individual and dyadic interviews (n = 28) utilizing a descriptive multilingual cross-cultural qualitative approach. Through this research, participants expressed that their understanding of well-being does not align with that of their healthcare providers, resulting in unmet health needs. Our study uses an intersectional lens to demonstrate participants' perceptions of virtual access to care and systemic factors, such as mandatory assimilation and whiteness as a taken-for-granted norm impacting the health and well-being of South Asian older adults. The findings of this research can offer valuable insights to healthcare providers and policymakers in developing culturally competent practices, guidelines, and training policies that effectively address the healthcare needs of the South Asian population in Canada."

"Quality midwifery education is central to improving midwifery service delivery and maternal and newborn health outcomes. In many settings, midwifery educators insufficiently prepared for their teaching role and deficient curriculum compared to international standards affect the quality of healthcare provided by the midwifery graduates. This study assessed the effectiveness of an EmONC enhanced midwifery curriculum delivered by trained and mentored midwifery educators on the quality of education and student performance in Kenya."
"This research presents a novel framework for distinguishing between actual and non-suicidal ideation in social media interactions using an ensemble technique. The prompt identification of sentiments on social networking platforms is crucial for timely intervention serving as a key tactic in suicide prevention efforts. However, conventional AI models often mask their decision-making processes primarily designed for classification purposes. Our methodology, along with an updated ensemble method, bridges the gap between Explainable AI and leverages a variety of machine learning algorithms to improve predictive accuracy. By leveraging Explainable AI's interpretability to analyze the features, the model elucidates the reasoning behind its classifications leading to a comprehension of hidden patterns associated with suicidal ideations. Our system is compared to cutting-edge methods on several social media datasets using experimental evaluations, demonstrating that it is superior, since it detects suicidal content more accurately than others. Consequently, this study presents a more reliable and interpretable strategy (F1-score for suicidal = 95.5% and Non-Suicidal = 99%), for monitoring and intervening in suicide-related online discussions."
"The burden of type 2 diabetes is increasing globally. Risk perception of type 2 diabetes plays an important role in motivating adoption of healthy lifestyle and preventive health interventions.

"Home care clinicians have transported equipment and supplies to their patients' homes for decades using a bag that's been referred to as a ""nursing bag"" or ""medical bag,"" among others. Regardless of what the bag is called, how it and its contents are managed is essential to prevent the transmission of potentially pathogenic microorganisms from one patient's home to another when making home visits. Bag technique is a component of the standard precautions implemented in home care and an essential practice that applies to all patients receiving in-home care, regardless of their suspected or confirmed infectious state. It is a strategy deployed of infection prevention and control measures to minimize the risk of the home care bag and its contents serving as a source for pathogen transmission. Properly managing the bag and its contents reduces the risk of pathogen transmission."
"A bone fracture is a medical condition characterized by a partial or complete break in the continuity of the bone. Fractures are primarily caused by injuries and accidents, affecting millions of people worldwide. The healing process for a fracture can take anywhere from one month to one year, leading to significant economic and psychological challenges for patients. The detection of bone fractures is crucial, and radiographic images are often relied on for accurate assessment. An efficient neural network method is essential for the early detection and timely treatment of fractures. In this study, we propose a novel transfer learning-based approach called MobLG-Net for feature engineering purposes. Initially, the spatial features are extracted from bone X-ray images using a transfer model, MobileNet, and then input into a tree-based light gradient boosting machine (LGBM) model for the generation of class probability features. Several machine learning (ML) techniques are applied to the subsets of newly generated transfer features to compare the results. K-nearest neighbor (KNN), LGBM, logistic regression (LR), and random forest (RF) are implemented using the novel features with optimized hyperparameters. The LGBM and LR models trained on proposed MobLG-Net (MobileNet-LGBM) based features outperformed others, achieving an accuracy of 99% in predicting bone fractures. A cross-validation mechanism is used to evaluate the performance of each model. The proposed study can improve the detection of bone fractures using X-ray images."
"Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a malignant tumor of the blood system, so far there is no effective cure. Imatinib (IM), as the first-line drug for the clinical targeted treatment of CML, has some limiting factors such as drug resistance and relapse, and drug resistance has also emerged in combination with other drugs. At present, traditional Chinese medicine combined with targeted drugs in the treatment of tumor is a research hotspot. The total saponin of L. (TSRP) has an effective anti-tumor activity. Our previous in vitro experiments showed that TSRP can effectively inhibit the proliferation and promote apoptosis of CML cells K562, suggesting that TSRP can effectively reverse the drug resistance of IM, but the mechanism of drug resistance remains unclear. Studies have shown that the PI3K/AKT pathway is the main activation pathway of IM secondary resistance, and is considered to be an innovative therapeutic strategy for targeted cancer treatment, which may be an important mechanism of IM resistance. This project aims to reveal the possible mechanism of TSRP reversing IM resistance through PI3K/AKT signaling pathway through both in vitro and in vivo experiments, providing experimental basis for TSRP combined with IM treatment of CML."
"The field of genomics is rapidly evolving and has made significant impact on the diagnosis and understanding of rare and genetic diseases, in guiding precision medicine in cancer treatment, and in providing personalized risk assessment for disease development and treatment responses. However, according to the literature, there is widespread socio economic and racial inequities in the diagnosis, treatment, and in the use of genomic medicine services. This policy review sets out to explore the concept of equity in access to genomic care, the level of inclusion of equity and how it is addressed and what mechanisms are in place to achieve equity in genomic care in the international health policy."
Poor medication adherence is common. Text messaging is increasingly used to change patient behavior but often not rigorously tested.
"The incidence and etiology of primary osteoarthritis (OA) of the scaphotrapeziotrapezoid joint (STTJ), radiocarpal joint (RCJ), and distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and factors associated with primary wrist OA in a cross-sectional study of a basic resident registry."
"Visual attribution in medical imaging seeks to make evident the diagnostically-relevant components of a medical image, in contrast to the more common detection of diseased tissue deployed in standard machine vision pipelines (which are less straightforwardly interpretable/explainable to clinicians). We here present a novel generative visual attribution technique, one that leverages latent diffusion models in combination with domain-specific large language models, in order to generate normal counterparts of abnormal images. The discrepancy between the two hence gives rise to a mapping indicating the diagnostically-relevant image components. To achieve this, we deploy image priors in conjunction with appropriate conditioning mechanisms in order to control the image generative process, including natural language text prompts acquired from medical science and applied radiology. We perform experiments and quantitatively evaluate our results on the COVID-19 Radiography Database containing labelled chest X-rays with differing pathologies via the Frechet Inception Distance (FID), Structural Similarity (SSIM) and Multi Scale Structural Similarity Metric (MS-SSIM) metrics obtained between real and generated images. The resulting system also exhibits a range of latent capabilities including zero-shot localized disease induction, which are evaluated with real examples from the cheXpert dataset."
"There is no standardised definition of what constitutes a junctional injury. Although well described in military literature, this is not the case in the civilian setting. This study aims to characterise the epidemiology of the civilian penetrating junctional injuries in our centre."
"Following lower limb amputation residuum skin from the lower leg is used to reconstruct the residual limb. Unlike skin on the sole of the foot (plantar skin), leg skin is not inherently load bearing. Despite this, leg skin is required to be load bearing in the prosthetic socket. Current hypotheses propose that lower limb amputee skin can adapt to become load bearing with repeated prosthesis use. Here, we show using confocal Raman spectroscopy, mechanical characterization and cytokine analysis that adaptations occur which actually result in impaired barrier function, higher baseline inflammation, increased coefficient of friction and reduced stiffness. Our results demonstrate that repeated frictional trauma does not confer beneficial adaptations in amputee skin. We hypothesize that non-plantar skin lacks the biological capabilities to respond positively to repeated mechanical trauma in the same manner observed in plantar skin. This finding highlights the need for improved therapies as opposed to current mechanical conditioning or product solutions that directly relate to improving load-bearing capacity on the skin of lower limb amputees. This study also highlights the importance of measuring multiple parameters of application-specific skin at different scales for skin tribology applications."
The association between chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and risk for postoperative complications after pancreatic surgery has not been clarified. The aim of this study was to investigate if COPD is associated with increased risk for postoperative complications after pancreatoduodenectomy.
"Pure red cell aplasia is a rare condition that may be congenital or associated with an underlying disease.Immunosuppressants are a commonly employed therapeutic option for the treatment of pure red cell aplasia;however, they are associated with considerable adverse effects, including nephrotoxicity. This case report describesa 74-year-old patient with pure red cell aplasia who developed long-term kidney injury following cyclosporinetherapy. Renal anemia is a common complication after chronic kidney injury and contributes to the poor outcome ofanemia treatment. Following a series of medication adjustments, the final treatment with roxarestat combined withsirolimus proved effective in delaying the impairment of this patient's kidney function, with the hemoglobin levelremaining above 100 g/L throughout. This case report demonstrates the efficacy of roxarestat in conjunction with animmunosuppressive agent in the treatment of pure red cell aplasia combined with kidney injury, with a dual effect ofalleviating the anemia and reducing serum creatinine levels."
"Black rice (BR) is beneficial for the health of animals and humans. Herein, we investigated the pharmacokinetics of cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G), a major anthocyanin constituent of BR, in male rats. After its intravenous administration, C3G was rapidly distributed throughout the body and disappeared from the plasma. Its cumulative urinary excretion accounted for less than 20% of the dose administered. After a single dose of BR extract (C3G40) containing C3G was orally administered (300 mg C3G/kg body weight), the C3G plasma concentration peaked at 30 min and then rapidly declined within 4 h. The extent of the cumulative urinary excretion of C3G, together with the area under the curve (AUC) of the plasma C3G concentration, indicated a bioavailability of approximately 0.5-1.5%. These results suggest that C3G was rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract in rats; however, its plasma concentration was very low. We also examined the enhancing effect of allyl isothiocyanate (AITC), a pungent component of wasabi, on the gastrointestinal absorption of C3G in rats. Following the co-administration of C3G with AITC dissolved in PEG200, the urinary excretion and AUC of C3G were 4.5- and 2.7-fold higher than those in the control group (without AITC) (p<0.01), respectively. This is the first study to show that the gastrointestinal absorption of BR anthocyanins is promoted by AITC."
"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) can impair activities of daily living (ADL), reducing quality of life. The influence of biopsychosocial factors on ADL limitations among CKD patients remains unclear. This study aims to investigate associations between these factors and ADL limitations among CKD patients in the Brazilian population. We analyzed data from 839 individuals diagnosed with CKD obtained from the National Health Survey. The outcome was the presence or absence of limitations in ADL caused by CKD. Biopsychosocial factors included clinical and health status, self-perceived behavior, contextual social support, lifestyle, and household characteristics. Cox regression was employed to adjust interactions between these factors, with the prevalence ratio used as a measure of effect (α ≤ 5%). From the analyzed sample, 373 CKD patients (40.7%; 95% CI: 35.4-46.1%) reported experiencing limitations in ADL. These limitations were associated with individual and contextual factors, including lack of private health insurance, residing in a rural area, poorer self-perceived health, presence of depressive symptoms, physical/mental disabilities, use of medications, and undergoing hemodialysis. Limitations in ADL among individuals with CKD are associated with biopsychosocial factors in the Brazilian population, emphasizing the necessity for public policies that support enhanced therapeutic management and address behavioral health."
"A bidirectional relationship exists between obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). We aimed to examine the cumulative impact of having both OSA and T2D on patient outcomes, relative to having either condition alone."
"The role of RBM47, an RNA-binding protein, in shaping the immune landscape of gliomas and tumor immune responses is yet to be fully studied. Therefore, a comprehensive investigation into the immunomodulatory roles of RBM47 in gliomas was conducted, leveraging gene expression data from multi-omic datasets. The prognosis of patients with gliomas considering RBM47 was elucidated using bioinformatics methods and clinical data, with results validated using immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence analyses. The expression of RBM47 in gliomas was higher than that in normal tissues and was positively correlated with the World Health Organization tumor grade. Increased RBM47 expression is associated with poor prognosis in patients with glioma, serving as an independent predictor of overall survival. The nomogram combining RBM47 expression levels with clinical prognostic factors demonstrated strong predictive accuracy, achieving a C-index of up to 0.863 in both TCGA training and CGGA validation groups. Gene Ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, and Gene Set Variation Analysis indicated that RBM47 is closely related to immunity and inflammation. Single-cell sequencing and immunofluorescence assays confirmed the enrichment of RBM47 in CD163 + macrophages. Therefore, RBM47 plays a vital role in the immune microenvironment of gliomas and may be a potential immunotherapy target."
Human placental hydrolysate (hPH) contains anti-inflammatory substances. This study aimed to analyze whether injecting hPH into the subacromial space could reduce pain in patients with shoulder impingement syndrome.
"Nonlinear responses of individual neurons are both experimentally established and considered fundamental for the functioning of neuronal circuitry. Consequently, one may envisage the collective dynamics of large networks of neurons exhibiting a large repertoire of nonlinear behaviors. However, an ongoing and central challenge in the modeling of neural dynamics involves the trade-off between tractability and biological realism. This is particularly important in exploring the range of possible dynamics of large networks. Our approach uses Gaussian white noise as a probe, thus capturing the full range of system responses and characteristics by using an approach inspired by the well-established Wiener - Volterra nonlinear system identification approach. We assess model behavior over a range of network architectures and noise stimulation rates and demonstrate non-monotonicity and nonlinearity as a system property. Perhaps surprisingly, our computational model suggests that recurrent systems of nonlinear neurons exhibit a range of complex behaviors that do not readily yield to linear modeling in every setting. Our results suggest that a linear interpretation of experimental data is likely to discount the critical importance of properties emerging from network architecture. The main contribution of this effort is to highlight the importance of the network's architecture operating on the nonlinear properties of individual neurons and the experimental probing approaches of the circuitry."
"Unstructured, free-text dictation (FT), the current standard in breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reporting, is considered time-consuming and prone to error.

"This study aimed to gather information about parental practices, knowledge, and attitudes regarding infant sleep habits and environments, among families who practice non-recommended sleep practices."
"We examined the potential of environmental DNA (eDNA) for identifying tsunami deposits in the geological record using lake-bottom sediments in the Tohoku region, Japan. The presence of eDNA from marine organisms in a lacustrine event deposit provides very strong evidence that the deposit was formed by an influx of water from the ocean. The diverse DNA assemblage in the deposit formed by the 2011 Tohoku-oki tsunami included DNA of marine origin indicating that eDNA has potential as an identifying proxy for tsunami deposits. Subsequently, we examined the applicability of eDNA for recognizing paleo-tsunami events using the deposits formed by the 869 CE Jogan tsunami and a prehistoric event (2400-2900 cal year BP). The taxa detected in the tsunami deposits were markedly different from those of the background sediments. Many taxa that were represented in the Jogan tsunami deposit were also detected in the layer immediately above the tsunami deposit. This layer was indistinguishable from the overlying peat by visual observation, but the eDNA results suggest that it is likely to be a muddy tsunami deposit. The results of this study indicate that eDNA has the potential to elucidate the origin of event deposits that have been difficult to identify."
"The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway senses and integrates various environmental and intracellular cues to regulate cell growth and proliferation. As a key conductor of the balance between anabolic and catabolic processes, mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) orchestrates the symphonic regulation of glycolysis, nucleic acid and lipid metabolism, protein translation and degradation, and gene expression. Dysregulation of the mTOR pathway is linked to numerous human diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, obesity, diabetes, and aging. This review provides an in-depth understanding of how nutrients and growth signals are coordinated to influence mTOR signaling and the extensive metabolic rewiring under its command. Additionally, we discuss the use of mTORC1 inhibitors in various aging-associated metabolic diseases and the current and future potential for targeting mTOR in clinical settings. By deciphering the complex landscape of mTORC1 signaling, this review aims to inform novel therapeutic strategies and provide a road map for future research endeavors in this dynamic and rapidly evolving field."
"Secondary metabolites are compounds not essential for an organism's development, but provide significant ecological and physiological benefits. These compounds have applications in medicine, biotechnology and agriculture. Their production is encoded in biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), groups of genes collectively directing their biosynthesis. The advent of metagenomics has allowed researchers to study BGCs directly from environmental samples, identifying numerous previously unknown BGCs encoding unprecedented chemistry. Here, we present the BGC Atlas (https://bgc-atlas.cs.uni-tuebingen.de), a web resource that facilitates the exploration and analysis of BGC diversity in metagenomes. The BGC Atlas identifies and clusters BGCs from publicly available datasets, offering a centralized database and a web interface for metadata-aware exploration of BGCs and gene cluster families (GCFs). We analyzed over 35 000 datasets from MGnify, identifying nearly 1.8 million BGCs, which were clustered into GCFs. The analysis showed that ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides are the most abundant compound class, with most GCFs exhibiting high environmental specificity. We believe that our tool will enable researchers to easily explore and analyze the BGC diversity in environmental samples, significantly enhancing our understanding of bacterial secondary metabolites, and promote the identification of ecological and evolutionary factors shaping the biosynthetic potential of microbial communities."
"Salt stress is one of the abiotic stresses affecting crop quality and yield, and the application of exogenous brassinosteroids (BRs) can be used in response to salt stress. However, the function of BR in tea plants under salt stress remains to be elucidated. This study investigated the effects of exogenous spraying of BR on the malondialdehyde, soluble sugar, soluble protein, and antioxidant enzyme activities in tea plants under salt stress and explored the expression changes in genes related to the synthesis pathways of proline and secondary metabolites (flavonoids and theanine). The results show that 200 mM NaCl solution inhibits the physiology of tea plants, but 0.2 mg/L BR could partially reduce the damage by increasing photosynthetic pigments, osmoregulatory substances (such as soluble sugar, soluble protein, and proline), and the activity of antioxidant enzymes (including peroxidase, catalase, and superoxide dismutase), while decreasing the malondialdehyde content in salt-stressed leaves. The qRT-PCR experiment also shows that the genes related to the synthesis pathways of proline and secondary metabolites (flavonoids and theanine) were upregulated under salt stress, and the proline degradation genes were downregulated, thus promoting the accumulation of proline under salt stress in both varieties. When tea plants were subjected to salt stress, the expression of genes related to the synthesis of secondary metabolites was regulated accordingly to resist salt stress. Moreover, spraying BR had an obvious effect on improving the salt tolerance of tea plants. Therefore, exploring a way to improve the salt tolerance of tea trees provides a reference for the subsequent study of its salt tolerance mechanism, which is of great significance for expanding the introduction area of tea trees, increasing the planting area of tea trees, and improving the yield and quality of tea."
"Second-generation integrase strand transfer inhibitors (InSTIs) have a high barrier to resistance and potent antiretroviral activity. They are recommended as first- or second-line (FL and SL) options in two- and three-drug regimens (2DR and 3DR) in international treatment guidelines. However, there are limited real-world data on emerging resistance at the time of virological failure (VF) with these regimens."

Xiaoyao Sanjie Decoction (XYSJD) exhibits remarkable therapeutic efficacy on TNBC; however, the underlying mechanism is unclear. This study verified the efficacy of XYSJD and its active component in the treatment of TNBC and explored its potential mechanism."
"Catecholamines (CAs), including adrenaline, noradrenaline, and dopamine, are neurotransmitters and hormones that play a critical role in regulating the cardiovascular system, metabolism, and stress response in the human body. As promising methods for real-time monitoring of catecholamine neurotransmitters, LC-MS detectors have gained widespread acceptance and shown significant progress over the past few years. Other detection methods such as fluorescence detection, colorimetric assays, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, and surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy have also been developed to varying degrees. In addition, efficient pretreatment technology for CAs is flourishing due to the increasing development of many highly selective and recoverable materials. There are a few articles that provide an overview of electrochemical detection and efficient enrichment, but a comprehensive summary focusing on analytical detection technology is lacking. Thus, this review provides a comprehensive summary of recent analytical detection technology research on CAs published between 2017 and 2022. The advantages and limitations of relevant methods including efficient pretreatment technologies for biological matrices and analytical methods used in combination with pretreatment technology have been discussed. Overall, this review article provides a better understanding of the importance of accurate CAs measurement and offers perspectives on the development of novel methods for disease diagnosis and research in this field."
"Cholesterol is vital for nerve processes. Changes in cholesterol homeostasis lead to neurodegeneration and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In recent years, extensive research has confirmed the influential role of adipose tissue mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in managing AD. The present study aims is to investigate a new approach concerning AD by MSCs with particular reference to the cholesterol homeostasis pathway and its regulatory miRNAs in an AD-like rat model. Three groups of 24 male Wistar rats have been divided: healthy rats (control), Alzheimer's rats (AD), and Alzheimer's rats that received MSCs (AD + MSC). Cholesterol level was measured using the GC-mass technique. The mRNA and expression levels of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR), apolipoprotein E (APOE), ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), and CYP46A1 genes, as well as their regulating miRNAs, were assessed using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blotting techniques, respectively. Intraventricular transplantation of MSCs improved behavioral disorders and decreased the count of Aβ plaques in brain tissue. Transplantation of these cells also led to a significant decrease in cholesterol levels and HMGCR, ApoE, and ABCA1 and a remarkable increase in CYP46A1 mRNAs and protein expression. These cells considerably changed the expression of microRNAs regulating these genes. These results indicated that the examined miRNAs could be used as promising biomarkers for AD management. Additionally, the potential therapeutic role of MSCs in improving cholesterol levels the expression levels of the targeted miRNAs and their related genes in the cholesterol homeostasis pathway was established."
"The octadecanoids are a broad class of lipids consisting of the oxygenated products of 18-carbon fatty acids. Originally referring to production of the phytohormone jasmonic acid, the octadecanoid pathway has been expanded to include products of all 18-carbon fatty acids. Octadecanoids are formed biosynthetically in mammals via cyclooxygenase (COX), lipoxygenase (LOX), and cytochrome P450 (CYP) activity, as well as nonenzymatically by photo- and autoxidation mechanisms. While octadecanoids are well-known mediators in plants, their role in the regulation of mammalian biological processes has been generally neglected. However, there have been significant advancements in recognizing the importance of these compounds in mammals and their involvement in the mediation of inflammation, nociception, and cell proliferation, as well as in immuno- and tissue modulation, coagulation processes, hormone regulation, and skin barrier formation. More recently, the gut microbiome has been shown to be a significant source of octadecanoid biosynthesis, providing additional biosynthetic routes including hydratase activity (e.g., CLA-HY, FA-HY1, FA-HY2). In this review, we summarize the current field of octadecanoids, propose standardized nomenclature, provide details of octadecanoid preparation and measurement, summarize the phase-I metabolic pathway of octadecanoid formation in mammals, bacteria, and fungi, and describe their biological activity in relation to mammalian pathophysiology as well as their potential use as biomarkers of health and disease."
"Research on airway smooth muscle has traditionally focused on its putative detrimental role in asthma, emphasizing on how its shortening narrows the airway lumen, without much consideration about its potential role in subserving the function of the entire respiratory system. New experimental evidence on mice suggests that not only the smooth muscle is required to sustain life postnatally, but its stiffening effect on the lung tissue also protects against excessive airway narrowing and, most importantly, against small airway narrowing heterogeneity and closure. These results suggest that the smooth muscle plays an vital role in the lung periphery, essentially safeguarding alveolar ventilation by preventing small airway closure. These results also shed light on perplexing clinical observations, such as the long-standing doubts about the safety of bronchodilators. Since there seems to be an optimal level of smooth muscle contraction, at least in small airways, the therapeutic goal of maximizing the relaxation of the smooth muscle in asthma needs to be revisited. A bronchodilator with an excessive potency for inhibiting smooth muscle contraction, and that is still potent at concentrations reaching the lung periphery, may foster airway closure and air trapping, resulting in no net gain or even a decline in lung function."
"In the context of community-based tourism, this study investigates the determinants of tourist loyalty to homestays, with a focus on sustainable rural tourism development in China. Using the stimulus-organism-response (SOR) framework, we propose a conceptual model to examine how connected experiences influence tourist emotions and, in turn, their loyalty. Data were gathered through onsite surveys of tourists, and structural equation modeling was applied to assess the relationships between key variables. The analysis reveals that tourists' emotions mediate the effect of connected experiences on loyalty, while the unique local characteristics of homestays significantly moderate the link between emotions and loyalty. These findings provide valuable insights for policymakers and practitioners aiming to enhance the sustainability of rural tourism through strategic management of community-based homestays."

"Though antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) are required for hospitals, the involvement of transplant recipients in programmatic interventions, protocols, and metrics has historically been limited. Though there is a growing interest in studying stewardship practices in transplant patients, optimal practices have not been clearly established. A component of ASPs, antiviral stewardship (AVS), specifically targeting cytomegalovirus (CMV), has been more recently described. Understanding AVS opportunities and interventions is particularly important for transplant recipients, given the morbidity and mortality associated with viral infections, challenging clinical syndromes, ultrasensitive molecular diagnostic assays, antiviral resistance, and costs of viral disease and medications, as well as antiviral drug toxicities. This review highlights opportunities for AVS for CMV, EBV, HSV, VZV, SARS-CoV-2, respiratory syncytial virus, and BK polyomavirus in transplant patients."
"CEP55 encodes centrosomal protein 55 kDa, which plays a crucial role in mitosis, particularly cytokinesis. Biallelic CEP55 variants cause MARCH syndrome (multinucleated neurons, anhydramnios, renal dysplasia, cerebellar hypoplasia and hydranencephaly). Here, we describe a Japanese family with two affected siblings harboring novel compound heterozygous CEP55 variants, NM_001127182: c.[1357 C > T];[1358 G > A] p.[(Arg453Cys)];[(Arg453His)]. Both presented clinically with typical lethal MARCH syndrome. Although a combination of missense and nonsense variants has been reported previously, this is the first report of biallelic missense CEP55 variants. These variants biallelically affected the same amino acid, Arg453, in the last 40 amino acids of CEP55. These residues are functionally important for CEP55 localization to the midbody during cell division, and may be associated with severe clinical outcomes. More cases of pathogenic CEP55 variants are needed to establish the genotype-phenotype correlation."
"Food commodities, including mycotoxins naturally produced from toxigenic fungi (pre- or post-harvest), are particularly vulnerable to contamination. The study intended to use unique bioactive composites loaded with antimicrobial constituents for food packaging. Three composite types are based on carboxymethyl cellulose/shellac (CMC/SH) and loaded with pomegranate extract (POE) with or without jojoba oil (JOE) at various concentrations. An enhancement was recorded for tensile strength and elongation at break and burst properties of the composites, where the results point out the amelioration of flexibility and elasticity with E9 (0.3/3 mg/mL of POE/JO). Moreover, E10 (0.3/1 of POE/JOE) content had higher phenolic and flavonoids, with significant antioxidants and the best antimicrobial and anti-mycotoxigenic activity. Six higher antimicrobial composites were chosen for corn seed coating applications in a simulated experiment of toxigenic fungal contamination, where the results recommend E10 as the best formula for packaging application. The E10 was characterized for emulsion stability, particle size, zeta potential, pH, PDI, and acidity that were recorded at 88.16 ± 2.87%, 54.81 nm, 38.74 mV, 6.34 ± 0.54, 31.12 ± 1.02, and 6.02 ± 0.34 mg/L, respectively. The in-silico study revealed that ellagic acid and hesperidin in POE extract, erucic and oleic acids in JOE, and shellac had the highest binding free energies against the vital enzymes involved in bactericidal/bacteriostatic effects and the aflatoxin bio synthetic mechanism."
"Although previous research has suggested that parenting style affects children's peer relationships, the influential mechanism remains a subject of debate. We propose that parental mentalizing plays a crucial role in parenting style and peer relationships. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the relationships between family parenting styles, parental mentalizing, and peer relationships during early adolescence. In this study, 379 primary school students (Mean age = 12.17 years, SD = 0.92) and their parents were assessed using the Family Parenting Style Scale, Peer Relationship Satisfaction Scale, and a distorted mentalizing task. The results showed a mediating effect of parental mentalizing between parenting style and peer relationships. For fathers, a favorable parenting style affects children's peer relationships through mentalizing. Among mothers, interference, protection, and punishment affect their children's peer relationships through mentalizing. In conclusion, parenting style affects peer relationships through parental mentalizing. Fathers'/mothers' parenting style and parental mentalizing affect their children's peer relationships differently."
