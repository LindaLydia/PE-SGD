"Endometritis is one of the main reproductive disorders in mares and due to the increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistance, the use of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of endometritis in mares has gained interest, given their potential to restore and maintain a healthy uterine microbiota. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of total metabolites of Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA) and Lactiplantibacillus plantarum (LP) against common equine endometrial pathogenic bacteria in vitro (Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli (1), Escherichia coli (2), Escherichia coli (3), Escherichia coli (4), Enterobacter cloacae, Streptococcus equi, Staphylococcus warneri, Actinobacillus equi and Klebesiella pneumoniae), as well as to assess their low molecular weight metabolites (loM) and extracellular vesicle (EVs) inhibition capacity over a multidrug-resistant E. coli isolated from mares with clinical endometritis. The total metabolites of LA showed better inhibition on A. baumannii, E. coli (1) and E. cloacae, while those of LP inhibited E. coli (4), S. equi and A. equi. Besides total metabolites, loM of LA and LP can inhibit E. coli. LA EVs were more effective in preventing E. coli (2) compared to LA loM, while LP EVs presented inhibition but below 90%. The use of LA and LP in the mare's uterus may be an interesting approach to controlling endometritis. In addition to metabolites, EVs can contribute to the inhibition of multidrug-resistant E. coli."
"The action of the Regional Ethical Reflection Spaces does not only concern the field of contemporary bioethics but also affects many issues concerning mental health that we may have to face in clinical practice and teamwork. To keep trying to identify the conflicts of values in ethical issues is an absolute necessity, which implies that we support a ""living together"" relying on a ""thinking together"" for both the sake of each of us and for the sake of all of us. Our duty is then to resist collectively to prevent any possible deleterious excesses on both human and therapeutic points of view. Moreover, to focus on the principle of proportionality in complex medical decisions in the field of mental health requires at the same time a balance between the protection, the safety and the respect of the fundamental freedoms and a balance between the public interest and the individual needs. Such arbitration demands a strong focus on the ethical reflection so as to avoid decisions simply oriented towards the health dimension and recorded without any consideration for the health democracy. The referrals of the ethical support cells in Brittany and everywhere in France bring to light the challenges we met on the field. In particular those aroused during the COVID crisis concerning the institutional decisions, to take care of the mental health of patients at the end of their life or when facing treatment of resistant diseases. These situations raise some critical issues about the respect for the dignity and the humanity of the people we take care of. It thus seems necessary to respect an ethical code of human understanding, with poise and right balance, relying on a collegiate discussion. Besides, receiving end of life care will today requires the development of a palliative psychiatry in France, which becomes a priority. This could enable us to lead to fairer and equitable care, respectful of the individual freedoms, and a care better adapted to the specific needs of the patients in great psychological suffering. Especially in places where vulnerability is at stake, such as the retirement homes, to maintain a better articulation between the principles of beneficence and of nonmaleficence."
There is variability in the literature on the role of the depth of invasion (DOI) for recommending an elective neck dissection (END).
"Balancing energy production and storage is a fundamental process critical for cellular homeostasis in most eukaryotes that relies on the intimate interplay between mitochondria and lipid droplets (LDs). In the oleaginous yeast Lipomyces starkeyi under nitrogen starvation, LD forms a single giant spherical structure that is easily visible under a light microscope. Currently, how mitochondria behave in L. starkeyi cells undergoing giant LD formation remains unknown. Here we show that mitochondria transition from fragments to elongated tubules and sheet-like structures that are in close proximity to a giant LD in nitrogen-depleted L. starkeyi cells. Under the same conditions, mitochondrial degradation and autophagy are strongly suppressed, suggesting that these catabolic events are not required for giant LD formation. Conversely, carbon-depleted cells suppress mitochondrial elongation and LD expansion, whereas they promote mitochondrial degradation and autophagy. We propose a potential link of mitochondrial proximity and autophagic suppression to giant LD formation."
"There is still some uncertainty towards the best method to diagnose the sarcopenic obesity, and specifically, altered body composition. A recent international consensus proposes the association of increased fat mass (FM) with reduced skeletal muscle mass adjusted by weight (SMM/W) (method 1). The ratio of fat mass index (FMI)/fat free mass index (FFMI) (method 2) has also been proposed."
"Hand infection is a common and frequent problem encountered by surgeons in their outpatient clinics. The causes are varied, ranging from trauma to surgical intervention and to the spread of infection from elsewhere on the body. The causative agents of infection are also varied, and although bacteria are the most common ones, viruses, fungi, and, of course, the problem of diagnosis after parasite infestation as well as rare causes of infections must also be considered. The diagnosis should be quick and the treatment should be as aggressive as possible without undue delay in a justified situation. This will avoid serious complications and consequences of infection on such a complex structure as the hand. The aim of this article is to provide an overview of the problem, and to provide information to support early diagnosis. Therapeutic options and interventions are proposed, with an emphasis on a modern, i.e. active, approach to the problem. Possible prevention of infection on the hand is mentioned. The article aims to improve clinical practice in the care of the hand with infection."
"Euglyceamic diabetic ketoacidosis (EuDKA) is an uncommon but serious diabetes mellitus complication associated with risk factors such as fasting, surgery, pregnancy and, more recently, the use of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i). This case is of a woman with type 2 diabetes and hypertension in her 50s who underwent an incarcerated umbilical hernia repair and abdominoplasty. Two days after discharge, she was readmitted with nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, low-grade fever and breathing difficulty. Preoperatively, her diabetes management included an SGLT2i. She was diagnosed with EuDKA with high anion gap metabolic acidosis, a medical emergency similar to diabetic ketoacidosis. The normal blood glucose levels in EuDKA can mask the condition, which poses a conundrum for physicians in the emergency department/intensive care units as it may delay diagnosis and treatment, worsening the outcomes. To mitigate this risk, SGLT2i should be stopped 3-4 days before planned surgery with appropriate adjustments to the insulin regimen."
"This study explores the associations between four macro-level factors-Economic Development (ED), Economic Inequality (EI), Governmental Willingness and capacities to invest in Public Health (GWPH) and Public Health-Related Infrastructures (PHRI)-and three mental health indicators: depressive symptoms, cognitive function and life satisfaction, among middle-aged and older adults in China."
Physicians' refusal to perform medical procedures that they deem contrary to their conscience may threaten basic human rights and public health. This study aims to investigate the thoughts and attitudes of future physicians on conscientious objection (CO) and thus contribute to the discussions from a country more heavily influenced by Eastern values.
"There are conflicting reports regarding the roles of T helper-17 (Th17) and T regulatory (Treg) cells in type 1 leprosy reactions (T1Rs). Also, literature on the correlation of immunological parameters with a validated scoring system and the effect of treatment on cytokines is lacking. Adult patients with untreated T1R and nonreactional spectrum-matched controls were included in the study for comparison of levels of Th17 and Treg pathway cytokines in serum, skin lesions (reactional), and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) culture supernatants. Venous blood samples were collected at baseline and after resolution of reaction (post treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs] or steroids) for serum cytokine estimation and PBMC stimulation assays, and lesional (reactional) skin biopsy for cytokine messenger RNA (mRNA) estimation. Thirty-two cases of T1R were recruited (23 patients completed follow-up). Serum levels of cytokines were not significantly different between cases and controls or between pre- and post-treatment samples. Tissue mRNA and Mycobacterium leprae (M. leprae) antigen-stimulated PBMC culture supernatant levels of Interleukin (IL)-17A, IL-17F, IL-6, and IL-23 were significantly higher in T1R than in controls. Levels of IL-10 and Transforming Growth Factor-beta (TGF-β) were comparable among the two groups. The levels of all cytokines were significantly reduced after treatment. There was no significant difference in magnitude of the fall between those treated with steroids versus NSAIDs. This study suggests heightened Th17 response in T1R, with a prominent inability of the regulatory cytokines IL-10 and TGF-β to control the associated inflammation. The dynamics of change after resolution of T1R were comparable between NSAID and oral steroid treatment groups."
"Biomimetic natural biomaterial (BNBM) nanocomposite scaffolds for bone replacement can reduce the rate of implant failure and the associated risks of post-surgical complications for patients. Traditional bone implants, like allografts, and autografts, have limitations, such as donor site morbidity and potential patient inflammation. Over two million bone transplant procedures are performed yearly, and success varies depending on the material used. This emphasizes the importance of developing new biomaterials for bone replacement. Innovative BNBM nanocomposites for modern bone fabrication can promote the colonization of the desired cellular components and provide the necessary mechanical properties. Recent studies have highlighted the advantages of BNBM nanocomposites for bone replacement; therefore, this review focuses on the application of cellulose, chitosan, alginates, collagen, hyaluronic acid, and synthetic polymers enhanced with nanoparticles for the fabrication of nanocomposite scaffolds used in bone regeneration and replacement. This work outlines the most up-to-date overview and perspectives of selected promising BNBM nanocomposites for bone replacement that could be used for scaffold fabrication and replace other biomorphic materials such as metallics, ceramics, and synthetic polymers in the future. In summary, the concluding remarks highlight the advantages and disadvantages of BNBM nanocomposites, prospects, and future directions for bone tissue regeneration and replacement."
"Protein lipoylation, a vital lysine post-translational modification, plays a crucial role in the function of key mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymatic complexes. In eukaryotes, lipoyl post-translational modification synthesis occurs exclusively through de novo pathways, relying on lipoyl synthesis/transfer enzymes, dependent upon mitochondrial fatty acid and Fe-S cluster biosynthesis. Dysregulation in any of these pathways leads to diminished cellular lipoylation. Efficient restoration of lipoylation in lipoylation deficiency cell states using either chemical or genetic approaches has been challenging because of pathway complexity and multiple upstream regulators. To address this challenge, we explored the possibility that a bacterial lipoate protein ligase A (lplA) enzyme, which can salvage free lipoic acid bypassing the dependency on de novo synthesis, could be engineered to be functional in human cells. Overexpression of the engineered lplA in lipoylation null cells restored lipoylation levels, cellular respiration, and growth in low glucose conditions. Engineered lplA restored lipoylation in all tested lipoylation null cell models, mimicking defects in mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis (MECR KO), Fe-S cluster biosynthesis (BOLA3 KO), and specific lipoylation-regulating enzymes (FDX1 [ferredoxin 1], LIAS [lipoyl synthase], and LIPT1 [lipoyl (octanoyl) transferase 1] KOs). Furthermore, we describe a patient with a homozygous c.212C>T variant LIPT1 with a previously uncharacterized syndromic congenital sideroblastic anemia. K562 erythroleukemia cells engineered to harbor this missense LIPT1 allele recapitulate the lipoylation-deficient phenotype and exhibit impaired proliferation in low glucose that is completely restored by engineered lplA. This synthetic approach offers a potential therapeutic strategy for treating lipoylation disorders."
"ScarTrace is a CRISPR/Cas9-based genetic lineage tracing method that allows for uniquely barcoding the DNA of single cells at a target GFP sequence during developing zebrafish embryos. Single cells from barcoded adult zebrafish can be isolated from various tissues (e.g., marrow, brain, eyes, fins), and their transcriptome and barcode sequences are captured by single-cell cDNA amplification and genomic DNA nested PCR, respectively. Computationally, cell type and barcode identification permit clone tracing and lineage tree reconstruction of tissues to unravel fate decisions during embryogenesis."
"In British Columbia, Canada, unidentified skeletal human remains are often recovered by law enforcement or civilians and there is a question if they are modern and of medicolegal significance, or historical or archaeological. We used relatively fast and inexpensive carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis of human bone collagen from a selection of these remains (n = 48) combined with a logistic regression model to classify remains as modern, historical, or archaeological. We then confirmed our temporal classification through directly radiocarbon dating each individual and found that we could predict the temporal group with 93% accuracy. In regions where archaeological remains have dietary isotope values distinct from living people, dietary stable isotope analysis can provide a time-, and resource-efficient method to screen cases of unidentified human remains early in death investigation."
"Dual harm involves the unfortunate experience of harm to self and others/objects. Safeguarding individuals in forensic psychiatric settings against all forms of harm to self and others is sacrosanct. While understanding dual harm is crucial in the care and rehabilitation of patients in forensic psychiatric settings, only a few studies have explored this phenomenon. This study examined dual harm and its associated clinical and sociodemographic factors among forensic patients in Ontario, Canada."
"Brain function requires continuous energy supply. Thus, unraveling brain metabolic regulation is critical not only for our basic understanding of overall brain function, but also for the cellular basis of functional neuroimaging techniques. While it is known that brain energy metabolism is exquisitely compartmentalized between astrocytes and neurons, the metabolic and neuro-energetic basis of brain activity is far from fully understood."
"Although, the impact of mulberry leaves on mortality of Bombyx mori [silkworm] and cocooning rates has been investigated, limited research has exploited the influence on the quality of B. mori pupae. This study evaluated the effects of four mulberry cultivars (Ichinose, Noi-EX-Thailand, Ex-Thika and Victory1) on the nutritional quality of B. mori pupae. The proximate composition, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals of different mulberry cultivars and silkworm pupae were analyzed using standard methods. Silkworms fed on Noi-EX-Thailand and Ex-Thika cultivars exhibited the highest crude protein (57.9%) and fat content (44.3%), respectively. Eight essential amino acids were identified in silkworm pupae, with histidine (6.02-7.12 μg/100mg) being the most abundant, followed by significant amounts of lysine (1.40-5.03 μg/100 mg), leucine (1.96-2.47μg/100 mg), and valine (0.89-2.03 μg/100 mg). Pupae raised on Noi-Ex-Thailand leaves had the highest total amino acid content (23.01 μg/100 mg). Potassium was the major mineral in pupae (505.62-665.30 mg/100 mg), with the highest levels observed in those fed on Noi-EX-Thailand. Vitamin C levels ranged from 28.84 to 61.88 mg/100 g, with pupae fed on Victory1 showing the highest concentration. There was a strong positive correlation between magnesium, crude protein and nitrogen-free extracts of mulberry leaves that mirrored the corresponding levels in silkworm pupae. These results underscore the importance of mulberry leaf composition in determining silkworm pupae quality, especially when considering their use as sustainable ingredient for the food, feed and pharmaceutical industry."
"Using a mixed-methods triangulation approach we piloted the Composite Abuse Scale-Brazilian version (CAS-Brazil) at the House of the Brazilian Woman of Curitiba among 62 survivors of intimate partner violence and four professionals serving survivors to assess its feasibility for use. Quantitative data were tabulated using descriptive statistics while qualitative data were recorded, coded, and thematically analyzed. Four qualitative domains emerged: (a) conceptual understanding; (b) item definitions; (c) women's experiences; and (d) professionals' perspectives. Comprehension of the CAS-Brazil appeared high across participants from diverse backgrounds. Professionals viewed it as highly feasible for use in Brazilian cross-sectoral services to support survivor decision-making."
"Little is known about the association between grain preference and abdominal fat accumulation, and mediating roles of circulating lipidomic signatures. We quantified 1245 circulating lipids in 150 normal-weight central obesity (NWCO) cases and 150 controls using targeted lipidomics. Grain preference was determined by the highest intake frequency of grains (white rice, wheat, or coarse grain). In our participants with high wheat intake frequency, preferring coarse grain over rice was associated with a 60% lower risk of NWCO. Of the 585 lipids showing opposing associations with white rice and coarse grains, 46 were significantly linked to either (p < 0.05), predominantly alkylacyl phospholipids (PE-Os; n = 9) and alkenylacylphospholipids (PE-Ps; n = 7). Network analysis identified a module primarily composed of PE-Os and PE-Ps, which was positively associated with coarse grain (p = 0.014). Another module, mainly consisting of triacylglycerols (TGs), was associated with white rice (p = 0.003) and mediated the association between white rice (mediation proportion: 20.30%; p = 0.027) or coarse grain preference (11.43%; p = 0.040) and NWCO. Specific lipids, such as TG(8:0_16:0_16:0) and TG(8:0_14:0_18:0), exhibited notable mediation effects. In normal-weight individuals with high wheat intake frequency, preferring coarse grain was inversely associated with NWCO, mediated by specific lipidomic signatures."
"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic has been the most severe public health emergency since 2019. Currently, the Omicron variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been the most dominant. The most prominent symptom of SARS-CoV-2 infection is respiratory. Meanwhile, the fatality of COVID-19 was mainly from pneumonia. However ,in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who have pneumonia and those who do not, the differences in the immune repertoire still require further investigation."
"Vitamin D is an essential micronutrient for multiple physiological processes, and its deficiency remains a world-wide public health problem that cannot be ignored. Dried blood spot (DBS) is a convenient tool in large-scale epidemiological studies, but its application in evaluating vitamin D status in Chinese population is still scarce. Herein, we aimed to determine the vitamin D status in Chinese pre-school children using DBS coupled with LC-MS/MS method."
"There is limited information available regarding post-simultaneous pancreatic kidney transplantation (SPKT) pregnancies. The present case describes a woman in her early 30s with first pregnancy who conceived spontaneously 4 years after SPKT. Her pancreatic and kidney graft function remained stable throughout the pregnancy. Creatinine was 0.6-0.7 mg/dL and Hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) was 5.1%. There was no pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, rejection or infection. There was gestational thrombocytopenia, which was managed conservatively. Tacrolimus levels fell during the antenatal period and subsequently rose post partum. Mycophenolate was discontinued and switched to azathioprine 6 weeks prior. Caesarean section was done at 36 weeks because of oligohydramnios and vaginal warts delivering a healthy, live, full-term baby. Her graft function was stable on follow-up and the baby was doing well. High-risk pregnancies occur in female SPKT recipients. A multidisciplinary team should closely monitor the course of pregnancy events and immunosuppression."
"Aortic pseudoaneurysm is a rare but life-threatening complication following aortic surgery. Although surgical repair remains the gold standard for treatment, alternative approaches such as transcatheter strategies are increasingly considered viable options, particularly in patients with high surgical risk due to comorbidities, anatomical challenges or technical constraints. We present the case of a 72-year-old male patient who developed a subaortic pseudoaneurysm during radiological follow-up after a previous Bentall operation. Given the high surgical risk, our multidisciplinary heart team opted for coil embolization via a transapical approach. The objective of this work was to present a step-by-step explanation of the transapical embolization with the coil as a landmark for all surgeons who want to perform it."
We examined the association between perceived discrimination and the risk of cognitive impairment with no dementia (CIND) and Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) while considering the potential effects of nativity status.
"Exercise intolerance and exertional dyspnoea are hallmarks of fibrosing interstitial lung disease (FILD) and are associated with worse prognosis and quality of life. Activation of pulmonary vagal afferents influences the ventilatory pattern and contributes to the sensation of dyspnoea. We tested the hypothesis that nebulized fentanyl, which might attenuate aberrant pulmonary afferent activity in FILD, reduces ventilation and dyspnoea while extending exercise endurance time (EET). In this randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled study, eight FILD patients (two males, 71 ± 6 years of age) performed incremental cardiopulmonary cycle exercise tests following nebulization of either fentanyl citrate (100 µg) or 0.9% saline. Previous work indicated that this dose was unlikely to produce central effects. Comparisons between treatment conditions at rest were undertaken using Student's paired t-test, and exercise data were evaluated with two-way ANOVA with repeated measures. Dyspnoea was assessed using the Borg dyspnoea scale. Resting respiratory variables were not different following treatment with fentanyl and saline; however, resting heart rate was lower following fentanyl (P = 0.002) and remained lower throughout exercise compared with placebo (P = 0.008). Fentanyl did not increase EET (placebo 334 ± 117 s vs. fentanyl 348 ± 126 s, P = 0.250) although overall minute ventilation was reduced slightly (mean difference: -0.97 L/min, P = 0.022). There were no differences in ratings of dyspnoea intensity or unpleasantness between the conditions either at rest or at end-exercise. Nebulized fentanyl did not improve EET or exercise dyspnoea but did decrease minute ventilation during exercise, although the extent of this reduction appears clinically insignificant. These findings suggest that nebulized fentanyl is unlikely to offer significant benefits for enhancing exercise capacity in FILD."
"Identifying cell types and brain regions critical for psychiatric disorders and brain traits is essential for targeted neurobiological research. By integrating genomic insights from genome-wide association studies with a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the adult human brain, we prioritized specific neuronal clusters significantly enriched for the SNP-heritabilities for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder along with intelligence, education, and neuroticism. Extrapolation of cell-type results to brain regions reveals the whole-brain impact of schizophrenia genetic risk, with subregions in the hippocampus and amygdala exhibiting the most significant enrichment of SNP-heritability. Using functional MRI connectivity, we further confirmed the significance of the central and lateral amygdala, hippocampal body, and prefrontal cortex in distinguishing schizophrenia cases from controls. Our findings underscore the value of single-cell transcriptomics in understanding the polygenicity of psychiatric disorders and suggest a promising alignment of genomic, transcriptomic, and brain imaging modalities for identifying common biological targets."
"Epithelial cancers are typically heterogeneous with primary prostate cancer being a typical example of histological and genomic variation. Prior studies of primary prostate cancer tumour genetics revealed extensive inter and intra-patient genomic tumour heterogeneity. Recent advances in machine learning have enabled the inference of ground-truth genomic single-nucleotide and copy number variant status from transcript data. While these inferred SNV and CNV states can be used to resolve clonal phylogenies, however, it is still unknown how faithfully transcript-based tumour phylogenies reconstruct ground truth DNA-based tumour phylogenies. We sought to study the accuracy of inferred-transcript to recapitulate DNA-based tumour phylogenies. We first performed in-silico comparisons of inferred and directly resolved SNV and CNV status, from single cancer cells, from three different cell lines. We found that inferred SNV phylogenies accurately recapitulate DNA phylogenies (entanglement = 0.097). We observed similar results in iCNV and CNV based phylogenies (entanglement = 0.11). Analysis of published prostate cancer DNA phylogenies and inferred CNV, SNV and transcript based phylogenies demonstrated phylogenetic concordance. Finally, a comparison of pseudo-bulked spatial transcriptomic data to adjacent sections with WGS data also demonstrated recapitulation of ground truth (entanglement = 0.35). These results suggest that transcript-based inferred phylogenies recapitulate conventional genomic phylogenies. Further work will need to be done to increase accuracy, genomic, and spatial resolution."
"Misfolding and accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) lead to neuronal loss through various mechanisms, including the downregulation of eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (EEF2) protein synthesis signaling. This study investigated the neuroprotective effects of indole and coumarin derivatives on Aβ folding and EEF2 signaling using SH-SY5Y cells expressing Aβ-green fluorescent protein (GFP) folding reporter. Among the tested compounds, two indole (NC009-1, -6) and two coumarin (LM-021, -036) derivatives effectively reduced Aβ misfolding and associated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Additionally, these compounds decreased acetylcholinesterase and caspase-3/-6 activities while promoting neurite outgrowth. NC009-1 increased active phosphorylation of extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK) (T202/Y204), leading to an increase in inactive eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (EEF2K) phosphorylation (S366). LM-021 decreased the active phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) (T172) and EEF2K (S398), while LM-036 exhibited dual effects, increasing inactive phosphorylation and decreasing active phosphorylation of EEF2K. These changes in EEF2K phosphorylation led to decreased EEF2K activity and a subsequent reduction in inactive phosphorylation of EEF2 (T56). This cascade further promoted the phosphorylation of transcription factor cAMP-response-element binding protein (CREB) (S133) and the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and reduced BCL-2 associated X-protein (BAX)/B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) ratio. Knockdown of EEF2 abolished the effects of NC009-1, LM-021, and LM-036 on CREB phosphorylation, BDNF expression, caspase-3 activity, and neurite outgrowth. These findings demonstrate that NC009-1, LM-021, and LM-036 exert their neuroprotective effects through modulation of EEF2K signaling, highlighting their potentials as therapeutic candidates for AD."
"This mixed-methods study explores the impact of the Vista curriculum, a trauma-informed antiviolence intervention program for women who have used force in their intimate relationships, delivered by the Department of the Air Force Family Advocacy Program clinicians. Questions sought to understand any changes in personal growth, self-awareness, beliefs, and relationship interaction skills for 62 cisgender women. Findings suggest that women gained personal growth, self-awareness, and increased relationship tools. Women identified the positive impact cofacilitator support and non-judgment had on them and their ability to heal from their experiences and increase their awareness of viable non-forceful alternatives. Policy and practice implications are discussed."
"Many phenotypic traits have a polygenic genetic basis, making it challenging to learn their genetic architectures and predict individual phenotypes. One promising avenue to resolve the genetic basis of complex traits is through evolve-and-resequence (E&R) experiments, in which laboratory populations are exposed to some selective pressure and trait-contributing loci are identified by extreme frequency changes over the course of the experiment. However, small laboratory populations will experience substantial random genetic drift, and it is difficult to determine whether selection played a role in a given allele frequency change (AFC). Predicting AFCs under drift and selection, even for alleles contributing to simple, monogenic traits, has remained a challenging problem. Recently, there have been efforts to apply the path integral, a method borrowed from physics, to solve this problem. So far, this approach has been limited to genic selection, and is therefore inadequate to capture the complexity of quantitative, highly polygenic traits that are commonly studied. Here, we extend one of these path integral methods, the perturbation approximation, to selection scenarios that are of interest to quantitative genetics. We derive analytic expressions for the transition probability (i.e. the probability that an allele will change in frequency from x to y in time t) of an allele contributing to a trait subject to stabilizing selection, as well as that of an allele contributing to a trait rapidly adapting to a new phenotypic optimum. We use these expressions to characterize the use of AFC to test for selection, as well as explore optimal design choices for E&R experiments to uncover the genetic architecture of polygenic traits under selection."
"Ulcerative colitis is a chronic relapsing-remitting and potentially progressive form of inflammatory bowel disease in which there is extensive inflammation and mucosal damage in the colon and rectum as a result of an abnormal immune response. MV130 is a mucosal-trained immunity-based vaccine used to prevent respiratory tract infections in various clinical settings. Additionally, MV130 may induce innate immune cells that acquire anti-inflammatory properties and promote tolerance, which could have important implications for chronic inflammatory diseases such as ulcerative colitis. This work demonstrated that the prophylactic administration of MV130 substantially mitigated colitis in a mouse model of acute colitis induced by dextran sulphate sodium. MV130 downregulated systemic and local inflammatory responses, maintained the integrity of the intestinal barrier by preserving the enterocyte layer and goblet cells, and reduced the oedema and fibrosis characteristic of the disease. Mechanistically, MV130 significantly reduced the infiltration of neutrophils and pro-inflammatory macrophages in the intestinal wall of the diseased animals and favoured the appearance of M2-polarised macrophages. These results suggest that MV130 might have therapeutic potential for the treatment of ulcerative colitis, reducing the risk of relapse and the progression of disease."
Candida auris (C. auris) is an emerging fungus pathogen associated with nosocomial infections that is seen as a serious global health issue.
"In the marine realm, unidirectional ocean currents often lead to high migration rates of marine organisms and, therefore, inhibit the formation of their latitudinal genetic structure. In contrast, cryptic latitudinal structures associated with local adaptation may frequently exist in widespread species generally exposed to a strong environmental heterogeneity. However, our understanding of the evolvability of locally adapted populations in open marine environments still needs to be completed. The coastal area along the Sea of Japan, where the Tsushima Warm Current flows from south to north in the Japanese Archipelago, provides a good model system for exploring this question. This study explored evidence for latitudinal local adaptation along with the prevailing ocean current in the ice goby Leucopsarion petersii at the phenotypic and genomic levels. Common garden experiments clearly showed genetically based clinal variation in growth rate, strongly suggesting local adaptation through conutergradient selection of this fitness-related trait. Analyses based on reduced-representation sequencing revealed a slight signal of genetic differentiation between the southern and northern populations, although continuous historical gene flow between them was supported by demographic modelling. Also, whole-genome resequencing showed their independent demographic history during the last glacial period. Thus, these results suggest that gene flow along with the prevailing ocean current is somewhat limited, and the populations are not completely panmictic. Furthermore, the selection scan based on low-coverage genome-wide sequencing detected putative genomic signatures of latitudinal adaptation of growth-related genes. Thus, our integrative study provided a novel example of marine local adaptation under a large ocean current."
"Glycerophosphocholine (GPC) is an intracellular metabolite in phosphatidylcholine metabolism and has been studied for endogenous choline supply in cells. GPC, as a water-soluble supplement, has been expected to play a role in preventing brain disorders; however, recent studies have shown that intake of high levels of choline-containing compounds is related to trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) production in the liver, which is reportedly associated with the progression of atherosclerosis. In this study, we aimed to explore the mechanisms underlying the intestinal absorption and metabolism of GPC. Caco-2 cell monolayer experiments showed that exogenously added GPC was hydrolyzed to choline in the apical medium, and the resulting choline was transported into the Caco-2 cells and further to the basolateral medium. Subsequently, we focused on glycerophosphodiesterase 1 (Gpcpd1/GDE5), which hydrolyzes GPC to choline in vitro and is widely expressed in the gastrointestinal epithelium. Our results revealed that the Gpcpd1 protein was located not only in cells but also in the medium in which Caco-2 cells were cultured. Gpcpd1 siRNA decreased the GPC-hydrolyzing activity both inside Caco-2 cells and in conditioned medium, suggesting the involvement of Gpcpd1 in luminal GPC metabolism. Finally, we generated intestinal epithelial-specific Gpcpd1-deficient mice and found that Gpcpd1 deletion in intestinal epithelial cells affected GPC metabolism in intestinal tissues and partially abolished the increase in blood TMAO levels induced by GPC administration. These observations demonstrate that Gpcpd1 triggers choline production from GPC in the intestinal lumen and is a key endogenous enzyme that regulates TMAO levels following GPC supplementation."
"Cerebellar heterotopia (CH) is a neuroradiologic abnormality that is poorly reported and investigated in the literature. It can be observed as an isolated finding, but it has been mainly reported in the context of cerebellar dysgenesis and syndromic conditions. This study aims to provide a comprehensive neuroradiologic, clinical, and genetic characterization of a cohort of pediatric patients with CH."
"Noninvasive neuromodulation, particularly through low-intensity ultrasound, holds promise in the fields of neuroscience and neuro-engineering. Ultrasound can stimulate the central nervous system to treat neurologic disorders of the brain and activate peripheral nerve activity. The aim of this study is to investigate the inhibitory effect of low-intensity ultrasonic tibial nerve stimulation on both the physiological state and the overactive bladder (OAB) model in rats."
"Fast and reliable identification of bacteria directly in clinical samples is a critical factor in clinical microbiological diagnostics. Current approaches require time-consuming bacterial isolation and enrichment procedures, delaying stratified treatment. Here, we describe a biomarker-based strategy that utilises bacterial small molecular metabolites and lipids for direct detection of bacteria in complex samples using mass spectrometry (MS). A spectral metabolic library of 233 bacterial species is mined for markers showing specificity at different phylogenetic levels. Using a univariate statistical analysis method, we determine 359 so-called taxon-specific markers (TSMs). We apply these TSMs to the in situ detection of bacteria using healthy and cancerous gastrointestinal tissues as well as faecal samples. To demonstrate the MS method-agnostic nature, samples are analysed using spatial metabolomics and traditional bulk-based metabolomics approaches. In this work, TSMs are found in >90% of samples, suggesting the general applicability of this workflow to detect bacterial presence with standard MS-based analytical methods."
"Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), a hallmark of cancer, is related to prognosis, tumor progression, and treatment response. Nevertheless, the correlation of ROS-based molecular signature with clinical outcome and immune cell infiltration has not been thoroughly studied in bladder cancer (BLCA). Accordingly, we aimed to thoroughly examine the role and prognostic value of ROS-related genes in BLCA."

"Host-gut microbiota interactions are more complex than good or bad. Both gut symbiotic bacteria and pathobionts can provide essential functions to their host in one scenario and yet be detrimental to host health in another. So, these gut-dwelling bacteria must be tightly controlled to avoid harmful effects on the host. However, how pathobionts and other symbiotic bacteria coordinate to establish a host immune defense system remains unclear. Here, using a Tephritidae fruit fly Bactrocera dorsalis, we report that both pathobionts and other gut symbiotic bacteria release tyramine, which is recognized by the host insects. These tyramines induce the formation of insect-conserved Malpighian tubules-gut countercurrent flow upon bacterial infection, which requires tyramine receptors and aquaporins. At the same time, pathobionts but not gut symbiotic bacteria induce the generation of reactive oxygen species, which are preserved by the countercurrent flow, promoting bacteria elimination through increasing gut peristalsis. More importantly, our results show that the Malpighian tubules-gut countercurrent flow maintains proper microbiota composition. Our work suggests a model where pathobiont-induced reactive oxygen species are preserved by Malpighian tubules-gut countercurrent flow involving both pathobionts and symbiotic bacteria. Furthermore, our work provides a Malpighian tubules-gut interaction that ensures efficient maintenance of the gut microbiota."
"SARS-CoV-2 Envelope (E) protein is critical in viral assembly, release, and virulence. E gene was considered highly conserved and evolving slowly. Pan-sarbecoviruses-conserved regions in the E gene have been used as targets for various RT-PCR assays to detect SARS-CoV-2. It remains elusive whether SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) have accumulated significant E mutations that may affect protein stability and diagnostic RT-PCR assays. Herein we aimed to perform a comprehensive genetic analysis on the conservation and diversity of the E gene of SARS-CoV-2 and its VOCs in comparison with other human coronaviruses (HCoVs). In silico analysis of 20 326 HCoV E gene sequences retrieved from GenBank and GISAID suggests that SARS-CoV-2 E gene has multiple pan-HCoVs- and pan-SARS-CoV-2-conserved positions but accumulates significant mutations in VOC B.1.351 and Omicron strains. Mutations were often found in the 5' and 3' variable regions, whereas the central region is conserved. Nucleotide changes C109U and A114G may lead to potential failure of first-line SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic/screening assays. Nucleotide change C212U and its concomitant amino acid substitution Pro71Leu (i.e., C212U/Pro71Leu) is a hallmark mutation of B.1.351 variants, while C26U/Thr9Ile is characteristic of all Omicron variants. Later Omicron subvariants, such as XBB.1.5 and EG.5, additionally acquired the A31G/Thr11Ala mutation, as was confirmed by whole genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 in 118 pediatric cases. Wild-type E protein exhibits cytotoxicity to cells, but the mutations Thr9Ile, Thr11Ala, Thr9Ile + Thr11Ala, or Pro71Leu reduces its cytotoxicity. The Thr9Ile + Thr11Ala mutation stabilizes the E proteins of Omicron variants, while Pro71Leu alters the cellular distribution of the E protein, reducing its colocalization with the Golgi body. Altogether, this study not only sheds light on the conservation and diversity of the E gene in SARS-CoV-2 and its VOCs but also informs the improvement and development of SARS-CoV-2 or pan-HCoVs screening and diagnostic assays."
"Bgee (https://www.bgee.org/) is a database to retrieve and compare gene expression patterns in multiple animal species. Expression data are integrated and made comparable between species thanks to consistent data annotation and processing. In the past years, we have integrated single-cell RNA-sequencing expression data into Bgee through careful curation of public datasets in multiple species. We have fully integrated this new technology along with the wealth of other data existing in Bgee. As a result, Bgee can now provide one definitive answer all the way to the cell resolution about a gene's expression pattern, comparable between species. We have updated our programmatic access tools to adapt to these changes accordingly. We have introduced a new web interface, providing detailed access to our annotations and expression data. It enables users to retrieve data, e.g. for specific organs, cell types or developmental stages, and leverages ontology reasoning to build powerful queries. Finally, we have expanded our species count from 29 to 52, emphasizing fish species critical for vertebrate genome studies, species of agronomic and veterinary importance and nonhuman primates."
"The impact of sex on coronary artery disease prognosis is debated. It has been postulated that women receive less prompt treatment compared with men, potentially adversely affecting their prognosis by significantly increasing the risk of morbidity and mortality. We aim to investigate the influence of sex on the timing and clinical outcomes of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients using a controlled Swiss registry."
"Predator recognition is essential for prey survival, allowing for appropriate antipredator strategies. Some bird species, such as the red-backed shrike (Lanius collurio), distinguish not only between predators and non-threatening species but also between different predator species. Earlier studies have identified general predator ""key features"", especially beak shape and talons, as critical for predator recognition. The question, though, still remains of whether exchanging predator key features with those of nonpredatory species or, alternatively, completely removing them, have different or equal impact on recognition. Here we tested to ascertain whether the presence of the ""incorrect key features"" of a harmless pigeon (Columba livia) placed on a common kestrel (Falco tinnunculus) body impairs predator recognition more efficiently than the absence of any key features. We presented an unmodified kestrel dummy and two modified kestrel dummies (one with pigeon key features, the other lacking key features) to wild red-backed shrikes defending their nest. The shrikes attacked the unmodified dummy kestrel more intensively than both kestrel modifications when defending the nest. However, shrikes did not show different responses to the kestrel with pigeon key features and the featureless kestrel. Our findings show that the absence and exchange of key features have the same effect in this case. These results are discussed in the context of recognition of a specific predator species and predators as a category in general."
"Little data exists for evaluating the prevalence and patient characteristics of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) according to the latest 2022 guidelines for FH published by the Japan Atherosclerosis Society (JAS), which revised the Achilles tendon thickness (ATT) threshold from 9.0 mm in both sexes to 8.0 mm in men and 7.5 mm in women. This study used a nationwide registry of patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) to evaluate the prevalence of FH according to the latest diagnostic criteria for FH and to investigate the application of Achilles tendon imaging in the diagnosis of FH.A previous prospective observational study at 59 Japanese centers involving consecutive patients with ACS who were managed between April 2015 and August 8, 2016 was conducted to explore lipid management and persistent risk in patients hospitalized for ACS (EXPLORE-J). The study population consisted of 1,944 EXPLORE-J enrollees."

"Vaccination remains the sole effective strategy for combating Japanese encephalitis (JE). Both inactivated and live attenuated vaccines exhibit robust immunogenicity. However, the production of these conventional vaccine modalities necessitates extensive cultivation of the pathogen, incurring substantial costs and presenting significant biosafety risks. Moreover, the administration of live pathogens poses potential hazards for individuals or animals with compromised immune systems or other health vulnerabilities. Subsequently, ongoing research endeavors are focused on the development of next-generation JE vaccines utilizing nanoparticle (NP) platforms. This systematic review seeks to aggregate the research findings pertaining to NP-based vaccine development against JE. A thorough literature search was conducted across established English-language databases for research articles on JE NP vaccine development published between 2000 and 2023. A total of twenty-eight published studies were selected for detailed analysis in this review. Of these, 16 studies (57.14%) concentrated on virus-like particles (VLPs) employing various structural proteins. Other approaches, including sub-viral particles (SVPs), biopolymers, and both synthetic and inorganic NP platforms, were utilized to a lesser extent. The results of these investigations indicated that, despite variations in the usage of adjuvants, dosages, NP types, antigenic proteins, and animal models employed across different studies, the candidate NP vaccines developed were capable of eliciting enhanced humoral and cellular adaptive immune responses, providing effective protection (70-100%) for immunized mice against lethal challenges posed by virulent Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). In conclusion, prospective next-generation JE vaccines for humans and animals may emerge from these candidate formulations following further evaluation in subsequent vaccine development phases."
"Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD) disease is a defect in the function of the Branched-chain 2-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex (BCKDH). It is caused by pathogenic biallelic variants in BCKDHA, BCKA decarboxylase, or dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase. The brain is the major organ involved in MSUD. MSUD happens in about 1 in 86,800 to 185,000 live births. According to some diversity in the management of Iranian patients with MSUD, the development of a national guideline is essential. This guideline is provided through a literature search on articles in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Sciences, Cochrane, and Embase databases from 2001 to 2022 accompanied by a consensus of physicians of different centers in Iran who are experts in the diagnosis and management of this disease. This article considers pathogenesis, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of MSUD patients with limited recourse."
"Breast cancer is the leading cause of death and morbidity among women. A major challenge for clinical management of breast cancer is the dissemination of breast cancer cells from the primary tumor site via lymphatic drainage, resulting in metastatic tumor spread. Recent studies have found that high expression of the microRNA miR-146a-5p is associated with better survival outcomes for breast cancer patients. However, the mechanisms for this prognostic benefit are not fully elucidated, including whether or not miR-146a-5p plays a role in suppression of lymphatic dissemination. In this study, we investigated the role and uncovered functional mechanisms of miR-146a-5p in breast cancer. We found that high expression of miR-146a-5p is associated with better clinical outcomes, specifically in the patients with N0 breast cancer. In culture, miR-146a-5p overexpression in MCF-7 breast cancer cells suppressed cell migration and lymphangiogenesis in lymphatic endothelial cells. When implanted in the mammary fat pad of mice, we observed that miR-146a-5p overexpressing MCF-7 suppressed lymphatic dissemination but had no effect on tumor progression in the primary site. This suppression was associated with fewer disseminated cancer cells and reduced lymphangiogenesis in the draining and distal lymph nodes. In conclusion, these results suggest that miR-146a-5p can exhibit a protective role against breast cancer metastasis, and it can be a therapeutic target for breast cancer."

"Angiogenesis describes the sprouting of blood vessels from existing vasculatures and it plays a pivotal role in disease progress such as diabetes, age-related macular degeneration and cancer. However, the most widely used anti-angiogenic agents targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway still lacked of specificity and therapeutic efficacy. To establish a method suitable for high-throughput drug screening and faithfully recapitulate the feature of in vivo angiogenesis, we generated a PECAM1-mRuby3-secNluc; ACTA2-EGFP dual reporter human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) line and utilizing the cell line to establish a visualized and quantifiable in vitro angiogenesis model with stem cell-derived vascular organoid. Using this method, we evaluated the anti-angiogenic effect of VEGFR inhibitor and efficiently identified several potential candidates of pro- and anti-angiogenic therapy via bioluminescence-based quantification. Overall, our study provides a valuable platform for in vitro drug screenings."
"Cholangiocarcinoma is a malignant tumor that emerges in the intrahepatic or extrahepatic bile ducts. Doramectin (DOR), a third-generation derivative of avermectins (AVMs), is renowned for its low toxicity and high efficiency. However, no research has hitherto focused on the anti-cholangiocarcinoma effects of these drugs. In this study, we undertook a preliminary exploration of the mechanism through which DOR inhibits the viability of human cholangiocarcinoma cells (Mz-ChA-1) via transcriptome analysis and molecular validation at the cellular level. The results indicated that DOR could suppress the growth and proliferation of Mz-ChA-1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, it significantly diminished their migration and invasion abilities. Cell cycle analysis disclosed arrest in the G1 phase, accompanied by an increase in p21 expression and a decrease in the levels of the cyclin E1 and CDK2 proteins. Additionally, DOR induced apoptosis via the ROS-triggered mitochondrial pathway. This was attested by an elevation in the BAX/BCL-2 ratio, the activation of caspase 3/7 and the cleavage of PARP1. These mechanistic insights underscore DOR's potential as a therapeutic agent against cholangiocarcinoma."

"Object play has been proposed to provide individuals with information about their environment, facilitating foraging skills and tool use. In species where object play co-occurs with locomotor or social play, it may have additional functional implications, such as facilitating the evaluation of peers or forming social bonds. For instance, ravens judge others' competitiveness via play caching and engage in social play by exchanging objects. However, most raven studies were conducted on a restricted number of individuals and under controlled captive settings. To validate these findings and to gauge the functional scope of object play under field conditions, we investigated the patterns and characteristics of object play in individually marked free-flying ravens in the Austrian Alps. Using two large data sets, we show a decrease in object play with age and a preference for playing longer with novel objects, supporting findings from captivity. We also find adults occasionally playing with objects and no difference in the duration of social or non-social object play bouts across age classes. Taken together, our findings are in line with the assumption that raven object play likely has more than one function and serves to gain information about the individual's physical and social environment."

"The apelin receptor (APJR) emerges as a promising drug target for cardiovascular health and muscle regeneration. While prior research unveiled the structural versatility of APJR in coupling to Gi proteins as a monomer or dimer, the dynamic regulation within the APJR dimer during activation remains poorly understood. In this study, we present the structures of the APJR dimer and monomer complexed with its endogenous ligand apelin-13. In the dimeric structure, apelin-13 binds exclusively to one protomer that is coupled with Gi proteins, revealing a distinct ligand-binding behavior within APJR homodimers. Furthermore, binding of an antagonistic antibody induces a more compact dimerization by engaging both protomers. Notably, structural analyses of the APJR dimer complexed with an agonistic antibody, with or without Gi proteins, suggest that G protein coupling may promote the dissociation of the APJR dimer during activation. These findings underscore the intricate interplay between ligands, dimerization, and G protein coupling in regulating APJR signaling pathways."
"Kidney physiology shows diurnal variation, and a disrupted circadian rhythm is associated with kidney disease. However, it remains largely unknown whether glomeruli, the filtering units in the kidney, are under circadian control. Here, we investigated core circadian clock components in glomeruli, together with their rhythmic targets and modes of regulation. With clock gene reporter mice, cell-autonomous glomerular clocks which likely govern rhythmic fluctuations in glomerular physiology were identified. Using circadian time-series transcriptomic profiling, the first circadian glomerular transcriptome with 375 rhythmic transcripts, enriched for extracellular matrix and glucocorticoid receptor signaling ontologies, were identified. Subsets of rhythmic matrix-related genes required for basement membrane assembly and turnover, and circadian variation in matrix ultrastructure, coinciding with peak abundance of rhythmic basement membrane proteins, were uncovered. This provided multiomic evidence for interactions between glomerular matrix and intracellular time-keeping mechanisms. Furthermore, glucocorticoids, which are frequently used to treat glomerular disease, reset the podocyte clock and induce rhythmic expression of potential glomerular disease genes associated with nephrotic syndrome that included Nphs1 (nephrin) and Nphs2 (podocin). Disruption of the clock with pharmacological inhibition altered the expression of these disease genes, indicating an interplay between clock gene expression and key genes required for podocyte health. Thus, our results provide a strong basis for future investigations of the functional implications and therapeutic potential of chronotherapy in glomerular health and disease."
"The HECT-type E3 ubiquitin WWP1 (also known as NEDD4-like E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase WWP1) acts as an oncogenic factor in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. WWP1 overexpression in AML confers a proliferative advantage to leukemic blasts (abnormal immature white blood cells) and counteracts apoptotic cell death and differentiation. In an effort to elucidate the molecular basis of WWP1 oncogenic activities, we identified WWP1 as a previously unknown negative regulator of thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP)-mediated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in AML cells. TXNIP inhibits the disulfide reductase enzymatic activity of thioredoxin (Trx), impairing its antioxidant function and, ultimately, leading to the disruption of cellular redox homeostasis. In addition, TXNIP restricts cell growth and survival by blocking glucose uptake and metabolism. Here, we found that WWP1 directly interacts with TXNIP, thus promoting its ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal proteolysis. As a result, accumulation of TXNIP in response to WWP1 inactivation in AML blasts reduces Trx activity and increases ROS production, hence inducing cellular oxidative stress. Increased ROS generation in WWP1-depleted cells culminates in DNA strand breaks and subsequent apoptosis. Coherently with TXNIP stabilization following WWP1 inactivation, we also observed an impairment of both glucose up-take and consumption. Hence, a contribution to the increased cell death observed in WWP1-depleted cells also possibly arises from the attenuation of glucose up-take and glycolytic flux resulting from TXNIP accumulation. Future studies are needed to establish whether TXNIP-dependent deregulation of redox homeostasis in WWP1-overexpressing blasts may affect the response of leukemic cells to chemotherapeutic drugs."
"Medical errors, often resulting from miscommunication and cognitive lapses during handoffs, account for numerous preventable deaths and patient harm annually. This research examined nurses' perceived workload and cognitive load during handoffs on hospital units with varying patient acuity levels and patient-nurse ratios. Conducted at a southeastern US medical facility, the study analyzed 20 handoff dyads using the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index to measure perceived workload and cognitive load. Linear regressions revealed significant associations between patient acuity levels, patient-nurse ratios, and National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index subscales, specifically mental demand ( P = .007) and performance ( P = .008). Fisher exact test and Wilcoxon rank sum test showed no significant associations between these factors and nurses' roles ( P > .05). The findings highlight the need for targeted interventions to manage workload and cognitive load, emphasizing standardized handoff protocols and technological aids. The study underscores the variability in perceived workload and cognitive load among nurses across different units. Medical-surgical units showed higher cognitive load, indicating the need for improved workload management strategies. Despite limitations, including the single-center design and small sample size, the study provides valuable insights for enhancing handoff communications and reducing medical errors."
"Live imaging methods allow the analysis of dynamic cellular processes in detail and in real-time. The Drosophila ovary represents an excellent model to explore the dynamics of a myriad of developmental processes, such as cell division, stemness, differentiation, migration, apoptosis, autophagy, cellular adhesion, etc., over time. Recently, we have implemented an extended ex vivo culture and live imaging of the female Drosophila GSC niche. Using a Drosophila line harboring a GFP::Par-1 transgene as an example, this method allows the visualization of the GSCs' asymmetric division within their niche and the description of the changes in the spectrosome morphology along the cell cycle. Here, we present a detailed protocol for the ex vivo culture of Drosophila germaria, enabling prolonged visualization of the female GSC niche. Importantly, this protocol is broadly applicable to live imaging GSCs with multiple fluorescently tagged proteins of interest that are available in stock centers and/or in the Drosophila research community."
"This study explores the perceived walkability of one-way commercial streets by utilizing immersive 360-degree virtual reality (VR) videos. While one-way roads are often introduced to facilitate smooth traffic flow on narrow roads, providing safe and walkable environments for pedestrians on the one-way roads is crucial, especially in commercial areas with heavy pedestrian traffic. We recruited 40 students to assess the perceived walkability of one-way roads based on ten VR scenarios. For each scenario, variables such as road width, one-way traffic status, vehicle approach direction, and the presence of sidewalks were configured differently. This study found that while there is awareness of one-way road types, the presence of sidewalks is considered critical factor contributing to enhanced perceived walkability on narrow commercial street. In the condition of narrow road width, one-way roads are the only applicable road layout to have a sidewalk, implying the potential of one-way roads for better walkability. Besides, the study also revealed the high correlation between five dimensions of perceived walkability, emphasizing their role to enhance perceived walkability in a setting of one-way roads. This study's findings could be utilized for more systematic walkability assessments and urban design improvements, especially in constrained road spaces."
"Sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping has been shown to be important for staging in dogs with mast cell tumors (MCTs). Despite this, many patients are referred to an oncologist after surgical intervention has been carried out. It is unknown whether lymphatic drainage patterns are altered by surgery and whether postoperative SLN mapping can be reliably conducted. The objective of this study was to compare lymphatic drainage patterns from MCT sites before and after surgical removal to determine whether the SLN changes following tumor excision. Twenty-nine client-owned dogs with 31 cytologically diagnosed MCTs were prospectively enrolled, with 14 dogs (N = 15 MCTs) completing the study. Preoperative SLN mapping was conducted using radiographic indirect lymphography (IL). Water-soluble iodinated contrast (WIC) medium was injected peritumorally using a 4-quadrant technique and digital radiography was then used to assess lymphatic drainage patterns. Orthogonal projections were obtained every 1 to 2 min until the SLN was visualized, up to 20 min post-injection. Dogs were re-evaluated 2 to 5 wk postoperatively and radiographic IL was carried out again using the same protocol as previously described with WIC injected around the surgical scar line in a 4-quadrant technique. An SLN was identified for 15 MCTs in 14 dogs preoperatively and in 13/15 MCTs postoperatively. Sixteen dogs with 16 MCTs did not have postoperative lymphography and did not complete the study. Agreement between preoperative and postoperative SLNs was a complete match in 7/15 MCTs, a partial match in 5/15 MCTs, and no match in 3/15 MCTs. A negative IL study was obtained in 2/15 MCTs postoperatively. Complete agreement between preoperative and postoperative SLN identification was detected in 46.7% of cases and there was no agreement in 20% of cases. Surgical intervention did not change the time to SLN identification when carrying out radiographic IL. Thus, surgical removal of MCTs affects lymphatic drainage and can alter the SLN(s) detected. Clinicians should be aware of this finding and interpret results of postoperative lymph node staging with caution."

"Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis is an uncommon sequela of low intracranial pressure, which may result from a lumbar puncture (LP). We describe a case of a patient in their 40s presenting with 48 hours of persistent headache following intrathecal administration of nusinersen for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) type 3. There were no focal neurological signs or symptoms apart from baseline symmetrical proximal limb weakness attributed to SMA. Initial investigations revealed radiological evidence of an acute cerebral venous sinus thrombus (CVST). The patient was promptly started on anticoagulation. Partial recanalisation was seen as soon as 48 hours after commencement of anticoagulation, with almost full resolution of the thrombus at follow-up in 2 months. Awareness of CVST as a potential complication of intrathecal therapies and diagnostic LP allows for early identification, management and prevention of serious neurological consequences."
"Multienvironment trials (METs) are crucial for identifying varieties that perform well across a target population of environments. However, METs are typically too small to sufficiently represent all relevant environment-types, and face challenges from changing environment-types due to climate change. Statistical methods that enable prediction of variety performance for new environments beyond the METs are needed. We recently developed MegaLMM, a statistical model that can leverage hundreds of trials to significantly improve genetic value prediction accuracy within METs. Here, we extend MegaLMM to enable genomic prediction in new environments by learning regressions of latent factor loadings on Environmental Covariates (ECs) across trials. We evaluated the extended MegaLMM using the maize Genome-To-Fields dataset, consisting of 4,402 varieties cultivated in 195 trials with 87.1% of phenotypic values missing, and demonstrated its high accuracy in genomic prediction under various breeding scenarios. Furthermore, we showcased MegaLMM's superiority over univariate GBLUP in predicting trait performance of experimental genotypes in new environments. Finally, we explored the use of higher-dimensional quantitative ECs and discussed when and how detailed environmental data can be leveraged for genomic prediction from METs. We propose that MegaLMM can be applied to plant breeding of diverse crops and different fields of genetics where large-scale linear mixed models are utilized."
"Liquid biopsy is an efficient diagnostic/prognostic tool for tumor-derived component detection in peripheral circulation and other body fluids. The rapid assessment of liquid biopsy techniques facilitates early cancer diagnosis and prognosis. Early and precise detection of tumor biomarkers provides crucial information about the tumor that guides clinicians towards effective personalized medicine. Point-of-care-testing remains still a great challenge in cancer diagnostics. Liquid biopsy is a promising alternative to tissue biopsy with the great advantages of less invasion and real-time monitoring of the disease, also providing information about tumor heterogeneity. The field is continuously and rapidly expanding. Numerous sophisticated biosensors have been developed targeting several biomarkers to achieve low detection limits, increased specificity and robustness. Current biosensors include mainly optical sensors, such as colorimetric, fluorescent, SPR, SERS and lateral flow assays. Electrochemical sensors have also been developed, providing very low detection limits. Colorimetric sensors exhibited simplicity in signal interpretation, while fluorescent sensors contributed to low analysis times, and SPR/SERS enabled label-free and rapid analysis. Novel target amplification and signal enhancement techniques have been exploited to increase the detectability of the sensors. In this context, this review is focused on the recent advances in biosensing technology for cutting-edge liquid biopsy applications towards point-of-care testing."
"Dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs) formalize medical decision-making as a sequence of rules for different stages, mapping patient-level information to recommended treatments. In practice, estimating an optimal DTR using observational data from electronic medical record (EMR) databases can be complicated by nonignorable missing covariates resulting from informative monitoring of patients. Since complete case analysis can provide consistent estimation of outcome model parameters under the assumption of outcome-independent missingness, Q-learning is a natural approach to accommodating nonignorable missing covariates. However, the backward induction algorithm used in Q-learning can introduce challenges, as nonignorable missing covariates at later stages can result in nonignorable missing pseudo-outcomes at earlier stages, leading to suboptimal DTRs, even if the longitudinal outcome variables are fully observed. To address this unique missing data problem in DTR settings, we propose 2 weighted Q-learning approaches where inverse probability weights for missingness of the pseudo-outcomes are obtained through estimating equations with valid nonresponse instrumental variables or sensitivity analysis. The asymptotic properties of the weighted Q-learning estimators are derived, and the finite-sample performance of the proposed methods is evaluated and compared with alternative methods through extensive simulation studies. Using EMR data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care database, we apply the proposed methods to investigate the optimal fluid strategy for sepsis patients in intensive care units."

"The BET family proteins play pleiotropic roles in the tumorigenesis and growth of various human malignancies that have aroused great interests as the cancer therapeutic targets. Therefore, it's significant to develop labeling toolkits for the dynamic monitoring of BET family proteins in living tumor cells and tissue slices. In particular, there are few small-molecule fluorescent probes based on BET family proteins developed for real-time imaging of these proteins in tumor cells and tissues and treatment of breast cancer. In general, antibodies of BET family proteins are chosen for imaging of these proteins. However, the cost of these antibodies is more expensive than small molecules and the operation is relatively complicated. Moreover, the antibodies for imaging are not capable of the therapy for breast cancer. Thus, it's essential to exploit a novel imaging system for BET family proteins which is easy-operating and economical, with achieving therapeutic effects simultaneously. Therefore, a series of fluorescent probes (17-21) targeting BET family proteins were developed. Through the evaluation studies, probe 17 showed advantages in docking studies, analysis of cell viability, and imaging studies. Importantly, probe 17 was capable of distinguishing tumor cells and tissue slices and made a distinction between them by labeling BRD3 and BRD4 proteins. Importantly, probe 17 showed higher resolution in mouse tumor and human tumor slice imaging than BRD3 and BRD4 antibodies. Moreover, compared with these antibodies, probe 17 was more stable, more economical and easier to operate in the imaging assays. In addition, it also played an anti-tumor role by inducing cell apoptosis, proliferation inhibition, and cycle arrest in tumor cells. All these features render probe 17 to perform as an effective labeling toolkit compatible for imaging studies of BRD3/BRD4, as well as an approach to diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer."
"The fracture of an endodontic instrument within the root canal system can occur during root canal therapy, complicating thorough cleaning and shaping. Consequently, managing the broken fragment becomes crucial."
"Pregnancy and lactation-associated osteoporosis (PLO) is a rare presentation of early-onset osteoporosis characterized by low trauma and spontaneous fractures during late pregnancy/lactation. Herein, we report areal BMD (aBMD) by DXA and volumetric BMD (vBMD), microarchitecture, and strength at the distal radius and tibia by HR-pQCT in 59 women with PLO-in comparison to both healthy premenopausal controls (n = 28) and premenopausal women with idiopathic osteoporotic fractures not associated with pregnancy/lactation (non-PLO IOP; n = 50). Women with PLO (aged 34 ± 6 yr) had a more severe clinical presentation than non-PLO IOP: 80% had vertebral and 92% had multiple fractures (p<.001). They had lower DXA aBMD at all sites vs Controls (all p<.001) and non-PLO IOP (all p<.05). By HR-pQCT, PLO had deficits in all radial/tibial density and most microarchitecture parameters and lower bone strength than controls (all p<.001). Compared to non-PLO IOP, PLO had lower total and trabecular density at radius and tibia (all p ≤ .01) and significant deficits in trabecular microstructure and cortical thickness at the radius only. We studied PLO subgroups with clinical factors potentially related to bone physiology: Within PLO, women with vertebral fractures had lower spine aBMD and higher tibial cortical porosity but were otherwise structurally similar to the nonvertebral group. Those with prior heparin exposure had larger bone size and trabecular area, and those with renal stones had smaller bone size and lower 1/3 radius aBMD. We also compared groups based on postpartum timing: Recent PLO (n = 25) evaluated ≤12 M postpartum, before expected recovery of pregnancy/lactation bone loss, had significantly lower aBMD than distant PLO (n = 34) evaluated >12 M postpartum. However, radial/tibial HR-pQCT measures did not differ, suggesting pre-existing and/or persistent structural deficits. This structural study increases our mechanistic understanding of the severe bone fragility presentation that characterizes PLO and also highlights areas of potential mechanistic heterogeneity that require additional investigation."
"To develop an atrophic Meibomian Gland Dysfunction (MGD) animal model via liquid nitrogen cryotherapy, the eyelid edges of C57 mice exposure to liquid nitrogen for 30 s. Morphology of MG and ocular surface were assessed using stereomicroscopy and a slit lamp microscope at multiple time points post-injury. Acinar loss and atrophy were observed from day 7, with increased inflammation and apoptosis, and decreased proliferation in acinar cells. Corneal epithelial defects appeared after day 14. Liquid nitrogen induced selective damage to meibomian acinar cells, simulating MGD pathology effectively, with peak effects at day 21, providing a relevant model for atrophic MGD research."
"The great advances in diagnostic and therapeutic skills of most sectors of medicine and dentistry have led to an increasingly greater demand from patients for accuracy, attention and diligence by healthcare workers. Dentistry is one of the branches most frequently involved in claims for damages from malpractice, especially in those sectors that are particularly costly and of significant aesthetic value. Aim of the study was to compare data of malpractice claims with those of other Authors to identify similarities and/or differences in the results and to increase epidemiological knowledge in the area of dental malpractice. This work is a descriptive study performed analyzing medical malpractice claims in which one of the Authors was nominated as court professional expert advisor from 2018 to 2022 in two of the biggest courts in Campania: Naples and Santa Maria Capua Vetere. Findings of great interest were the greater involvement of the pros-thetic and implant-prosthetic sector, the significant recurrence of clinical records deficiency and the high prevalence of claims made by female subjects. Also, there was a greater incidence of emergent damage confronted to the non-pecuniary personal injury (biological damage)."
"Breast cancer ranks as the second most prevalent malignancy among women in Nepal. This cancer has a high likelihood of cure, if detected early. Therefore, it is imperative to emphasize awareness and screening for breast cancer in Nepal. It indeed underscores the importance of clinical breast examination. The study aims to find the disease burden, association of abnormal breast condition with sociodemographic variables, and the need for change in the breast cancer screening protocol."
"The existing literature provides little insight into the efficacy of transoral endoscopy in exposing benign tumors originating from salivary glands in the parapharyngeal space at the parotid gland base and resecting part of the deep lobe with a safe margin. This study aims to investigate the efficacy of the endoscopic transoral approach for the visualization and resection of such tumors. Through transoral endoscopic cadaveric dissections and surgical procedures, we examined the anatomical structures of the parapharyngeal space and the deep lobe of the parotid gland, identifying key anatomical landmarks. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 19 patients with benign salivary gland-derived tumors in the parapharyngeal space who underwent transoral endoscopic resection. Intraoperative visualization of the tumor pedicle and the deep lobe of the parotid gland was successfully achieved in all cases, allowing for resection with safe margins. During a median follow-up period of 54.0 months, imaging revealed no signs of recurrence. Endoscopic transoral approach provides effective visualization of the deep lobe of the parotid gland and the medial portion of the parotid bed from the parapharyngeal space. Benign tumors of salivary gland-derived in this area can be well exposed and safely resected with adequate margins."
"The mean height is taller in males than in females, except for early teens. In this regard, previous studies have revealed that (1) distribution of the mean adult heights in subjects with disorders accompanied by discordance between sex chromosome complement and bioactive sex steroids and in control subjects (the British height standards) indicates that, of the ~12.5 cm of sex difference in the mean adult height, ~9 cm is accounted for by the difference in the sex chromosome complement and the remaining ~3.5 cm is explained by the dimorphism in sex steroids (primarily due to the growth-promoting effect of gonadal androgens); (2) according to the infancy-childhood-puberty growth model, the sex difference in the childhood growth function produces height differences of ~1 cm in childhood and 8-10 cm at 18-20 years of age, whereas the sex difference in the pubertal growth function yields height difference of ~4.5 cm at 18-20 years of age; and (3) SHOX expression and methylation analyses using knee cartilage tissues and cultured chondrocytes have shown lower SHOX expression levels in female samples than in male samples and methylation patterns consistent with partial spreading of X-inactivation affecting SHOX in female samples. These findings suggest that small but persistent sex difference in SHOX expression dosage leads to the variation in the sex steroid independent childhood growth function, thereby yielding the sex difference in height which remains small in childhood but becomes obvious in adulthood."
"Affect recall is key to psychological assessment and decision-making. However, self-concepts (self-beliefs) may bias retrospective affect reports such that they deviate from lived experiences. Does this experience-memory gap apply to solitude experiences? We hypothesized that individuals misremember how they feel overall and when in solitude, in line with self-concepts of introversion, self-determined/not-self-determined solitude motivations, and independent/interdependent self-construal. A pilot study comparing retrospective to daily affect reports captured over 2 weeks (N = 104 UK university students) provided preliminary evidence of introversion and not-self-determined solitude shaping affect recall."
"Sciatic nerve crush in neonatal rats leads to an extensive death of motor and sensory neurons, serving as a platform to develop new neuroprotective approaches. The endocannabinoid system plays important neuromodulatory roles and has been involved in neurodevelopment and neuroprotection. The present work investigated the role of the cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2 in the neuroprotective response after neonatal axotomy. CB1 and CB2 antagonists (AM251 and AM630, respectively) were used after sciatic nerve crush in 2-day-old Wistar rats. Five days after lesion and treatment, the rats were perfused, and the spinal cords and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) were obtained and processed to investigate neuronal survival and immunohistochemistry changes, or RT-qPCR analysis. Motoneuron survival analysis showed that blocking CB2 alone or in combination with CB1 was neuroprotective. This effect was associated with a decrease in astrogliosis and microglial reaction. Interestingly, Cnr1 (CB1) and Bdnf gene transcripts were downregulated in the spinal cords of the antagonist-treated groups. Despite no intergroup difference regarding neuronal survival in the DRG, the simultaneous blockade of CB1 and CB2 receptors led to an increased expression of both Cnr1 and Cnr2, combined with Gdnf upregulation. The results indicate that the selective antagonism of cannabinoid receptors facilitates neuroprotection and decreases glial reactivity, suggesting new potential treatment approaches."
The results of the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) surveys conducted in 2018 and 2022 allow for a comparison of selected health-related indicators from before the COVID-19 pandemic and from its final phase. The aim of the study is to assess the level of health literacy (HL) among Polish students aged 13-17 years.
We sought to investigate disparities in the utilization of next-generation genetic sequencing (NGS) across demographic groups related to several  common cancer subtypes.
"Gelatin hydrogels have drawn attention for their diverse biomedical applications due to their flexible physiochemical properties. However, such gelatin hydrogels are made of toxic crosslinkers and photoinitiators, restricting their non-invasive deep tissue application. The in-situ forming chemical crosslinked without such toxic crosslinker and UV light has not been explored under physiological conditions. This study establishes a simple method to fabricate an injectable click-chemistry-based in-situ forming gelatin hydrogel in a physiological environment (without toxic UV or photoinitiator) with tunable physiochemical properties to modulate cellular response. Using Divinyl Sulfone (DVS) modification, gelatin hydrogel (GelVS) is optimized with tunable degradation properties, moduli (100 Pa -1000 Pa), gelation time, swelling, degradation, and viscoelastic behaviour. The in-vitro results using fibroblast and stem cells show that the hydrogel and its precursors were cytocompatible with diverging feedback of cells as the modulus varies. The in-vivo analysis for injectability, degradation, and biocompatibility of the GelVS hydrogel displays their biocompatible nature and lasts up to 30 days at the injecting site. Overall results indicate that DVS-modified GelVS hydrogel will be a great system with tunable physicochemical properties to modulate favorable cellular response for tissue regeneration and non-invasive deep tissue application."
"Case management is a structured, client centered approach that incorporates various strategies such as employing lay counsellors to provide psychosocial and adherence support to strengthen antiretroviral (ART) adherence, improve retention in care and viral load (VL) suppression. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of case management on VL in clients enrolled due to non-suppression (> = 50 copies/ml) in Capricorn District, Limpopo Province."
The colonization history of house mice reflects the maritime history of humans that passively transported them worldwide. We investigated western house mouse colonization in the Atlantic region through studies of mitochondrial D-loop DNA sequences from modern specimens.
"Great travel distances and long travel times can be barriers to outpatient stroke rehabilitation services (OSR) receipt, but there is limited information on differences in proximity to specific OSR services between urban and potentially medically underserved rural areas. Accordingly, we compared travel distance and time to the nearest service for different OSR services between rural and urban counties in Tennessee."
"During the modified Broström procedure for chronic ankle instability, surgeons often experience cases with insufficiently restored mechanical stability even after anatomical ligament repair. In these cases, longer postoperative immobilization and delayed rehabilitation can be required, and a risk for recurrence of instability may persist. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical usefulness of suture-tape augmentation based on intraoperative stress radiographs during anatomical ligament repair for chronic ankle instability."
"G-quadruplex (G4) DNA structures are increasingly acknowledged as promising targets in cancer research, and the development of G4-specific stabilizing compounds may lay a fundamental foundation in precision medicine for cancer treatment. Here, we propose a light-responsive G4-binder for precise modulation of drug activation, providing dynamic and spatiotemporal control over G4-associated biological processes contributing to cancer cell death. We developed a specialized fluorinated azobenzene (AB) switch equipped with a quinoline unit and a positively charged carboxamide side chain, Q-Azo4F-C, designed for targeted binding to G4 structures within cells. Biophysical studies, combined with molecular dynamics simulations, provide insights into the unique coordination modes of the photoswitchable ligand in its trans and cis configurations when interacting with G4s. The observed variations in complexation processes between the two isomeric states in different cancer cell lines manifest in more than 25-fold reversible cytotoxic activity. Immunostaining conducted with the structure-specific G4 antibody (BG4), establishes a direct correlation between cytotoxicity and the varying extent of G4 induction regulated by the two isoforms. Finally, we demonstrate the photo-driven reversible regulation of G4 structures in lung cancer cells by Q-Azo4F-C. Our findings highlight the potential of light-responsive G4-binders in advancing precision cancer therapy through dynamic control of G4-mediated pathways."
"Healthcare-associated infections are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the pediatric population and a growing problem in intensive care services. However, limited data are available on these infections in the Portuguese pediatric population. This study aimed to estimate its prevalence rate in a Portuguese pediatric intensive care unit, identifying the most frequent microorganisms and their antibiotic resistance profiles."
"Despite efforts toward achieving gender-based equality in clinical trial enrollment, females are frequently underrepresented and gender-specific data analysis is lacking. Identifying and addressing gender bias in medical decision-making and outcome reporting may facilitate more equitable healthcare delivery. This study aimed to determine if gender differences exist in the clinical evaluation and surgical management of patients with degenerative lumbar conditions."
"The rarest form of renal ectopia, the thoracic kidney, has been documented in only about 200 cases worldwide. There are four recognized causes of congenital thoracic renal ectopia: renal ectopia with an intact diaphragm, diaphragmatic eventration, diaphragmatic hernia, and traumatic diaphragmatic rupture. This condition often presents as an incidental finding in asymptomatic patients. The following is a report of mediastinal renal ectopia in a 52-year-old male patient."
We investigated the association between impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and cardiometabolic multimorbidity (CMM) in the Chinese population.
"Bed regulation within Brazil's National Health System (SUS) plays a crucial role in managing care for patients in need of hospitalization. In Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil, the RegulaRN Leitos Gerais platform was the information system developed to register requests for bed regulation for COVID-19 cases. However, the platform was expanded to cover a range of diseases that require hospitalization. This study explored different machine learning models in the RegulaRN database, from October 2021 to January 2024, totaling 47,056 regulations. From the data obtained, 12 features were selected from the 24 available. After that, blank and inconclusive data were removed, as well as the outcomes that had values other than discharge and death, rendering a binary classification. Data was also correlated, balanced, and divided into training and test portions for application in machine learning models. The results showed better accuracy (87.77%) and recall (87.77%) for the XGBoost model, and higher precision (87.85%) and F1-Score (87.56%) for the Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models, respectively. As for Specificity (82.94%) and ROC-AUC (82.13%), the Multilayer Perceptron with SGD optimizer obtained the highest scores. The results evidenced which models could adequately assist medical regulators during the decision-making process for bed regulation, enabling even more effective regulation and, consequently, greater availability of beds and a decrease in waiting time for patients."
High blood pressure (BP) or hypertension (HTN) remains key risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Circulating fatty acids (FAs) in the blood can affect directly cardiovascular hemodynamics and serves as building blocks for endocrine mediators modifying inflammatory processes and vascular function. This review aims to describe optimal circulating FA profiles for BP to adjust dietary recommendations for HTN prevention.
"Traditional photosynthesis-driven growth models have considerable uncertainties in predicting tree growth under changing climates, partially because sink activities are directly affected by the environment but not adequately addressed in growth modelling. Therefore, we developed a semi-mechanistic model coupling stomatal optimality, temperature control of enzymatic activities and phenology of cambial growth. Parameterized using Bayesian inference and measured data on Picea abies and Pinus sylvestris in peatland and mineral soils in Finland, the coupled model simulates transpiration and assimilation rates and stem radial dimension (SRD) simultaneously at 30 min resolution. The results suggest that both the sink and phenological formulations with environmental effects are indispensable for capturing SRD dynamics across hourly to seasonal scales. Simulated using the model, growth was more sensitive than assimilation to temperature and soil water, suggesting carbon gain is not driving growth at the current temporal scale. Also, leaf-specific production was occasionally positively correlated with growth duration but not with growth onset timing or annual cambial area increment. Thus, as it is hardly explained by carbon gain, phenology itself should be included in sink-driven growth models of the trees in the boreal zone and possibly other environments where sink activities and photosynthesis are both restrained by harsh conditions."
"Prediabetes (PreDM) and obesity increase the risk of type 2 diabetes. Individuals with these conditions often consume diets higher in animal protein than in plant protein, which are associated with elevated levels of dietary advanced glycation end products (dAGEs). Increased dAGE intake has been linked to blood glucose abnormalities, oxidative stress, and dysbiosis of the microbiota, all of which exacerbate metabolic disorders. Black soybeans, as a plant-based protein source, contain substantially lower levels of dAGEs compared with pork. This study aimed to investigate the effects of substituting animal protein with black soybeans on advanced glycation end product (AGE) levels, oxidative stress, and the gut microbiota in individuals with both PreDM and obesity. This study was a randomized crossover intervention trial conducted over 16 weeks. We recruited men and women aged 20-64 years with both prediabetes and obesity. This study had four periods: 0-4 weeks for the run-in period, 4-8 weeks and 12-16 weeks for the pork or black soymilk intervention period, and 8-12 weeks for the wash-out period. During the intervention period, the participants consumed pork or black soymilk with similar protein content as their dietary protein source. The participants maintained 3 day dietary records, and we measured anthropometric items and collected blood and fecal samples for analysis. The results showed that partially substituting pork with black soymilk as a dietary protein source for 4 weeks significantly reduced dAGE intake. The black soymilk group also exhibited significantly lower blood AGE fluorescence intensity, oxidative stress, and levels of glycative stress markers. Furthermore, black soymilk consumption significantly increased the relative abundance of short-chain fatty acid-producing genera compared with pork consumption. In conclusion, partially substituting dietary pork with black soymilk may reduce serum AGE levels, reduce oxidative and glycation stress, and increase the abundance of short-chain fatty acid-producing microbiota in individuals with both PreDM and obesity. Registration number of Clinical Trial: NCT05290519 (ClinicalTrials.gov)."
"Small-molecule inhibitors of the mono (ADP) ribosyl transferase PARP7 are being evaluated asmonotherapy for tumors overexpressing PARP7 and in combination with immune checkpoint blockade. We previously showed that sensitivity to the PARP7 inhibitor (PARP7i) RBN-2397 could be enhanced by cotreatment with agonists of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHRa) in cell lines that show strong intrinsic sensitivity to RBN-2397. In this study, we demonstrated that a range of tumor cell lines that are relatively insensitive to PARP7i or AHRa as individual agents are unexpectedly profoundly sensitive to their combination. Our data show that this synergistic response is dependent on the AHR/AHR nuclear translocator and is associated with increased levels of nuclear AHR and increased transcription of AHR target genes. In some hormone receptor-positive cell lines, we find that combination treatment is associated with proteasomal turnover of the steroid hormone receptors, androgen receptor and estrogen receptor. Both wild-type and hormone-resistant mutant forms of these receptors are degraded upon treatment with AHRa and PARP7i in breast and prostate cancer models. These results suggest that combining PARP7i with AHRa may extend the utility of these drugs to a wider range of tumors, including those that are refractory to hormone therapy."
"Chromosome instability is a prevalent vulnerability of cancer cells that has yet to be fully exploited therapeutically. To identify genes uniquely essential to chromosomally unstable cells, we mined the Cancer Dependency Map for genes essential in tumor cells with high levels of copy number aberrations. We identify and validate KIF18A, a mitotic kinesin, as a vulnerability of chromosomally unstable cancer cells. Knockdown of KIF18A leads to mitotic defects and reduction of tumor growth. Screening of a chemical library for inhibitors of KIF18A enzymatic activity identified a hit that was optimized to yield VLS-1272, which is orally bioavailable, potent, ATP non-competitive, microtubule-dependent, and highly selective for KIF18A versus other kinesins. Inhibition of KIF18A's ATPase activity prevents KIF18A translocation across the mitotic spindle, resulting in chromosome congression defects, mitotic cell accumulation, and cell death. Profiling VLS-1272 across >100 cancer cell lines demonstrates that the specificity towards cancer cells with chromosome instability differentiates KIF18A inhibition from other clinically tested anti-mitotic drugs. Treatment of tumor xenografts with VLS-1272 results in mitotic defects leading to substantial, dose-dependent inhibition of tumor growth. The strong biological rationale, robust preclinical data, and optimized compound properties enable the clinical development of a KIF18A inhibitor in cancers with high chromosomal instability."
"Actin plays a crucial role not only in the cytoplasm, but also in the nucleus, influencing various cellular behaviors, including cell migration and gene expression. Recent studies reveal that nuclear actin dynamics is altered by cellular stresses, such as DNA damage; however, the effect of heat shock on nuclear actin dynamics, particularly in the nucleolus, remains unclear. This study aims to elucidate the contribution of nucleolar actin to cellular responses under heat shock conditions."

"The study aimed to assess the percent correct shade identification of four intraoral scanners (IOS) and a spectrophotometer, focusing on how reliably each device selects the correct tooth shade compared to a visual observer's selection. The research question addresses how much clinicians can trust the device-selected shade without visual verification."
"EP400 encodes a core catalytic ATPase subunit of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes. The gene-disease association of EP400 is undetermined. In this study, we performed trio-based whole-exome sequencing in a cohort of 402 families with epilepsy and neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) and identified compound heterozygous EP400 variants in six unrelated individuals. Six additional EP400 individuals were recruited via the match platform of China, including two de novo heterozygous and four compound heterozygous variants. The individual with a heterozygous de novo frameshift variant presented with NDDs, while the others exhibited epilepsy and NDDs, explained by the damaged genetic dependence quantity. EP400 presented significantly higher excesses of variants in the individuals. Clustering analysis revealed that the majority paralogs of EP400 were associated with NDDs/epilepsy and co-expressed highly with EP400. Analysis of the spatiotemporal expression indicated that EP400 is highly expressed in the developing brain and cells during differentiation, indicating its vital role in neurodevelopment; EP400 is predominantly expressed in inhibitory neurons in the early stage but in excitatory neurons in the mature stage. The development-dependent expression pattern of neuron specificity explained the favorable outcome of epilepsy. Knockdown of EP400 ortholog in Drosophila caused significantly increased susceptibility to seizures and abnormal neuronal firing. The ep400 crispant zebrafish exhibited brain developmental abnormalities, poorer adaptability, lower response to stimulation, epileptic discharges, abnormal cellular apoptosis, and increased susceptibility to seizures. Transcriptome analysis showed that ep400 deficiency caused expressional dysregulation of 84 epilepsy/NDD-associated genes, including 11 highly dose-sensitive genes. This study identified EP400 as a causative gene of epilepsy/NDDs."

"Many proteins are essential food components but also major allergens. Reducing protein allergenicity while preserving its nutritional value and technofunctional properties has always been the goal of the food industry. Ultrasound (US) is a green processing method for modifying proteins. In addition, US pretreatment combined with other processing techniques (USPCT) has been increasingly used in the food industry. Therefore, this review presents an overview of recent advances in the impact of US and USPCT (US-combined enzymatic hydrolysis [USCE], US-combined glycation [USCG], and US-combined polyphenol conjugation [USCP]) on the allergenicity, nutritional value, and technofunctional properties of food allergens. We discuss the potential mechanisms, advantages, and limitations of these technologies for improving the properties of proteins and analyze their safety, challenges, and corresponding solutions. It was found that USPCT can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of different methods, which in turn can be more effective in reducing protein allergenicity and improving the nutritional value and functional properties of processed products. Future research should start with new processing methods, optimization of process conditions, industrial production, and the use of new research techniques to promote technical progress. This paper is expected to provide reference for the development of high-quality hypoallergenic protein raw materials."
"Traditionally, antifungal resistance (AFR) has received much less attention compared with bacterial resistance to antibiotics. However, global changes, pandemics, and emerging new fungal infections have highlighted global health consequences of AFR. The recent report of the World Health Organisation (WHO) has identified fungal priority pathogens, and recognised AFR among the greatest global health threats. This is particularly important given the significant increase in fungal infections linked to climate change and pandemics. Environmental factors play critical roles in AFR and fungal infections, as many clinically relevant fungal pathogens and AFR originate from the environment (mainly soil). In addition, the environment serves as a potential rich source for the discovery of new antifungal agents, including mycoviruses and bacterial probiotics, which hold promise for effective therapies. In this article, we summarise the environmental pathways of AFR development and spread among high priority fungal pathogens, and propose potential mechanisms of AFR development and spread. We identify a research priority list to address key knowledge gaps in our understanding of environmental AFR. Further, we propose an integrated roadmap for predictive risk management of AFR that is critical for effective surveillance and forecasting of public health outcomes under current and future climatic conditions."
The differences between the use of fractional flow reserve (FFR) or instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR) in the long term are unknown.
"An increasing body of literature has investigated the implications of housing quality on health, confirming the negative consequences of poor housing quality on physical and mental health. Despite this increased focus on the salutogenic impacts of housing, the relationship between housing quality and cognitive health remains understudied. This study examined how the housing quality in urban informal settlements, where living conditions are often substandard, affects women's cognitive functioning, with a specific focus on executive function (EF) skills. EF is a decision-making system that enables us to make decisions using working memory and attentional control. This study addressed two key questions: (1) Is housing quality associated with EF skills? (2) Does perceived housing stress experienced by women mediate the housing-EF relationship? A standardized observer-based tool assessed housing quality, psychometric instruments measured EF skills, and a 12-item questionnaire evaluated perceived housing stress. Results indicated that better housing quality is positively associated with higher EF skills, with housing stress acting as a mediating factor in this relationship. These findings have important implications for both health and housing policies. Investments in improving housing conditions can yield cognitive health benefits for women, and addressing stress-inducing housing factors could further enhance cognitive outcomes."

Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is a high-risk malignancy. Telomeres- (TRGs) and aging-related genes (ARGs) play an important role in cancer progression and prognosis. This study aimed to develop a novel prognostic model combined TRGs and ARGs signatures to predict the prognosis of patients with LUAD.
"The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) is a landmark international treaty which embeds the human rights of people with disabilities, including mental disabilities, into international law. We aim to demonstrate the relevance of the CRPD for the protection of human rights of people with mental illness in France. We begin with a broad overview of its development and implementation at the level of the international community, and then describe the situation in France."
This review will analyze the effectiveness of early childhood education interventions to improve complementary feeding practices in children aged 4 to 36 months.
"Regenerative medicine utilizes stem cells to repair damaged tissues by replacing them with their differentiated cells and activating the body's inherent regenerative abilities. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are adult stem cells that possess tissue repair and regenerative capabilities and immunomodulatory properties with a much lower risk of tumorigenicity, making them a focus of numerous clinical trials worldwide. MSCs primarily exert their therapeutic effects through paracrine effects via secreted factors, such as cytokines and exosomes. This has led to increasing interest in cell-free therapy, where only the conditioned medium (also called secretome) from MSC cultures is used for regenerative applications. However, MSCs face certain limitations, including cellular senescence, scarcity, donor heterogeneity, complexity, short survival post-implantation, and regulatory and ethics hurdles. To address these challenges, various types of immortalized MSCs (ImMSCs) capable of indefinite expansion have been developed. These cells offer significant promise and essential tools as a reliable source for both cell-based and cell-free therapies with the aim of translating them into practical medicine. However, the process of immortalization, often involving the transduction of immortalizing genes, poses potential risks of genetic instability and resultant malignant transformation. Cell-free therapy is particularly attractive, as it circumvents the risks of tumorigenicity and ethical concerns associated with live cell therapies. Rigorous safety tests, such as monitoring chromosomal abnormalities, are critical to ensure safety. Technologies like inducible or suicide genes may allow for the controlled proliferation of MSCs and induce apoptosis after their therapeutic task is completed. This review highlights recent advancements in the immortalization of MSCs and the associated risks of tumorigenesis."
"The influence of eye contact on memory has been a topic of extensive study, yet its effects remain ambiguous. This inconsistency may be attributed to the varying levels of task difficulty encountered when conducting this type of research."

"Brucellosis is a neglected infectious disease caused by animals and is becoming a public health problem in developing countries. There are limited case reports of human brucellosis in Indonesia because the symptoms are not specific. This study investigated the association between serological tests for brucellosis among workers and their knowledge, attitude, and behavior. The study was conducted on farmworkers in a dairy cattle milking center in Boyolali and Cilawu. A total of 149 respondents, according to the inclusion criteria, were included. Around 3 ml of blood was collected from the respondents, followed by structured interviews to determine the level of knowledge, attitudes, and behavior towards brucellosis in humans. The sera were tested with the rose bengal test (RBT) and complement fixation test (CFT). Results showed that 3.3% of respondents were positive for RBT in Boyolali and 7.01% in Cilawu. However, CFT showed that 5.3% of respondents were positive in Cilawu, but 0% in Boyolali. The level of knowledge and attitudes of respondents regarding brucellosis in humans was still lacking, and the behavior of respondents on the farm was mostly good, in the sense of understanding the procedures for maintaining healthy dairy cattle correctly, but maintaining personal health was still lacking. This study underscores the need for immediate action to improve the situation. Public health professionals, researchers, and policymakers have a crucial role in implementing regular health education programs for farmworkers and improving the availability of personal protective equipment."
"Immunoglobulin G4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is an immune-mediated chronic fibro-inflammatory condition, that can involve multiple systems. Immunoglobulin G4-related respiratory disease (IgG4-RRD) is relatively rare, with non-specific clinical symptoms. Hemoptysis is a rare clinical symptom of IgG4-RRD, and cases of massive hemoptysis in adults have not been reported. We present here a rare case of massive hemoptysis caused by IgG4-RRD in adults and review relevant literature. An 84-year-old female presented with recurrent cough and blood-streaked sputum, progressing to massive hemoptysis. Her chest CT showed patchy lesions in the lungs, initially misdiagnosed as a tumor. Ultimately, a biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of IgG4-RRD. The patient was treated with prednisone combined with leflunomide, which controlled her condition and maintained remission. However, after 13 months without hemoptysis, she experienced intermittent hemoptysis followed by a massive episode. Increasing the prednisone dose and continuing leflunomide treatment controlled the condition once again, with no recurrence in the subsequent year of follow-up. In patients with IgG4-RRD, particularly those with hemoptysis, it is essential to remain vigilant for massive hemoptysis. Similarly, in patients with lung patch lesions and no evidence of a tumor on biopsy, IgG4-RRD should not be overlooked. Early diagnosis and timely treatment can improve the patient's clinical prognosis."
"Recent epidemiological data shows significant rates of grade 2 disability at point-of-diagnosis among new leprosy cases in Pakistan. This indicates a feature of extensive diagnostic delay; the disability burden appears unmoving and disproportionate to the falling leprosy incidence rates. Therefore, this study was required to understand reasons for delay in diagnosis and treatment of leprosy."
"Congenital neutropenia is a primary immunodeficiency characterized by quantitative anomalies in neutrophil counts. It is classified as mild, moderate, or severe. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation stands as a potential therapeutic intervention; nevertheless, graft-versus-host disease emerges as a main complication."
"A disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs-7 (ADAMTS-7) belongs to the family of metalloproteinases that contributes to tissue homeostasis during morphogenesis and reproduction. These metalloproteinases regulate various cell functions such as cell proliferation, are important regulators in tissue regeneration, and play a role in vascular remodelling, which is involved in atherosclerosis development. Despite the well-established association between ADAMTS-7 and atherosclerotic disease, data regarding the metalloproteinase's association with LV function remain scarce. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of ADAMTS-7 levels with diastolic dysfunction and various echocardiographic parameters in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. All patients underwent a clinical, vascular, and echocardiographic examination during their visit. Plasma ADAMTS-7 levels were measured in all patients. The results showed that diastolic dysfunction was strongly associated with age, but had no statistically significant association with ADAMTS-7. When individual echocardiographic parameters were examined, ADAMTS-7 levels showed a positive tendency only with deceleration time (DT), with the other echocardiographic parameters being positively associated only with age. The possible role of ADAMTS-7 in diastolic dysfunction and in the development and progression of heart failure in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus deserves further investigation."
"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a prevalent endocrine and metabolic disorder affecting 6-20% of women of childbearing age worldwide. Immune cell imbalance and dysregulation of inflammatory factors can lead to systematic low-grade chronic inflammation (SLCI), which plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of PCOS. A significant higher infiltration of immune cells such as macrophages and lymphocytes and pro-inflammatory factors IL-6 and TNF-α has been detected in PCOS organ systems, impacting not only the female reproductive system but also other organs such as the cardiovascular, intestine, liver, thyroid, brain and other organs. Obesity, insulin resistance (IR), steroid hormones imbalance and intestinal microecological imbalance, deficiencies in vitamin D and selenium, as well as hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) can induce systematic imbalance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cells and molecules. The pro-inflammatory cells and cytokines also interact with obesity, steroid hormones imbalance and IR, leading to increased metabolic imbalance and reproductive-endocrine dysfunction in PCOS patients. This review aims to summarize the dysregulation of immune response in PCOS organ system and the intrinsic mechanisms affecting SLCI in PCOS to provide new insights for the systemic inflammatory treatment of PCOS in the future."
"Some studies have confirmed that pathogens can cause infection through bacterial cultures on the surface of infectious keloids. However, further exploration of the comparison between infectious and non-infectious keloids and the bacterial flora of infectious foci is lacking. To investigate the differential flora of purulent secretions on the surface of infectious keloids compared to non-infectious keloids and to determine the microbial composition within the infectious foci. This case-control study involved 17 patients and obtained swab specimens from the surface of keloids in two groups, and from the infectious foci in the infectious group. Bacterial composition was analyzed using 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing. There were no statistical differences in the general condition of patients between the two groups. The presence of the phylum Actinobacteriota, and the orders Propionibacteriales and Corynebacteriales, as well as the genus Taibaiella, was greater on the surface of keloids in the infectious group. The most prevalent genera in infective sites were Staphylococcus, Peptoniphilus, and Cutibacterium. Microbial-associated gene pathways indicated a correlation with inflammation and tumor-like growth in keloids. There is a connection between infectious keloids and microorganisms, providing insights for predicting and treating keloid infections."
"Malnutrition, a significant risk factor for mortality and morbidity in the elderly, poses a huge threat in the geriatric population, showing a high prevalence, especially in people affected by chronic non-communicable age-related diseases [...]."
"Diacylglycerol kinases (DGKs) phosphorylate diacylglycerol to generate phosphatidic acid, which plays important roles in intracellular signal transduction. DGKα is reportedly associated with progression of tumors, including hepatocellular carcinomas, but its relationship with liver regeneration has not been examined. The purpose of this research is to elucidate the role of DGKα in liver regeneration. Here, we provide a detailed examination of C57BL/6 wild-type and DGKα knockout (KO) mice subjected to 70% partial hepatectomy (70% PH) modeling, including survival rates, hematological marker and gene expression levels, and histological analyses of factors related to liver regeneration. Following 70% PH, DGKα KO mice produce higher levels of hepatobiliary enzymes and have a higher incidence of jaundice compared with wild-type mice, with a death rate of ~ 40%. Furthermore, they exhibit impaired glycogen and lipid consumption, low liver energy charge, and hepatocyte hypertrophy disorder, accompanied by significantly reduced liver expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen and cyclin D. We conclude that DGKα is a key molecule in the post-PH liver regeneration process and may have potential as a therapeutic target for the acceleration of liver regeneration."
"This case study analyzed arrangements and strategies of the network actors in the Special Indigenous Sanitary District (DSEI) Pernambuco's territory to guarantee the right to health of Indigenous populations during the COVID-19 pandemic. This work was carried out through document analysis, workshops, and field research. The Contingency Plan for COVID-19 in Indigenous Peoples of DSEI Pernambuco included surveillance actions, laboratory and pharmaceutical assistance, communication, and management. With the modeling of this document, it was noticed that actions aimed at local specificities were not integrated: in its initial design, at the national level, the voice of Indigenous leaders was not heard when formulating this plan. By contrast, the actions of these leaders and their mobilization to mitigate the effects of the pandemic on the Indigenous population stands out. Contextual factors were cited as facilitators and obstacles to the plan's implementation; the local sociotechnical network mapping also made it possible to identify strategic actors and actants in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic and verify their performance or ineffectiveness. The findings of this study reflect recurrent problems in the organization of the Indigenous health system."
"The rates of chronic respiratory disease (CRD) is rising in Asia. Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) has been shown to be a highly efficacious intervention for people with CRD. While PR models are well established in Western countries, environmental, cultural and societal factors may influence how rehabilitation programs for people with CRD are conducted in Asia. This review aims to identify the characteristics of rehabilitation programs for people with CRD within Asia and identify differences between these rehabilitation programs to the recently updated American Thoracic Society (ATS) PR guidelines. Utilising the PRISMA scoping review guidelines, five databases- CINAHL, Medline, Embase, Web of Science and Health and Medical Collection were searched from inception until 13th December 2023. A total of 137 studies (n = 19,128) were included in the review. As many as 113 studies (83 %) included aerobic exercises as part of rehabilitation, only 90 studies (66 %) included resistance training. Thirty-nine studies included interventions such as Tai Chi, Qigong and Yoga. Comparing to the 2023 ATS PR guidelines, only 22 % of the included studies evaluated a rehabilitation program that was consistent with the guidelines. Improvement in exercise capacity (76 %) and quality of life (QOL) (73 %) were the most frequent outcomes used to evaluate program efficacy. The results suggest that models of rehabilitation varied greatly within the Asia region, with some more heavily adapted to suit the local context as compared to others. Further consideration on how to balance adaptation of PR with fidelity of the intervention needs to be taken."
"Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a herpes virus with a long replication cycle. HCMV encoded long non-coding RNA termed RNA2.7 is the dominant transcript with a length of about 2.5kb, accounting for 25% of total viral transcripts. Studies have shown that HCMV RNA2.7 inhibits apoptosis caused by infection. The effect of RNA2.7 on other forms of cell death is still unclear. In this work, we found that RNA2.7 deletion significantly decreased the viability of HCMV-infected cells, while treatment with ferroptosis inhibitor Fer-1 rescued the infection-induced cell death, demonstrating an anti-ferroptosis role of RNA2.7. The results further showed that RNA2.7 inhibited ferroptosis via enhancing Ferritin Heavy Chain 1 (FTH1) and Solute Carrier Family 7 Member 11 (SLC7A11) expression in Erastin treated cells without involving other viral components. Pooled Genome-wide CRISPR screening revealed zinc finger protein 395 (ZNF395) as a new regulator repressing the expression of FTH1 and SLC7A11. HCMV RNA2.7 promoted proteasome-mediated degradation of ZNF395 that resulted in upregulation of FTH1 and SLC7A11 to inhibit ferroptosis, therefore maintain survival in host cells and complete replication of virus."
"In the last years, it has been proved that some viruses are able to re-structure chromatin organization and alter the epigenomic landscape of the host genome. In addition, they are able to affect the physical mechanisms shaping chromatin 3D structure, with a consequent impact on gene activity. Here, we investigate with polymer physics genome re-organization of the host genome upon SARS-CoV-2 viral infection and how it can impact structural variability within the population of single-cell chromatin configurations. Using published Hi-C data and molecular dynamics simulations, we build ensembles of 3D configurations representing single-cell chromatin conformations in control and SARS-CoV-2 infected conditions. We focus on genomic length scales of TADs and consider, as a case study, models of real loci containing DDX58 and IL6 genes, belonging, respectively, to the antiviral interferon response and pro-inflammatory genes. Clustering analysis applied to the ensemble of polymer configurations reveals a generally increased variability and a more heterogeneous population of 3D structures in infected conditions. This points toward a scenario in which viral infection leads to a loss of chromatin structural specificity with, likely, a consequent impact on the correct regulation of host cell genes."
"Head and neck cancer (HNC) remains a major global health burden, prompting the need for innovative therapeutic strategies. This review examines the role of the cystine/glutamate antiporter (xCT) in HNC, specifically focusing on how xCT contributes to cancer progression through mechanisms such as redox imbalance, ferroptosis, and treatment resistance. The central questions addressed include how xCT dysregulation affects tumor biology and the potential for targeting xCT to enhance treatment outcomes. We explore recent developments in xCT-targeted current and emerging therapies, including xCT inhibitors and novel treatment modalities, and their role in addressing therapeutic challenges. This review aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of xCT as a therapeutic target and to outline future directions for research and clinical application."
"The autonomous and active Long-Interspersed Element-1 (LINE-1, L1) and the non-autonomous Alu retrotransposon elements, contributing to 30% of the human genome, are the most abundant repeated sequences. With more than 90% of their sequences being methylated in normal cells, these elements undeniably contribute to the global DNA methylation level and constitute a major part of circulating-cell-free DNA (cfDNA). So far, the hypomethylation status of LINE-1 and Alu in cellular and extracellular DNA has long been considered a prevailing hallmark of ageing-related diseases and cancer. This study demonstrated that errors in LINE-1 and Alu methylation level measurements were caused by an excessive input quantity of genomic DNA used for bisulfite conversion. Using the minuscule DNA amount of 0.5 ng, much less than what has been used and recommended so far (500 ng-2 μg) or 1 μL of cfDNA extracted from 1 mL of blood, we revealed hypermethylation of LINE-1 and Alu in 407 tumour samples of primary breast, colon and lung cancers when compared with the corresponding pair-matched adjacent normal tissue samples (P < 0.05-0.001), and in cfDNA from 296 samples of lung cancers as compared with 477 samples from healthy controls (P < 0.0001). More importantly, LINE-1 hypermethylation in cfDNA is associated with healthy ageing. Our results have not only contributed to the standardized bisulfite-based protocols for DNA methylation assays, particularly in applications on repeated sequences but also provided another perspective for other repetitive sequences whose epigenetic properties may have crucial impacts on genome architecture and human health."
"Postoperative delirium (POD) is the most common neurological adverse event among elderly patients undergoing surgery. POD is associated with an increased risk for postoperative complications, long-term cognitive decline, an increase in morbidity and mortality as well as extended hospital stays. Delirium prevention and treatment options are currently limited. This study will evaluate the effect of transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) on the incidence of POD."
"Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are widely used for nucleic acid delivery but face challenges like limited targeting and accelerated blood clearance (ABC) effect. We design three ionizable oligomers (IOs) that, with polylactide-polyethylene glycol (PLA-PEG), form a potential siRNA delivery system, named Ionizable Polymeric Micelles (IPMs). The siRNA encapsulated IPMs escape from lysosomes upon cellular uptake, and silence the target gene. A fibroblast activation protein inhibitor modified IPMs (FAPi-IPMs) show higher targeting for activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) compared to that for hepatocytes, silencing both HSP47 and HMGB1, reducing collagen secretion and liver inflammation, thereby treating fibrosis. Moreover, IPMs and FAPi-IPMs mitigate ABC effect and produce fewer PEG antibodies than LNPs, and show minimal apolipoprotein adsorption in vivo compared with LNPs, differentiating their targeting effects from LNPs. In conclusion, IPMs represent a nucleic acid delivery system with alternative targeting ability and reduced ABC effect."
"The gastric conduit can be created with partial preservation or a central ligation of the right gastric artery. Central ligation may facilitate complete removal of lymph node (LN) station 3; however, whether this influences conduit and anastomotic perfusion is unknown. Hence this study investigated whether a central ligation of the right gastric artery would affect conduit or anastomotic perfusion compared with partial preservation (local standard) during robot-assisted resection of gastroesophageal junction cancer. Patients scheduled for robot-assisted resection of gastroesophageal junction cancer were randomized to either central ligation or partial preservation of the right gastric artery. Perfusion was assessed using quantified indocyanine green angiography: before gastric mobilization, after conduit formation, and after anastomosis. Hemodynamic variables during surgery and surgical outcomes were recorded. We included 70 patients between June 2020 and October 2021, of whom 5 were excluded from the final analysis. The two patient groups did not differ in conduit (0.07 [interquartile range (IQR), 0.05-0.08] vs. 0.07 u [IQR, 0.05-0.08], P = 0.86) or anastomotic perfusion (0.08 [standard deviation (SD), ±0.02] vs. 0.08 u [SD, ±0.02], P = 0.21), nor did they differ in intraoperative blood loss, anastomotic leaks, postoperative complications, or 1-year survival. However, more LNs were resected in the central ligation group (36 [IQR, 30-44] vs. 28 [IQR, 23-43], P = 0.02). Introducing a central ligation of the right gastric artery did not seem to affect conduit or anastomotic perfusion, compared with partial preservation. However, significantly more LNs were resected."
"The mammalian Apolipoprotein-L families (APOLs) contain several isoforms of membrane-interacting proteins, some of which are involved in the control of membrane dynamics (traffic, fission and fusion). Specifically, human APOL1 and APOL3 appear to control membrane remodeling linked to pathogen infection. Through its association with Non-Muscular Myosin-2A (NM2A), APOL1 controls Golgi-derived trafficking of vesicles carrying the lipid scramblase Autophagy-9A (ATG9A). These vesicles deliver APOL3 together with phosphatidylinositol-4-kinase-B (PI4KB) and activated Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) to mitochondrion-endoplasmic reticulum (ER) contact sites (MERCSs) for the induction and completion of mitophagy and apoptosis. Through direct interactions with PI4KB and PI4KB activity controllers (Neuronal Calcium Sensor-1, or NCS1, Calneuron-1, or CALN1, and ADP-Ribosylation Factor-1, or ARF1), APOL3 controls PI(4)P synthesis. PI(4)P is required for different processes linked to infection-induced inflammation: (i) STING activation at the Golgi and subsequent lysosomal degradation for inflammation termination; (ii) mitochondrion fission at MERCSs for induction of mitophagy and apoptosis; and (iii) phagolysosome formation for antigen processing. In addition, APOL3 governs mitophagosome fusion with endolysosomes for mitophagy completion, and the APOL3-like murine APOL7C is involved in phagosome permeabilization linked to antigen cross-presentation in dendritic cells. Similarly, APOL3 can induce the fusion of intracellular bacterial membranes, and a role in membrane fusion can also be proposed for endothelial APOLd1 and adipocyte mAPOL6, which promote angiogenesis and adipogenesis, respectively, under inflammatory conditions. Thus, different APOL isoforms play distinct roles in membrane remodeling associated with inflammation."
"Schizophrenia is a chronic mental illness, with a prevalence of about 1%. The symptoms are classified in three categories: positive symptoms, negative symptoms and deficits in cognitive function. Regarding the pharmacological treatment, current antipsychotics mainly improve positive symptoms while negative and cognitive symptoms remain inadequately treated. Among them, aripiprazole, through its pharmacological properties results in regulation of positive symptoms and, to a lesser extent, to negative and cognitive ones. Drug treatment studies in animals typically employ administration methods such as injection or gavage, which is time-consuming over long periods, does not reflect route of administration used in patients, and cause substantial stress in animals. We assessed herein the pharmacokinetic properties and behavioural effects of aripiprazole after chronic administration via drinking solution in C57Bl/6 mice. Results show that subchronic administration of 1 and 10 mg/kg doses of aripiprazole via drinking solution present significant blood concentrations, without any significant effect on the spontaneous activity of mice (between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m.). Furthermore, we described for the first time to our knowledge the main pharmacokinetic parameters of aripiprazole after gavage acute administration (10 mg/kg). Collectively, all of these data will be very useful in future projects including chronic administrations (several months) of this antipsychotic."
"Tracheal schwannomas are exceedingly rare, accounting for a minute fraction of primary tracheal tumors. They are classified into intraluminal and mixed types, with treatment strategies varying significantly between these subtypes. While thorax tomography is usually sufficient to distinguish intraluminal and mixed type, endobronchial ultrasonography (EBUS) can also be used in cases where the distinction cannot be made clearly with tomography. This case highlights the use of bronchoscopic procedures in the diagnosis and treatment of tracheal schwannomas and the role of radial EBUS in guiding clinical management in distinguishing between intraluminal and mixed type tracheal schwannomas."
"Following interventions to eliminate trachoma in the Afar region of Ethiopia, our goal was to reassess the prevalence of trachomatous trichiasis (TT) and trachomatous inflammation-follicular (TF) at the woreda level, and to identify factors associated with the disease."
"Extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma (ENKTCL) is an extremely aggressive form of lymphoma and lacks of specific diagnostic markers. The study intended to unearth the role of interleukin-33 (IL-33) in ENKTCL. RT-qPCR was conducted to assess mRNA levels of ENKTCL tissues and cells, while western blot assay was performed for evaluating protein levels. Plate cloning experiment and transwell assay were employed to measure aggressiveness of ENKTCL. Tube formation assay was executed to determine the angiogenesis ability. Mice ENKTCL xenograft model was designed to probe the impacts of IL-33 in vivo. IL-33 and suppression of tumorigenicity 2 receptor (ST2, receptor of IL-33) were enhanced in ENKTCL. IL-33 inhibition suppressed viability, migration, and invasion of ENKTCL cells. Moreover, IL-33 knockdown restricted angiogenesis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Furthermore, Wnt/β-catenin pathway associated proteins (β-catenin, c-myc, and cyclin D1) were downregulated by loss of IL-33. However, these impacts were overturned by Wnt/β-catenin signaling agonist lithium chloride (LiCl). Additionally, IL-33 silencing exerted anti-tumor effect via Wnt/β-catenin pathway in vivo. Silencing of IL-33 inhibited ENKTCL tumorigenesis and angiogenesis by inactivating Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. As such, IL-33 might be a prospective treatment target for ENKTCL."
"Insomnia is a typical type of sleep disorder. Huanglian Wendan Decoction (HWD) is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) with the effects of regulating Qi, drying dampness and resolving phlegm, calming the mind, and relieving irritation. This study aims to investigate the effect of HWD on insomnia in rats and its mechanism. Para-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA)-induced insomnia in rats was used for in vivo experiments and then treated with HWD. Behavioral tests, Western blot, real-time PCR, immunofluorescent staining, 16S rRNA sequencing were conducted. The content of SCFAs was determined by GC-MS. Acetic acid-pretreated rat hippocampal nerve cells were used for in vitro experiments. The results showed that HWD significantly improved the learning memory ability, decreased sleep latency, and prolonged sleep duration in insomniac rats. HWD reduced TNF-α and IL-6 levels and increased IL-10 and Foxp3 levels. HWD also promoted the polarization of macrophages from M1 pro-inflammatory phenotype to M2 anti-inflammatory phenotype. In addition, HWD increased the expression levels of BDNF and TrkB in the hippocampus. Administration of the TrkB receptor agonist 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) confirmed the mechanism by which HWD activates BDNF/TrkB signaling to ameliorate insomnia. Furthermore, HWD restored gut microbiota richness and diversity and promoted short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production in insomniac rats. In vitro experiments confirmed that the acetic acid-treated SCFA group could activate the BDNF/TrkB signaling pathway in neuronal cells, further promoting neuronal cell growth. In conclusion, HWD alleviated insomnia by maintaining gut microbiota homeostasis, promoting SCFA production, reducing neuroinflammatory response and microglia activation, and activating BDNF/TrkB signaling pathway."
"The scourge of drug addiction and abuse poses a significant challenge to society. Opioid drugs acting on μ-opioid receptor (OPRM1) make it one of the pivotal targets for drug addiction. In the past decade, sewage analysis has become a prevalent method of drug monitoring. However, traditional methods of detecting drugs in sewage are cumbersome, and rapid detection methods are relatively lacking. To address this, an innovative OPRM1-SNAP-tag/CMC method to directly identify drug components in sewage was established. Cell membrane chromatography (CMC) is an affinity chromatography technique which effectively detects receptor affinity substances. Cells constructed with high expression of specific receptor could be used to screen for compounds acting on the receptor. CMC based on OPRM1 provides a potentially convenient and effective tool for the detection of targeted drug components in sewage. In this study, the selectivity, reproducibility, column lifetime, and carryover of the CMC column had been assessed. Initially, we eluted the collected domestic sewage with methanol and acetonitrile, and the retention peaks were observed on the CMC system. Subsequently, without any preliminary sample preparation, we directly injected filtered samples of suspicious sewage into the OPRM1-SNAP-tag/CMC system, where we observed retention peaks as well. The retained components were further identified as morphine by using UPLC-MS/MS. In conclusion, the OPRM1-SNAP-tag/CMC method stands out as a reliable and robust model for the detection of drug components in sewage. It provides a valuable analytical tool for frontline drug control efforts, enhancing our capacity to monitor and mitigate the impact of drug abuse on society."
"Gaucher disease (GD), the most common ultra-rare metabolic disorder, results from lipid accumulation. Systemic inflammation, cellular stress, and metabolic dysfunction may influence endocrine function, including the thyroid. This study evaluated thyroid function and morphology in 60 GD patients, alongside carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Anthropometric, biochemical, and hormonal tests were conducted, including thyroid ultrasound and shear-wave elastography (SWE). Clinical data, bone mineral density (BMD), and body composition (BOD POD) analyses were correlated. Healthy controls, matched for age, sex, and body mass index (BMI), were included. GD patients had higher thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (FT4) levels within normal limits. Hypothyroidism occurred in 7%, elevated anti-thyroid antibodies in 8%, and nodular goiter in 23%. Patients with nodular goiter showed lower platelet counts and higher chitotriosidase and glucosylsphingosine (lysoGb-1) levels. Patients with type 3 GD had larger thyroid volumes and greater stiffness on SWE than patients with type 1 GD. GD patients also exhibited increased metabolic risk, including central obesity and elevated glucose levels. GD patients, despite normal thyroid hormone levels, exhibit subtle alterations in thyroid function indicators. Their increased risk of central obesity and glucose metabolism disorders, alongside higher TSH and FT4 levels, underscores the need for closer monitoring and further investigation."
"Menstrual Health (MH) knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) are highly affected by access to information regarding menstruation. Despite being included in the school curriculum, Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) education is often not delivered in practice. School-based educational interventions have been shown to be effective in promoting MH."
"According to recent estimates, around 30 million people have taken Direct-to-Consumer DNA ancestry tests, typically marketed as a fun, harmless and exciting process of discovery. These tests estimate a user's ethnic ancestry, also matching users with biological relations on their database. This matching can produce a surprising 'not parent expected' discovery, where a user learns that an assumed parent (typically the father) is not a biological parent. Such news may negatively affect mental health, self-identity and familial relationships, while prompting the utilization of putatively helpful resources by affected individuals. However, there is a lack of research on this topic. Thus, this study aimed to document the psychosocial experience of adults who have learnt that an assumed parent is not a biological parent via a Direct-to-Consumer DNA ancestry test. Specific objectives include investigating and understanding impact on mental health, familial relationships and subsequent resources mobilized."
"Recent advances in genetics and epigenetics have provided critical insights into the pathogenesis of both idiopathic and non-idiopathic interstitial lung diseases (ILDs). Mutations in telomere-related genes and surfactant proteins have been linked to familial pulmonary fibrosis, while variants in MUC5B and TOLLIP increase the risk of ILD, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and rheumatoid arthritis-associated ILD. Epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNAs such as miR-21 and miR-29, regulate fibrotic pathways, influencing disease onset and progression. Although no standardized genetic panel for ILD exists, understanding the interplay of genetic mutations and epigenetic alterations could aid in the development of personalized therapeutic approaches. This review highlights the genetic and epigenetic factors driving ILD, emphasizing their potential for refining diagnosis and treatment."
"The cattle tick Rhipicephalus microplus is prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions, causing substantial economic losses due to its resistance to conventional acaricides. There is an urgent need to identify safe and effective new acaricidal agents. Essential oils and their volatile compounds are promising alternatives. Ensuring the use of optimal solvents or surfactants that do not compromise the acaricidal activity of these compounds during testing is crucial. This study aims to evaluate how compounds thymol, carvacrol and eugenol interact with xylol, methanol, ethanol, acetone, isopropyl alcohol, glycerol, dimethyl sulfoxide, castor oil, propylene glycol, vaseline, and Tween 80® to enhance (or to worse) their acaricidal efficacy against R. microplus. Larval mortality time were compared against one negative control (soybean oil) and two positive controls (commercial pour-on products). The experiments were conducted in 48-well polyethylene plates, with around 100 larvae immersed in 200 μl of each solvent at 100, 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25, 3.125 and 1.56% and diluted in soybean oil or water, according to solubility. Each volatile compound (Thymol, carvacrol and eugenol) was diluted in the tested solvents to assess larval mortality time. Xylol demonstrated the shortest larval mortality time, even at a minimum concentration (p < 0.05). In contrast, liquid vaseline exhibited the longest larval mortality time. When thymol, carvacrol, and eugenol were combined with xylol, they achieved the shortest larval mortality time. Conversely, when diluted in liquid vaseline they exhibited synergistic effects decreasing the mortality time. Tween 80® worsen the efficacy of thymol, carvacrol, and eugenol, resulting in prolonged larval mortality times. These findings emphasize the critical role of solvent selection, indicating the choice of solvent profoundly affects the formulation's effectiveness, directly influencing the activity of the active compounds."
"African swine fever (ASF) emerged in Germany in 2020. A few weeks after the initial occurrence, infected wild boar were detected in Saxony. In this study, data from wild boar surveillance in Saxony were analyzed. The analysis focused on the eastern districts of the state, where the disease likely spread through infected wild boar. Additionally, data from Meissen, located approximately 65 km further west, were examined. In Meissen, the disease emerged one year later, and a human-mediated introduction was suspected. To evaluate the progression of ASF in the two study areas over time, data from active and passive surveillance were analyzed both descriptively and using a Bayesian space-time model. Prevalence estimates were calculated for wild boar testing positive for the ASF virus and for ASF-specific antibodies. Higher prevalence estimates were observed in the eastern districts, indicating a stronger viral load, consistent with patterns seen in other European regions. Over time, seroprevalence increased, suggesting an accumulation of surviving wild boar. The findings provide important insights into the epidemiology of ASF in wild boar over time. They complement the existing knowledge and support targeted ASF control measures. This is particularly significant, as ASF continues to spread across Europe rather than being successfully eradicated."
"The modified Fresno test was developed to assess knowledge and skills related to evidence-based practice among physical therapists and students, however no Chinese version is available. Therefore, the aim of this study was to cross-culturally adapt the English version of the modified Fresno test into Chinese and to evaluate its validity and reliability."
"This review investigated the effects of hypersensitivity treatment on molar-incisor hypomineralization (MIH) using laser therapy, combined or in conjunction with other therapeutic modalities. The review was conducted according to the PICOS strategy (Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome) and was performed in March 2024 using the Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus and Embase. The RoB 2 tool was employed to evaluate the risk of bias. Seven articles were included, and none were classified as ""high risk"" for bias. The recommended wavelengths for laser application ranged from 808 to 810 nm, with an irradiation duration of at least 10 s per point. In two studies, the interval between application sessions varied from 48 to 72 h, with a dosage of 1 J. Three studies incorporated a control group that received some form of fluoride-based treatment. Overall, all studies demonstrated a degree of improvement in dentin hypersensitivity after the laser therapy treatment alone. The application of laser therapy for MIH, whether used in isolation or in combination with other desensitizing strategies, exhibited potential for the long-term reduction of hypersensitivity.

"In Trinidad and Tobago, high HIV prevalence among key populations necessitates studying factors that impact durable viral suppression (DVS), crucial for effective HIV management and reducing transmission among at-risk networks. This study investigates these factors using clinical data from a major HIV care clinic in the Caribbean."
"This study aimed to 1) describe the 2-year postoperative trajectories of leg pain and overall clinical outcome after surgery for radiculopathy, 2) identify the preoperative prognostic factors that predict trajectories representing poor clinical outcomes, and 3) develop and internally validate multivariable prognostic models to assist with clinical decision-making."
"A variety of autoimmune disorders are associated with an increased risk of thrombosis. Previous studies have suggested combined therapy of heparin and therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) with fresh frozen plasma (FFP) as the replacement fluid is beneficial in some cases of acute flare-up of autoimmune diseases complicated by thrombotic events. Nevertheless, it remains unknown whether clinicians do more harm than good by exposing patients to a ""thrombotic storm"" through simultaneous administration of heparin and the clotting factors in the FFP during TPE. A variety of data are currently available on therapeutic interventions for autoimmune diseases complicated with acute thrombosis; however, there is limited evidence on the exact efficacy of each individual approach and combinations of these measures. Herein, we report a case of catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS) to highlight the difficulty of therapeutic decision-making when complicated interactions occur between heparin and TPE. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of a patient diagnosed with CAPS successfully treated with a novel therapeutic strategy of escalating the heparin dosage when performing TPE by monitoring the partial prothrombin time to reduce the risk of the progression of thrombosis."
"WHAT IS KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT?: In daily psychiatric practice, understanding individuals often involves formulating the clinical case, which may lead to viewing them solely as symptoms to be solved. Consequently, it can be challenging to see the individual beyond their symptoms. However, trying to understand the individual by his/her writings about narratives can offer broader perspectives and extend beyond being a medium for patients to express their experiences. On understanding writing, hermeneutics will be a resourceful method. WHAT THE PAPER ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: This study aims to propose a reevaluation of the nature of therapeutic communication among individuals with schizophrenia, psychiatrists, and psychiatric nurses by interpreting their writings on the same written narratives through a hermeneutic analysis. Our study has unique features compared to previous studies on communication between mental health professionals and patients. We directly investigated the act of understanding through the writings of the three groups of participants. The participants were also engaged in reading and writing about the narratives instead of relying on clinical interviews or self-report questionnaires. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first hermeneutic study to examine the nature of reflection while all three groups encounter the same narratives as readers. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: The results point to the need for psychiatrists/psychiatric nurses to develop new perspectives and skills in understanding/interacting with individuals with schizophrenia. Our study could be a pioneer sample in applying hermeneutics as a prevailing method to mental health nursing practice."
"Prehabilitation has been increasingly utilized to optimize perioperative outcomes. In this study, we aim to evaluate the impact of uni- and multimodal prehabilitation on functional capacity and postoperative outcomes among surgical oncology patients undergoing major abdominal surgery."
"Previous results from this trial showed longer overall survival after treatment with nivolumab plus ipilimumab or with nivolumab monotherapy than with ipilimumab monotherapy in patients with advanced melanoma. Given that patients with advanced melanoma are living longer than 7.5 years, longer-term data were needed to address new clinically relevant questions."
"An ocular mass was noted in the right iridociliary region of a 13-year-old male beagle dog. The right eyeball was surgically removed. Histopathologically, the mass was located mainly in the ciliary body and appeared to be continuous with non-pigmented epithelial cells. The polygonal neoplastic cells proliferated in sheets with periodic acid-Schiff-positive basement membrane material. Neoplastic cells had small round nuclei with no atypia or mitosis, and abundant, pale eosinophilic, granular, and rarified cytoplasm displayed ballooning change. No invasive growth or metastasis was observed. Immunohistochemically, the cells were positive for vimentin, neuron-specific enolase, and S100, and negative for cytokeratin AE1/AE3, Iba-1, CD204, MelanA, Sox10, and PNL2. Based on these findings, the lesion was diagnosed as an iridociliary adenoma with ballooning change."
"Immunologic measures have been studied as predictors of who will respond to standard antidepressants. Two previous, small studies of pretreatment leukocyte mRNA expression levels of the cytokines macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and interleukin 1-beta (IL1-β) identified antidepressant treatment responders."
"Family income to poverty ratio (PIR) may have independent effects on diet and lifestyle factors and the development of prediabetes and diabetes, as well as on mortality. It is unclear how the protective effect of a healthy lifestyle against death differs between individuals with different glucose metabolic profiles and whether PIR mediates this effect. This study aimed to explore whether healthy lifestyle and family PIR reduced the risk of all-cause mortality in participants with different metabolic status and the mediating role of PIR."
"- Accurate detection, segmentation, and volumetric analysis of brain lesions are essential in neuro-oncology. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based models have improved the efficiency of these processes. This study evaluated an AI-based module for detecting and segmenting brain metastases, comparing it with manual detection and segmentation."
"PCSK9 is a serine protease that regulates plasma levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and cholesterol by mediating the endolysosomal degradation of LDL receptor (LDLR) in the liver. When PCSK9 functions unchecked, it leads to increased degradation of LDLR, resulting in elevated circulatory levels of LDL and cholesterol. This dysregulation contributes to lipid and cholesterol metabolism abnormalities, foam cell formation, and the development of various diseases, including cardiovascular disease (CVD), viral infections, cancer, and sepsis. Emerging clinical and experimental evidence highlights an imperative role for PCSK9 in metabolic anomalies such as hypercholesterolemia and hyperlipidemia, as well as inflammation, and disturbances in mitochondrial homeostasis. Moreover, metabolic hormones - including insulin, glucagon, adipokines, natriuretic peptides, and sex steroids - regulate the expression and circulatory levels of PCSK9, thus influencing cardiovascular and metabolic functions. In this comprehensive review, we aim to elucidate the regulatory role of PCSK9 in lipid and cholesterol metabolism, pathophysiology of diseases such as CVD, infections, cancer, and sepsis, as well as its pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical targeting for therapeutic management of these conditions."
"Polymicrobial biofilms, the reason for most chronic wound infections, play a significant role in increasing antibiotic resistance. The in vivo effectiveness of the new anti-biofilm therapy is conditioned by the profound evaluation using appropriate in vitro biofilm models. Since nutrient availability is crucial for in vitro biofilm formation, this study is focused on the impact of four selected cultivation media on the properties of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans dual-species biofilms. To reflect the wound environment, Tryptic soy broth, RPMI 1640 with and without glucose, and Lubbock medium were supplemented with different amounts of host effector molecules present in human plasma or sheep red blood cells. The study demonstrates that the Lubbock medium provided the most appropriate amount of nutrients regarding the biomass structure and the highest degree of tolerance to selected antimicrobials with the evident contribution of the biofilm matrix. Our results allow the rational employment of nutrition conditions within methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans dual-species biofilm formation in vitro for preclinical research. Additionally, one of the potential targets of a complex antibiofilm strategy, carbohydrates, was revealed since they are prevailing molecules in the matrices regardless of the cultivation media."
"The nature of somatotroph adenomas has not been clearly revealed in studies. We consider that there are macroscopic differences in intraoperative tumor consistency in acromegaly patients. We aimed to determine whether there is a relationship between intraoperative tumor consistency and histopathological subtypes by planning a prospective study to determine whether these differences are significant. Between August 1997 and December 2021, 1118 patients with GH-secreting tumors underwent endoscopic endonasal surgery at our Pituitary Research Center. Between January 2022 and May 2023, pure GH-secreting adenomas operated via the endoscopic endonasal approach were sequentially categorized into three types(Type-1:Soft, Type-2:Mucinous/Adhesive, Type-3:Mix/Intermediate) according to the intraoperative tumor consistency. The final patient cohort consisted 218 cases. The ratio of densely granulated adenomas(DG-A) to sparsely granulated adenomas(SG-A) was as follows: Type-1, 89/11; Type-2, 5/95; Type-3, 13/5. Logistic regression revealed that Type-1 tumors were associated with a high remission rate(p = 0.011), and Type-2 were associated with SG-A(p < 0.001). Furthermore, no or weak staining for E-cadherin was associated with Type-2 tumors(p < 0.001). Surgeon could predict the prognosis and histopathological subtype of the pure somatotroph adenoma by observing the intraoperative tumor consistency. This could facilitate better intraoperative planning of patient-specific surgical strategies to increase the remission rates."
"A niche in the context of microorganisms defines the specific ecological role or habitat inhabited by microbial species within an ecosystem. For the human commensal Malassezia, the skin surface is considered its primary niche, where it adapts to the skin environment by utilising lipids as its main carbon and energy source. However pathogenic characteristics of Malassezia include the production of allergens, immune modulation and excessive lipid utilisation, which result in several diseases such as pityriasis versicolor, seborrheic dermatitis, Malassezia folliculitis and atopic dermatitis. Recent studies have revealed Malassezia colonisation in internal organs, including the lungs, gut, genitourinary tract, eyes, ears and breast milk. In these organs, Malassezia is associated with diseases linked to respiratory conditions, neurological disorders, gastrointestinal diseases and genital infections. The immune system plays a critical role in shaping Malassezia prevalence, with factors like, immune suppressive drugs and underlying health conditions influencing susceptibility. Accurate diagnosis of Malassezia-related skin disorders is challenging due to its unique growth requirements, but molecular fingerprinting assays and sequencing methods, particularly ITS sequencing, offer precise identification. Treatment involves antifungal drugs, corticosteroids and phytocompounds, yet recurrent infections highlight the need for more targeted therapeutic strategies addressing Malassezia's pathogenic characteristics. Understanding the complex interactions between Malassezia and the host organs is crucial for diagnosis, treatment and prevention and exploring its potentially beneficial roles in health and disease. This review highlights the current findings on the intricate interactions between Malassezia and the diverse ecosystem of the human body, underscoring the complexity of these associations and emphasising their multifaceted role in health and disease."
"This detailed study examines the complex role of the SOX family in various tumorigenic contexts, offering insights into how these transcription factors function in cancer. As the study progresses, it explores the specific contributions of each SOX family member. The significant roles of the SOX family in the oncogenic environment are well-recognized, highlighting a range of regulatory mechanisms that influence tumor progression. In brain, lung, and colorectal cancers, SOX types like SOX2, SOX3, and SOX4 promote the migration, proliferation, and angiogenesis of cancer cells. Conversely, in pancreatic, gastric, and breast cancers, SOX types, including SOX1, SOX9, and SOX17 inhibit various cancer cell activities such as proliferation and invasion. This thorough investigation enhances our understanding of the SOX family's complex role in cancer, establishing a foundation for future research and potential therapeutic strategies targeting these versatile transcription factors."
"Amblyopia is a common eye disease that seriously affects children's eye health. The Chinese Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus has carried out a lot of work for the prevention and treatment of amblyopia, but there are still many problems that need to be paid attention to and solved in the amblyopia screening and clinical diagnosis and treatment. In this article, we discuss three aspects of the amblyopia prevention and treatment, including the timing of prevention and treatment according to visual developmental patterns, the standardized treatment of amblyopia, overdiagnosis and commercialization, and the establishment of an efficient amblyopia screening system, for providing guidance for the standardization of clinical practice and improving the level of amblyopia prevention and treatment in China."
"Health promotion commonly focuses on supporting youth wellness, as health behaviors acquired in childhood and adolescence tend to have a significant impact on an individual's future. Adolescent health education is associated with positive health and educational outcomes, yet young people experience barriers to fully engaging in learning about health issues that are often unique to their social location. Barriers for successful engagement in health education for African diaspora youth in North American and European contexts may include school initiatives built around engagement models that do not center Black youth; for Black youth in majority-Black societies, barriers may include access to resources or exclusionary practices based on other social characteristics. Global health promotion has used a variety of multimodal educational tools from radio to more recently online engagement, especially in African contexts, to reach young people. This essay shares experiences using AI and in-person facilitation to engage in community health education with youth in Liberia and the United States. In our practice, we found that there are far more underlying systemic and structural similarities to the inequities experienced between African and Black American youth and that utilizing AI tools alongside of in-person discussion may contribute to better outcomes for youth health education."
"It has been confirmed that exposure to various metal pollutants can induce neurotoxicity, which is closely associated with the occurrence and development of neurological disorders. Ferroptosis is a form of cell death in response to metal pollutant exposure and it is closely related to oxidative stress, iron metabolism and lipid peroxidation. Recent studies have revealed that ferroptosis plays a significant role in the neurotoxicity induced by metals such as lead, cadmium, manganese, nickel, and antimony. Lead exposure triggers ferroptosis through oxidative stress, iron metabolism disorder and inflammation. Cadmium can induce ferroptosis through iron metabolism, oxidative stress and ferroptosis related signaling pathways. Manganese can promote ferroptosis through mitochondrial dysfunction, iron metabolism disorder and oxidative stress. Nickel can promote ferroptosis by influencing mitochondrial function, disrupting iron homeostasis and facilitating lipid peroxidation in the central nervous system. Antimony exposure can induce glutathione depletion by activating iron autophagy, resulting in excessive intracellular iron deposition and ultimately causing ferroptosis. This article reviews the effects of metal pollutants on ferroptosis-related indicators and discusses the specific mechanisms by which each metal triggers ferroptosis. It provides a reference for identifying targets for preventing neurotoxicity and for developing treatment strategies for neurological disorders."
"Squalene epoxidase (SQLE) is a key enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis and has been shown to negatively affect tumor immunity and is associated with poor outcomes of immunotherapy in various cancers. While most research in this area has focused on the impact of cholesterol on immune functions, the influence of SQLE-mediated squalene metabolism within the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) remains unexplored."
"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), decreases quality of life and causes disability. The underlying processes are not fully understood. This study uses Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to identify cytokines that may be associated with UC and CD, aiding in early diagnosis and treatment decisions. Methods Genome-wide association study (GWAS) data for inflammatory cytokine levels were obtained from a cohort of 14,824 individuals of European descent. The outcome data were then analyzed using summary-level GWAS data for UC and CD from the International Inflammatory Bowel Disease Genetics Consortium (IIBDGC). The analysis was primarily conducted using inverse-variance weighted (IVW) methods, with MR-Egger and weighted median serving as supplementary analyses. Sensitivity analyses included Cochran's Q test, MR-Egger intercept test, MR-PRESSO, and leave-one-out analysis.The inflammatory cytokines were subjected to additional scrutiny through the application of the Steiger test and reverse Mendelian randomization analysis. Subsequently, multivariable Mendelian randomization (MVMR) was employed to examine the associations of metabolites on UC and CD, in conjunction with linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) and colocalization analysis. After FDR correction, we identified significant genetic associations of two inflammatory proteins (CXCL5 and CXCL9) with UC, and CXCL5 and IL-18R1 with CD. These findings were further validated by MVMR. Colocalization analyses demonstrated substantial genetic overlap between inflammatory proteins and IBD, with CXCL5 showing strong evidence of shared genetic variants with UC, and CXCL9 exhibiting genetic colocalization with CD, suggesting common genetic determinants underlying these inflammatory protein-IBD relationships. The current work presents evidence that presents evidence of significant associations between seven inflammatory protein factors and UC, as well as three inflammatory protein factors and CD. These findings provide novel insights into the biological mechanisms of IBD, and have implications for the screening, prevention, and treatment of IBD."
"The current situation of COVID-19 measures makes it difficult to accurately assess the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 due to a decrease in reporting rates, leading to missed initial transmission events and subsequent outbreaks. There is growing recognition that wastewater virus data assist in estimating potential infections, including asymptomatic and unreported infections. Understanding the COVID-19 situation hidden behind the reported cases is critical for decision-making when choosing appropriate social intervention measures. However, current models implicitly assume homogeneity in human behaviour, such as virus shedding patterns within the population, making it challenging to predict the emergence of new variants due to variant-specific transmission or shedding parameters. This can result in predictions with considerable uncertainty. In this study, we established a state-space model based on wastewater viral load to predict both reported cases and potential infection numbers. Our model using wastewater virus data showed high goodness-of-fit to COVID-19 case numbers despite the dataset including waves of two distinct variants. Furthermore, the model successfully provided estimates of potential infection, reflecting the superspreading nature of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. This study supports the notion that wastewater surveillance and state-space modelling have the potential to effectively predict both reported cases and potential infections."
"Whole-exome sequencing (WES) studies have revealed that germline de novo variants (gDNVs) contribute to the genetic etiology of schizophrenia. However, the contribution of mosaic DNVs (mDNVs) to the risk of schizophrenia remains to be elucidated. In the present study, we systematically investigated the gDNVs and mDMVs that contribute to the genetic etiology of schizophrenia in a Japanese population."
"High telomerase activity has been detected in over 85 % of tumors, with the activation of hTERT being the most crucial mechanism for re-establishing telomerase activity. Activation of hTERT maintains telomere length in cells, enabling cancer cells to proliferate indefinitely. Nevertheless, the specific mechanism of telomerase activation in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains unclear, and post-transcriptional regulation of hTERT could be a potential activation mechanism."
"Antisense oligodeoxynucleotides can bind to target RNAs and cleave them using RNase H. Despite the high activity of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides modified with locked nucleic acids (LNA) at several bases at both the 5' and 3' ends (LNA gapmer), toxicity has been reported, necessitating additional backbone modifications to reduce toxicity. In this study, we introduced a sulfonamide linkage into the LNA gapmer to elucidate its fundamental properties such as hybridization, base recognition, and induction of RNase H activity. A new chemically stable sulfonyltriazole was used as a synthetic intermediate to introduce a sulfonamide linkage between the two nucleosides. We studied the properties of the duplex of the sulfonamide-linked gapmer and target RNAs, such as melting temperature, circular dichroism, and cleavage of RNA strands by RNase H. We found that the gapmers had a lower but tolerable duplex stability with base-pair specificity and the ability to induce RNase H activity."
"Climate change is predicted to alter the hydrological and thermal regimes of high-mountain streams, particularly glacier-fed streams. However, relatively little is known about how these environmental changes impact the microbial communities in glacier-fed streams. Here, we operated streamside flume mesocosms in the Swiss Alps, where benthic biofilms were grown under treatments simulating climate change. Treatments comprised four flow (natural, intermittent, stochastic, and constant) and two temperature (ambient streamwater and warming of +2°C) regimes. We monitored microbial biomass, diversity, community composition, and metabolic diversity in biofilms over 3 months. We found that community composition was largely influenced by successional dynamics independent of the treatments. While stochastic and constant flow regimes did not significantly affect community composition, droughts altered their composition in the intermittent regime, favouring drought-adapted bacteria and decreasing algal biomass. Concomitantly, warming decreased algal biomass and the abundance of some typical glacier-fed stream bacteria and eukaryotes, and stimulated heterotrophic metabolism overall. Our study provides experimental evidence towards potential and hitherto poorly considered impacts of climate change on benthic biofilms in glacier-fed streams."
We aimed to assess the effects of olanzapine in the improvement of body weight and appetite in patients with cancer or receiving chemotherapy through a systematic review and meta-analysis.
"This paper introduces the ""NEBULA101 - Neuro-behavioural Understanding of Language Aptitude"" dataset, which comprises behavioural and brain imaging data from 101 healthy adults to examine individual differences in language and cognition. Human language, a multifaceted behaviour, varies significantly among individuals, at different processing levels. Recent advances in cognitive science have embraced an integrated approach, combining behavioural and brain studies to explore these differences comprehensively. The NEBULA101 dataset offers brain structural, diffusion-weighted, task-based and resting-state MRI data, alongside extensive linguistic and non-linguistic behavioural measures to explore the complex interaction of language and cognition in a highly multilingual sample. By sharing this multimodal dataset, we hope to promote research on the neuroscience of language, cognition and multilingualism, enabling the field to deepen its understanding of the multivariate panorama of individual differences and ultimately contributing to open science."
"Hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) is a serious pulmonary vascular complication that causes arterial hypoxemia in the setting of liver disease. HPS has a progressive course and is associated with a two-fold increased risk of mortality relative to cirrhotic patients without HPS. It primarily affects patients with portal hypertension. The key pathological features of HPS include intrapulmonary angiogenesis and vascular dilations (IPVDs). The prevalence of HPS varies widely due to inconsistent diagnostic criteria and a lack of standardized protocols. Despite advances in understanding its pathophysiology, no effective curative treatments for HPS exist. Liver transplantation remains the only definitive treatment, improving survival and altering the disease natural course. This review explores the pathophysiology, clinical features, and therapeutic strategies for HPS, highlighting recent advances in the literature."
"Though COVID-19 as a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) was declared to be ended by the WHO, it continues to pose a significant threat to human society. Vaccination remains one of the most effective methods for preventing COVID-19. While most of the antigenic regions are found in the receptor binding domain (RBD), the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the S protein is another crucial region for inducing neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) against COVID-19."
"Human motion is often tracked using three-dimensional video motion tracking systems, which have demonstrated high levels of validity. More recently, inertial measurement units (IMUs) have been used to measure human movement due to their ease of access and application. The purpose of this study was to systematically review the literature regarding the validity of inertial sensor systems when being used to track human motion. Four electronic databases were used for the search, and eleven studies were included in the final review. IMUs have a high level of agreement with motion capture systems in the frontal and sagittal planes, measured with root mean square error (RMSE), intraclass correlation coefficient, and Pearson's correlation. However, the transverse or rotational planes began to show large discrepancies in joint angles between systems. Furthermore, as the intensity of the task being measured increased, the RMSE values began to get much larger. Currently, the use of accelerometers and inertial sensor systems has limited application in the assessment of human motion, but if the precision and processing of IMU devices improves further, it could provide researchers an opportunity to collect data in less synthetic environments, as well as improve ease of access to biomechanically analyse human movement."
"Sijilmassi et al. argue that myths around shared ancestry and history exploit an evolved psychology of interdependence. In contrast, we argue that psychological exploitation is not required. Rather, such myths may be one method, among many, to create a shared understanding of group boundaries, which can be ""self-enforcing."" We summarize the game-theoretic basis for this account and some supportive evidence."
"Red blood cells (RBCs) are the main cells of the blood, perform numerous functions within the body and are in continuous contact with endogenous and exogenous molecules. In this context, the study aims to investigate the effect of epicatechin (EC) (flavan-3-ols) on the erythrocytes, analyzing the protective effect of the molecule and the action exerted on metabolism and RBC membrane. The effect of EC on RBC viability has been evaluated through the change in hemolysis and methemoglobin, assessing caspase 3 activity and performing a cytofluorometric analysis. Next, the impact of the molecule on RBC metabolism was assessed by measuring anion flux kinetics, ATP production, and phosphatase activity. Finally, an evaluation of the potential protection against different stressors was performed. Our results show no detrimental effects of EC on RBCs (no change in hemolysis or methemoglobin and no caspase 3 activation recorded); rather, a protective effect was recorded given the reduction in hemolysis induced by hydrogen peroxide treatment and temperature increase. The increase in anion exchange and intracellular ATP values, with the inhibition of phosphatase PTP1B activity, highlights several biochemical alterations induced by EC. The present results contribute to clarifying the influence of EC on RBCs, confirming the beneficial effects of catechins."
"Anti-dipeptidyl-peptidase-like protein 6 antibody-mediated disease is a rare autoimmune encephalitis typically presenting with diarrhoea and/or weight loss, central nervous system hyperexcitability and cognitive dysfunction. We present a case of a young woman with 10 days of diplopia and unsteadiness in the context of dysthymia and significant weight loss over 2 months. Initial examination demonstrated mixed dysconjugate nystagmus and ataxic gait. Presumed diagnosis was Wernicke's encephalopathy and intravenous thiamine was given, resulting in partial improvement. Subsequent examination revealed hyperekplexia with ocular flutter, cervical dystonia and startle myoclonus. Cerebrospinal fluid indirect immunofluorescence on primate cerebellum revealed granular layer pattern of staining, prompting testing for anti-dipeptidyl-peptidase-like protein antibodies, which returned strongly positive. Given the phenotypic overlap, it is important to consider this rare disorder in the differential diagnosis of Wernicke's encephalopathy. In this case, the emergence of ocular flutter, startle myoclonus and the specific type of nystagmus made it clear there was an alternative diagnosis."
"Effective Microorganism (EM) is widely employed as a growth promoter in agricultural practices. The aging of oat seeds not only directly impairs agricultural production but also exerts adverse effects on biodiversity. The mechanism through which EM influence the germination of aging seeds remains unclear. In this experiment, the EM bacterial solution underwent pretreatment, which included the original-solution treatment (OrT), supernatant treatment (SuT), and sterile treatment (StT). Aging of oat seeds was induced using the pretreated EM bacterial solution. In this study, the EM bacterial solution facilitated the enhancement of the germination rate, germination index, and vitality index of aged seeds, with SuT demonstrating the most pronounced effects. Specifically, SuT resulted in a significant increase in APX and POD activities, while significantly reducing the malondialdehyde content. In addition, metabolic profiling highlighted the significance of 5-phosphoribosylamine in the purine metabolic pathway. Particularly in the SuT, the upregulation of 5-phosphoribosylamine facilitated the synthesis of (R)-Allantoin, consequently augmenting antioxidant enzyme activity."
"Despite being one of the most common infectious diseases, urinary tract infections (UTIs) still represent a challenge for clinicians to diagnose and treat, especially in the era of growing antibiotic resistance among uropathogenic bacteria. Recent studies investigating the pathophysiology of UTIs have discovered the prominent role of antimicrobial peptides in the urinary tract defense system. Cathelicidin is an evolutionary conserved antimicrobial peptide encoded by one single gene in humans. Except for being stored in neutrophil cytoplasmic granules, cathelicidin is produced by uroepithelial cells rapidly upon contact with a uropathogen, even before leukocytes invade the urinary tract. In addition to its bactericidal effect, cathelicidin acts as a chemoattractant for multiple immune cells and a potent inductor of numerous cytokine synthesis. Such a crucial role in the initial pathogenesis of a UTI makes cathelicidin a potential biomarker for an early UTI diagnosis. Indeed, multiple studies over the last two decades have proved the potential clinical utility of cathelicidin as a UTI diagnostic biomarker. Furthermore, since patients after the resolution of a UTI have been found to express a lower urinary cathelicidin level than healthy controls, decreased cathelicidin levels have been suggested as a risk factor for developing UTI recurrence. Therefore, measuring cathelicidin levels in urine might help in distinguishing patients with a higher risk for a recurrent UTI. Interestingly, except in UTIs, cathelicidin has also been evaluated in other urinary tract diseases and proposed as a biomarker for diagnosing severe vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and for recognizing renal scar development in patients with VUR. Finally, a prominent role in UTI pathogenesis also makes cathelicidin an attractive therapeutic target for treating UTIs and, lately, different therapeutic agents up-regulating cathelicidin expression have been investigated in this matter. Therefore, the present review aims to summarize the current body of knowledge on the diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic potential of cathelicidin in urinary tract diseases. For this purpose, three databases (Scopus, Medline and Web of Science) were extensively searched to cover all the published articles. This exhaustive review will update clinicians on the contemporary state of knowledge about the potential clinical utility of cathelicidin in urinary tract diseases and hopefully encourage further research, resulting in improvement in the current management of urinary tract diseases."
"Isoforms spliced from the same gene may carry distinct biological functions. Therefore, annotating functions at the isoform level provides valuable insights into the functional diversity of genomes. Since experimental approaches for determining isoform functions are time- and cost-demanding, computational methods have been proposed. In this case, multi-omics data integration helps enhance the model performance, providing complementary insights for isoform functions. However, current methods underperform in leveraging diverse omics data, primarily due to the limited power to integrate the heterogeneous feature domains. Besides, among the multi-omics data, isoform-isoform interactions (IIIs) are a key data source, as isoforms interact with each other to perform functions. Unfortunately, IIIs remain largely underutilized in isoform function predictions until now."
"The popliteal artery segment is particularly challenging for endovascular treatment. Stents used for treating popliteal artery lesions are usually associated with an increased risk of stent fracture and re-occlusion. The Supera stent is designed to withstand mechanical stress, with a low risk of fracture. A man in his mid-70s with left popliteal artery occlusion was treated with a Supera stent implantation. After 5 months, he revisited our hospital complaining of left leg pain. Preprocedural computed tomography angiography showed popliteal artery occlusion associated with a Supera stent fracture. A new Supera stent was implanted at the previous stent fracture site. However, 3 months after the second procedure, computed tomography angiography showed popliteal artery re-occlusion associated with a repeated fracture of the Supera stent. A femoral-popliteal bypass was performed. At the 6-month follow-up, computed tomography angiography showed a patent graft. Our findings indicated that recurrent fractures occurred after additional Supera stenting at the previous Supera stent fracture site. Careful observation is necessary after deploying a new Supera stent for treating a Supera stent fracture because of the possibility of a repeated fracture."
This study aims to identify a pathogenic SDHD mutation associated with hereditary head and neck paraganglioma (HNPGL) in a Chinese family and to explore its implications for genetic counseling.
"mRNA delivery has emerged as a transformative approach in biotechnology and medicine, offering a versatile platform for the development of novel therapeutics. Unlike traditional small molecule drugs or protein-based biologics, mRNA therapeutics have the unique ability to direct cells to generate therapeutic proteins, allowing for precise modulation of biological processes. The delivery of mRNA into target cells is a critical step in realizing the therapeutic potential of this technology. In this review, our focus is on the latest advancements in designing functional polymers to achieve efficient mRNA delivery. Biodegradable polymers and low molecular weight polymers in addressing the balance in mRNA binding and release are summarized. Benefiting from the excellent performance of lipid nanoparticles in mRNA delivery, polymer/lipid hybrid nanostructures are also included. Finally, the challenges and future prospects in the development of polymer-based mRNA delivery systems are discussed."
"Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) across numerous disciplines has transformed the worldwide landscape of pandemic response. This review investigates the multidimensional role of AI in the pandemic, which arises as a global health crisis, and its role in preparedness and responses, ranging from enhanced epidemiological modelling to the acceleration of vaccine development. The confluence of AI technologies has guided us in a new era of data-driven decision-making, revolutionizing our ability to anticipate, mitigate, and treat infectious illnesses. The review begins by discussing the impact of a pandemic on emerging countries worldwide, elaborating on the critical significance of AI in epidemiological modelling, bringing data-driven decision-making, and enabling forecasting, mitigation and response to the pandemic. In epidemiology, AI-driven epidemiological models like SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) and SIS (Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible) are applied to predict the spread of disease, preventing outbreaks and optimising vaccine distribution. The review also demonstrates how Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and predictive analytics improve our knowledge of disease propagation patterns. The collaborative aspect of AI in vaccine discovery and clinical trials of various vaccines is emphasised, focusing on constructing AI-powered surveillance networks. Conclusively, the review presents a comprehensive assessment of how AI impacts epidemiological modelling, builds AI-enabled dynamic models by collaborating ML and Deep Learning (DL) techniques, and develops and implements vaccines and clinical trials. The review also focuses on screening, forecasting, contact tracing and monitoring the virus-causing pandemic. It advocates for sustained research, real-world implications, ethical application and strategic integration of AI technologies to strengthen our collective ability to face and alleviate the effects of global health issues."
"To address the high surface roughness and poor optical properties of three-dimensional (3D) printed orthodontic clear retainers, an alternative post-processing protocol was investigated with the goal of achieving improved surface, optical, and mechanical properties while preserving dimensional accuracy."
"Neural electrodes used for bidirectional communication between the nervous system and external devices like prosthetic limbs have advanced in neuroprosthetic applications. However, their effectiveness is hindered by the foreign body reaction, a natural immune response causing inflammation and fibrosis around the implanted device. This process involves protein adsorption, immune cell recruitment, cytokine release, and fibroblast activation, leading to a fibrous capsule formation and a decrease in electrode functionality. Anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic strategies have the potential to diminish the impact of the foreign body response. In this work, we have evaluated long-term metformin administration and short-term dexamethasone administration as a combined therapy to modulate the foreign body reaction induced by a polyimide intraneural implant in the sciatic nerve of rats. After a 12-week implant, the foreign body reaction was significantly reduced only in the group administered both drugs."
"Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are one of the most frequent bacterial conditions in children, being enterobacteria the predominant etiologic agents. Streptococcus pneumoniae is an exceptional cause of UTI in the pediatric population."
"This article explores the significant yet underappreciated role of medical experts in consolidating the promotion of moderate drinking as a viable solution to Britain's alcohol problem during the interwar period. The country's experience with alcohol regulation in the First World War showed that widespread drunkenness could be effectively managed through policies that restricted the availability of alcohol and encouraged moderation. This realization weakened the political standing of the temperance movement, as support for alcohol prohibition and abstinence waned, leading to the liberalization of social attitudes towards drinking. Such circumstances facilitated the emergence of New Moderationism, a renewed policy approach that regarded moderate drinking as relatively benign while cautioning against the dangers of heavy consumption. Medical professionals provided the conceptual foundation for New Moderationism by reassessing several assumptions on alcohol's conflicting reputation as either a 'poison' or a 'food', its benefits to drinkers, and its potential to cause disease. These considerations led to the conclusion that alcohol policy should focus not on whether people should drink, but on how much. This study thus underscores the pivotal contribution of medical professionals in the evolution of the alcohol debate between the two world wars, revealing the transformative impact of expertise on policymaking and social change in modern Britain."
The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy and safety of low-dose radiotherapy (LDR) for postoperative local chest wall recurrence of breast cancer.
"Neurodevelopmental disorders are a group of diseases with cognitive, motor, and emotional development deficits. Alpha-synuclein (α-syn) is a synaptic protein involved in transmission and neurodevelopment. This protein was previously shown to be associated with several disorders, including Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, a close link between neurodevelopmental disorders and Parkinson's has also been found. Changes in synaptic function have been noticed in neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder. Impaired neurogenesis and related cognitive problems have been associated with altered expression of α-syn. Various studies reported α-syn in different body fluids and tissues such as blood and serum. Alpha-synuclein can help in better understanding the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental diseases and facilitating their early diagnosis. This review aims to go over the recent advances in the role of α-syn in the pathophysiology of neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and motor and social impairment, and its value as a diagnostic biomarker."
"Renal interstitial fibrosis is a frequent pathological manifestation of lupus nephritis (LN). tRNA halves (tiRNAs) are acquired from tRNA-derived small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) and are associated with fibrosis. Our previous study indicated enhanced tiRNA-Gly-GCC-002 (tiRNA002) levels in kidneys were positively related to LN-related fibrosis. However, the precise molecular mechanism remains unclear."
"This case report highlights sorafenib as maintenance therapy postallogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) in a young patient with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with FMS-like tirosine kinase-3 (FLT3)-internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutation. Given the high relapse risk in FLT3-ITD-positive AML, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib was administered. Several studies have shown that sorafenib improves survival in younger AML patients when combined with chemotherapy, though side effects can limit use in older patients. Sorafenib is increasingly significant after allo-HSCT maintenance, offering a promising option for high-risk AML cases. In this case, the patient achieved long-term remission with minimal side effects."
"The lack of data on the whole-genome analysis of genotype II African swine fever virus (ASFV) isolates significantly hinders our understanding of its molecular evolution, and as a result, the range of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) necessary to describe a more accurate and complete scheme of its circulation. In this regard, this study aimed to identify unique SNPs, conduct phylogenetic analysis, and determine the level of homology of isolates obtained in the period from 2019 to 2022 in the central and eastern regions of Russia. Twenty-one whole-genome sequences of genotype II ASFV isolates were assembled, analyzed, and submitted to GenBank. The isolates in eastern Russia form two clades, ""Amur 2022"" and ""Asia"". Within the latter clade, five subclusters can be distinguished, each characterized by a unique set of SNPs and indels. The isolates from the central regions of Russia (2019; 2021) form the ""Center of Russia"" clade, with two subclusters, ""Bryansk 2021"" and ""Center of Russia 2021"" (bootstrap confidence index = 99). The presence of the previously unique genetic variant ASFV for the Kaliningrad region in the wild boar population of the Khabarovsk region (eastern Russia; 2021) has also been confirmed."
"Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), a zinc-dependent enzyme, plays a critical role in the degradation and remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM). As a member of the gelatinase subgroup of matrix metalloproteinases, MMP-2 is involved in a variety of physiological processes, including tissue repair, wound healing, angiogenesis, and embryogenesis. It is primarily responsible for the degradation of type IV and V collagen, fibronectin, laminin, and elastin, which are essential components of the ECM. MMP-2 is secreted as an inactive pro-enzyme (proMMP-2) and activated through proteolytic cleavage, with its activity being precisely regulated by tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). Dysregulation of MMP-2 has been linked to a variety of pathological conditions, including cardiovascular diseases, diabetic complications, kidney diseases, and cancer. In cardiovascular diseases, it contributes to vascular remodeling, atherosclerosis, and aneurysms, while in fibrotic diseases, it mediates excessive ECM degradation leading to tissue scarring. In diabetes, elevated MMP-2 activity exacerbates complications such as nephropathy, retinopathy, and cardiovascular disease. In cancer, MMP-2 facilitates tumor invasion and metastasis by degrading ECM components and promoting angiogenesis. Despite its essential roles in both physiological and pathological processes, targeting MMP-2 for therapeutic purposes presents challenges due to its dual functions in tissue remodeling and repair, raising concerns about unplanned consequences such as impaired tissue healing or excessive tissue damage. These challenges underscore the need for future research to focus on developing selective modulators that can precisely balance their activity under specific disease environments. Clinical trials targeting MMP-2 modulation highlight the potential of gelatinase inhibitors, including those targeting MMP-2, to reduce tumor progression in fibrosarcoma, breast, and lung cancers. This paper reviews the structure, function, and regulation of MMP-2, its involvement in disease pathogenesis, and the potential challenges in the therapeutic implications of modulating its activity."
"Osteosarcoma is one of the most common malignant bone tumours in children. In this study, we aimed to construct a cuproptosis-related lncRNAs signature to predict the prognosis and immune landscape of osteosarcoma patients. Databases from TARGET were used to acquire osteosarcoma patient datasets, which included clinical information and RNA sequencing data. Cuproptosis-related lncRNAs was obtained by correlation analysis. Through univariate Cox regression analysis, prognosis-related lncRNAs were obtained. We used nonnegative matrix factorization clustering to identify potential molecular subgroups with different cuproptosis-related lncRNA expression patterns. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator algorithm and multivariate Cox regression analysis were used to construct the prognostic signature. The ESTIMATE algorithm, Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes were applied to explore the underlying mechanisms in the immune landscape of osteosarcoma. We used gene set enrichment analysis to compare the different enrichments in the high-risk group and the low-risk group. Furthermore, we predicted the response to targeted drugs in patients with different risk groups. Using multivariable analysis, we developed a risk scoring model based on 7 long noncoding RNAs and calculated two molecular subgroups from osteosarcoma patients from the database. There is a better immune microenvironment in the low-risk group compared to the high-risk group. At the same time, the gene functional enrichment analysis based on the differently expressed genes obtained by grouping showed they were mainly related to immunity, indicating that cuproptosis-related lncRNAs may affect the prognosis of osteosarcoma by regulating immunity. Moreover, these patients in high-risk group were more susceptible to targeted drugs than the low-risk group. We identified a cuproptosis-related lncRNA prognostic signature for osteosarcoma and showed a close connection in terms of immunity. Moreover, we provided some potential targeted drugs for the treatment of osteosarcoma."
Training occupational therapy students in manual skills such as goniometry typically requires intensive one on one student teacher interactions and repetitive practice to ensure competency. There is evidence that immersive virtual reality (IVR) supported embodied learning can improve confidence and performance of skills. Embodied learning refers to learner's experience of viewing a simulated body and its properties as if they were the learner's own biological body. The aim of this proof-of-concept study was to develop and examine the usability and establish preliminary efficacy of an Embodied Goniometric Occupational Therapy Training Program (EGOTTP) to teach occupational therapy students wrist goniometry.
"The ""La Esperanza"" native mercury mine in Aranzazu, (Caldas, Colombia) was active from 1948 until 1975. Before the final closure of the mine, the company began using dimercaprol (BAL, British Anti-Lewisite) and penicillamine for the treatment of hydrargyrism among workers. Mercury poisoning among miners was frequent due to precarious working conditions, inadequate technology, difficult terrain, and the high toxicity of native mercury within the mine. The costs associated with the treatment was one of the causes of the closure of the mine. The early use of these chelators corresponds to the first systematic use of an antidote in occupational health in Colombia. This paper describes the context in which dimercaprol and penicillamine were used, a milestone in the history of toxicology, medical geology and occupational health in Colombia and Latin America."

"Fluorescein angiography (FA) is a diagnostic method for observing the vascular circulation in the eye. However, it poses a risk to patients. Therefore, generative adversarial networks have been used to convert retinal fundus structure images into FA images. Existing high-resolution image generation methods employ complex deep network models that are challenging to optimize, which leads to issues such as blurred lesion boundaries and poor capture of microleakage and microvessels. In this study, we propose a multiple-ResNet generative adversarial network (GAN) to improve model training, thereby enhancing the ability to generate high-resolution FA images. First, the structure of the multiple-ResNet generator is designed to enhance detail generation in high-resolution images. Second, the Gaussian error linear unit (GELU) activation function is used to help the model converge rapidly. The effectiveness of the multiple-ResNet is verified using the publicly available Isfahan MISP dataset. Experimental results show that our method outperforms other methods, achieving better quantitative results with a mean structural similarity of 0.641, peak signal-to-noise ratio of 18.25, and learned perceptual image patch similarity of 0.272. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, the results showed that using the multiple-ResNet framework and GELU activation function can improve the generation of detailed regions in high-resolution FA images."
"Mollusca represents the second-largest animal phylum but remains less explored genomically. The increase in high-quality genomes and diverse functional genomic data holds great promise for advancing our understanding of molluscan biology and evolution. To address the opportunities and challenges facing the molluscan research community in managing vast multi-omics resources, we developed MolluscDB 2.0 (http://mgbase.qnlm.ac), which integrates extensive functional genomic data and offers user-friendly tools for multilevel integrative and comparative analyses. MolluscDB 2.0 covers 1450 species across all eight molluscan classes and compiles ∼4200 datasets, making it the most comprehensive multi-omics resource for molluscs to date. MolluscDB 2.0 expands the layers of multi-omics data, including genomes, bulk transcriptomes, single-cell transcriptomes, proteomes, epigenomes and metagenomes. MolluscDB 2.0 also more than doubles the number of functional modules and analytical tools, updating 14 original modules and introducing 20 new, specialized modules. Overall, MolluscDB 2.0 provides highly valuable, open-access multi-omics platform for the molluscan research community, expediting scientific discoveries and deepening our understanding of molluscan biology and evolution."
"Gastric cancer (GC) remains a significant cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Despite the transformative impact of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies across various cancers, only a minority of patients with metastatic GC (mGC) benefit, emphasizing the urgent need for precise biomarkers to predict therapeutic responses and optimize patient selection."
"Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by persistent inflammatory responses throughout all stages of its progression. Modulating these inflammatory responses is a promising avenue for the development of cardiovascular disease therapies. Splicing events modulate gene expression and diversify protein functionality, exerting pivotal roles in the inflammatory mechanisms underlying atherosclerosis. These insights may provide novel opportunities for developing anti-inflammatory therapies for this disease. This article systematically discusses the diverse splice variants and how splicing events impact the inflammatory response in atherosclerosis via endothelial cells, macrophages, and vascular smooth muscle cells, highlighting their underlying molecular mechanisms and implications. Furthermore, this study summarizes clinical evidence supporting splicing-related molecules as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets in atherosclerosis. Lastly, we outline the current challenges and future research directions concerning splicing events and inflammatory responses in atherosclerosis. This offers a novel perspective and evidence for formulating new therapeutic strategies aimed at lowering the risk of atherosclerosis."
"Drought-related die-off events have been observed throughout Europe in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.). Such events are exacerbated by carbon starvation that is, an imbalance of photosynthetic productivity and resource usage. Recent evidence suggests that optically measurable photosynthetic pigments such as chlorophylls and carotenoids respond to water stress (WS). However, there is a lack of measurements using imaging spectroscopy, and the mechanisms linking xanthophyll-related changes in reflectance captured by the photochemical reflectance index (PRI) and chlorophyll changes in red edge position (REP) to WS are not understood. To probe this, we conducted a greenhouse experiment where 3-year-old Pinus sylvestris saplings were subjected to water limitation and followed using hyperspectral imaging (HSI) spectroscopy, water status and photosynthetic measurements. Carotenoids (e.g., xanthophyll cycle) and chlorophylls responded to WS, which was observed using the HSI-derived indices PRI and REP respectively. The spatial-temporal response in these two pigment-reflectance groupings differed. The spatial distribution of PRI represented the light intensity around the time of the measurement, whereas REP reflected the daily averaged light intensity over the experimental course. A further difference was noted upon rewatering, where the carotenoid-related PRI partially recovered but the chlorophyll-related REP did not."
"Uniport robotic assisted thoracoscopic surgery (U-RATS) is a recently adopted approach in thoracic surgery and is assumed to require a learning curve for surgeons because of technical difficulties. We aimed to verify the feasibility and safety of solo surgery in U-RATS in an initial series of patients, comparing with initial series of uniport video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (U-VATS)."
"Dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD) is an autosomal dominant disease with parkinsonian and dystonic symptoms caused by GCH1 gene pathogenic variants affecting dopamine synthesis. The present case report is the first to link DRD with childhood-onset with ALS, suggesting that complex inheritance patterns in the North African population may contribute to multiple disorders."
"School-age children with unilateral hearing loss are at an increased risk of exhibiting academic difficulties. Yet, approximately half of children with unilateral hearing loss will not require additional support. There is a dearth of information to assist in determining which of these children will express academic deficits and which will not. The purpose of this study was to identify hearing- and health-related factors that contribute to adverse educational progress in children with permanent unilateral hearing loss. Specific indicators of academic concern identified during school age included the need for specialized academic services, receipt of speech-language therapy, or parent/teacher concerns for academics or speech-language development."
Polatuzumab vedotin is the first antibody-drug conjugate approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

"Antibiotic use for early-onset neonatal sepsis (EONS) is common, but prolonged exposure can lead to poor outcomes. Laboratory capacity and infection prevention initiatives may impact antibiotic use for EONS in neonatal intensive care units. The objective of this study was to examine the influence of institutional capacity on antibiotic prescribing for EONS in India."
Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a common and dose-limiting chemotoxicity caused by oxaliplatin. This study investigated the relationship between dietary quality and the development of moderate and/or severe CIPN in colon cancer survivors using data from the Focus on Reducing Dose-Limiting Toxicities in Colon Cancer with Resistance Exercise trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT03291951).
"SPiReL is a phase II clinical trial evaluating combination immunotherapy, pembrolizumab and cyclophosphamide, with maveropepimut-S, in survivin-expressing relapsed/refractory (R/R) Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL). We describe baseline tumor survivin expression and associations with clinico-pathological variables in 25 participants. The median number of survivin-expressing cells was 99%, and the intensity of survivin expression within tumors was heterogeneous by semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry assessment. Tumors with higher numbers of cells expressing 2+/3+ survivin were associated with characteristics of poor outcome, (Lactate dehydrogenase and cell-of-origin). Greater total baseline tumor area was associated with lower proportions of 1+ cells and greater proportions of 2+/3+ cells. High intensity survivin expression is associated with aggressive clinical features supporting a pathobiological role in R/R DLBCL. Future prognostic models incorporating survivin as a clinical biomarker require assessment of intensity, overall expression and should include potential threshold effects of survivin in DLBCL pathobiology."
"Male-male social interactions exert a substantial impact on the transcriptional regulation of genes associated with aggression and mating behavior in male Drosophila melanogaster. Throughout our comprehensive genetic screening of aggression-related genes, we identified that the majority of mutants for these genes are associated with rival-induced and visually oriented mating behavior, longer-mating duration (LMD). The majority of mutants with upregulated genes in single-housed males significantly altered LMD behavior but not copulation latency, suggesting a primary regulation of mating duration. Single-cell RNA-sequencing revealed that LMD-related genes are predominantly co-expressed with male-specific genes like dsx and Cyp6a20 in specific cell populations, especially in cone cells. Functional validation confirmed the roles of these genes in mediating LMD. Expression of LMD genes like Cyp6a20, Cyp4d21, and CrzR was enriched in cone cells, with disruptions in cone cell-specific expression of CrzR and Cyp4d21 leading to disrupted LMD. We also identified a novel gene, CG10026/Macewindu, that reversed LMD when overexpressed in cone cells. These findings underscore the critical role of cone cells as a pivotal site for the expression of genes involved in the regulation of LMD behavior. This study provides valuable insights into the intricate mechanisms underlying complex sexual behaviors in Drosophila."
"Evodiamine has been a promising lead structure with broad-spectrum antitumor activity. Druggability optimization is the most challenging part of evodiamine-based lead-to-candidate campaign. Amino acids as building blocks for conjugates are widely incorporated into approved drug and drug candidates, demonstrating highly attractive druggability. Herein, a series of evodiamine amino acid conjugates were designed and synthesized based on the evodiamine lead compound (±)-8b discovered in our previous work. The structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies culminated in the identification of a promising conjugate (-)-15h featuring a N-Boc-l-glutamine group and a chiral carbon atom (sinister), which exhibited nanomolar antiproliferative activity against LoVo and RKO colorectal cancer cells. Moreover, (-)-15h could inhibit topoisomerases I, arrest the cell cycle in the G2/M phase, and induce apoptosis. Importantly, (-)-15h (tumor growth inhibition rate was 82.53 % in 40 mpk) showed better efficacy and tolerability to that of parent compound (-)-8b (tumor growth inhibition rate was 51.22 % in 40 mpk) in LoVo xenograft model. Further, (-)-15h (tumor growth inhibition rate was 70.09 % in 40 mpk) showed comparable efficacy and better tolerability to that of topotecan (tumor growth inhibition rate was 70.67 % in 0.5 mpk) in HT-29 xenograft model. Collectively, this study further provided a strong scientific basis for amino acid-based structural modifications and a drug lead for anti-colorectal cancer applications."
"Cultured meat needs edible bio-scaffolds that provide not only a growth milieu for muscle and adipose cells, but also biomimetic stiffness and tissue-sculpting topography. Current meat-engineering technologies struggle to achieve scalable cell production, efficient cell differentiation, and tissue maturation in one single culture system. Here we propose an autoclaving strategy to transform common vegetables into muscle- and adipose-engineering scaffolds, without undergoing conventional plant decellularization. We selected vegetables with natural anisotropic and isotropic topology mimicking muscle and adipose microstructures respectively. We further adjusted vegetable stiffness by autoclaving, to emulate the mechanical properties of animal tissues. Autoclaved vegetables preserve rich cell-affinitive moieties, yielding a good cell culture effect with simplified processing. Autoclaved Chinese chive and Shiitake mushroom with anisotropic micro-patterns support the scalable expansion of muscle cells, improved cell alignment and myogenesis. Autoclaved isotropic loofah encourages adipocyte proliferation and lipid accumulation. Our engineered muscle- and fat-on-vegetables can further construct meat stuffing or layered meat chips. Autoclaved vegetables possess tissue-mimicking stiffness and topology, and bring biochemical benefits, operational ease, cost reduction and bioreactor compatibility. Without needing decellularization, these natural biomaterials may see scale-up applications in meat analog bio-fabrication."
"Antibodies play critical roles in modern medicine, serving as diagnostics and therapeutics for various diseases due to their ability to specifically bind to target antigens. Traditional antibody discovery and optimization methods are time-consuming and resource-intensive, though they have successfully generated antibodies for diagnosing and treating diseases. The advancements in protein data, computational hardware, and machine learning (ML) models have the opportunity to disrupt antibody discovery and optimization research. Machine learning models have demonstrated their abilities in antibody design. These machine learning models enable rapid in silico design of antibody candidates within a few days, achieving approximately a 60% reduction in time and a 50% reduction in cost compared to traditional methods. This review focuses on the latest machine learning-based antibody discovery and optimization developments. We briefly discuss the limitations of traditional methods and then explore the machine learning-based antibody discovery and optimization methodologies. We also focus on future research directions, including developing Antibody Design AI Agents and data foundries, alongside the ethical and regulatory considerations essential for successfully adopting machine learning-driven antibody designs."
"O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) is the most abundant mono-saccharide modification occurring in the cytoplasm, nucleus, and mitochondria. The recent advent of mass spectrometry technology has enabled the identification of abundant O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) substrates in diverse biological processes, such as cell cycle progression, replication, and DNA damage response. Herein we report the O-GlcNAcylation of Replication Protein A2 (RPA2), a component of the heterotrimeric RPA complex pivotal for DNA metabolism. We found that RPA2 interacts with OGT, and a topoisomerase II inhibitor, etoposide, diminishes the association. Using higher-energy collisional dissociation mass spectrometry, we mapped RPA2 O-GlcNAc sites to be Ser-4/Ser-8, which are well-known PIKK-dependent RPA2 phosphorylation sites involved in checkpoint activation upon replication stress. We further demonstrated that Ser-4/Ser-8 O-GlcNAcylation antagonizes phosphorylation and impairs downstream Chk1 activation. Moreover, RPA2 O-GlcNAcylation sustains H2AX phosphorylation upon etoposide treatment and promotes inappropriate cell cycle progression, indicative of checkpoint defects. Our work not only unveils a new OGT substrate, but also underscores the distinct roles of OGT in replication versus replication stress."
"Scientific evaluation of the effectiveness of ecological restoration could provide support for sustainable management and protection of wetlands. However, due to the multiple and difficult to quantify factors affecting wetlands, commonly used spatiotemporal evaluation methods were difficult to scientifically reflect the actual effectiveness of ecological restoration. This paper took Tianjin Qilihai Wetland, a representative wetland in northern China, as the research object. Two representative time points, 2017 (before the start of the 2-year restoration project) and 2023 (4 years after the completion of the restoration project), were selected to construct a three-level monitoring and evaluation index system containing eight specific indicators from three aspects-water environment, biological community, and landscape topography. And then, a model based on fuzzy analytic hierarchy process was developed to systematically evaluate the ecological restoration effect. The evaluation results showed that after implementing a series of measures, the comprehensive evaluation index of wetland ecological environment increased by 37.68%. In addition, it was also found that compared to the water environment, the restoration of the ecosystem had a certain lag. It was recommended to further strengthen the follow-up and continuous monitoring and evaluation, as well as the monitoring and control of the stability of external water source quality. The method and model adopted in this paper further improved the theoretical and methodological system for evaluating the effectiveness of wetland ecological restoration."
"Sleep disorder is a growing public health concern that requires attentive assessment and treatment. However, the length of assessment tools for sleep disorders, including insomnia, hinders their use in both research and clinical settings. Brief assessment measures expedite assessment time, reducing respondent burden, and save resources, especially in resource-limited settings."

"Limb-girdle muscular dystrophies (LGMDs) constitute a diverse group of inherited disorders primarily affecting skeletal muscle. Despite the absence of cures, rehabilitative treatments offer potential for preventing and mitigating loss of muscle strength. However, the role of exercise training in LGMD patients remains contentious. This review aims to provide an overview of the currently available motor rehabilitation strategies for the most common subtypes of LGMD. To identify relevant articles, we performed a systematic search in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science, focusing on muscular and respiratory interventions. The search resulted in 560 potentially relevant articles, of which 16 were included in the review. Eight studies concentrated on neuromuscular functional rehabilitation therapy programs, seven combined both neuromuscular rehabilitation and interventions to maintain or enhance respiratory functionality and one focused on respiratory intervention only. Altogether, the papers examined offered a comprehensive view on the rehabilitative strategies available and provided an indication of the most valuable practices to deal with patients' health and needs. Upon analysis, we conclude that, when tailored to individual needs, muscle training can enhance strength and functional abilities, positively impacting psychological well-being. However, generic protocols may lead to limited benefits, fatigue, pain, and compliance issues. Moreover, early management of respiratory symptoms and personalized respiratory physiotherapy can enhance patients' well-being and their capability to participate in muscle training exercises. Future studies should not only refine rehabilitation approaches but also assess their impact on patients' quality of life, including psychological factors like depression and self-esteem."
"Nutrition interventions commenced in ICU and continued through to hospital discharge have not been definitively tested in critical care to date. To commence a program of research, we aimed to determine if a tailored nutrition intervention delivered for the duration of hospitalisation delivers more energy than usual care to patients initially admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU)."
"The endothelium plays a key role in regulating vascular homeostasis by responding to a large spectrum of chemical and physical stimuli. Vasculitis is a group of inflammatory conditions affecting the vascular bed, and it is known that they are strongly linked to endothelial dysfunction (ED). Kawasaki disease (KD) is one childhood systemic vasculitis, and it represents the leading cause of acquired cardiac disease in children due to coronary damage and subsequent cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality. We aimed to focus on the actual knowledge of ED in the pathogenesis of KD and its practical implications on therapeutical strategies to limit cardiovascular complications. Understanding ED in KD provides insight into the underlying mechanisms and identifies potential therapeutic targets to mitigate vascular damage, ultimately improving cardiovascular outcomes in both the acute and chronic stages of the disease. However, research gaps remain, particularly in translating findings from animal models into clinical applications for cardiovascular lesions and related morbidity in KD patients."

"While tobacco smoking is a risk factor in the development of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), only a fraction of smokers develop the disease. Compelling evidence shows that microbial community composition is associated with carcinogenesis, suggesting that the microbiome may play a role in cancer development of smokers. We previously showed that black raspberry (BRB) protects against OSCC induced by the tobacco constituent dibenzo[def,p]chrysene (DBP) via alteration of genetic and epigenetic markers in a manner consistent with its cancer preventive activity. In the present study, we conducted a mouse experiment to investigate the effects of BRB and DBP individually and in combination on the oral and gut microbiota. DBP-induced DNA damage in the mouse oral cavity is an essential step for the development of OSCC in mice. 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that BRB significantly increased microbial diversity and shifted microbiome composition in the gut and oral cavity, whereas DBP had no significant effect. In both gut and oral microbiota, Akkermansia muciniphila was significantly reduced after BRB treatment; however, this was not consistent with pure culture in vitro assays suggesting that the impact of BRB on A. muciniphila may be mediated through indirect mechanisms including the host or other microbes. Indeed BRB, but not DBP, was found to modulate the growth kinetics of human gut microbes in vitro including lactic acid bacteria and Bacteroides spp. The results of the current study further emphasize the interplay of microbiome and environmental factors in the development and prevention of OSCC. Prevention Relevance: Our work clearly demonstrates the modulatory impact of BRB on both gut and oral microbiomes within a DBP-induced OSCC mouse model and paves the way for future research examining a causal role of BRB-microbiota interactions at different stages of disease progression."

"This study aimed to investigate the role of the MIR210 host gene (MIR210HG), a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), in the proliferation of colon cancer cells and its potential mechanism involving the ferroptosis pathway. We assessed MIR210HG expression in colon cancer cell lines and tissues, and examined the effects of its overexpression and knockdown on cell proliferation. Proteomic analysis was conducted to explore the interaction between MIR210HG and ferroptosis pathway components. The binding of MIR210HG to poly(rC) binding protein 1 (PCBP1) was predicted using catRAPID and confirmed through RNA pull-down and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) experiments. MIR210HG was significantly upregulated in colon cancer cells and tissues. Its overexpression promoted, while its knockdown inhibited, colon cancer cell proliferation. MIR210HG was found to be associated with ferroptosis pathway components and to bind to PCBP1, which was experimentally validated. The inhibition of ferroptosis by MIR210HG through PCBP1 binding was confirmed, highlighting its role in promoting cell proliferation. MIR210HG promotes colon cancer cell proliferation by binding to PCBP1 and inhibiting ferroptosis. These findings suggest MIR210HG as a potential therapeutic target for colon cancer."
This study aims to define the computed tomography (CT) criteria that distinguish extra-gastrointestinal stromal tumors (eGISTs) from intra-abdominal fibromatosis (IAF).
"BACKGROUND Simultaneously occuring diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is extremely rare. Generally, patients with CD20-positive DLBCL receive rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, prednisone (R-CHOP) regimen, while those with HL receive brentuximab vedotin, doxorubicin, vinblastine, dacarbazine (A-AVD) regimen as first-line therapy. Establishing a strategy for treating both lymphoma subtypes concurrently is thus very difficult. We report successful treatment of a patient simultaneously diagnosed with advanced DLBCL and HL. CASE REPORT A 20-year-old man visited the Hematology Department of Kyungpook National University Hospital after the diagnosis of germinal center B-cell DLBCL in the kidney and HL (nodular sclerosis type) in the neck lymph node. His DLBCL was classified as Ann Arbor stage IV with an International Prognostic Index score of 4, a high-risk group. Six cycles of R-CHOP therapy were planned, and central nervous system prophylaxis with intrathecalmethotrexate was added because of the high-risk features of central nervous system involvement. After completing 6 cycles of chemotherapy, without significant adverse events (Deauville score of 1), complete remission was confirmed. Then, the patient decided to undergo consolidative autologous stem cell transplantation (auto-SCT). He received busulfan, cyclophosphamide, and etoposide conditioning regimen, after which auto-SCT was conducted in April 2021. After auto-SCT, the patient was undergoing regular check-ups and doing well, without obvious disease relapse or specific symptoms. He maintained a disease-free status for 40 months to date. CONCLUSIONS Our case showed that R-CHOP regimen was effective not only for DLBCL but also for HL. Notably, consolidative upfront auto-SCT should be considered for a deeper response."

"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a clinically rare, genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous condition characterized by chronic respiratory tract infections, male infertility, tympanitis, and laterality abnormalities. PCD is typically resulted from variants in genes encoding assembly or structural proteins that are indispensable for the movement of motile cilia. Here, we identified a novel nonsense mutation, c.466G>T, in cilia- and flagella-associated protein 300 ( CFAP300 ) resulting in a stop codon (p.Glu156*) through whole-exome sequencing (WES). The proband had a PCD phenotype with laterality defects and immotile sperm flagella displaying a combined loss of the inner dynein arm (IDA) and outer dynein arm (ODA). Bioinformatic programs predicted that the mutation is deleterious. Successful pregnancy was achieved through intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Our results expand the spectrum of CFAP300 variants in PCD and provide reproductive guidance for infertile couples suffering from PCD caused by them."
Photon-counting detector (PCD) technology has the potential to reduce noise in computed tomography (CT). This study aimed to carry out a voxelwise noise characterization for a clinical PCD-CT scanner with a model-based iterative reconstruction algorithm (QIR).
"The introduction of non-native fish species into new environments has raised global concerns due to potential ecological impacts on recipient ecosystems. A previous study focusing on the introduced fish species Arapaima gigas in Bolivian Amazon waters showed that its isotopic niche significantly overlapped with most co-occurring native fish species, suggesting potential competition. To evaluate this hypothesis, we extended here the investigation by comparing the trophic position and isotopic niche width of eleven abundant native fish species inhabiting both colonized and non-colonized floodplain lakes. We found lower trophic positions in colonized versus non-colonized lakes only for native piscivores, mostly driven by a shift towards increased dietary proportion of detritivorous fishes. Conversely, results showed that the isotopic niche width of most fish species analyzed (i.e. 10 over 11 species) did not significantly decrease in colonized compared to non-colonized lakes. Our overall results suggest potentially low competitive interactions between A. gigas and native fishes, with the notable exception of piscivorous species. We attribute our findings to the high abundance of available resources in Amazon oxbow lakes."
"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) frequently results in compromised visual function, with hyperglycemia-induced disruption of the blood-retinal barrier (BRB) through various pathways as a critical mechanism. Existing DR treatments fail to address early and potentially reversible microvascular alterations. This study examined the effects of empagliflozin (EMPA), a selective Sodium-glucose transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, on the retina of db/db mice. The objective of this study is to investigate the potential role of EMPA in the prevention and delay of DR."
"In Iran, the assessment of osteoporosis through tools like dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry poses significant challenges due to their high costs and limited availability, particularly in small cities and rural areas. Our objective was to employ a variety of machine learning (ML) techniques to evaluate the accuracy and precision of each method, with the aim of identifying the most accurate pattern for diagnosing the osteoporosis risks."
"Ischemic stroke (IS), a major cause of mortality and disability worldwide, remains a significant healthcare challenge due to limited therapeutic options. Ferroptosis, a distinct iron-dependent form of regulated cell death characterized by lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress, has emerged as a crucial mechanism in IS pathophysiology. This review explores the role of ferroptosis in IS and its potential for driving innovative therapeutic strategies."
"Elucidating the neural mechanisms governing changes in individual animal behavior is a key goal in neuroscience. Such research has important implications for behavioral pharmacology and could lead to the development of treatments for psychiatric and neurological disorders. Given that the brain likely represents vast amounts of information through the combined activity of multiple neurons, studying these mechanisms requires the simultaneous recording of many neurons. Recent years have seen significant advancements in techniques for multi-cellular activity recording. Calcium imaging utilizing fluorescent sensors has emerged as a powerful method, enabling the concurrent acquisition of spatial arrangements and temporal activity changes in neuronal populations. This article focuses on deep brain imaging using GRIN lenses, particularly deep brain calcium imaging in freely behaving animals with miniaturized head-mounted microscopes. We compare the strengths and limitations of this approach to other calcium imaging methods, electrophysiological techniques, and fiber photometry. Finally, we discuss future developments in this field, including two-photon microscopy for imaging beyond cell bodies, membrane potential imaging using voltage sensors, and single-cell resolution manipulation of neural activity by integrating spatial light modulators and electrically tunable lenses."
"Bacteria-based tumor therapy, which releases therapeutic payloads or remodels the tumor's immune-suppressive microenvironment and directly kills tumor cells or initiates an anti-tumor immune response, is recently recognized as a promising strategy. Bacteria could be endowed with the capacities of tumor targeting, tumor cell killing, and anti-tumor immune activating by established gene engineering. Furthermore, the integration of synthetic biology and nanomedicine into these engineered bacteria could further enhance their efficacy and controllability. This comprehensive review systematically elucidates the classification and mechanisms of bacterial gene expression induction systems, as well as strategies for constructing bacterial-nanomaterial nanobiohybrids. The review concludes by highlighting the challenges associated with quality control and regulation of bacteria-based tumor therapy while also providing insights into the future prospects of this therapeutic technology. KEY POINTS: • A comprehensive overview of the current status of research on bacteria-based tumor therapy. • The classification and mechanisms of bacterial gene expression induction systems are summarized. • The challenges and perspectives in clinical translation."
"Neonatal hypoxia (Hx) causes white matter (WM) injury, particularly in the cerebellum. We previously demonstrated that Hx-induced reduction of cerebellar Purkinje cell (PC) activity results in locomotor deficits. Yet, the mechanism of Hx-induced cerebellar WM injury and associated locomotor abnormalities remains undetermined. Here, we show that the cerebellar WM injury and linked locomotor deficits are driven by PC activity and are reversed when PC activity is restored. Using optogenetics and multielectrode array recordings, we manipulated PC activity and captured the resulting cellular responses in WM oligodendrocyte precursor cells and GABAergic interneurons. To emulate the effects of Hx, we used light-activated halorhodopsin targeted specifically to the PC layer of normal mice. Suppression of PC firing activity at P13 and P21 phenocopied the locomotor deficits observed in Hx. Moreover, histopathologic analysis of the developing cerebellar WM following PC inhibition (P21) revealed a corresponding reduction in oligodendrocyte maturation and myelination, akin to our findings in Hx mice. Conversely, PC stimulation restored PC activity, promoted oligodendrocyte maturation, and enhanced myelination, resulting in reversed Hx-induced locomotor deficits. Our findings highlight the crucial role of PC activity in cerebellar WM development and locomotor performance following neonatal injury."
"Medicare (MCR) reimbursement for arthroplasty procedures has been declining, but little has been reported on Medicaid (MCD) reimbursement. We sought to determine MCD reimbursement rates using state MCD data for nine arthroplasty procedure codes and compare them to MCR rates."
"Nursing interventions play a critical role in enhancing the quality of life (QoL) and therapeutic outcomes for cervical cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. However, variations in nursing interventions and patient results require a meta-analysis to consolidate evidence on the most effective nursing approaches. This meta-analysis assessed how nursing care interventions influence QoL, adherence to chemotherapy, and the management of symptoms in cervical cancer patients. An extensive search through PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases yielded 17 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that met the eligibility requirements. The findings revealed that nursing interventions significantly boosted QoL (OR = 1.28, 95% CI: 1.10 to 1.49), increased adherence to chemotherapy protocols (OR = 1.35, 95% CI: 1.15 to 1.60), and alleviated chemotherapy-induced symptoms like fatigue and nausea (OR = 1.42, 95% CI: 1.20 to 1.67). Funnel plots showed minimal publication bias in the studies analyzed. We conclude that nursing interventions significantly enhance QoL, treatment adherence, and symptom control for cervical cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy."
"The study aimed to investigate oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMDs) diagnosed in an Oral Pathology service in southern Brazil over a span of 56 years and to assess the factors influencing their severity and outcomes. A retrospective analysis of histopathological records from 1965 to 2021 was performed. Lesions diagnosed as leukoplakia, erythroplakia, leukoerythroplakia, or actinic cheilitis were included. Data on age, sex, race, tobacco smoking, alcohol drinking, clinical characteristics, biopsy type, and histopathological diagnosis were collected. Among 32.698 histopathological reports, 2.10% were classified as OPMD. The study included 689 specimens from 602 patients, with a predominance of cases affecting men aged over 51 years, particularly in anatomical sites considered of low risk. White lesions, with leukoplakia as the most common clinical diagnosis were observed. Over time, there was an increase in the incidence of OPMDs among females and in high-risk anatomical sites. The mean follow-up period was 30.28 ± 29.86 months, during which 9.6% of cases exhibited malignant transformation. Lesions diagnosed as leukoerythroplakia and those presenting epithelial dysplasia exhibited a higher risk of malignant transformation, particularly when located in high-risk sites. This underscores the importance of identifying clinical and microscopic features, as well as lesion's anatomical location, as crucial factors in determining the risk of malignant transformation. These findings provide valuable insights for clinicians managing OPMDs and contribute to the improvement of oral cancer prevention."
The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the dual efficacy of tocilizumab (TCZ) in the treatment of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-associated arthritis (ICI-AR) and the prevention of relapses after rechallenge.
"The global increase in cancer cases and mortality has been associated with inflammatory processes, in which chemokines play crucial roles. These molecules, a subfamily of cytokines, are essential for the migration, adhesion, interaction, and positioning of immune cells throughout the body. Chemokines primarily originate in response to pathogenic stimuli and inflammatory cytokines. They are expressed by lymphocytes in the bloodstream and are divided into four classes (CC, CXC, XC, and CX3C), playing multifaceted roles in the tumor environment (TME). In the TME, chemokines regulate immune behavior by recruiting cells such as tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), which promote tumor survival. Additionally, they directly influence tumor behavior, promoting pathological angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis. On the other hand, chemokines can also induce antitumor responses by mobilizing CD8+ T cells and natural killer (NK) cells to the tumor, reducing pro-inflammatory chemokines and enhancing essential antitumor responses. Given the complex interaction between chemokines, the immune system, angiogenic factors, and metastasis, it becomes evident how important it is to target these pathways in therapeutic interventions to counteract cancer progression. In this context, physical exercise emerges as a promising strategy due to its role modulating the expression of anti-inflammatory chemokines and enhancing the antitumor response. Aerobic and resistance exercises have been associated with a beneficial inflammatory profile in cancer, increased infiltration of CD8+ T cells in the TME, and improvement of intratumoral vasculature. This creates an environment less favorable to tumor growth and supports the circulation of antitumor immune cells and chemokines. Therefore, understanding the impact of exercise on the expression of chemokines can provide valuable insights for therapeutic interventions in cancer treatment and prevention."
"Biodegradable controlled delivery systems for mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have emerged as novel advancements in the field of regenerative medicine, particularly for accelerating bone fracture healing. This detailed study emphasizes the importance of quick and adequate fracture treatment and the limitations of existing methods. New approaches employing biodegradable scaffolds can be placed within a fracture to serve as a mechanical support and allow controlled release of in situ MSCs and bioactive agents. They are made up of polymers and composites which degrade over time, aiding in natural tissue regrowth. The fabrication methods, including 3D printing, electrospinning, and solvent casting, with particulate leaching that enable precise control over scaffold architecture and properties, are discussed. Progress in controlled drug delivery systems including encapsulation techniques and release kinetics is described, highlighting the potential of such strategies to maintain therapeutic benefits over a prolonged time as well as improving outcomes for fracture repair. MSCs play a role in bone regeneration through differentiation using biodegradable scaffolds, paracrine effects, and regulation of inflammation focusing on fracture healing. Current trends and future directions in scaffold technology and MSC delivery, including smart scaffolds with growth factor incorporation and innovative delivery approaches for fracture healing are also discussed."
"Tumors in boars are uncommon, and testicular tumors even rarer. This study describes the pathological and immunohistochemical characteristics of a case series of testicular tumors in commercial boars with fertility problems. Tumors were detected in 19 of 333 animals (19/333, 5.9%). Macroscopically, tumors were observed in 13 (13/19, 68%) boars, while 6 cases (6/19, 32%) were only detected by microscopic examination. Testicular enlargement was observed in 1 boar, while in the others, tumors were only observed after removal of the scrotal skin or after sectioning of the testis. Histologically, tumors were classified as seminomas (16/19, 84%), mixed germ cell-stromal tumors (2/19, 11%), and B-cell lymphoma (1/19, 5%). Seminomas had 3 different growth patterns: intratubular (6/16, 38%), diffuse (4/16, 25%), and intratubular/diffuse (6/16, 38%). All tumors that were not evident on macroscopic examination were intratubular seminomas. Intratesticular metastases were observed in 2 cases and extratesticular metastases, located in the pampiniform plexus, were observed in 1 case. In 1 seminoma, the rete testis was also involved. By immunohistochemistry, all intratubular seminomas were negative for c-kit, cytokeratin, and vimentin. In diffuse seminomas, c-kit and cytokeratin were also negative, while vimentin showed granular or perinuclear cytoplasmic labeling in some areas. PAX-5 and CD-3 antibodies classified the lymphoma as a B-cell lymphoma. This study suggests that testicular tumors in boars may be more common than previously reported, especially when microscopic examination is performed. It also shows that testicular tumors in pigs are predominantly seminomas."
"Given the negative impact of breast cancer and its treatment on women's self-efficacy in various areas, including sexual function, investigating and understanding ways to enhance sexual function is crucial. The current study aimed to examine the impact of sexual counseling and education based on self-efficacy theory on the sexual function of women with breast cancer."
"The cytokine storm associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection is one of the most distinctive pathological signatures in COVID-19 patients. Macrophages respond to this pro-inflammatory challenge by reprogramming their functional and metabolic phenotypes. Interestingly, human macrophages fail to express the inducible form of the NO synthase (NOS2) in response to pro-inflammatory activation and, therefore, NO is not synthesized by these cells. The contribution of exogenously added NO, via a chemical NO-donor, on the immunometabolic changes associated with the cytokine storm is investigated. By using metabolic, transcriptomic, and functional assays the effect of NO in human macrophages is evaluated and found specific responses. Moreover, through integrative fluxomic analysis, pathways modified by NO that contribute to the expression of a particular phenotype in human macrophages are identified, which includes a decrease in mitochondrial respiration and TCA with a slight increase in the glycolytic flux. A significant ROS increase and preserved cell viability are observed in the presence of NO, which may ease the inflammatory response and host defense. Also, NO reverses the cytokine storm-induced itaconate accumulation. These changes offer additional clues to understanding the potential crosstalk between NO and the COVID-19 cytokine storm-dependent signaling pathways."

"Patients with rectal cancer often experience adverse effects on urinary, sexual, and digestive functions. Despite recognised impacts and available treatments, they are not fully integrated into follow-up protocols, thereby hindering appropriate interventions. The aim of the study was to discern the activities conducted in our routine clinical practice outside of clinical trials."
"Wrist arthroscopy is considered the gold standard for diagnosis of intra-articular wrist conditions including triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tears; however, the ability to reliably diagnose TFCC pathology during wrist arthroscopy is unclear. The purpose of this study was to assess the reliability of the diagnosis of TFCC tears on wrist arthroscopy videos."
"Natural extracts as biostimulants have the potential to enhance the productivity and growth of many medicinal and aromatic plants. This study aimed to enhance the growth, and essential oil (EO) content, as well as composition of Lavandula latifolia Medik. by using Malva parviflora L. extract (ME) as a biostimulant in combination with humic acid (HA) in a field experiment in two successive seasons of 2022 and 2023. The phenolic, flavonoid and water-soluble vitamins of the ME were analyzed using an HPLC. The protein amino acids of the ME were identified by an amino acid analyzer. The prepared concentrations of HA (0, 1, 2, and 4 g/L) were applied to the soil. While, they for ME (0, 2, 4, and 6 g/L) were added as a foliar spray. The EO compositions collected from the leaves of the treated L. latifolia plants were subjected to the hydro-distillation method and analyzed using GC-MS. The most prevalent vitamins found in ME were vitamin B12, vitamin C, and folic acid. Besides, several phenolic compounds were found in ME, such as catechol, cinnamic acid and syringic acid, while flavonoid chemicals, such as luteolin and quercetin. Also, alanine, ammonia, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, glycine, and tyrosine were the ME's most prominent nitrogenous and amino acid components. The most effective treatments of HA and ME on the plant height, the number of branches/plant, and plant fresh weight were 4 + 6 g/L and 4 + 2 g/L for leaf area and chlorophyll content, it was 4 + 4 g/L; and for EO percentage were 4 + 0 g/L, 2 + 0 g/L, and 4 + 4 g/L, compared to the control treatment for each characteristic. The main EO compounds eucalyptol, camphor, α-pinene, β-pinene, Δ-elemene, germacrene D-4-ol, isoborneol, β-caryophyllene oxide, and tau.-cadinol identified in the leaves were found in the range of 28.74-46.19%, 15.34-30.49%, 3.39-7.16%, 0-5.08%, 0-5.18%, 0-3.20%, 0-3.31% and 0-3.40%, respectively. It can be concluded that a combination treatment of HA and ME as natural biostimulant compounds at 4 + 4 g/L could be recommended for good plant growth, and EO quantity of L. latifolia plants."
"We engineered a microfluidic platform to study the effects of bioactive glass nanoparticles (BGNs) on cell viability under static culture. We incorporated different concentrations of BGNs (1%, 2%, and 3% w/v) in collagen hydrogel (with a concentration of 3.0 mg/mL). The microfluidic chip's dimensions were optimized through fluid flow and mass transfer simulations. Collagen type I extracted from rat tail tendons was used as the main material, and BGNs synthesized by the sol-gel method were used to enhance the mechanical properties of the hydrogel. The extracted collagen was characterized using FTIR and SDS-PAGE, and BGNs were analyzed using XRD, FTIR, DLS, and FE-SEM/EDX. The structure of the collagen-BGNs hydrogels was examined using SEM, and their mechanical properties were determined using rheological analysis. The cytotoxicity of BGNs was assessed using the MTT assay, and the viability of fibroblast (L929) cells encapsulated in the collagen-BGNs hydrogel inside the microfluidic device was assessed using a live/dead assay. Based on all these test results, the L929 cells showed high cell viability in vitro and promising microenvironment mimicry in a microfluidic device. Collagen3-BGNs3 (Collagen 3 mg/mL + BGNs 3% (w/v)) was chosen as the most suitable sample for further research on a microfluidic platform."
"In recent decades, technological advances have been made in the field of radiotherapy and with it the emergence of new dosimetric systems for their calibration and commissioning, among other uses. Such is the case of the measurement in the build-up region, where there is no charged-particle equilibrium, which is reflected in the increase in surface dose for patient treatments and potential skin toxicities as a secondary effect. This study utilizes optically stimulated dosemeters (nanoDot) and the radiochromic film (EBT3) to measure skin doses in patients with head and neck cancer who received radiotherapy. Accurately depicting 15 patients with different diagnoses from 3 linear accelerators using 3D, intensity modulated radiation therapy, or volumetric arc therapy/RapidArc technology, these results were compared with those calculated in the treatment planning system (TPS) and obtaining a percentage of variation for the EBT3 ranged from 0.30% to 6.15%, while that observed for the nanoDot was from 0.51% to 4.88%. This difference may be attributed to the reproducibility of placement in patients. Therefore, for clinical use, nanoDot dosemeters are a viable alternative for in vivo dosimetry where rapid validation of planning system results is required."
"Aristolochic acids (AAs) have been identified as a significant risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Ferroptosis is a type of regulated cell death involved in the tumor development. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms by which AAs enhanced the growth of HCC. By conducting bioinformatics and RNA-Seq analyses, we found that AAs were closely correlated with ferroptosis. The physical interaction between p53 and AAs in HepG2 cells was validated by bioinformatics analysis and SPR assays with the binding pocket sites containing Pro92, Arg174, Asp207, Phe212, and His214 of p53. Based on the binding pocket that interacts with AAs, we designed a mutant and performed RNA-Seq profiling. Interestingly, we found that the binding pocket was responsible for ferroptosis, GADD45A, NRF2, and SLC7A11. Functionally, the interaction disturbed the binding of p53 to the promoter of GADD45A or NRF2, attenuating the role of p53 in enhancing GADD45A and suppressing NRF2; the mutant did not exhibit the same effects. Consequently, this event down-regulated GADD45A and up-regulated NRF2, ultimately inhibiting ferroptosis, suggesting that AAs hijacked p53 to down-regulate GADD45A and up-regulate NRF2 in HepG2 cells. Thus, AAs treatment resulted in the inhibition of ferroptosis via the p53/GADD45A/NRF2/SLC7A11 axis, which led to the enhancement of tumor growth. In conclusion, AAs-hijacked p53 restrains ferroptosis through the GADD45A/NRF2/SLC7A11 axis to enhance tumor growth. Our findings provide an underlying mechanism by which AAs enhance HCC and new insights into p53 in liver cancer. Therapeutically, the oncogene NRF2 is a promising target for liver cancer."
"The sun is one of the primary natural sources of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) and a known human carcinogen. It has been related to melanoma and several skin cancers, such as squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma. Non-melanoma skin cancers are prevalent in South Africa, with high reported incidence rates in both genders. Due to its diversified population, South Africa experiences extreme ultraviolet index (UVI) levels, reaching 13 in the summer (a UVI of 11+ is considered extreme). Most summer workdays expose outdoor workers to repeated UVR exposure, which can lead to health risks like sunburn, premature ageing, cataracts, and an increased risk of skin cancer. This study aims to evaluate UV radiation exposure among outdoor military workers."
"Cardiac computed tomography (CT) exams are some of the most complex CT exams due to the need to carefully time the scan when the heart chambers are near the peak contrast concentration. With current ""bolus tracking"" and ""timing bolus"" techniques, after contrast medium is injected, a target vessel or chamber is scanned periodically, and images are reconstructed to monitor the opacification. Both techniques have opportunities for improvement, such as reducing the contrast medium volume, the exam time, the number of manual steps, and improving the robustness of correctly timing the peak opacification."
"Cataracts are diseases characterized by the opacity of the ocular lens and the subsequent deterioration of vision. Metal ions are one of the factors that have been reported to induce crystallin aggregation. For HγS crystallin, several equivalent ratios of Cu(II) promote protein aggregation. However, reports on zinc are contradictory. To characterize the process of metal ion binding and subsequent HγS crystallin aggregation, we performed dynamic light scattering, turbidimetry, isothermal titration calorimetry, fluorescence, and nuclear magnetic resonance experiments. The data show that both metal ions have multiple binding sites and promote aggregation. Zinc interacts mainly with the N-terminal domain, inducing small conformational changes, while copper interacts with both domains and induces unfolding, exposing the tryptophan residues to the solvent. Our work provides insight into the mechanisms of metal-induced aggregation at one of the lowest doses that appreciably promote aggregation over time."
Occupational heat-related illness (OHI) is a health threat to workers that can be fatal in severe cases. Effective and feasible measures are urgently needed to prevent OHI.
"A protein subunit vaccine comprising conserved surface-exposed outer membrane proteins (SE-OMPs) is considered a promising platform for leptospirosis vaccine. The search for novel vaccine candidates that confer high protective efficacy against leptospirosis is ongoing. The LIP3228 protein was previously identified as a conserved and abundant SE-OMP with the potential to serve as an effective vaccine candidate. However, it is crucial to explore the immunological properties of this vaccine antigen before proceeding with animal experiments. This study aimed to assess the immunological characteristics of LIP3228 through in silico prediction and to validate its immunogenicity and protective efficacy in a hamster model of acute leptospirosis. The LIP3228 vaccine candidate was predicted in silico to be immunogenic, with strong binding B-cell and T-cell epitopes. In the immune simulator, it demonstrated stable interactions with Toll-like receptors 2 (TLR2) and 4 (TLR4) and induced immune responses, potentially stimulating host immune responses in vivo. The animal experiment showed that immunization with recombinant LIP3228 protein, formulated with AddaVax adjuvant, induced high and specific IgG responses in hamsters, with IgG2 being the predominant subclass. Although no significant improvement in survival was observed compared to the negative control after a homologous challenge with virulent leptospires, the vaccinated hamsters showed a reduction in histopathological changes and severity of lesions in target organs compared to unvaccinated hamsters. These results suggest that the immunoinformatic prediction is effective in predicting immunogenicity but not protective efficacy. Therefore, LIP3228 could be considered a potential vaccine candidate for mitigating severe tissue damage. These findings may have significant implications for the development of subunit vaccines in the future."

"Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a major cause of preventable blindness in preterm infants. The association between red blood cell (RBC) parameters and the development of ROP remains unclear. The objectives of the present study were to evaluate the association between RBC parameters and ROP treatment. This single-center, retrospective cohort study included preterm infants born at < 30 weeks of gestation. Data pertaining to RBC parameters and ROP treatment were obtained from the medical records. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to determine the cut-off values of the RBC parameters according to the need for ROP treatment. Multiple logistic regression analyses assessed the association between ROP treatment and RBC parameters at birth and on day of life (DOL) 28. We included 202 infants, and 44.1% were treated for ROP. After adjusting for confounders, we observed associations between ROP treatment and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) values > 117.3 fL at birth (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]:2.3; 95% confidence intervals CI 1.0-5.3). Additionally, on DOL 28, hemoglobin (Hb) values < 9.9 g/dL (aOR:3.0; 95% CI 1.4-6.7), hematocrit (Hct) values < 31.0% (aOR:2.7; 95% CI 1.3-5.6), and red cell distribution width (RDW) values > 18.5% (aOR:2.6; 95% CI 1.1-6.2) were associated with ROP treatment. In conclusion, our study indicated that infants born at < 30 weeks of gestation with an MCV > 117.3 fL at birth, along with Hb < 9.9 g/dL, Hct < 31.0%, and RDW > 18.5% on DOL 28, had an increased risk of requiring ROP, warranting treatment."
"The COVID-19 pandemic has created unprecedented levels of stress and anxiety, which has a profound effect on sleep quality. However, limited data are available on the sleep quality of medical residents who work directly with patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.

"The inappropriate use of antibiotics increases the costs of treatment, antibiotic resistance, increased disease length and duration of hospital stay."
"Despite significant advances in HIV treatment, a definitive cure remains elusive. The first-in-human clinical trial of Excision BioTherapeutics' CRISPR-based HIV cure, EBT-101, demonstrated safety but failed to prevent viral rebound. These outcomes may result from the interplay of several factors. Growing evidence indicates that intricate epigenetic modifications play a major role in the persistence of HIV latency, presenting a significant barrier to eradication efforts and causing viral rebound after ART discontinuation. Current strategies to purge the latent reservoir involve LRAs that reactivate latent proviruses. However, their clinical success is hindered by the heterogeneity of HIV reservoirs and the virus's diverse pathways. Additionally, RNA modifications like N6-methyladenosine (m^6 A) methylation influence HIV biology beyond transcriptional control, affect RNA stability, splicing, and translation, which could enhance therapeutic efficacy. The regulatory framework of chromatin dynamics is also key to understanding viral latency and reactivation, such as Vpr's role in reactivating latent HIV by targeting HDACs. Sex-specific factors were also shown to play an important role with females, showing stronger early immune responses and higher representation among elite controllers. This review addresses the multifaceted challenges of HIV cure research, focusing on genetic diversity, epigenetic regulation, RNA modifications, chromatin remodeling, and sex-specific factors. By integrating insights into these aspects, this paper aims to advance our understanding of HIV cure strategies and highlight directions for future research."
"Proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) is an emerging therapeutic technology that leverages the ubiquitin-proteasome system to target protein degradation. Due to its event-driven mechanistic characteristics, PROTAC has the potential to regulate traditionally non-druggable targets. Recently, AI-aided drug design has accelerated the development of PROTAC drugs. However, the rational design of PROTACs remains a considerable challenge. Here, we present an updated online database, PROTAC-DB 3.0. In this third version, we have expanded the database to include 6111 PROTACs (87% increase compared to the 2.0 version). Additionally, the database now contains 569 warheads (small molecules targeting the protein), 2753 linkers, and 107 E3 ligands (small molecules recruiting E3 ligases). The number of target-PROTAC-E3 ternary complex structures has also increased to 959. Recognizing the importance of druggability in PROTAC design, we have incorporated pharmacokinetic data to PROTAC-DB 3.0. To enhance user experience, we have added features for sorting based on molecular similarity and literature publication date. PROTAC-DB 3.0 is accessible at http://cadd.zju.edu.cn/protacdb/."
"To fabricate electroactive fibrous membranes and provide simulated bioelectric micro-environment for bone regeneration mimicking nature periosteum, a series of electroactive polyurethanes (PUAT) were synthesized using amino-capped aniline trimers (AT) and lysine derivatives as chain extenders. These PUAT were fabricated into fibrous membranes as guided bone tissue regeneration membranes (GBRMs) via electrospinning. The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry (CV) of PUAT copolymers showed that the electroactive PUAT fibrous membranes had good electroactivity. Besides, the introduction of AT significantly improved the hydrophobicity and thermal stability of PUAT fibrous membranes and decreased the degradation rate of PUAT fibers in vitro. With the increasing content of AT incorporated into copolymers, the tensile strength and Young's modulus of PUAT fibrous membranes increased from 4 MPa (PUAT0) to 15 MPa (PUAT10) and from 2.1 MPa (PUAT0) to 18 MPa (PUAT10), respectively. The cell morphology and proliferation of rat mesenchymal stem cells (rMSCs) on PUAT fibers indicated that the incorporation of AT enhanced the cell attachment and proliferation. Moreover, the expression levels of OCN, CD31, and VEGF secreted by rMSCs on PUAT fibers increased with the increasing content of AT. In conclusion, an electroactive polyurethane fibrous membrane mimicking natural periosteum was prepared via electrospinning and showed good potential application in guiding bone tissue regeneration."

"The efficacy of elotuzumab, an anti-SLAMF7 monoclonal antibody, in treating relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) and newly-diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) has varied in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Moreover, there is limited data on its real-world application."
"The ability of cells to sense and respond to mechanical forces is crucial for navigating their environment and interacting with neighboring cells. Myosin II and cortexillin I form complexes known as contractility kits (CKs) in the cytosol, which facilitate a cytoskeletal response by accumulating locally at the site of inflicted stress. Here, we present a computational model for mechanoresponsiveness in Dictyostelium, analyzing the role of CKs within the mechanoresponsive mechanism grounded in experimentally measured parameters. Our model further elaborates on the established distributions and channeling of contractile proteins before and after mechanical force application. We rigorously validate our computational findings by comparing the responses of wild-type cells, null mutants, overexpression mutants, and cells deficient in CK formation to mechanical stresses. Parallel in vivo experiments measuring myosin II cortical distributions at equilibrium provide additional validation. Our results highlight the essential functions of CKs in cellular mechanosensitivity and suggest new insights into the regulatory dynamics of mechanoresponsiveness."
Microbial threats pose a growing concern worldwide. This paper reports the analysis of Iran's policy process against microbial threats.
We evaluated the accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) computed tomography (CT)-like sequences compared to normal-resolution CT (NR-CT) and super-high-resolution CT (SHR-CT) for planning of cochlear implantation.
"Bacterial infections have historically posed significant challenges until the discovery of antibiotics, which revolutionized infectious disease treatment. However, bacterial adaptation mechanisms over time have led to increased antimicrobial resistance, necessitating judicious antibiotic use."
"The Clusters of Orthologous Genes (COG) database, originally created in 1997, has been updated to reflect the constantly growing collection of completely sequenced prokaryotic genomes. This update increased the genome coverage from 1309 to 2296 species, including 2103 bacteria and 193 archaea, in most cases, with a single representative genome per genus. This set covers all genera of bacteria and archaea that included organisms with 'complete genomes' as per NCBI databases in November 2023. The number of COGs has been expanded from 4877 to 4981, primarily by including protein families involved in bacterial protein secretion. Accordingly, COG pathways and functional groups now include secretion systems of types II through X, as well as Flp/Tad and type IV pili. These groupings allow straightforward identification and examination of the prokaryotic lineages that encompass-or lack-a particular secretion system. Other developments include improved annotations for the rRNA and tRNA modification proteins, multi-domain signal transduction proteins, and some previously uncharacterized protein families. The new version of COGs is available at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/COG, as well as on the NCBI FTP site https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/COG/, which also provides archived data from previous COG releases."
"Ultra-processed foods (UPFs) have become popular in recent years, however, the detrimental effects of their excessive consumption have also become evident. Acrylamide (AA), a processing hazard present in UPFs, can further aggravate the harmful effects of UPFs. AA can cause significant damage to both the intestinal barrier and gut microbiota, thereby affecting the nervous system through the microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis. Natural polysaccharides have demonstrated the capacity to significantly alleviate the oxidative stress and inflammatory response associated with AA exposure. In addition, they exhibit neuroprotective properties that may be mediated through the MGB axis. This paper reviews literature on the presence of AA in certain UPFs and its potential to inflict serious harm on the human gut microbiota and brain. Moreover, the possibility of utilizing polysaccharides as a preventative measure against AA-induced neurotoxicity was also proposed. These findings provide new insights into the safety risks associated with the overconsumption of UPFs and highlight the potential of polysaccharides to counteract the neurodegeneration induced by AA."
"Recent cohort studies suggest a potential association between atopic dermatitis and dementia, though the evidence remains conflicting. This study aims to elucidate the association between atopic dermatitis and dementia employing systematic review, meta-analysis, and Mendelian randomization (MR). A comprehensive search was performed to select eligible cohort studies using Medline, Embase, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and the Web of Science database. In MR analysis, genomic data from the Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) (864,982 European individuals) for atopic dermatitis cases and dementia cases were obtained from the MRBase. Statistical analyses included the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method, sensitivity tests, and MR-PRESSO for outliers. The adjustment accounted for various factors, including sex, age, smoking status, and other medical comorbidities, along with several additional variables. In the systematic review and meta-analysis, 5 longitudinal cohort studies (12,576,235 participants) indicated a significant association between atopic dermatitis and all-cause dementia (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.15, 95% CI: 1.07-1.23). Subgroup analyses revealed an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.18 (95% CI: 1.08-1.27) for Alzheimer's disease in patients with atopic dermatitis, and an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.37 (95% CI: 1.21-1.55) for all-cause dementia in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. However, MR analysis showed no significant causal link between atopic dermatitis and dementia, Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, or cognitive performance. While the meta-analysis revealed a significant association, MR analysis did not substantiate a significant causal link. Future research should consider demographic variables and medication influences in unravelling the intricate atopic dermatitis-dementia interplay."
"Marine protected areas (MPAs) are an important tool in helping to protect biodiversity in the oceans. Recent ratification of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) has ensured that globally we are committed to effectively protecting 30% of the world's oceans by 2030, in MPAs. In Australia there is considerable interest in the potential benefits that partially protected areas (PPAs) may provide. However, a consistent definition of a PPA is currently lacking, and urgently needed to conduct quantitative analyses of PPAs. We conducted a systematic literature review to understand the current knowledge surrounding PPAs and their potential benefits. We define a PPA, characterise PPA implementation in Australia, and present results for the outcomes of PPAs in terms of ecological, economic, and social indicators. Our review suggests that although 45% of Australia's marine environment is within MPAs, 61% of MPAs provide only partial protection. The Northern Territory (100%), New South Wales (81%), and Queensland (79.8%) have the highest percentage of MPAs that are partially protected, compared to Tasmania which has the smallest percentage of partially protected MPAs (13.12%). Tasmania also has the smallest percentage cover of MPAs (6.49% state waters). Most PPA management plans did not contain quantifiable Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to be able to effectively monitor the progress of these PPAs against the stated outcomes. We find the benefits of PPAs to be ambiguous: PPAs generally provide benefits when compared to 'open' ocean, however this is not a consistent result. There are no PPAs that provide greater overall benefits when compared to fully protected MPAs. Only one state (South Australia) and the Commonwealth (Australian Marine Parks) are collecting publicly available baseline data to facilitate quantitative monitoring of PPAs. Contrary to fisheries management, there were no plans of action if the declared MPAs and PPAs failed to meet their declared objectives and goals. Some PPAs within Australia appear to be incompatible with conservation priorities according to the recent ""MPA Guide"" classification framework. This study highlights the need for clearer management rationale and plans for PPAs in Australia, as these comprise the majority of MPAs in Australia's Exclusive Economic Zone."
"The role of the complement system in antibody mediated rejection (AMR) emerged in the last decades, and the demonstration of the presence of complement fragments in renal allograft biopsies is a consolidated diagnostic sign of AMR. However, antibodies against donor antigens may lead to microvascular inflammation and endothelial injury even in the absence of complement activation, and growing evidence suggests that complement-independent mechanisms may be prominent in late (i.e., occurring >6 months after transplantation) vs early AMR. Different donor specific antibodies (DSA) with different biological features and complement activation ability may be involved in late or early AMR. Downregulation of tissue complement inhibitors may happen early after transplantation, partially due to ischemia reperfusion injury, and could facilitate complement activation in early vs late AMR. Clinical and histological features of late AMR and C4d negative AMR seem to converge, and this narrative review analyzes the evidence that supports lower complement activation in late vs early AMR, including differential C4d staining prevalence based on the time after transplantation, differential response to anti-complement therapy and other direct and indirect signs of the complement system activation. The therapeutic approach in early vs late AMR should take into account possible differences in the pathophysiological mechanisms of microvascular inflammation and endothelial injury in early vs late AMR."
"The transport of drugs into tumor cells near the center of the tumor is known to be severely hindered due to the high interstitial pressure and poor vascularization. The aim of this work is to investigate the possibility to induce acoustic streaming in a tumor. Two tumor cases (breast and abdomen) are simulated to find the acoustic streaming and temperature rise, while varying the focused ultrasound transducer radius, frequency, and power for a constant duty cycle (1%). In the absence of perfusion, the simulated rise in temperature, despite the low duty cycle, never reaches a steady state and is fitted to a logarithmic equation, enabling predictions of the temperature for long treatment times. Higher frequencies and larger probe radii are found to result in shorter treatment times relative to the temperature rise, at the cost of a smaller treated area. Results from the simulations indicate that it may be possible to achieve reasonable acoustic streaming values in tumor without the temperature exceeding 50 °C. Treatment times for streaming a distance of 50 μm in the breast case are shown to range from less than one and a half hour to 93 h, depending on the probe settings."
"To investigate the effectiveness of histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate (HTK) solution compared to Ringer's (RS) solution for preserving isolated hair follicles (HFs), focusing on structural integrity, cell viability, apoptosis prevention, and identifying the mechanisms of cell death during the preservation period."
"Ulnar collateral ligament injury of the elbow is a problem most associated with baseball pitchers but can be a challenging pathology for any overhead throwing athlete. The prevalence of these injuries has been steadily increasing over the past several decades, as has the need for surgical management. Surgical reconstruction has long been considered the gold standard for complete ulnar collateral ligament injuries in throwers, but repair has surfaced as a viable option for younger patients or those with isolated proximal or distal injuries with good tissue quality. Ulnar collateral ligament repair continues to evolve with modified techniques, including graft augmentation."
A man in his early 50s presented to the emergency department (ED) with sudden onset of palpitation and presyncope. The 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) recorded in ED showed monomorphic ventricular tachycardia requiring cardioversion in view of haemodynamic instability. The patient was subsequently detected to have an anomalous left coronary artery origin from the pulmonary artery. We present the features of this case that lead to clinical suspicion of this disease and discuss the presentation of anomalous left coronary artery origin from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) in adults.
"Mosquitoes such as Aedes aegypti must consume a blood meal for the nutrients necessary for egg production. Several transcriptome and proteome changes occur post-blood meal that likely corresponds with codon usage alterations. Transfer RNA (tRNA) is the adapter molecule that reads messenger RNA codons to add the appropriate amino acid during protein synthesis. Chemical modifications to tRNA enhance codon decoding, improving the accuracy and efficiency of protein synthesis. Here, we examined tRNA modifications and transcripts associated with the blood meal and subsequent periods of vitellogenesis in A. aegypti. More specifically, we assessed tRNA transcript abundance and modification levels in the fat body at critical times post blood-feeding. Based on a combination of alternative codon usage and identification of particular modifications, we discovered that increased transcription of tyrosine tRNAs is likely critical during the synthesis of egg yolk proteins in the fat body following a blood meal. Altogether, changes in both the abundance and modification of tRNA are essential factors in the process of vitellogenin production after blood-feeding in mosquitoes."
"Coastal lagoons, which cover about 13% of coastline, are among the most productive ecosystems worldwide. However, they are subject to significant stressors, both natural and anthropogenic, which can alter ecosystem services and functioning and food web structure. In the Comacchio Lagoon (Northern Italy), eutrophication, among other minor factors, transformed the ecosystem in the early 1980s. Here, we compiled available data for the lagoon into trophic networks (pre- and post-transformation), analyzed the ecosystem using local and global network analysis, and computed trophic fluxes of the two periods. For comparability, the networks of two periods (i.e., pre- and post- transformation) were aggregated into food webs with 23 nodes. We found differences in the trophic networks before and after eutrophication, resulting in some decrease in complexity, increase of flow diversity, and an overall shortening of the food chain. A crucial aspect of this change is the disappearance of submerged vegetation in the lagoon and the increased importance of cyanobacteria in the post-eutrophication period. We provide an approach to better understand ecosystem changes after severe disturbances which can be extended to biodiversity conservation and for the management of coastal resources in general."
"Primary liver tumors are an increasing indication for pediatric liver transplantation. Here we report the cases of 10 patients who underwent liver transplantation for primary liver tumors in our hospital, from 2001 to date. Up to 2011, 1 transplant due to hepatoblastoma was done out of 117 liver transplants (0.8%). Since 2012, there were 9 patients out of 141 (6.4%) (5 due to hepatoblastoma, 2 due to hepatocellular carcinoma, 1 due to hepatic epithelioid hemangioendothelioma, and 1 due to hepatic mesenchymal hamartoma). Follow-up: 13.2 months (median); age at transplantation: living 4.7 years (median); weight: 17.6 kg (median). Eighty percent of patients received grafts from living donors. No tumor recurrence was observed. Survival was 100% in the follow-up period. In our series, patients with primary liver tumors requiring transplantation showed an adequate course, even in the case of hepatocellular carcinoma, Related living donors liver transplantation shortened the time between the indication and the surgery."
"Freshwater soaking of the conchocelis is often used to reduce yellow spot, white spot, and mud red disease in Pyropia yezoensis. However, the understanding of physiological, transcriptomic, and metabolomic changes for the conchocelis under freshwater stress remains limited. Here, we comprehensively explored the dynamic changes of physiological activities, transcriptomes, and metabolomes of the conchocelis under three points of freshwater stress (0 h, 4 h, and 24 h) and one point of seawater recovery (R2h). We found that the content of photosynthetic pigments, soluble proteins, and photosynthesis performance significantly responded to freshwater stress. Metabolomic analysis identified a total of 24 metabolites, including 15 DAMs, suggesting the metabolites changes in the conchocelis in response to freshwater stress. Additionally, comparative transcriptome and metabolome analyses identified a black co-expression module that was strongly correlated with the DAMs. Furthermore, this module was predominantly enriched in carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism pathways. We found that PyDLD, PyPGK, and PyBCKDHA were key genes in hub-networks, which are potentially involved in changes of leucine, valine, isoleucine, lactate, and floridoside during freshwater stress. These findings reveal the genetic basis of the dynamic changes of physiological activities, transcriptome, and metabolome in the Py. yezoensis conchocelis during freshwater soaking for disease control."

"Pelvic venous disorders (PeVDs) are rarely considered as a cause of chronic pelvic pain in women being evaluated by nonvascular specialists. A Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR) Foundation-sponsored Research Consensus Panel addressing this issue identified multiple gaps in the literature and made recommendations to enhance the evidence. Since publication of these recommendations in 2019, significant progress has been made in developing the necessary tools to improve the ability to conduct rigorous clinical studies and advance the evidence supporting the diagnosis and treatment of PeVD. This report summarizes the 5-year impact of the panel's recommendations. The investment made by SIR Foundation to host a Research Consensus Panel on PeVD has facilitated enduring academic productivity related to this clinical issue."
"The student development initiatives of the BUILDing SCHOLARS Center at The University of Texas at El Paso comprise a program intended to prepare undergraduate students to enter and succeed in advanced graduate and professional biomedical degree programs, ultimately contributing to the diversity of the biomedical research workforce. The program adopted the Johnson/Bozemann Asset Bundles model, which recommends addressing five areas necessary to support minority students as they prepare for and continue towards scientific careers: a) educational endowments, b) science socialization, c) network development, d) family expectations and e) material resources. Through a variety of activities, which included a minimum of two years of research training, all five asset bundles were integrated into the program. Validated scales on science identity and research self-efficacy were completed by program fellows, and academic metrics such as retention, grade point average (GPA), and time to degree were collected for both program fellows and a comparison group. Thorough records of all students who participated in the program, including their presentations and co-authored publications, have been maintained, and students are being tracked post-graduation to determine their entry and completion of advanced degrees. Academic-based results for the first three cohorts of program participants show large, significant, and positive differences in retention, 4-year graduation rates and entry into advanced degrees between program participants and the comparison group. Comparison of academic and non-academic metrics indicate that the asset bundles approach is effective in retaining and preparing students for advanced degrees and careers in STEM disciplines. Using our results in combination with research by others on retention of students in STEM, we suggest factors contributing to the push-out of very talented majority Hispanic students in the comparison group from completing STEM degrees or not pursuing advanced studies in STEM areas."
"The carboxyl groups on MIL-88B(Fe) are crucial for the covalent immobilization of snailase, and the enzyme can convert common ginsenoside Rb1 into the rare ginsenoside compound K (CK) with higher bioavailability. The present study proposed glutamate-modified MIL-88B(Fe) for the immobilization of snailase to improve enzymatic activity and loading capacity. The surface topography characterized by SEM and CLSM indicated snailase was successfully encapsulated and uniformly distributed in the Sna@MIL-88B(Fe). The maximum immobilized capacities of snailase by MIL-88B(Fe)-Glu and MIL-88B(Fe) were 185 mg/g and 140 mg/g, respectively. Moreover, covalently immobilized snailase on MIL-88B(Fe)-Glu showed better pH, thermal, solvent, and storage stabilities than those immobilized on MIL-88B(Fe) and resolvase. Meanwhile, the reaction kinetics exhibited that the Km value of Sna@MIL-88B(Fe)-Glu (1.6 mM) was significantly lower than that of free snailase (2.1 mM), indicating a higher substrate affinity. Besides, more ginsenoside CK with higher conversion (60.71 %) was generated by Sna@MIL-88B(Fe)-Glu, even after five cycles. The glutamate modified covalent grafting method provides a highly efficient strategy for biocatalysis and a reference for the immobilized snailase-catalyzed transformation of rare ginsenosides CK."

"Perivascular epithelioid-cell tumour (PEComa) is a rare mesenchymal tumour with low malignant potential. PEComa can be found in many organs throughout the body. In the urinary system, it can be found in the prostate, bladder, and kidney. Given the rarity of bladder PEComas, a multidisciplinary approach is often required for diagnosis, encompassing radiological imaging, histopathological examination, and immunohistochemical staining."
"It remains inconclusive about the stability and optimal fixation scheme of screw internal fixation for lateral malleolus oblique fractures in clinical practice. In this study, the effects of different screw internal fixation methods on the biomechanics of lateral malleolus oblique fractures were investigated. These efforts are expected to lay a theoretical foundation for the selection of internal fixation methods and rehabilitation training regimens in the treatment of lateral malleolus fractures. A healthy ankle joint model and a lateral malleolus fracture internal fixation model were established based on CT data with the aid of some software. Besides, the effects of screw internal fixation modalities on the fracture displacement of fibula fractures, fibula Von Mises stress, and screw Von Mises stress under different physiological conditions and loading conditions were investigated using finite element methods (FEMs) and in vitro physical experiments. The double screw vertical fibular axis internal fixation approach had the lowest fracture displacement of fibula fractures and screw Von Mises stress values; while the double screw vertical fracture line internal fixation approach had the lowest fibula Von Mises stress values. Under different physiological conditions, the magnitude of the peak Von Mises stress of the fibula and screw was ranked as plantarflexion 20° > plantarflexion 10° > neutral position > dorsiflexion 10° > dorsiflexion 20°; and the magnitude of the peak displacement of the fibula fracture breaks was ranked as plantarflexion 20° > plantarflexion 10° > neutral position > dorsiflexion 20° > dorsiflexion 10°. The results of in vitro physical experiments and finite element analyses were in good agreement, which validated the validity of finite element analyses. The vertical fracture line screw implantation method displays a better load-sharing ability; while the vertical fibular axis screw implantation method exhibits a better ability to prevent axial shortening of the fibula and also reduces the risk of screw fatigue damage. Overall, the double screw achieves better therapeutic effects than the single screw. Given that the ankle joint has high stability in the dorsiflexion position, it is recommended to prioritize dorsiflexion rehabilitation training, rather than dorsiflexion and plantarflexion rehabilitation training with too large angles, in the treatment of lateral malleolus fractures."
"Cerebral visual impairment (CVI) can negatively affect a child's functioning, emphasising the need for interventions to improve visual perception (VP), potentially translating into improved health-related quality of life (HRQOL)."
"Transitioning into and out of dormancy is a crucial survival strategy for many organisms. In unicellular cyanobacteria, surviving nitrogen-starved conditions involves tuning down their metabolism and reactivating it once nitrogen becomes available. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), the enzyme that catalyzes the first step of the oxidative pentose phosphate (OPP) pathway, plays a key role in this process. G6PDH is produced at the onset of nitrogen starvation but remains inactive in dormant cells, only to be rapidly reactivated when nitrogen is restored. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms underlying this enzymatic regulation and found that G6PDH inactivation is primarily due to the accumulation of inhibitory metabolites. Moreover, our findings demonstrate that metabolite-level regulation is the driving force behind the resuscitation program. This study highlights the critical importance of metabolite-level regulation in ensuring rapid and precise enzymatic control, enabling microorganisms to swiftly adapt to environmental changes and undergo developmental transitions."
"The chloroplast (cp) genome is a widely used tool for exploring plant evolutionary relationships, yet its effectiveness in fully resolving these relationships remains uncertain. Integrating cp genome data with nuclear DNA information offers a more comprehensive view but often requires separate datasets. In response, we employed the same raw read sequencing data to construct cp genome-based trees and nuclear DNA phylogenetic trees using Read2Tree, a cost-efficient method for extracting conserved nuclear gene sequences from raw read data, focusing on the Aurantioideae subfamily, which includes Citrus and its relatives. The resulting nuclear DNA trees were consistent with existing nuclear evolutionary relationships derived from high-throughput sequencing, but diverged from cp genome-based trees. To elucidate the underlying complex evolutionary processes causing these discordances, we implemented an integrative workflow that utilized multiple alignments of each gene generated by Read2Tree, in conjunction with other phylogenomic methods. Our analysis revealed that incomplete lineage sorting predominantly drives these discordances, while introgression and ancient introgression also contribute to topological discrepancies within certain clades. This study underscores the cost-effectiveness of using the same raw sequencing data for both cp and nuclear DNA analyses in understanding plant evolutionary relationships."
"Thoracic switch/sucrose nonfermentable-related, matrix-associated, actin-dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily A, member 4 (SMARCA4)-deficient (SD) malignancies, including SD undifferentiated tumor (SD-UT) and SD non-small cell lung carcinoma (SD-NSCLC), have been recently described. The cytologic features of these neoplasms in fine-needle aspiration (FNA) and effusion specimens have rarely been reported in the literature. This study aimed to describe and compare the spectrum of cytologic, immunohistochemical, and clinical features of these high-grade malignancies recently encountered at the participating institutions."
"Humanity has long battled mosquitoes and the diseases they transmit-a struggle intensified by climate change and globalization, which have expanded mosquito ranges and the spread of associated diseases."
"Tuberculosis (TB) is a chronic respiratory infectious disease and is induced by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) infection. Macrophages serve as the cellular home in immunoreaction against M.tb infection, which is tightly regulated through Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) expression. Therefore, this study is designed to explore the role and mechanism of TLR4 in mycobacterial injury in human macrophages (THP-1 cells) after M.tb infection. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were assessed using MTT, EdU, and flow cytometry assays. ELISA kits were utilized to assess the levels of Interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α). The binding between Yin-Yang-1 (YY1) and TLR4 promoter was predicted by JASPAR and verified using Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and dual-luciferase reporter assays. M.tb infection might repress THP-1 cell proliferation, and induce cell apoptosis and inflammatory response in a multiplicity of infection (MOI)-dependent manner. Moreover, M.tb infection increased the expression of TLR4 in HTP-1 cells in an MOI-dependent way, and its downregulation might overturn M.tb infection-mediated HTP-1 cell damage and inflammatory response. At the molecular level, YY1 was a transcription factor of TLR4 and promoted TLR4 transcription via binding to its promoter region. Besides, YY1 might activate the NF-kB signaling pathway via regulating TLR4. Meanwhile, TLR4 inhibitor BAY11-7082 might overturn the repression effect of TLR4 on M.tb-infected HTP-1 cell damage. YY1-activated TLR4 might aggravate mycobacterial injury in human macrophages after M.tb infection by the NF-kB pathway, providing a promising therapeutic target for TB treatment."
"Historically, evaluation of the upper extremity vasculature was performed using digital subtraction angiography. With the advancement of cross-sectional imaging and submillimeter isotropic data acquisition, CT angiography (CTA) has become an excellent noninvasive diagnostic tool for evaluation of the vasculature of the upper extremities. CTA allows quick evaluation of vessel patency and irregularity and achievement of the anatomic detail needed in preoperative planning. When interpreting CTA of the upper extremities, radiologists must be familiar with the normal vascular anatomy, common vascular anomalies, and pitfalls or artifacts that may mimic or mask abnormality. In this review, the authors provide an overview of the utility of CTA of the upper extremities. Also discussed are CTA techniques and the use of several newer technologies including dual-energy and photon-counting detector CT. The utility of CTA in patients with upper extremity trauma is explored, with a focus on assessing vascular injury. Other vascular abnormalities including infection, acute limb ischemia, and vasculitis are discussed. It is imperative for radiologists to be accustomed to CTA of the upper extremities in diagnosing acute vascular abnormalities and to recognize common pitfalls and mimics of these abnormalities."
"Traditionally, colorectal liver metastases (CRLMs) are divided into ""initially resectable"" and ""initially unresectable."" The terminology ""borderline resectable"" continues to be elusive without any common consensus or definition. This narrative review aims to decode the conundrum of ""borderline resectable CRLM (BR-CRLM)"" and to discuss optimal treatment strategies."
"Prenatal cell-free DNA (cfDNA) screening is a success story of clinical genomics that has translated to and transformed obstetric care. It is a highly sensitive and specific method of screening for the most common fetal aneuploidies, including trisomies 13, 18, and 21. While primarily designed to detect fetal chromosomal abnormalities, the test also analyzes maternal cfDNA, which can complicate interpretation of results. Occasionally, abnormalities in cfDNA that do not align with fetal aneuploidy may indicate benign or malignant maternal disease states, presenting unique diagnostic challenges and opportunities."
"Clinical trialists have long been searching for approaches to increase statistical power without increasing sample size. Conventional wait-list controlled (WLC) trials are limited to two trial arms and two or three repeated measurements per person. These features limit statistical power. Furthermore, their analysis is usually based on analysis of covariance or mixed effects modelling, with a focus on estimating treatment effect at one time-period after initiation of therapy. We propose two 3-arm WLC trial designs together with a mixed-effects analysis framework. The designs require three or four repeated measurements per person. The analytic framework defines up to three treatment effect estimands, representing the effects at one to three time-periods after initiation of therapy. The precision (inverse of variance) of the treatment effect estimators in the new and conventional trial designs are analytically derived and evaluated in simulations. The results are interpreted in the context of a cognitive training trial in older people. The proposed designs and analysis methods increase the precision level of treatment effect estimators as compared to conventional designs and analyses. Given a target level of statistical power, the proposed methods require a smaller number of participants per trial than the conventional methods, without necessarily increasing the number of measurements per trial. Furthermore, the proposed analytic framework sheds light on the treatment effects at different times after initiation of therapy, which is not usually considered in conventional WLC trial analysis. In situations that a WLC trial is appropriate, the 3-arm designs are useful alternatives to existing 2-arm designs."
Genetic polymorphisms have been associated with risk of antituberculosis treatment toxicity. We characterized associations with adverse events and treatment failure/recurrence among adults treated for tuberculosis in Brazil.
"Upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) are characterized by high photostability, narrow spectral bands, excellent tuneability, and low biotoxicity, facilitating a broad range of biomedical applications. However, the small size required in many biological applications implies a lower luminescent brightness, as large surface-to-volume ratio is always accompanied with severe surface quenching. Herein, we introduce a strategy to overcome the surface quenching by incorporating an acceptor dye, sulforhodamine B (SRB) to surpass energy relaxation on long-lived lanthanide excited states. The surface modification of SRB led to up to 98.8% energy transfer efficiency, accompanied with the emergence of an intense SRB emission, with four orders of magnitude of change in the SRB/UCNPs emission ratio. The further structural optimisation led to an 8-fold upconversion emission enhancement. Moreover, the system exhibits excellent photostability, with only a 25% reduction over 2 h under intense irradiation. By incorporating a pH responsive 5-carboxytetramethylrhodamine (5-TAMRA) to the UCNPs, we achieved a self-referencing protochromic sensor that are specific to protons and resistant to interference from various metal ions. This work provides a facile method for enhancing small-sized nanocrystals for potential biomedical sensing and imaging applications."
"Doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity is still an important medical problem associated with a high mortality rate in cancer survivors. p53 plays a key role in doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. Diacylglycerol kinase ζ (Dgkζ), a 130-kDa enzyme abundant in cardiomyocytes, regulates the p53 protein expression level in neurons. To elucidate the mechanism of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity, we focused on the functional role of Dgkζ and its interaction with heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70)-related ubiquitin E3 ligases such as E6-associated protein (E6ap) and C-terminus of Hsp70-interacting protein."
"This review aims to evaluate current diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for postpericardiotomy syndrome (PPS), with a focus on the evolving role of multimodality imaging, including echocardiography, cardiac computed tomography (CCT), and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR). The review also explores the potential benefits of advanced imaging in improving the accuracy and management of PPS."
The purpose of this study was to assess adults' perspectives after using the insulin-only Bionic Pancreas (BP) during a 13-week pivotal trial. Automated insulin delivery (AID) systems show promise in improving glycemic outcomes and reducing disease burden for those with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D). Understanding the lived experience of those using the BP can help to inform education and uptake of AID devices.
"The Federal Cervical Cancer Collaborative (FCCC) was established by the Health Resources and Services Administration Office of Women's Health and its interagency partners within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Its primary mission, aligned with the goals of the Cancer Moonshot (https://www.cancer.gov/research/key-initiatives/moonshot-cancer-initiative/implementation/prevention-early-detection), is to accelerate control of cervical cancer within safety-net settings of care. This interagency partnership works in close collaboration to reduce disparities in cervical cancer care, particularly among populations that are geographically isolated, economically challenged, and medically underserved. The FCCC bridges federal priorities of cancer research from the National Institutes of Health National Cancer Institute to health care delivery in Health Resources and Services Administration-supported and safety-net settings of care. In this commentary, FCCC activities are discussed to improve cervical cancer prevention and control through vaccination, screening, and management of preinvasive cervical disease in safety-net settings of care.

"Understanding recovery is important for patients with stroke and their families, including how much recovery is expected and how long it might take. These conversations can however be uncomfortable for stroke unit staff, particularly when they involve breaking bad news. This study aimed to begin development of a novel complex intervention to improve conversations about recovery on stroke units."
"Aberrant cardiac fibrosis, defined as excessive production and deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM), is mediated by myofibroblasts. ECM-producing myofibroblasts are primarily derived from resident fibroblasts during cardiac fibrosis. The mechanism underlying fibroblast-myofibroblast transition is not fully understood."
"Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) represents a significant advancement in therapeutic medicine, offering unique molecular and cellular characteristics that make it exceptionally suitable for medical applications. The bullet-shaped morphology, RNA genome organization, and cytoplasmic replication strategy provide fundamental advantages for both vaccine development and oncolytic applications. VSV's interaction with host cells through the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) and its sophisticated transcriptional regulation mechanisms enables precise control over therapeutic applications. The virus demonstrates remarkable versatility through its rapid replication cycle, robust immune response induction, and natural neurotropism. Recent technological innovations in VSV engineering have led to enhanced safety protocols and improved therapeutic modifications, particularly in cancer treatment. Attenuation strategies have successfully addressed safety concerns while maintaining the therapeutic efficacy of the virus. The molecular and cellular interactions of VSV, particularly its immune modulation capabilities and tumor-selective properties, have proven valuable in the development of targeted therapeutic strategies. This review explores these aspects, while highlighting the continuing evolution of VSV-based therapeutic approaches in precision medicine."
"Practical biomarkers for endotypic characterization of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) remain elusive, hindering clinical utility. Eosinophil peroxidase (EPX) is an enzyme released by activated eosinophils. The objective of this study was to evaluate a clinic EPX assay as a marker of eosinophilic CRS."
"Recently, the impressive performance of large language models (LLMs) on a wide range of tasks has attracted an increasing number of attempts to apply LLMs in drug discovery. However, molecule optimization, a critical task in the drug discovery pipeline, is currently an area that has seen little involvement from LLMs. Most of existing approaches focus solely on capturing the underlying patterns in chemical structures provided by the data, without taking advantage of expert feedback. These non-interactive approaches overlook the fact that the drug discovery process is actually one that requires the integration of expert experience and iterative refinement. To address this gap, we propose DrugAssist, an interactive molecule optimization model which performs optimization through human-machine dialogue by leveraging LLM's strong interactivity and generalizability. DrugAssist has achieved leading results in both single and multiple property optimization, simultaneously showcasing immense potential in transferability and iterative optimization. In addition, we publicly release a large instruction-based dataset called 'MolOpt-Instructions' for fine-tuning language models on molecule optimization tasks. We have made our code and data publicly available at https://github.com/blazerye/DrugAssist, which we hope to pave the way for future research in LLMs' application for drug discovery."

"Insufficient staffing often makes it difficult for nurses in South Korea to adjust their schedules when they have illnesses or other health problems, resulting in presenteeism. This study aimed to explore the experiences of the Acknowledged Care Expert (ACE) team as a substitution system for clinical nurses taking leave because of illness or health problems from the perspectives of ACE nurses, nurse managers, and shift nurses. We collected data for this qualitative study through individual in-depth interviews with six ACE nurses, a focus group interview with five nurse managers, and two focus group interviews with five nurses who shared their experiences with the ACE team. Thematic analysis of the data identified the following four themes: expected and unexpected benefits of the ACE team; challenges in operating the ACE team; characteristics and competencies required of the ACE team; and recommendations for the ACE program. The findings showed that the ACE team was highly valued and received positive feedback from colleagues and administrators with whom they worked. Such positive impacts were made possible by team members' clinical expertise and the collective engagement of both coworkers and team members. Further research to evaluate such substitute systems is necessary to establish a more stable and encouraging environment for clinical nurses, as well as for patient care."
"Sleep apnea (SA) is prevalent among patients with heart failure (HF) and contributes to a poor prognosis. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in reducing the risk of serious clinical events in patients with HF. Additionally, SGLT2 inhibitors may reduce the risk of incident SA and mitigate its severity in patients with cardiovascular disease and T2DM. We aimed to investigate whether the SGLT2 inhibitor tofogliflozin reduced the severity of SA, as assessed using the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), in patients with HF and T2DM and whether a decrease in AHI correlates with changes in body composition and cardiorenal function parameters. This is a single-arm, prospective pathophysiologic study involving patients with HF, T2DM, and SA, defined as having an AHI of 15 events/h and more. SA was assessed using polysomnography. Changes in AHI before and 6 months after starting oral administration of tofogliflozin (20 mg) were assessed. Additionally, body composition and cardiorenal functions were assessed before and 6 months after tofogliflozin administration. Ten patients with HF, T2DM, and SA were finally enrolled (60% men, 66.9 ± 13.4 years). Tofogliflozin reduced AHI from 43.2 [30.2] to 35.3 [13.1] events/h (p = 0.024) at 6 months. Hemoglobin A1c, body weight, and body water content decreased significantly. However, no significant changes were observed in the cardiorenal function parameters. A linear relationship was observed between the changes in body water content and AHI (r = 0.642, p = 0.045). Tofogliflozin reduced AHI, possibly associated with a reduction in body water content."
"Drug-coated balloon (DCB) catheters offer an alternative to drug-eluting stents (DES) by delivering anti-proliferative drugs directly to vessel walls, avoiding implantation of a permanent metallic structure. While DCBs have shown efficacy for in-stent restenosis, evidence for their application in de novo coronary disease and chronic total occlusion (CTO) PCI is growing. We present a case of a 49-year-old male with multivessel chronic total and subtotal occlusions who had complete percutaneous revascularisation using a DCB only strategy. Each lesion had unique characteristics involving its length and location, bifurcation anatomy, and vessel diameter for which this stent-free approach was favored. DCB use in CTO PCI may be promising in select cases and lesions, and further studies are warranted to ascertain long-term efficacy in this setting."
"The rising prevalence of depression, with its associated suicide risk, demands effective fast-acting treatments. Ketamine has emerged as promising, demonstrating rapid antidepressant effects. While early studies show swift mood improvements, its precise mechanisms remain unclear. This article aims to compile and synthesize the literature on ketamine's molecular actions. Ketamine primarily works by antagonizing NMDA receptors, reducing GABAergic inhibition, and increasing glutamate release. This enhanced glutamate activates AMPA receptors, triggering crucial downstream cascades, including BDNF-TrkB and mTOR pathways, promoting synaptic proliferation and regeneration. Moreover, neuroimaging studies have demonstrated alterations in brain networks involved in emotional regulation, including the Default Mode Network (DMN), Central Executive Network (CEN), and Salience Network (SN), which are frequently disrupted in depression. Despite the promising findings, the literature reveals significant inaccuracies and gaps in understanding the full scope of ketamine's therapeutic potential. For instance, ketamine engages with opioid receptors, insinuating a permissive role of the opioid system in amplifying ketamine's antidepressant effects, albeit ketamine does not operate as a direct opioid agonist. Further exploration is requisite to comprehensively ascertain its safety profile, long-term efficacy, and the impact of genetic determinants, such as BDNF polymorphisms, on treatment responsiveness."

"Monacolin K is a valuable secondary metabolite produced after a period of fermentation by Monascus purpureus; however, our current understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of its synthesis remains incomplete. This study conducted functional analysis on the key transcription factor, comp54181_c0, that is involved in the synthesis of monacolin K in Monascus. Mutant strains with either knockout or overexpression of comp54181_c0 were constructed using CRISPR/Cas9. A comparison between the knockout and overexpression strains revealed changes in fungal morphology and growth, with a significant increase in the production of Monascus pigments and monacolin K when comp54181_c0 was absent. Real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR analysis revealed that comp54181_c0 significantly influenced the transcription of key genes related to monacolin K biosynthesis in Monascus. In conclusion, our study elucidates the crucial role of comp54181_c0 in Monascus, enriches our understanding of fungal secondary metabolite development and regulation, and provides a foundation for the development and regulation of Monascus and monacolin K production."
"DDX3 is a DEAD-box RNA helicase that plays multiple roles in RNA metabolism, including translation. We previously reported that DDX3 is required for translation of PACT, a binding partner of Dicer, suggesting a role for DDX3 in microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis and RNA interference (RNAi). Emerging evidence suggests that DDX3 plays a vital role in tumorigenesis and cancer progression, however, its underlying mechanism is still not fully understood. Here, we showed that the control of PACT by DDX3 is conserved in human cells and Caenorhabditis elegans. Using a miRNA microarray, we found that DDX3 regulates the expression of a small subset of cancer-related miRNAs. These oncogenic miRNAs were down-regulated by knockdown of DDX3 or PACT and up-regulated by overexpression of DDX3 or PACT in HEK293T cells. Similar results were obtained in human cancer HCT116 and HeLa cells. Dual luciferase reporter assay showed that DDX3 and PACT are required for short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-induced RNAi. We also performed co-immunoprecipitation to confirm the interaction between DDX3 and AGO2, a significant component of the RNA-induced silencing complex, supporting a role for DDX3 in the RNAi pathway. We further examined the effects of DDX3 and PACT on cell proliferation, and stable overexpression of DDX3 in HEK293 cells results in loss of contact inhibition of cell growth. Hence, we propose that DDX3 may participate in cancer development by regulating the RNAi pathway."

"One of the essential skills required in nursing students is empathetic communication and communication skills. Communication skills refer to a set of potential and actual abilities that help achieve acceptable and informative behavior, leading to a level of emotional connection. This interpersonal skill facilitates the establishment and strengthening of the nurse-patient relationship. Therefore, researchers aimed to conduct a study to determine the impact of narrative writing based on Gibbs' reflective model on the empathy and communication skills of nursing students."
"Cartilage damage resulting from trauma demonstrates a poor capacity for repair due to its avascular nature. Cartilage tissue engineering offers a unique therapeutic option for cartilage recovery. In this study, methylcellulose (MC)/gelatin (GEL) hydrogels (MC10G20, MC12.5G20, MC15G20, and MC17.5G20) were developed to assess and compare their chemical, mechanical, and biological characteristics for cartilage repair. First, the interaction between MC and GEL after blending and subsequent crosslinking with EDC/NHS was confirmed by using FTIR. Mechanical tests under compression test revealed that hydrogels' resistance to both elastic and plastic deformation increased with higher wt.% of MC. The % strain of the hydrogels doubled with the addition of MC, likely due to abundant hydrogen bonding between polymeric chains. Furthermore, the compressive modulus of MC/GEL hydrogels was approximately 0.2 MPa, closely matching modulus of human cartilage tissue. Similarly, the % water retention capacity of the hydrogels increased over the 7 days as the MC content increased. Additionally, SEM images showed that the incorporation of MC to GEL introduced porosity with the diameters ranging from 10 to 50 μm, similar to the size of pores in native cartilage. In vitro cell culture studies confirmed the biocompatibility of MC/GEL hydrogels. Fluorescence staining showed a 2.5-fold increase in F-actin staining following the incorporation of MC into the hydrogels. Overall, this study highlights the potential of MC/GEL hydrogels for cartilage tissue engineering, however, further research is required to assess its full potential."
"Farmakogenomika to dziedzina z pogranicza farmacji i genomiki. Zajmuje się ona badaniem wpływu występujących u pacjenta wariantów genów związanych z metabolizmem leków na jego reakcję na konkretny lek. Rolą testów farmakogenomicznych jest określenie tempa metabolizmu leków i wykorzystanie tej informacji w praktyce klinicznej. Takie podejście otwiera nowe możliwości w optymalizacji terapii, poprzez dobranie właściwego leku i dostosowanie dawki tak, aby zminimalizować działania niepożądane, jednocześnie maksymalizując skuteczność podawanego preparatu. Dzięki temu zwiększona jest szansa na przypisanie pacjentowi odpowiedniego leku, co przyspiesza wprowadzenie skutecznej terapii. Perspektywy zastosowania farmakogenomiki w psychiatrii są obiecujące, choć podobnie jak w przypadku schorzeń innych układów, stworzenie jednolitych rekomendacji jest utrudnione przez złożoność wielu zaburzeń psychicznych oraz wpływ innych czynników, takich jak interakcje pomiędzy przyjmowanymi lekami. Z tego powodu rekomendacje tworzone przez różne instytucje różnią się między sobą. Celem niniejszego artykułu jest omówienie aktualnych możliwości zastosowania farmakogenomiki w psychiatrii oraz trudności jej wprowadzenia jako standardu leczenia psychiatrycznego."
"Since 1979, The Belmont Report has served as a guidebook for ensuring that basic standards for ethical research are upheld. The Belmont Report calls for special protections of vulnerable research participants, such as people who are incarcerated and economically and educationally disadvantaged individuals who are deemed susceptible to exploitation. With a growing focus on health equity and community-engaged approaches in health equity research, efforts to involve vulnerable participants are increasing. Yet there is little understanding of what matters most to vulnerable populations. This study sought to understand, from participant perspectives, ethical considerations when conducting research with two vulnerable populations: women experiencing homelessness and women who are incarcerated. Health care professionals and staff that work closely with homeless and incarcerated populations were also interviewed. The findings from semistructured interviews with these populations underscore the sustained importance of respect for persons, beneficence, and justice, and further highlight the need for self-determination; privacy/confidentiality; continuous consent; fair treatment; benefit-burden balance; nonauthoritarian relationships; and fair access to research participation. Although The Belmont Report durably serves to ethically guide standard conventional research, the Report's original concepts should be extended to include specific considerations when vulnerable populations are involved in community-engaged research."
Current endogenous indicators utilised in avian medicine are not sensitive enough to detect renal disease in its early stages. Alternative markers ought to be examined as a result.

"There is intratumor heterogeneity in the stabilization of missense mutant p53, and it has been thought that only cells with nuclear accumulation of mutant p53 have oncogenic function. However, using mouse intestinal tumor-derived organoids, we show that mutant p53-stabilized cells transactivate Wnt/β-catenin signaling in neighboring p53-destabilized cells through activating the COX-2/PGE2 pathway. These results suggest that both p53-stabilized cells and p53-destabilized cells contribute to malignant progression through interaction within the intratumor microenvironment."

"Impaired fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and the therapeutic benefits of FAO restoration have been revealed in sepsis. However, the regulatory factors contributing to FAO dysfunction during sepsis remain inadequately clarified. In this study, we identified a subset of lipid-associated macrophages characterized by high expression of trigger receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) and demonstrated that TREM2 acted as a suppressor of FAO to increase the susceptibility to sepsis. TREM2 expression was markedly upregulated in sepsis patients and correlated with the severity of sepsis. Knockout of TREM2 in macrophages improved the survival rate and reduced inflammation and organ injuries of sepsis mice. Notably, TREM2-deficient mice exhibited decreased triglyceride accumulation and an enhanced FAO rate. Further observations showed that the blockade of FAO substantially abolished the alleviated symptoms observed in TREM2-knockout mice. Mechanically, we demonstrated that TREM2 interacted with the phosphatase SHP1 to inhibit bruton tyrosine kinase-mediated (BTK-mediated) FAO in sepsis. Our findings expand the understanding of FAO dysfunction in sepsis and reveal TREM2 as a critical regulator of FAO that may provide a promising target for the clinical treatment of sepsis."
"The current study aimed to systematically review the literature on the accuracy of artificial intelligence (AI) models for osteoporosis (OP) diagnosis using dental images. A thorough literature search was executed in October 2022 and updated in November 2023 across multiple databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. The research targeted studies using AI models for OP diagnosis from dental radiographs. The main outcomes were the sensitivity and specificity of AI models regarding OP diagnosis. The ""meta"" package from the R Foundation was selected for statistical analysis. A random-effects model, along with 95% confidence intervals, was utilized to estimate pooled values. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool was employed for risk of bias and applicability assessment. Among 640 records, 22 studies were included in the qualitative analysis and 12 in the meta-analysis. The overall sensitivity for AI-assisted OP diagnosis was 0.85 (95% CI, 0.70-0.93), while the pooled specificity equaled 0.95 (95% CI, 0.91-0.97). Conventional algorithms led to a pooled sensitivity of 0.82 (95% CI, 0.57-0.94) and a pooled specificity of 0.96 (95% CI, 0.93-0.97). Deep convolutional neural networks exhibited a pooled sensitivity of 0.87 (95% CI, 0.68-0.95) and a pooled specificity of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.83-0.96). This systematic review corroborates the accuracy of AI in OP diagnosis using dental images. Future research should expand sample sizes in test and training datasets and standardize imaging techniques to establish the reliability of AI-assisted methods in OP diagnosis through dental images."

"Diagnosing cancer subtypes is a prerequisite for precise treatment. Existing multi-omics data fusion-based diagnostic solutions build on the requisite of sufficient samples with complete multi-omics data, which is challenging to obtain in clinical applications. To address the bottleneck of collecting sufficient samples with complete data in clinical applications, we proposed a flexible integrative model (CancerSD) to diagnose cancer subtype using limited samples with incomplete multi-omics data. CancerSD designs contrastive learning tasks and masking-and-reconstruction tasks to reliably impute missing omics, and fuses available omics data with the imputed ones to accurately diagnose cancer subtypes. To address the issue of limited clinical samples, it introduces a category-level contrastive loss to extend the meta-learning framework, effectively transferring knowledge from external datasets to pretrain the diagnostic model. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that CancerSD not only gives accurate diagnosis, but also maintains a high authenticity and good interpretability. In addition, CancerSD identifies important molecular characteristics associated with cancer subtypes, and it defines the Integrated CancerSD Score that can serve as an independent predictive factor for patient prognosis."
"Twitter (subsequently rebranded as X) is acknowledged by US health agencies, including the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as an important public health communication tool. However, there is a lack of data describing its use by state health agencies over time. This knowledge is important amid a changing social media landscape in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic."
"Myogenesis is essential for skeletal muscle formation and regeneration after injury, yet its regulators are largely unknown. Here we identified fibronectin type III domain containing 1 (FNDC1) as a previously uncharacterized myokine. In vitro studies showed that knockdown of Fndc1 in myoblasts reduces myotube formation, while overexpression of Fndc1 promotes myogenic differentiation. We further generated recombinant truncated mouse FNDC1 (mFNDC1), which retains reliable activity in promoting myoblast differentiation in vitro. Gain- and loss-of-function studies collectively showed that FNDC1 promotes cardiotoxin (CTX)-induced muscle regeneration in adult mice. Furthermore, recombinant FNDC1 treatment ameliorated pathological muscle phenotypes in the mdx mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Mechanistically, FNDC1 bound to the integrin α5β1 and activated the downstream FAK/PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway to promote myogenic differentiation. Pharmacological inhibition of integrin α5β1 or of the downstream FAK/PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway abolished the pro-myogenic effect of FNDC1. Collectively, these results suggested that myokine FNDC1 might be used as a therapeutic agent to regulate myogenic differentiation and muscle regeneration for the treatment of acute and chronic muscle disease."
"Candida lusitaniae is one of the fungal species which causes serious health illnesses including peritonitis, vaginitis and fungemia, among others. Several antifungal drugs have been designed to tackle its infections but their efficacy is still questionable due to their associated side effects. Hence, there is a need to design those drugs which possess comparatively higher degree of therapeutic potential. Phytochemicals were selected in this regard because these compounds which satisfactorily follow this criteria as, their therapeutic index is comparatively larger than the synthetic drugs. Considering this fact, different phyto-compounds were opted in this research work to estimate their therapeutic efficiency against the secreted aspartyl proteinase (SAP) of C. lusitaniae since, it assists this pathogen in developing the infections. Initially, the structure of SAP was modelled for subsequent docking analysis. The results of molecular docking suggested that three compounds, opelconazole, daidzin 4'0-glucuronide and naringin exhibited better docking scores. Afterwards, ADME analysis of all these four compounds was performed to comprehend their drug-likeness attributes. The results of ADME analysis revealed that only the daidzin 4'0-glucuronide followed all the required parameters. Lastly, MD simulations were conducted in which top three compounds in context of docking scores along three approved anti-fungal drugs in complex with SAP were incorporated for the comparative analysis. The overall results of MD simulations suggested that daidzin 4'0-glucuronide exhibited comparatively better results. This outcome indicated that this particular compound not only showed better binding affinity with SAP during docking analysis and fulfilled all of the drug-likeness moieties among other compounds but also, displayed better simulation results, leading to a conclusion that daidzin 4'0-glucuronide could be a potential drug candidate against C. lusitaniae. However, its real-time efficacy could only be validated in clinical settings."

"In today's world, there is almost no homogeneous culture without interaction, and multiculturalism has become the most important phenomenon for all societies. Therefore, this cultural diversity, consisting of differences in culture, language, identity, religion, etc. has also brought along many problems. In the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization's in ""Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage"", it is stated that identifying, documenting and surveying intangible cultural heritage of communities contributes to social harmony and tolerance. This research has been conducted on the identity, language, and communication of the Cretan in Türkiye. The purpose of the study is to contribute to social peace and tolerance by examining the identity, language, and communication perceptions and concerns of the Crete-origin community living in Türkiye as a subculture group, within the context of multiculturalism and intercultural communication. In this direction, preliminary interviews, observations and semi-structured in-depth interviews were made in the fieldwork carried out between May-July 2024 in the of the Cretan immigrants who have migrated and settled in Antalya at the first settlements one of the world cities with intense multiculturalism. In the study, an answer has been sought to the question ""What are the identity and linguistic anxiety, harmony and conflict situations in the communication and interaction of Cretans living in Turkey as a subculture with the dominant culture?"". The findings were subjected to thematic and descriptive analysis and interpreted. It is predicted that the findings and results of this research can be used to contribute to studies aimed at preventing identity, linguistic and cultural incompatibility and possible conflicts caused by increasing migration movements."

"Myelopoiesis provides for the formation and continued renewal of cells belonging primarily to the innate immune system. It is a highly plastic process that secures the response to external and internal stimuli to face acute and changing needs. Infections and chronic diseases including cancer can modulate it by producing several factors, impacting proliferation and differentiation programs. While the lymphocytic compartment has attracted major attention due to the role of adaptive immunity in anticancer immune response, in recent years, research has found convincing evidence that confirms the importance of innate immunity and the key function played by emergency myelopoiesis. Due to cancer's ability to manipulate myelopoiesis to its own advantage, the purpose of this review is to outline myelopoiesis processes within the tumor microenvironment and suggest possible therapeutic lines of research to restore the physiological functioning of the host's immune system, with a special outlook on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)."

"Pigs are recognized as amplifying hosts for influenza A virus (IAV) reassortant viruses. Understanding the extent of IAV reassortment occurring at the individual pig level in naturally infected pigs and how reassortment impacts virus diversity, persistence, and replicative fitness is essential for countering IAV threats to humans and animals. Here, 244 IAV plaques were isolated from 24 commercial pigs, resulting in 26 distinct genome segment constellations. About 33% (8/24) of pigs were infected with two or more different genotypes, with two pigs harboring two or more different subtypes. Our results indicate that few pigs in a population harbor significantly more genotypes than other pigs and generate most of the diversity, including the emergence of reassortants. However, detecting distinct genotypes during surveillance was dynamic, with most of the genotypes subsiding over time. All the IAV genotypes could replicate in various swine and human-sourced respiratory epithelial cells, and we observed that distinct reassortant genotypes recovered from a single pig could exhibit different growth abilities, especially in human cells. Overall, we demonstrated that multiple distinct IAV genotypes with distinct antigenic profiles and varying growth abilities on swine and human respiratory tracts can be shed simultaneously from a single pig, which contributes to the dynamic nature of IAV prevalence. The striking magnitude of IAV reassortment at the single pig level revealed in this study highlights the need to strengthen surveillance efforts and plans to eliminate IAV from swine farms because pigs have a high potential to produce diverse and potentially zoonotic influenza reassortant viruses."
"Low-grade systemic inflammation has been reported in many psychiatric diseases and is described as a non-severe state of the inflammatory response. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic psychiatric disorder characterized by symptoms of avoidance, re-experiencing and hyperarousal that develop secondary to a serious traumatic event. The trauma itself creates psychological and biological changes in the individual, apart from PTSD. This complex situation has still not been clarified and researchers have tended to research on inflammatory processes. Systemic immune inflammation index (SII), as a new index related to inflammation, is a comprehensive value based on peripheral lymphocyte, neutrophil and platelet counts. SII has been used as a marker of subclinical inflammation and prognosis in various studies. Although the presence of inflammation in PTSD was tried to be demonstrated through cytokines, inflammatory variables such as neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and SII, which are low-cost and easily shown in routine examinations, have not been studied before."

"The need for high-quality protist genomes has prevented in-depth computational and experimental studies of giant virus-host interactions. In addition, our current knowledge of host range is highly biased due to the few hosts used to isolate novel giant viruses. This study presents 6 high-quality amoeba genomes from known and potential giant virus hosts belonging to 2 distinct eukaryotic clades: Amoebozoa and Discoba. We employ their genomic data to investigate the predictability of giant virus host range. Using a combination of long- and short-read sequencing, we obtained highly contiguous and complete genomes of Acanthamoeba castellanii, Acanthamoeba griffini, Acanthamoeba terricola, Naegleria clarki, Vermamoeba vermiformis, and Willaertia magna, contributing to the collection of sequences for the eukaryotic tree of life. We found that the 6 amoebae have distinct codon usage patterns and that, contrary to other virus groups, giant viruses often have different and even opposite codon usage with their known hosts. Conversely, giant viruses with matching codon usage are frequently not known to infect or replicate in these hosts. Interestingly, analyses of integrated viral sequences in the amoeba host genomes reveal potential novel virus-host associations. Matching of codon usage preferences is often used to predict virus-host pairs. However, with the broad-scale analyses performed in this study, we demonstrate that codon usage alone appears to be a poor predictor of host range for giant viruses infecting amoeba. We discuss the potential strategies that giant viruses employ to ensure high viral fitness in nonmatching hosts. Moreover, this study emphasizes the need for more high-quality protist genomes. Finally, the amoeba genomes presented in this study set the stage for future experimental studies to better understand how giant viruses interact with different host species."
"The impact of cultivar and production system was studied over two years on organoleptic and nutritional characteristics of apple fruits and then, on purees processed with both conventional convection cooking under vacuum and fast innovative microwave cooking. The main factors affecting the content and composition of sugars, organic acids, volatiles, polyphenols, and fibre were in the decreasing order, cultivar, year, and production system. Regarding processing, the fast innovative microwave cooking led to puree with a higher viscosity but with a lower polyphenol content compared to the convection cooking. Microwave cooking seemed to better preserve fibre but limit the diffusion of minor phenolic components, coming from skin and pips to puree and increase polyphenols degradation due to excessively high temperature spot. These results indicate that apple puree processed under vacuum did not present lower organoleptic and nutritional quality compared with fresh apple, as far as sugars, acids, volatiles, polyphenols and fibres were concerned."
"Excitable systems of eukaryotic chemotaxis can generate asymmetric signals of Ras-GTP-enriched domains spontaneously to drive random cell migration without guidance cues. However, the molecules responsible for the spontaneous signal generation remain elusive. Here, we characterized RasGEFs encoded in Dictyostelium discoideum by live-cell imaging of the spatiotemporal dynamics of Ras-GTP and hierarchical clustering, finding that RasGEFX is primarily required for the spontaneous generation of Ras-GTP-enriched domains and is essential for random migration in combination with RasGEFB/M/U in starved cells, and they are dispensable for chemotaxis to chemoattractant cAMP. RasGEFX and RasGEFB that co-localize with Ras-GTP regulate the temporal periods and spatial sizes of the oscillatory Ras-GTP waves propagating along the membrane, respectively, and thus control the protrusions of motile cells differently, while RasGEFU and RasGEFM regulate adhesion and migration speed, respectively. Remarkably, RasGEFX is also important for Ras/PIP3-driven macropinocytosis in proliferating cells, but RasGEFB/M/U are not. These findings illustrate a specific and coordinated control of the cytoskeletal dynamics by multiple RasGEFs for spontaneous motility and macropinocytosis."
"Increasing antibiotic resistance poses an urgent global public health threat and a serious concern worldwide. Bacteriophage (phage) therapy has been identified as a promising alternative to antibiotics for treating bacterial diseases in both humans and animals. The excessive use of antibiotics in aquaculture is a major threat to sustainable aquaculture, promoting the spread of antibiotic resistance in the aquaculture environment and the contamination of aquaculture products with antibiotic residues. Consequently, interest in alternative approaches that reduce reliance on antibiotics has grown within the aquaculture sector. As a promising alternative, extensive phage research targeted at aquaculture has demonstrated the protective efficacy of phages against diseases in aquatic animals. Although numerous studies have employed in vitro models, research supported by in vivo experiments remains scarce. Without in vivo evidence, phage therapy cannot fulfill the requirements of aquaculturists. The first part of this review outlines the bacterial diseases severely affecting the health and survival of aquatic animals. The second part provides updates on phage applications for the therapy and prophylaxis of pathogenic bacterial infection in aquatic animals, including administration routes and key accomplishments. Therefore, this review provides insights into effective real-world phage biocontrol strategies that enable sustainable aquaculture."
"Cooperative interactions profoundly shape individual and collective behaviors of social animals. Successful cooperation requires coordinated efforts by cooperators toward collective goals. However, the underlying behavioral dynamics and neuronal mechanisms within and between cooperating brains remain largely unknown. We recorded intracranial electrophysiological signals from human pairs engaged in a cooperation game. We show that teammate coordination and goal pursuit make distinct contributions to the behavioral cooperation dynamics. Increases and decreases in high-gamma activity in the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and amygdala distinguish between establishing and maintaining cooperation and forecast transitions between these two states. High-gamma activity from distinct neuronal populations encodes teammate coordination and goal pursuit motives, with populations of TPJ neurons preferentially tracking dominant motives of different cooperation states. Across cooperating brains, high-gamma activity in the TPJ and amygdala synchronizes in a state-dependent manner that predicts how well cooperators coordinate. These findings provide fine-grained understandings of human cooperation dynamics as a state-dependent process with distinctive neurocognitive profiles of each state."
"College students' beliefs and attitudes concerning concussion, and masculinity norms, were examined in relation to stigma and willingness to seek treatment for possible concussion. Beliefs were measured using a revised Illness Perception Questionnaire (IPQ)."
"Hepatic sarcomatoid carcinoma (HSC) and hepatic sarcoma (HS) are rare malignancies. Without pathology, the differential diagnosis between these two tumors is difficult due to their frequent overlaps in clinical presentations and imaging features. Currently, there are limited analyses about the ultrasound (US), contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) and contrast-enhanced computer tomography (CECT) characteristics of HSC and HS. Therefore, the purpose of our study is to evaluate the value of US, CEUS and CECT on the differential diagnosis between HSC and HS."
"Tinea corporis (TC) is a common fungal infection affecting 20%-25% of the global population. Though diagnosing TC is straightforward, treatment has become challenging due to the use of certain medications and lack of follow-up, leading to resistance. Andrea et al. proposed Tinea Corporis Score (TCS) to assess and provide follow-up care for TC. However, double tracing was its limitation. We proposed modified Tinea Corporis Score (mTCS) to overcome this limitation."
"In 1783, Alexander Monro secundus maintained that because the brain is enclosed in a case of bone and its substance is nearly incompressible, the quantity of blood within the head must be the same, or very nearly the same, at all times. Years later, this hypothesis was experimentally supported by George Kellie, and became known as the Monro-Kellie doctrine. However, this doctrine encountered resistance. Its reviewers have agreed to point out the historically understandable error of not having considered the CSF as a normal intracranial volume. Yet, almost nothing has been published about some of the physiological, pathophysiological, and therapeutic ideas prevailing at that time that may have influenced Monro's hypothesis. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, it is not clear why Monro, who knew the ventricular system in detail, did not include it as a potential compensatory compartment for changes in the intracranial blood volume."
"This study aimed to evaluate the effects of fiberglass posts on fracture behavior in endodontically treated teeth (ETT) restored with composite veneers. Adult patients who had endodontically treated anterior teeth restored with composite veneers, with or without fiberglass posts, were divided into the case (with fractured teeth) and control (without fractured teeth) groups. All fracture patterns were sorted by a 6-point scoring system: 0, no fracture; 1, veneer buccal fracture; 2, incisal edge fracture; 3, coronal middle-third fracture; 4, coronal cervical fracture; 5, coronal and root fracture; and 6, root fracture. The odds ratio was calculated concerning the outcome (fracture) and exposed factor (post presence). Fracture patterns were analyzed by the Mann-Whitney and Fisher exact tests, with a significance level of 95%. Of the 89 ETT restored with composite veneers (31 with posts; 58 without posts), 30 were fractured. The odds ratio revealed a reduction in fracture risk to 34% compared with ETT without posts. Teeth without posts fractured more frequently, showing more complex fracture patterns. In conclusion, fiberglass posts decreased the risk of fractures in ETT restored with composite veneers."
"Cell cycle-dependent gene expression analysis is particularly important as numerous genes show tightly regulated expression patterns at different phases of the cell cycle. For cancer cells, analysis of cell cycle-related events is of paramount significance since tumorigenesis is characteristically coupled to cell cycle perturbations. RT-qPCR is a highly sensitive technique to investigate cell cycle-dependent transcriptional regulation. However, for reliable evaluation of qPCR data reference genes with stable mRNA expression are required. Although several studies investigating cell cycle-dependent gene expression employ frequently used reference genes, the suitability of these reference genes has not been thoroughly investigated so far. Moreover, such potential reference genes for cell cycle analysis have not been described in the literature. Therefore, we aimed to identify reference genes characterized with stable expression throughout the cell cycle in MOLT4 and U937 human leukemia cell lines synchronized with RO-3306 CDK1 inhibitor using RT-qPCR. Here we show that for cell cycle-dependent gene expression analysis the commonly used TBP is suitable, while the recently recognized reference genes SNW1 and CNOT4 are applicable in a cell line-dependent manner. We also suggest that proper selection of reference genes for each experimental condition is crucial for reliable normalization as these aspects can severely compromise conclusions."
"We assessed the performance of large language models' summarizing clinical dialogues using computational metrics and human evaluations. The comparison was done between automatically generated and human-produced summaries. We conducted an exploratory evaluation of five language models: one general summarisation model, one fine-tuned for general dialogues, two fine-tuned with anonymized clinical dialogues, and one Large Language Model (ChatGPT). These models were assessed using ROUGE, UniEval metrics, and expert human evaluation was done by clinicians comparing the generated summaries against a clinician generated summary (gold standard). The fine-tuned transformer model scored the highest when evaluated with ROUGE, while ChatGPT scored the lowest overall. However, using UniEval, ChatGPT scored the highest across all the evaluated domains (coherence 0.957, consistency 0.7583, fluency 0.947, and relevance 0.947 and overall score 0.9891). Similar results were obtained when the systems were evaluated by clinicians, with ChatGPT scoring the highest in four domains (coherency 0.573, consistency 0.908, fluency 0.96 and overall clinical use 0.862). Statistical analyses showed differences between ChatGPT and human summaries vs. all other models. These exploratory results indicate that ChatGPT's performance in summarizing clinical dialogues approached the quality of human summaries. The study also found that the ROUGE metrics may not be reliable for evaluating clinical summary generation, whereas UniEval correlated well with human ratings. Large language models may provide a successful path for automating clinical dialogue summarization. Privacy concerns and the restricted nature of health records remain challenges for its integration. Further evaluations using diverse clinical dialogues and multiple initialization seeds are needed to verify the reliability and generalizability of automatically generated summaries."
"Depression commonly arises among adolescents who have experienced long-standing psychosocial difficulties, especially those facing chronic illnesses such as sickle cell anemia (SCA). SCA is a global health concern, and Tanzania is one of the countries with a high incidence, estimated at 8,000-11,000 births per year. This study aims to assess the magnitude and factors associated with depression among adolescents with SCA."
"Overcoming resistance to third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as Osimertinib, particularly due to the emergence of the C797S mutation, remains a key challenge in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) therapy. This review highlights recent advancements in the development of fourth-generation EGFR inhibitors that specifically target the catalytic Lys745 residue, aiming to overcome resistance associated with Osimertinib. Both covalent and non-covalent inhibitors targeting Lys745 were explored, using warheads like sulfonyl fluoride, phosphine oxides, esters, and trisubstituted imidazoles. Sulfonyl fluoride was particularly effective in forming covalent bonds with Lys745, while non-covalent analogues demonstrated flexibility with reduced off-target effects. The manuscript highlights the importance of warhead design, molecular docking, protein XRD study and structure-activity relationships (SAR) for optimizing Lys745-targeting inhibitors. The study suggests that hybrid scaffolds combining key pharmacophoric features from Osimertinib and Brigatinib along with Lys745 targeting warheads, could enhance selectivity and potency. Future efforts should focus on refining bioavailability, identifying new scaffolds by employing drug design strategies. Fourth-generation TKIs targeting Lys745 offer a novel therapeutic avenue, potentially overcoming mutation-induced resistance and improving NSCLC treatment outcomes. This approach represents a critical advancement toward durable clinical responses in patients with drug-resistant cancer."
"During the pandemic, there was concern that underascertainment of COVID-19 outcomes may impact treatment effect estimation in pharmacoepidemiologic studies. We assessed the impact of outcome misclassification on the association between inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and COVID-19 hospitalisation and death in the United Kingdom during the first pandemic wave using probabilistic bias analysis (PBA)."
"The healthcare sector has great potential for promoting physical activity (PA) for chronic disease prevention, treatment and management; however, multiple adoption and implementation barriers exist, ranging from practice integration to information flow. In 2016, Exercise is Medicine Greenville (EIMG), a comprehensive clinic-to-community approach that involves PA assessment, recommendation and/or prescription and provider-based referral of patients to community-based PA programmes, was launched by Prisma Health in Greenville, South Carolina, USA. Since inception, variability has emerged in adoption and implementation, impacting patient reach, referral rates and engagement in the community-based PA programmes, highlighting the need for closer evaluation and refinement of strategies to maximise programme impact."
"We compared the visual performance and subjective outcomes of mini-monovision, crossed mini-monovision, and bilateral emmetropia using enhanced monofocal intraocular lenses (IOLs). This retrospective study involved 200 eyes of 100 patients who underwent surgery for bilateral age-related cataract using an enhanced monofocal IOL (TECNIS Eyhance). The dominant eye was identified before surgery. Based on patients' preferences, they were divided into mini-monovision (dominant eye for distance and non-dominant eye for near with 1.0 D anisometropia), crossed mini-monovision (dominant eye for near and non-dominant eye for distance with 1.0 D anisometropia), or bilateral emmetropia groups. There were 32 patients in the mini-monovision group, 28 in the crossed mini-monovision group, and 40 in the emmetropia group. While binocular distance visual acuity was not different among groups, intermediate and near visual acuity was significantly better in the mini-monovision and crossed mini-monovision groups than in the emmetropia group (p < 0.001). The severity of glare and halo, as well as the level of patient satisfaction, did not differ between groups. The rate of spectacle independence was significantly higher in the mini-monovision and crossed mini-monovision groups than in the emmetropia group (p = 0.008). Mini-monovision and crossed mini-monovision approaches using enhanced monofocal IOLs are equally effective in enhancing intermediate and near vision without compromising distance vision, leading to reduced spectacle dependence."
"Isolated craniosynostosis of the sagittal suture results in scaphocephaly characterized by a long, narrow skull. Surgical correction of this condition remains debated, particularly regarding the necessity of directly addressing frontal bossing. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of extended strip craniectomy combined with bilateral barrel staving in improving cranial morphology without direct intervention on the forehead."
"Parental migration plays a significant role in shaping the health outcomes of left-behind children. However, limited research has been conducted on how parental migration impacts the dental health of these children in China. To address this gap, this study aims to investigate the effects of parental migration on the dental health of left-behind children and explore the underlying mechanisms that contribute to these outcomes."
We described clinical outcomes for patients with blunt splenic injuries treated with transarterial embolization (TAE) based on their hemodynamic status.
"Esophagogastric junction outflow obstruction (EGJOO) can be an achalasia variant caused by neuromuscular dysfunction of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), or the manometric manifestation of mechanical processes that impair EGJ distensibility. Distinction among these conditions has important implications for treatment, but can be difficult. We hypothesized that response to botulinum toxin (BT) injection of the LES could be a diagnostic test for identifying achalasia-variant EGJOO likely to respond to LES muscle-directed invasive therapy. We reviewed our experience with symptomatic EGJOO patients who had BT injection of the LES. Data collected include demographics, esophageal body manometry findings, esophagram evidence of retention, and symptom response at 1-6 months after BT injection categorized as poor, partial, or good. Clinical response to any subsequent LES-directed invasive treatment (EsoFLIP dilation, pneumatic dilation, Heller myotomy, or POEM) also was recorded. Thirteen symptomatic EGJOO patients were included (mean age 55.9 ± 16.4 years; eight men, five women). Symptom response to BT injection was good in six (46%), partial in three (23%), and poor in three (23%); one was lost to follow-up. All five patients who received invasive treatment after partial or good response to BT had a partial or good response to invasive treatment. The one patient who had invasive treatment after a poor response to BT had a poor response to invasive treatment. These findings suggest that a good response to BT injection of the LES can identify an achalasia-variant form of EGJOO that will respond to LES muscle-directed invasive therapy."
"Sorafenib (SOR) is the first-line chemotherapeutic therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment, but SOR resistance is a key factor affecting the therapeutic effect. Emerging studies have suggested that circular RNAs (circRNAs) play an important role in the development of drug resistance in HCC cells. This paper aimed to elucidate the potential role and molecular mechanism of circRNA Scm polycomb group protein homolog 1 (circSCMH1) in SOR-resistant HCC cells. CircSCMH1, microRNA-485-5p (miR-485-5p), and hematological and neurological expressed 1 (HN1) contents were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) assay was adopted to detect the SOR sensitivity of cells. Cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis were assessed using colony formation, 5-Ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU), transwell, and flow cytometry assays. Glucose metabolism was analyzed using commercial kits. HN1, B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), and Bcl-2-associated X (Bax) protein levels were assessed using western blot. Binding between miR-485-5p and circSCMH1 or HN1 was verified using a dual-luciferase reporter. Xenograft tumor model was used to explore the function of circSCMH1 in vivo. CircSCMH1 expression and HN1 abundances were increased, but the miR-485-5p level was reduced in SOR-resistant HCC tissues and cells. Deficiency of circSCMH1 enhanced SOR sensitivity by suppressing cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and glucose metabolism and inducing cell apoptosis in SOR-resistant HCC cell lines (Huh7/SOR and Hep3B/SOR). Mechanistically, circSCMH1 sponged miR-485-5p to positively regulate HN1 expression. Importantly, circSCMH1 depletion inhibited tumor growth and increased SOR sensitivity in vivo. CircSCMH1 promoted SOR resistance in HCC cells at least partly through upregulating HN1 expression by sponging miR-485-5p. These findings elucidated a new regulatory pathway of chemo-resistance in SOR-resistant HCC cells and provided a possible circRNA-targeted therapy for HCC."
"On-line counting of the microparticle/bacteria in the liquid medium has great potential in the food safety and biomedical fields. A new low-cost microfluidic device is proposed for the on-line counting of the microparticles/bacteria in the liquid medium. The gradually contracted microchannel and the viscoelastic fluid are combined to achieve the efficient elastic focusing of the particle/bacteria, which significantly improves the counting accuracy by aligning all particles/bacteria in a single position at the center of the microchannel. A simple light resistance-based counting method is designed and integrated with the microchannel, where the low-cost elements including the laser pointer, convex lens, diaphragm, and photodiode, are used to build the optical path of detection. The influence of the flow rate, the particle size, the property of fluid, and the channel structure on the focusing of the particle/bacteria are investigated by the experiment, and the counting ability of the integrated microfluidic device is validated by using different-sized microparticles and the bifidobacterium. With its simple structure, low cost, easy operation, and high efficiency, this microfluidic device is suitable for the commercial applications, such as the on-line counting of the plastic microparticle in water or the colony-forming units (CFU) of bacteria in food."
"Sponges harbor microbial communities that play crucial roles in host health and ecology. However, the genetic adaptations that enable these symbiotic microorganisms to thrive within the sponge environment are still being elucidated. To understand these genetic adaptations, we conducted a comparative genomics analysis on 350 genomes of Actinobacteriota, a phylum commonly associated with sponges."
"Ischemic complications account for significant patient morbidity following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). The Prevention and Treatment of Vasospasm with Clazosentan (REACT) study was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of clazosentan, an endothelin receptor antagonist, in preventing clinical deterioration due to delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) in patients with aSAH."
"Several studies indicate that smoking is one of the major risk factors for bladder cancer. Nicotine and its metabolites, the main components of tobacco, have been found to be strongly linked to the occurrence and progression of bladder cancer. However, the function of nicotine metabolism-related genes (NRGs) in bladder urothelial carcinoma (BLCA) are still unclear."
"The International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury (ISNCSCI) assessment is the gold standard for evaluation of neurological function after spinal cord injury (SCI). Although it is an invaluable tool for diagnostic and research purposes, it is time consuming and can be impractical in acute injury settings. Clinical neurosurgery motor examinations (NMEs) could serve as an expeditious surrogate for SCI research when ISNCSCI motor examinations are not feasible. The aim of this study was to evaluate the agreement between motor examinations performed by the neurosurgery clinical team and ISNCSCI examiners."
"RaceRunning is a sport for disabled people and successful performance depends on reducing the amount of time spent travelling a specific distance. Performance analysis in RaceRunning athletes is based on traditional methods such as recording race time, distances travelled and frequency (sets and reps) that are not sufficient for monitoring training loads. The aims of this study were to monitor training loads in typical training sessions and evaluate technical adaptations in RaceRunning performance by acquiring sensor metrics. Five elite and competitive RaceRunning athletes (18.2 ± 2.3 yrs) at RR2 and RR3 levels were monitored for 8 weeks, performing in their usual training sessions while wearing unobtrusive motion sensors. The motion sensors were attached to the waist and lower leg in all training sessions, each lasting between 80 and 90 min. Performance metrics data collected from the motion sensors included player loads, race loads, work/rest ratio and impact shock directions, along with training factors (duration, frequency, distance, race time and rest time). Results showed that weekly training loads (player and race loads) followed acceptable threshold levels, according to assessment criteria (smallest worthwhile change, acute/chronic work ratio). The relationship between race velocity (performance index) and race load was non-linear and statistically significant, which led to different performance efficiency groups. Wearable motion sensor metrics revealed small to moderate technical adaptations following repeated sprint attempts in temporal running performance, variability and consistency. In conclusion, using a wearable-based system is an effective feedback tool to monitor training quality, revealing important insights into adaptations to training volumes in disabled athletes."
"Nasotracheal intubation is a commonly used technique in elective oral and pharyngeal surgeries. This case report details an incident involving a young adult patient in which an attempt at nasotracheal intubation resulted in a life-threatening cervicofacial and thoracic emphysema. Although complications associated with nasotracheal intubation are rare, their potential severity necessitates a comprehensive preprocedural discussion and risk assessment with the surgical team to confirm its appropriate indication for each individual patient. This case underscores the need for increased awareness and readiness for managing rare but critical complications associated with airway management techniques."
"Plants mount induced resistance and adult-plant resistance against different pathogens throughout the whole growth period. Rice production faces threats from multiple major diseases, including rice blast, sheath blight, and bacterial leaf blight. Here, we report that the miR172a-SNB-MYB30 module regulates both induced and adult-plant resistance to these three major diseases via lignification in rice. Mechanistically, pathogen infections induce the expression of miR172a, which downregulates the transcription factor SNB to release its suppression of MYB30, leading to an increase in lignin biosynthesis and disease resistance throughout the whole growth period. Moreover, expression levels of miR172a and MYB30 gradually increase and are consistently correlated with lignin contents and disease resistance during rice development, reaching a peak at full maturity, whereas SNB RNA levels are negatively correlated with lignin contents and disease resistance, indicating the involvement of the miR172a-SNB-MYB30 module in adult-plant resistance. The functional domain of SNB protein and its binding sites in the MYB30 promoter are highly conserved among more than 4000 rice accessions, while abnormal expression of miR172a, SNB, or MYB30 compromises yield traits, suggesting artificial selection of the miR172a-SNB-MYB30 module during rice domestication. Taken together, these results reveal a novel role for a conserved miRNA-regulated module that contributes significantly to induced and adult-plant resistance against multiple pathogens by increasing lignin accumulation, deepening our understanding of broad-spectrum resistance and adult-plant resistance."

"The Lovisenberg Diakonal Hospital recently introduced an Open-Door Policy in their (formerly) closed psychiatric admission wards for people with a forced admission to an acute psychiatric crisis. Their modern mental health care system is remarkably similar to the Dutch healthcare organization, with shared values and standards, and provides good grounds for an implementation of an Open-Doors Policy in the Netherlands."
"The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of the DBP-8278B Wrist-type Fully Automatic Blood Pressure Monitor in the general population according to the AAMI/ESH/ISO Universal Standard (ISO 81060-2 : 2018/AMD 1 : 2020). The test monitor was used to measure SBP and DBP and pulse rate in the wrists using the oscillometric method. According to this protocol using the same-arm sequential blood pressure measurement method, subjects were recruited to fulfill the age, sex, blood pressure, and cuff distribution criteria of the Universal Standard. A single cuff for wrist sizes of 13.5-21.5 cm was used. A total of 85 subjects were included in this study. According to Criterion 1, the mean difference in SBP between the test device and the reference device was 0.89 mmHg, with a SD of 7.76 mmHg. The mean difference of DBP was -1.44 mmHg, with a SD of 6.23 mmHg. The mean difference between SBP and DBP was less than 5.0 mmHg, and the SD was less than 8.0 mmHg, which met the requirements. According to Criterion 2, the SD of the mean differences of SBP between the test device and the reference device per subject was 5.65 mmHg, which was less than 6.88 mmHg and met the requirements. The SD of the mean differences of DBP between the test device and the reference device per subject was 5.61 mmHg, which was less than 6.78 mmHg and met the requirements. The DBP-8278B Wrist-type Fully Automatic Blood Pressure Monitor met the requirements of the AAMI/ESH/ISO Universal Standard (ISO 81060-2 : 2018/AMD 1 : 2020). It can be recommended for home and clinical use."
"Surgical stabilization of rib fractures (SSRF) has been demonstrated to improve early clinical outcomes. Tube thoracostomy (TT) is commonly performed with SSRF, however there is a paucity of data regarding when removal of TT following SSRF should occur. This study aimed to compare patients undergoing thoracic reinterventions (reintubation, reinsertion of TT/pigtail, or video-assisted thoracic surgery) to those not following SSRF+TT, hypothesizing increased TT output prior to removal would be associated with thoracic reintervention."

"This is a case of a 61-year-old lady who presented to the lipid clinic with possible familial hypercholesterolaemia (Simon Broome Criteria). She was commenced on atorvastatin; however, 4 weeks later, she developed hepatitis, and therefore her atorvastatin was discontinued. Following that, her liver function tests normalized, and she was diagnosed with statin-induced hepatitis. Three years later, she was seen again in the lipid clinic with an uncontrolled lipid profile, and she was commenced on alirocumab, a Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor. A few days later, she developed hepatitis, and subsequently, the alirocumab was discontinued. She underwent a liver biopsy, which confirmed that she had Autoimmune Hepatitis (AIH) with presumed superimposed drug injury. This is the first reported case of autoimmune hepatitis associated with alirocumab."
Skin graft is frequently used for donor site closure after osteocutaneous fibula free flap (OCFFF) harvest when primary closure is not possible.

"Single-cell transcriptomics applied to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for elucidating the pathophysiology of neurologic diseases has produced only a preliminary characterization of CSF immune cells. CSF derives from and borders central nervous system (CNS) tissue, allowing for comprehensive accounting of cell types along with their relative abundance and immunologic profiles relevant to CNS diseases. Using integration techniques applied to publicly available datasets in combination with our own studies, we generated a compendium with 139 subjects encompassing 135 CSF and 58 blood samples. Healthy subjects and individuals across a wide range of diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, COVID-19, and autoimmune encephalitis, were included. We found differences in lymphocyte and myeloid subset frequencies across different diseases as well as in their distribution between blood and CSF. We identified what we believe to be a new subset of AREG+ dendritic cells exclusive to the CSF that was more abundant in subjects with MS compared with healthy controls. Finally, transcriptional cell states in CSF microglia-like cells and lymphoid subsets were elucidated. Altogether, we have created a reference compendium for single-cell transcriptional profiling encompassing CSF immune cells useful to the scientific community for future studies on neurologic diseases."

"Down syndrome (DS) is characterized by severe neurodevelopmental alterations that ultimately lead to the typical hallmark of DS: intellectual disability. In the DS brain, since the prenatal life stages, the number of astrocytes is disproportional compared to the healthy brain. This increase is due to a shift from neuron to astrocyte differentiation during brain development. Astrocytes are involved in numerous functions during brain development, including balancing pro-neurogenic and pro-gliogenic stimuli, sustaining synapse formation, regulating excitatory/inhibitory signal equilibrium, and supporting the maintenance and integration of functional neural circuits. The enhanced number of astrocytes in the brain of DS individuals leads to detrimental consequences for brain development. This review summarizes the mechanisms underlying astrocytic dysfunction in DS, and particularly the dysregulation of key signaling pathways, which promote astrogliogenesis at the expense of neurogenesis. It further examines the implications of astrocytic alterations on dendritic branching, spinogenesis and synaptogenesis, and the impact of the abnormal astrocytic number in neural excitability and in the maintenance of the inhibitory/excitatory balance. Identifying deregulated pathways and the consequences of astrocytic alterations in early DS brain development may help in identifying new therapeutic targets, with the ultimate aim of ameliorating the cognitive disability that affects individuals with DS."
"Lyme disease (LD) is caused by infection with the bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (Bb) through the bite of an infected Ixodes spp. tick. LD has emerged as a public and animal health issue in Canada, with human incidence increasing in part due to the expansion of Ixodes scapularis ticks and their vertebrate hosts. We sought to provide the first comprehensive summary of published tick and animal surveillance literature regarding LD in Canada to describe changes in LD over time."

The diagnostic yield of invasive coronary angiography (ICA) in patients with chronic coronary syndromes (CCS) in contemporary practice is uncertain.
"The dynamics of many macromolecular machines are characterized by chemically mediated structural changes that achieve large-scale functional deployment through local rearrangements of constitutive protein subunits. Motivated by recent high-resolution structural microscopy of a particular class of such machines, contractile injection systems (CISs), we construct a coarse-grained semianalytical model that recapitulates the geometry and bistability of CISs in terms of a minimal set of measurable physical parameters. We use this model to predict the size, shape, and speed of a dynamical actuation front that underlies contraction. Scaling laws for the velocity and physical extension of the contraction front are consistent with our numerical simulations and may be generally applicable to related systems."
"Aminoglycoside antibiotics have played a critical role in the treatment of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial infections. However, antibiotic resistance has severely compromised the efficacy of aminoglycosides. A leading cause of aminoglycoside resistance is mediated by bacterial enzymes that inactivate these drugs via chemical modification. Aminoglycoside nucleotidyltransferase-6 (ANT(6)) enzymes inactivate streptomycin by transferring an adenyl group from ATP to position 6 on the antibiotic. Despite the clinical significance of this activity, ANT(6) enzymes remain relatively uncharacterized. Here, we report the first high resolution x-ray crystallographic structure of ANT(6)-Ib from Campylobacter fetus subsp. fetus bound with streptomycin. Structural modeling and gel filtration chromatography experiments suggest that the enzyme exists as a dimer in which both subunits contribute to the active site. Moreover, superposition of the ANT(6)-Ib structure with the structurally related enzyme lincosamide nucleotidyltransferase B (LinB) permitted the identification of a putative nucleotide binding site. These data also suggest that residues D44 and D46 coordinate essential divalent metal ions and D102 functions as the catalytic base."
"There is an emerging necessity for improved therapies against Candida-related infections, with significant implications for global healthcare. Current antifungal agents, limited in number, target specific pathways, but resistance remains a concern. Flucytosine (5FC) exhibits antifungal activity, particularly against Candida. However, monotherapy efficacy is limited, necessitating combination treatments. Herein, we report PEGylated squalene-based nanocarriers for 5FC loading, aiming to enhance its monotherapy efficacy against Candida strains. The loading of 5FC within micelles was achieved using the ultrasound-assisted solvent evaporation method. The 5FC-loaded micelles, together with non-loaded micelles, were thoroughly characterized and analyzed. STEM and DLS analysis confirmed the core-shell morphology with nanometric dimensions along with improved colloidal stability. The quantification of drug loading efficiency and drug loading capacity was calculated using the UV-Vis technique. The in vitro drug-release studies in simulated physiological conditions showed sustained release within 48 hours. Moreover, the release kinetics calculated using mathematical models showed a Fickian diffusion drug release mechanism in simulated physiological conditions with a slower diffusion rate. The in vitro antifungal activity was tested on Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, and Candida parapsilosis. The results showed improved antifungal activity for the nanotherapeutic and unchanged in vitro toxicity toward normal cells, suggesting promising advancements in 5FC therapy."
"During the spring of 2024, 33 members of a group of Gulf War I veterans wounded in depleted uranium (DU) friendly-fire incidents were seen at the Baltimore VA Medical Center for surveillance related to their combat exposure. The cohort was assessed with a protocol which includes exposure monitoring for total and isotopic uranium (U) concentrations in urine and a comprehensive assessment of health outcomes including measures of bone metabolism and bone mineral density (BMD). An audiometry examination of the cohort was added to assess for acoustic trauma and toxic metal effects in this surveillance episode marking over 30 years since this exposure event. Elevated urine U concentrations were detected in cohort members with retained DU shrapnel fragments. In addition, a measure of bone resorption, N-telopeptide, determined in urine, exhibited a significant increase in the high DU sub-group. In addition, and similar to our previous surveillance report, a significant decrease was found in bone mass in the high DU sub-group compared to the low DU sub-group. It has been 30 years since the first surveillance visit occurred. An aging cohort of military veterans continues to demonstrate few U-related adverse health effects in known target organs attributed to U toxicity exposure. The new finding of impaired BMD in older cohort members has now been detected in three consecutive surveillance visits. This is a biologically plausible outcome related to the diminished bone mass in those with an elevated DU burden in combination with advancing age. The accumulating U burden derived from fragment absorption over time and the effect of aging on bone mineral loss recommends that our surveillance efforts need to continue. Our findings enable early detection of bone effects and other signs of target organ insult, which may occur when tissue injury thresholds are reached in the future and thus, permitting indicated medical management."
"Seed endophytes are actively used by the mother plant as both reservoir and vector of beneficial microbes. During seed dormancy endophytes experience significant physiochemical changes and only competent endophytes could colonise successfully in seeds and some of them act as obligate endophyte that are transmitted vertically across generations. The adaptive nature of endophytes allows them to switch lifestyles depending on environment and host conditions. In this review, instead of providing broad discussion on applicability of endophytes in plant growth improvement, the fundamental nature of endophytes, their survival strategies under stress conditions, transmittance, etc. have been broadly highlighted by collaborating recent discoveries and theories. We have also tried to differentiate endophyte with their pathogenic counterpart and their survival mechanism during seed dormancy stages. Critical analyses of physio-biochemical changes in seeds during maturation and parallel modifications of life styles of seed endophytes along with pathogens will enlighten the shaded part of seed-microbiome interactions. The mutualistic interrelations as well as their shipment towards pathogenic behaviour under stress are being discussed acutely. Finally, importances of conservation of seed microbiome to maintain seed quality and vigour have been pointed out. Throughout the manuscript, the knowledge gap on seed-microbiota have been mentioned, thus, in future, studies on these areas could help us to understand properly the actual role of endophytes for the betterment of maintaining seed quality and vigour."
"This study aimed to understand the perspectives of key stakeholders regarding strategies for better supporting culturally and ethnically diverse family caregivers, aiming to incorporate them into the Recognize, Assist, Include, Support, and Engage (RAISE) Family Caregivers Advisory Council's proposed National Strategy. The Strategy, published in 2022, identified priority actions to support the growing population of people providing unpaid care to people of all ages with disabilities, with a goal of improving the health and well-being of both the family caregiver and the person receiving support. Researchers conducted extensive outreach to purposively diverse stakeholder organizations, using six stakeholder strategy sessions with representatives from 42 groups in December 2020 to identify preliminary themes. During July-October 2021, 17 key informant interviews and 16 stakeholder listening sessions were held, involving 103 different organizations. Qualitative data analysis using an inductive approach was used to identify key themes. A significant issue for diverse caregivers is widespread lack of self-identification as caregivers, which is tied to a lack of awareness of potentially helpful services and supports; culturally appropriate outreach is critical to ensure access to services, as well as access to centralized resources and funding for community- and faith-based organizations. A community health worker model was recommended. Tailored activities, involving trusted community- and faith-based groups, as well as investments in caregiver- and culturally-specific supports, are critical for reaching the diverse family caregivers who most need supports. Raising awareness of caregiving among and taking advantage of the expertise of professionals working with diverse communities is also crucial."
"An aberrant right subclavian artery (ARSA) is a rare vascular anomaly accompanied by nonrecurrent inferior laryngeal nerve (NRILN). Here, we described the cervical-first approach in thoracoscopic esophagectomy for an esophageal cancer patient with ARSA using the intraoperative nerve monitoring (IONM) system. First, a left cervical procedure proceeded to expose the left vagus nerve to attach the APS electrode of the IONM system, and the left cervical paraesophageal lymph nodes was dissected separately. Subsequently, the NRILN was identified using the IONM system by tracing the right vagal nerve with intermittent manual stimulation. In the thoracoscopic procedures, the right vagal nerve was traced cranially from the bronchial bifurcation, and the dissection continued through the cervicothoracic border up to NRILN without difficulty. Continuous nerve monitoring can ensure safe left upper mediastinal dissection ensuring the left recurrent laryngeal nerve integrity in the narrow upper mediastinum. The postoperative course was uneventful and, the patient was discharged on postoperative Day 21. In patients with ARSA, the cervical-first method in thoracoscopic esophagectomy with IONM is a safer alternative, and left upper mediastinal dissection by the dorsal approach over the esophagus is useful in the restricted space of the upper mediastinum."
"Osteochondral and chondral injuries of the patellofemoral joint are common in active patients, and effective management requires a thorough physical and imaging evaluation, a detailed understanding of the unique anatomic and biomechanical joint properties contributing to these injuries, and an appropriate selection of treatment modality. Diagnosis of patellofemoral chondral injuries can be challenging, and differentiating between various causes of anterior knee pain is crucial to successful outcomes. Once identified, nonsurgical treatments including physical therapy, bracing, and injections are a mainstay of initial management. Surgical interventions for patellofemoral chondral injuries include palliative, restorative, and reconstructive techniques. It is important to consider overall limb alignment and patellar tracking in these patients to determine the appropriate role of realignment osteotomy procedures in addition to directly addressing the chondral lesion. An understanding of the array of multiple nonsurgical and surgical treatment modalities can allow for improvement in symptoms and function for this challenging clinical problem."
"Neogenin (NEO1) is a ubiquitously expressed transmembrane protein. It interacts with hemojuvelin (HJV). Both NEO1 and HJV play pivotal roles in iron homeostasis by inducing hepcidin expression in the liver. Our previous studies demonstrated that this process depends on Neo1-Hjv interaction and showed that the Hjv-mediated hepcidin expression is correlated with the accumulation of a truncated and membrane-associated form of Neo1. In this study, we tested whether hepcidin expression is induced by increased γ-secretase-mediated cleavage of Neo1 in the liver. We found that Neo1 underwent cleavage of its ectodomain and intracellular domains by α- and γ-secretases, respectively, in hepatoma cells. Our in vitro studies suggest that γ-secretase is responsible for cleavage and release of the cytoplasmic domain of Neo1 in the Hjv-Neo1 complex. This process was enhanced by the inhibition of α-secretase proteolysis and by co-expression with the Neo1-binding partner, Alk3. Further in vivo studies indicated that Neo1 induction of hepcidin expression required γ-secretase cleavage. Interestingly, neither predicted form of γ-secretase-cleaved Neo1 was able to induce hepcidin when separately expressed in hepatocyte-specific Neo1 KO mice. These results imply that the function of Neo1 requires a de novo γ-secretase proteolysis. Additional studies revealed that in addition to the Hjv-binding domains, the function of Neo1 also required its C-terminal intracellular domain and the N-terminal immunoglobulin-like domains that are involved in Neo1 binding to Alk3. Together, our data support the idea that Neo1 induction of hepcidin is initiated as a full-length form and requires a de novo γ-secretase cleavage of Neo1's cytoplasmic domain."
"Low bone mineral density is highly prevalent in sickle cell disease (SCD); whether bisphosphonates can safely preserve or increase bone mass in SCD adults remains unknown. In this study, lumbar spine bone density remained stable with alendronate use, and treatment-related side effects were mostly mild and self-limited."

"This clinical consensus statement of the European Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions was developed in association with the European Society of Cardiology Working Group on Cardiovascular Surgery. It aims to define procedural and contemporary technical requirements that may improve the efficacy and safety of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), both in the acute phase and at long-term follow-up, in a high-risk cohort of patients on optimal medical therapy when clinical and anatomical high-risk criteria are present that entail unacceptable surgical risks, precluding the feasibility of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). This document pertains to patients with surgical contraindication according to the Heart Team, in whom medical therapy has failed (e.g., residual symptoms), and for whom the Heart Team estimates that revascularisation may have a prognostic benefit (e.g., left main, last remaining vessel, multivessel disease with large areas of ischaemia); however, there is a lack of data regarding the size of this patient population. This document aims to guide interventional cardiologists on how to proceed with PCI in such high-risk patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction after the decision of the Heart Team is made that CABG - which overall is the guideline-recommended option for revascularisation in these patients - is not an option and that PCI may be beneficial for the patient. Importantly, when a high-risk PCI is planned, a multidisciplinary decision by interventional cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, anaesthetists and non-invasive physicians with expertise in heart failure management and intensive care should be agreed upon after careful consideration of the possible undesirable consequences of PCI, including futility, similar to the approach for structural interventions."
"In the current era of immune therapy, lenvatinib (LEN) continues to be vital for treating unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC) patients. This study investigates the importance of nutritional status in the prognosis of uHCC patients receiving LEN and evaluates a new prognostic scoring system that combines the geriatric nutritional risk index (GNRI) and systemic inflammatory response. From 2018 to 2022, 484 uHCC patients treated with LEN (384 males, median age 73). Prognostic value was compared between GNRI and C-reactive protein (CRP) scoring (GNRI-C score), GNRI, and neo-Glasgow prognostic score (neo-GPS). Evaluation was based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and concordance index(c-index). Median progression-free survival (mPFS) was 9.3/6.8/4.6 months for GNRI no-risk/low-risk/moderate-to-major risk (p < 0.01, AIC 4742.4/c-index 0.585). Median overall survival (mOS) was 27.8/15.2/9.5 months (p < 0.01, AIC 3433.34/c-index 0.639). For GNRI-C score, mPFS was 10.8/7.1/5.6/4.0 months (score 0/1/2/3) (p < 0.01, AIC 4732.82/c-index 0.6), while neo-GPS showed mPFS of 8.5/5.1/5.2 months (p < 0.01, AIC 4745.89/c-index 0.562). For mOS, GNRI-C score demonstrated 28.6/20.0/10.1/8.4 months (score 0/1/2/3) (p < 0.01, AIC 3420.27/c-index 0.652), while neo-GPS indicated 21.0/12.4/4.5 months (p < 0.01, AIC 3468.84/c-index 0.564). The newly devised GNRI-C score, incorporating nutritional and inflammatory markers, could offer improved prognostic predictions for uHCC patients treated with LEN."
Oncologic mastectomy in the setting of obesity poses challenges in achieving a flat closure that includes the lateral adiposity. The angel wing (AW) technique was developed to address this issue. We aim to demonstrate the safety of AW by evaluating incidence of arm lymphedema (AL) and decreased range of motion (dROM) in patients postmastectomy with and without the AW closure.
"With the rising number of elderly surgical patients, selecting an appropriate anesthetic tailored to their specific needs is essential. Ciprofol, a novel intravenous anesthetic, has garnered attention due to its low injection pain rate and minimal impact on the circulatory system. This meta-analysis aims to examine the efficacy and safety profile of ciprofol during perioperative management of elderly patients."
"Green coffee beans, rejected for commercial use because of glyphosate contamination, were examined to monitor their glyphosate levels from harvest, through roasting, until various coffee extractions. The green beans, Arabica and Robusta, exhibited glyphosate levels above the EU-MRL (0.14-0.21 mg/kg), representing a worst-case scenario. The beans were roasted to different degrees and subsequently used for different coffee preparations. As a result of roasting (>200 °C), glyphosate contents were reduced, frequently by more than 73%. Remarkably, up to 9% of initial glyphosate was removed together with the silverskin, already at lower temperatures. Filtered and instant coffee beverages prepared from respective coffee samples resulted in virtually quantitative glyphosate transfer. Glyphosate transfer was significantly less for espresso, and ristretto, apparently due to the reduced amounts of water used for extraction. Aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) was not detectable on any process level, confirming that AMPA is not a thermal glyphosate degradation product. In conclusion, compelling evidence is provided that glyphosate contamination becomes considerably reduced during roasting, whereas beverage preparation contributes at best to a minor further reduction. In consequence, even unusually high initial glyphosate loads in green beans are strongly reduced by the roasting process, resulting in a final cup content of <0.4 µg."
"Psoriasis is a chronic skin condition that is associated with persistent inflammation and skin lesions. Topical therapy has been a promising approach to the alleviation of psoriasis through the application of anti-inflammatory agents. Phosphatidylserine (PS) administration has shown anti-inflammatory effects in the trials. Consequently, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of topical PS on the potential improvement of an imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriasis model. Additionally, cyclosporine A was utilized as a comparative anti-psoriatic agent in our study."
"Chironomidae have a wide distribution in Neotropical aquatic ecosystems and are predominant in the macroinvertebrate biota of these ecosystems, such as shallow lakes and swamps. In recent years, there has been a notable increase in research efforts aimed at understanding the biology of chironomid, and research on the bionomy of this group is still limited. Therefore, the objective of this study was to describe the growth and development of Chironomus calligraphus and Goeldichironomus holoprasinus, maintained under controlled laboratory conditions. The ovigerous masses of C. calligraphus and G. holoprasinus were collected and kept in the laboratory in 2-L plastic trays containing distilled water under constant aeration at 20 °C and photoperiod of 12/12 h. After hatching, three subjects from each posture were removed for ventralcephalic capsule length, cephalic capsule width, body length, and total body length. We determine the growth curve, daily growth rate, Dyar's rule, and larval instars. We followed the growth and development of C. calligraphus for 14 days and G. holoprasinus for 13 days. The growth ratio of Dyar was 1.30 for C. calligraphus and 1.48 for G. holoprasinus. The larvae developed in a short period and the species was easy to maintain in the laboratory. These species are therefore promising for use in toxicological studies."
"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss among adults. This study evaluates Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) vessel density (VD) as a marker for DR in diabetes mellitus (DM) patients. An observational study was conducted with 47 type 2 DM patients and 21 healthy controls. OCTA measured superficial and deep retinal VD in the parafoveal region. Statistical analyses, including logistic regression and ROC curve analysis, were used to assess the association between VD and DR presence. Results showed that DM patients had lower parafoveal superficial (46.73 vs. 52.37%, p = 0.002) and deep VD (50.35 vs. 54.26%, p = 0.019) compared to controls. Within the DM group, DR patients had lower VD in the superior parafoveal superficial layer (p = 0.042) and temporal parafoveal deep layer (p = 0.035). ROC analysis identified a cutoff of 51.86% for the temporal deep parafoveal VD, with an AUC of 0.697 (p = 0.035) and 81.8% sensitivity for DR discrimination. Reduced VD in the temporal deep parafoveal region is linked to a higher DR likelihood. OCTA-derived VD metrics offer promise for early DR detection and underscore the importance of monitoring vascular changes in DM patients."
"It has been hypothesized that the biopsychosocial stress associated with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, in combination with the immunological effects of SARS-CoV-2 and pancreatic β-cell dysfunction, may contribute to the onset of type 1 diabetes (T1D) in children. In this study, we documented the incidences of T1D in Yamanashi Prefecture, Japan, from 1986 to 2018, and expanded the analysis to include cases from 2019 to 2022 to evaluate the potential influence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on T1D incidence. The COVID-19 pandemic period was defined as 2020 to 2022. Data spanning from 1986 to 2022 were analyzed in annual increments, while data from 1987 to 2022 were analyzed in 3-year interval increments using Joinpoint regression analysis. Across all analyses, no joinpoints were identified, and a consistent linear increase was observed. These findings suggest that there was no statistically significant change in the incidence of T1D attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic in Yamanashi Prefecture. The annual increase in the incidence was calculated to be 3.384% per year, while the increase in the 3-year interval incidence was calculated to be 2.395% per year. Although the incidence of pediatric T1D among children aged 0-14 years in Yamanashi Prefecture increased during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2022), this trend appeared to be a continuation of the pre-2019 increase. The direct or indirect impact of COVID-19 on this trend could not be conclusively determined due to the limited number of cases included in this study."
"This article discusses the meanings of differentiated health care guideline given by health professionals from the Indigenous Health Multidisciplinary Team (EMSI) who work at the Alto Rio Negro Special Indigenous Health District (DSEI-ARN). This exploratory, descriptive, analytical, and qualitative study conducted 15 semi-structured interviews with professionals from the Indigenous Health Multidisciplinary Teams of the DSEI-ARN, which were submitted to content analysis. The four meaning cores identified from the analyses were: Differentiated care as a way of providing primary care in the territory; Actions conducted under the population's cultural differences; Self-care, traditional medicine, and the construction of therapeutic itineraries; and Professionals' challenges and difficulties in addressing traditional indigenous health care. In the professionals' perspective, differentiated health care is linked to the conditions for working in this primary care type. For their performance, they refer to the need to respect the cultural differences of the Indigenous population. Professionals recognize the use and effectiveness of Indigenous practices, knowledge, and regional specificities."
Understanding the diversity and distribution of fungal communities at a regional scale is important since fungi play a crucial role in ecosystem functioning. Our study used environmental metagenomics to determine fungal communities in mountainous forest soils in the central highlands of Mexico.
"Carmustine is used in the treatment of glioblastoma (GBM). GBM is a well-known life-threatening type of cancerous tumor. GBM covers 60.00% among all primary brain tumors, with an occurrence of 74,000 cases across the globe. Management for GBM is still very difficult because most of the medicines are unable to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The present work observed that flexible liposomes embedded in situ nasal gel of carmustine is the best brain-targeted medicine delivery system for the management of GBM through the nasal route."
"Reputation is the most important intangible asset of merchants. In the e-commerce platform market, reputation information has become an important signal of product quality. However, with increasingly fierce competition among merchants on these platforms, violations of reputation information, such as ""click farming,"" ""cash rebate for favorable comments,"" and ""pay per click,"" have caused information asymmetry and adverse selection. Based on the network externality perspective, considering the duopoly e-commerce platform market, this paper uses game theory to construct a theoretical model to compare and analyze the changes in consumers, merchants, platforms, and social total welfare when the reputation information of e-commerce products is symmetric and asymmetric. The research results show that when the reputation information of e-commerce products is symmetrical, the reputation mechanism of the e-commerce platform can play a positive role, the platform income decreases, and the consumer surplus and the total social welfare level increase. The increment increases with the increase in consumer-side network externality, and the e-commerce platform transfers part of the surplus value to consumers. Due to the influence of network externality, reputation information asymmetry, and violation penalty cost, reputation asymmetry decreases consumer, merchant, and total social welfare and increases platform profits, indicating that the e-commerce platform lacks the economic motivation to govern the violation of reputation information. We recommend that the healthy development of e-commerce platforms proceeds from three aspects: building a reputation mechanism for e-commerce platforms that is jointly supervised by e-commerce platforms, third-party institutions, and social organizations; increasing the cost of punishment for violations; and exerting platform network effects to enhance the competitiveness of enterprises."
"Epigenetic modifications have been proved to play important roles in the spinal degenerative diseases.

"Because tertiary centres are generally situated at urban sites, it is unclear whether patients in rural areas have the same access to surgical services that patients in urban areas do. We sought to map the North American evidence landscape of how rurality affects access to medically indicated surgeries and identify system-, patient-, and provider-level barriers that preclude urban-comparable care."
"The Ollie movement is about the most dangerous fundamental skateboarding skill. This study proposed a peak heuristic algorithm to detect the key temporal events of the Ollie movement during skateboarding using IMUs. The proposed algorithm was used to detect four key temporal events including take-off (TO), peak flight height (HP), front wheel landing (FL), and back wheel landing (RL). Based on these temporal events, three temporal phases including ascending, descending, and flight were identified. The results showed that our proposed method could help accurately identify these key temporal events and phases. Knowledge of the temporal information about the Ollie movement could provide a basis for quantitative assessment of riders' performance and injury risks. Practically, this proposed algorithm can benefit the outdoor injury risk monitoring of the skateboarding movement."
"Sarcopenia is a prevalent condition associated with worse clinical outcomes in hospitalized patients. The SARC-CalF is an accurate instrument for its screening; however, it includes the calf circumference (CC) measure as a criterion, which is influenced by adiposity. An adjustment for CC based on body mass index (BMI) has been proposed, but the literature lacks studies evaluating the SARC-CalF using adjusted CC."
"SCN2A gene-related early-infantile developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (EI-DEE) is a rare and severe disorder that manifests in early infancy. SCN2A mutations affecting the fast inactivation gating mechanism can result in altered voltage dependence and incomplete inactivation of the encoded neuronal Nav1.2 channel and lead to abnormal neuronal excitability. In this study, we evaluated clinical data of seven missense Nav1.2 variants associated with DEE and performed molecular dynamics simulations, patch-clamp electrophysiology and dynamic clamp real-time neuronal modelling to elucidate the molecular and neuron-scale phenotypic consequences of the mutations. The N1662D mutation almost completely prevented fast inactivation without affecting activation. The comparison of wild-type and N1662D channel structures suggested that the ambifunctional hydrogen bond formation between residues N1662 and Q1494 is essential for fast inactivation. Fast inactivation could also be prevented with engineered Q1494A or Q1494L Nav1.2 channel variants, whereas Q1494E or Q149K variants resulted in incomplete inactivation and persistent current. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed a reduced affinity of the hydrophobic IFM-motif to its receptor site with N1662D and Q1494L variants relative to wild-type. These results demonstrate that the interactions between N1662 and Q1494 underpin the stability and the orientation of the inactivation gate and are essential for the development of fast inactivation. Six DEE-associated Nav1.2 variants, with mutations mapped to channel segments known to be implicated in fast inactivation were also evaluated. Remarkably, the L1657P variant also prevented fast inactivation and produced biophysical characteristics that were similar to those of N1662D, whereas the M1501V, M1501T, F1651C, P1658S and A1659V variants resulted in biophysical properties that were consistent with gain-of-function and enhanced action potential firing of hybrid neurons in dynamic action potential clamp experiments. Paradoxically, low densities of N1662D or L1657P currents potentiated action potential firing, whereas increased densities resulted in sustained depolarization. Our results provide novel structural insights into the molecular mechanism of Nav1.2 channel fast inactivation and inform treatment strategies for SCN2A-related EI-DEE. The contribution of non-inactivating Nav1.2 channels to neuronal excitability may constitute a distinct cellular mechanism in the pathogenesis of SCN2A-related DEE."
"In maize breeding, enhancing yield through genetic insights is crucial yet challenged by the complex interplay of agronomic traits. This study utilized a diallel mating design involving nine advanced early maize lines to dissect the genetic architecture underlying key agronomic traits and their impact on yield. Over two consecutive years (2018-2019 and 2019-2020), 36 hybrids derived from these lines were grown across two locations, Karaj, Alborz, Iran and Kermanshah (2019-2020), Iran, in a randomized complete block design with three replications. The study aimed to evaluate the general combining ability of the parental lines and the specific combining ability of their hybrids, alongside the mutual influences of critical traits on yield. The analysis of variance revealed significant differences at 1% and 5% probability levels among the hybrids for all traits studied, indicating substantial genetic variability. Diallel analysis suggested that both additive and non-additive genetic effects are crucial in controlling traits such as kernel yield, kernel rows, kernel in row, 1000 kernel weight, plant height, ear height, kernel moisture, and ear wood. Additive effects, as indicated by the Baker's ratio, predominated for these traits. Among the parental lines, KE 79,017/3211 demonstrated the strongest general combining ability for kernel yield. Hybrids K 1264/5-1 × KE 76,009/311, KE 77,005/2 × KE 75,016/321, KE 77,008/1 × KE 77,004/1, and KE 77,008/1 × KE 79,017/3211 exhibited significant and positive specific combining ability effects for kernel yield, highlighting their potential in yield-enhancing breeding programs. Correlation analysis showed no significant association between KY*KIN with the KY*KW. However, there were weak positive correlations between KY*KR with other traits such as KY*PH, KY*KR, and KY*EH. The biplot analyses identified genotypes 4, 12, and 31 as superior across various trait combinations. Genotype 12 emerged as notably high-yielding based on average tester coordinates. Using the multi-trait stability index and imposing a selection pressure of 25%, genotype 10 was ranked highest, followed by genotypes 9, 13, 11, 1, 2, and 16, which were considered the most stable and ideal across all evaluated traits. This comprehensive study underscores the importance of both general combining ability and specific combining ability in maize breeding and highlights specific genotypes and hybrid combinations with promising traits for yield enhancement."

"Stress has been considered as a major risk factor for depressive disorders, triggering depression onset via inducing persistent dysfunctions in specialized brain regions and neural circuits. Among various regions across the brain, the lateral habenula (LHb) serves as a critical hub for processing aversive information during the dynamic process of stress accumulation, thus having been implicated in the pathogenesis of depression. LHb neurons integrate aversive valence conveyed by distinct upstream inputs, many of which selectively innervate the medial part (LHbM) or lateral part (LHbL) of LHb. LHb subregions also separately assign aversive valence via dissociable projections to the downstream targets in the midbrain which provides feedback loops. Despite these strides, the spatiotemporal dynamics of LHb-centric neural circuits remain elusive during the progression of depression-like state under stress. In this review, we attempt to describe a framework in which LHb orchestrates aversive valence via the input-output specific neuronal architecture. Notably, a physiological form of Hebbian plasticity in LHb under multiple stressors has been unveiled to incubate neuronal hyperactivity in an input-specific manner, which causally encodes chronic stress experience and drives depression onset. Collectively, the recent progress and future efforts in elucidating LHb circuits shed light on early interventions and circuit-specific antidepressant therapies."
"Centromeres are essential for chromosome segregation in eukaryotes, yet their specification is unexpectedly diverse among species and can involve major transitions such as those from localized to chromosome-wide centromeres between monocentric and holocentric species. How this diversity evolves remains elusive. We discovered within-cell variation in the recruitment of the major centromere protein CenH3, reminiscent of variation typically observed among species. While CenH3-containing nucleosomes are distributed in a monocentric fashion on autosomes and bind tandem repeat sequences specific to individual or groups of chromosomes, they show a longitudinal distribution and broad intergenic binding on the X chromosome, which partially recapitulates phenotypes known from holocentric species. Despite this variable CenH3 distribution among chromosomes, all chromosomes are functionally monocentric, marking the first instance of a monocentric species with chromosome-wide CenH3 deposition. Together, our findings illustrate a potential transitional state between mono- and holocentricity or toward CenH3-independent centromere determination and help to understand the rapid centromere sequence divergence between species."
"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized the treatment of many malignant tumors. However, ICI-induced hyper-immune activation causes cardiotoxicity. Traditional treatments such as glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants have limited effectiveness and may even accelerate tumor growth. This study aimed to identify approaches that effectively reduce cardiotoxicity and simultaneously preserve or enhance the antitumor immunity of ICI therapy."
"Olfactory deficits are increasingly recognized in a variety of neurological, neurodevelopmental, psychiatric, and viral diseases. While the pathology underlying olfactory loss is likely to differ across diseases, one shared feature may be an immune response mediated by microglia. Microglia orchestrate the brain's response to environmental insults and maintain neurodevelopmental homeostasis. Here, we explore the potential involvement of microglia in olfactory development and loss in disease. The effects of microglia-mediated immune response during development may be of special relevance to the olfactory system, which is unique in both its vulnerability to environmental insults as well as its extended period of neurogenesis and neuronal migration."
"Virus-derived small interfering RNAs (vsiRNAs) have been widely recognized to play an antiviral immunity role. However, it is unclear whether vsiRNAs can also play a positive role in viral infection. Here, we characterized three highly abundant vsiRNAs mapped to the genomic termini of rice stripe virus (RSV), a negative-strand RNA virus transmitted by insect vectors. The three vsiRNAs shared 11 nucleotides due to the conservative genomic termini and were likely generated from viral terminal panhandle structure, depending on both Dicer1 and Dicer2 in insects. In addition to targeting viral RNAs in a miRNA-like manner, the three vsiRNAs coordinately downregulated the expression of DOPA decarboxylase, thereby suppressing the prophenoloxidase immune reaction in insect vectors. In vsiRNA-silenced transgenic rice, the viral titer significantly decreased, indicating that these vsiRNAs promote RSV replication in rice. This study elucidates a unique function of vsiRNAs derived from the conserved panhandle structure of negative-strand RNA viruses in enhancing viral infection."
"Polymyxins have been regarded as last-line treatment for multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacterial infections. Nonetheless, concerns regarding toxicity persist. This study aimed to explore and compare potential adverse events (AEs) between colistin and polymyxin B (PMB)."
"Protein evolution is central to molecular adaptation and largely characterized by modular rearrangements of domains, the evolutionary and structural building blocks of proteins. Genetic events underlying protein rearrangements are relatively rare compared to changes of amino-acids. Therefore, these events can be used to characterize and reconstruct major events of molecular adaptation by comparing large data sets of proteomes."

"The content and composition of intramuscular fat (IMF) affect the cooked meat palatability such as tenderness and juiciness. Thus, elucidation of lipid deposition and its composition in goat IMF is necessary. Here, Jianzhou big-ear goats with higher IMF content is associated with lower mRNA level of LKB1 gene, compared with those of Chuannan black goats. Functionally, knockdown of LKB1 promoted intramuscular adipocyte lipid accumulation. Next, LC-MS/MS based pseudo target analysis found that 409 lipids existed in goat intramuscular adipocytes, of which polyunsaturated fatty acids accounted for most lipids. Compared with the control, 78 differential lipids were screened in the siLKB1 group, enriched in the triacylglycerols and fatty acids subclasses. The combined analysis between lipidomic and published transcriptomic data showed that siLKB1 enhanced polyunsaturated fatty acids synthesis through upregulation expression of HACD4. Finally, the promotion of lipid accumulation and polyunsaturated fatty acids synthesis in the LKB1 knockdown cells were partly rescued by ablation of HACD4. Collectively, these data provide a genetic target to produce PUFA enriched functional goat meat and expand new insights into improvement of meat quality."
"During crime scene investigations, numerous traces are secured and may be used as evidence for the evaluation of source and/or activity level propositions. The rapid chemical analysis of a biological trace enables the identification of body fluids and can provide significant donor profiling information, including age, sex, drug abuse, and lifestyle. Such information can be used to provide new leads, exclude from, or restrict the list of possible suspects during the investigative phase. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art labelling techniques to identify the most suitable visual enhancer to be implemented in a lateral flow immunoassay setup for the purpose of trace identification and/or donor profiling. Upon comparison, and with reference to the strengths and limitations of each label, the simplistic one-step analysis of noncompetitive lateral flow immunoassay (LFA) together with the implementation of carbon nanoparticles (CNPs) as visual enhancers is proposed for a sensitive, accurate, and reproducible in situ trace analysis. This approach is versatile and stable over different environmental conditions and external stimuli. The findings of the present comparative analysis may have important implications for future forensic practice. The selection of an appropriate enhancer is crucial for a well-designed LFA that can be implemented at the crime scene for a time- and cost-efficient investigation."
"Despite improvements in our understanding of elbow biomechanics and implant design, early revision are higher following total elbow arthroplasty (TEA) compared with hip and knee arthroplasty. Revision TEA remains a standard but technically challenging procedure with the potential for substantial morbidity. This review discusses the diagnosis and management of the failed primary TEA. Current concepts related to surgical treatment with revision TEA indicated for prosthetic joint infection, periprosthetic fracture, and aseptic osteolysis will be reviewed. In addition, strategies and adjunctive procedures for dealing with bone loss in the revision setting will be discussed."

"Understanding how natural and engineered peptides enter cells would facilitate the elucidation of biochemical mechanisms underlying cell biology and is pivotal for developing effective intracellular targeting strategies. In this study, we demonstrate that our peptide stapling technique, fluorine-thiol displacement reaction (FTDR), can produce flexibly constrained peptides with significantly improved cellular uptake, particularly into the nucleus. This platform confers enhanced flexibility, which is further amplified by the inclusion of a D-amino acid, while maintaining environment-dependent α helicity, resulting in highly permeable peptides without the need for additional cell-penetrating motifs. Targeting the estrogen receptor α (ERα)-coactivator interaction prevalent in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancers, we showcased that FTDR-stapled peptides, notably SRC2-LD, achieved superior internalization, including cytoplasmic and enriched nuclear uptake, compared to peptides stapled by ring-closing metathesis. These FTDR-stapled peptides use different mechanisms of cellular uptake, including energy-dependent transport such as actin-mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis. As a result, FTDR peptides exhibit enhanced antiproliferative effects despite their slightly decreased target affinity. Our findings challenge existing perceptions of cell permeability, emphasizing the possibly incomplete understanding of the structural determinants vital for cellular uptake of peptide-like macromolecules. Notably, while α helicity and lipophilicity are positive indicators, they alone are insufficient to determine high-cell permeability, as evidenced by our less helical, more flexible, and less lipophilic FTDR-stapled peptides."
"Shared decision making is a concept essential to establishing meaningful goals of care that reflect one's preferences, values, beliefs, culture, and quality of life. This rapid review considered shared decision making from the perspective of seriously ill or medically complex children receiving inpatient palliative or end-of-life care, where shared decision making is made on behalf of and in the child's best interest. A total of 118 articles were screened, resulting in the selection of 12 articles using a systematic process. Emergent themes noted and discussed include the roles of family and clinicians, explorative communication, transparency, cultural implications, and ethical challenges."
"A microRNA with a non-canonical precursor structure harbours an intron in between its miRNA-5p and miRNA-3p relevant for its biogenesis, is conserved across Solanaceae, and targets the mRNA of low phosphate root. Hundreds of miRNAs have been identified in plants and great advances have been accomplished in the understanding of plant miRNA biogenesis, mechanisms and functions. Still, many miRNAs, particularly those with less conventional features, remain to be discovered. Likewise, additional layers of regulation from miRNA generation to action and turnover are still being revealed. The current study describes a microRNA not previously identified given its unusual intron-split stem-loop structure, that has been previously observed only within the monocot-specific miRNA444 family. It shows its conservation across a branch of Solanales including agriculturally relevant Solanaceae family, where its transcripts had already been predicted in several species within sequence databases. The miRNA is absent in Arabidopsis thaliana but present in Solanum lycopersicum, Nicotiana benthamiana, Petunia axillaris, and Ipomoea nil. It proves that at least two different pri-miRNA variants are produced from this miRNA gene, one spliced and the other one retaining the intron. It demonstrates the dual function of its intron in the miRNA biogenesis. On the one hand, its presence in the pri-miRNA positively influences mature miRNA accumulation, but on the other hand, it needs to be removed from the pri-miRNA for efficient mature miRNA production. Finally, it sets low phosphate root as one of its targets, a protein known to be involved in root growth regulation under phosphate starvation in other plant species."

"Miniaturized systems have attracted much attention with the recent advances in microfluidics and nanofluidics. From the capillary electrophoresis, the development of glass-based microfluidic and nanofluidic technologies has supported advances in microfluidics and nanofluidics. Most microfluidic systems, especially nanofluidic systems, are still simple, such as systems constructed with simple straight nanochannels and bulk-scale electrodes. One of the bottlenecks to the development of more complicated and sophisticated systems is to develop the locally integrated nano-electrodes. However, there are still issues with integrating nano-electrodes into nanofluidic devices because it is difficult to fit the nano-electrode size into a nanofluidic channel at the nanometer level. In this study, we propose a new method for the fabrication of local nano-electrodes in nanofluidic devices with nanofluidic and nano-electrochemistry-based experiments. An electroplating solution was introduced to a nanochannel with control of the flow and the electroplating reaction, by which nano-electrodes were successfully fabricated. In addition, a nanofluidic device was available for nanofluidic experiments with the application of 200 kPa. This method can be applied to any electroplating material such as gold and copper. The local nano-electrode will make a significant contribution to the development of more complicated and sophisticated nanofluidic electrophoresis systems and to local electric detection methods for various nanofluidic devices."

"Pathogenic variants in the SLC34A1 and SLC34A3 genes, encoding sodium-phosphate cotransporters 2a (NPT2a) and 2c (NPT2c), are linked to rare phosphate-wasting disorders. In this issue, Brunkhorst et al. explore the clinical presentations, biochemical profiles, and treatment outcomes associated with these genetic variants in 113 individuals. The study highlights distinct phenotypes, potential treatment challenges, and the need for further research to optimize therapeutic strategies and understand long-term outcomes for affected individuals."
"Congenital anomalies (CAs) encompass a wide spectrum of structural and functional abnormalities during fetal development, commonly presenting at birth. Identifying the cause of CA is essential for accurate diagnosis and treatment. Using a target-gene approach, genetic variants could be found in certain CA patients. However, some patients were genetically undiagnosed; therefore, it is imperative to identify the causative variants from whole genome sequence (WGS) data of these patients."
"To evaluate the outcomes and predictive factors for fluid resolution following three loading injections of faricimab for neovascular age-related macular degeneration(AMD). This retrospective study included patients diagnosed with treatment-naïve neovascular AMD who received three monthly injections of faricimab. Changes in best-corrected visual acuity(BCVA) and central retinal thickness(CRT) following treatment were evaluated. The resolution of subretinal fluid(SRF), intraretinal fluid(IRF), and serous pigment epithelial detachment(PED) was also assessed. In addition, factors associated with complete resolution of SRF and IRF were investigated. A total of 69 patients were included in this study. BCVA significantly improved from a mean logarithm of minimal angle of resolution of 0.64 ± 0.41 at baseline to 0.47 ± 0.39 at 3 months (P < 0.001). CRT significantly decreased from 424.1 ± 155.5 μm at baseline to 266.3 ± 71.7 μm at 3 months (P < 0.001). At baseline, SRF was observed in 55 eyes (79.7%), IRF in 39 eyes(56.5%), and serous PED in 57 eyes(82.6%). By 3 months, the number of eyes showing these findings had decreased to 11 eyes(15.9%) for SRF, 6 eyes(8.7%) for IRF, and 10 eyes(14.5%) for serous PED. The presence of type 2 (88.2%) and type 3 (94.7%) macular neovascularization(MNV) was associated with a high incidence of complete resolution of SRF and IRF after treatment. Three loading injections of faricimab resulted in significant functional and anatomical improvements in treatment-naïve neovascular AMD, with a high rate of resolution of SRF, IRF, and serous PED. The anatomical effects were especially pronounced in cases of type 2 and type 3 MNV."
"The authors' proposal for the evolutionary origins of historical myths does not hold up to scrutiny, as illustrated by a simple mathematical model. Group-level explanations, such as defining the conditions for in-group membership, are dismissed by the authors but are far more plausible, as illustrated by the ongoing war in Ukraine."
Many viruses can cause persistent infection and/or viral shedding in immunocompromised hosts. This is a well-described occurrence not only with SARS-CoV-2 but for many other viruses as well. Understanding how viruses evolve and mutate in these patients and the global impact of this phenomenon is critical as the immunocompromised population expands.
"Over the past three decades, more advanced pre-hospital systems have increasingly integrated physicians into targeted roles, forming interprofessional teams. These teams focus on providing early senior decision-making and advanced interventions while also ensuring rapid transport to hospitals based on individual patient needs. This paper aims to evaluate the benefits of an inter-professional care model compared to a model where care is delivered solely by paramedics."
"Hyperuricemia is characterised by high blood levels of uric acid, and it can degenerate into gout when monosodium urate crystals precipitate in joints and other tissues. Uric acid is produced during the catabolism of xanthine by the enzyme xanthine oxidase (XO), which is the primary therapeutic target in gout treatment. Current XO inhibitors approved to treat gout, such as allopurinol and febuxostat, suffer from serious adverse effects, creating the need for new drug molecules. Three libraries comprising 75 purine analogues were designed using a 1,2,4-triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine scaffold, synthesised and tested in vitro as potential XO inhibitors. The screening identified that 23 compounds exhibited better inhibitory activity than allopurinol, with 2-(4-isopropoxyphenyl)-7-oxo-4,7-dihydro-1,2,4-triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine-6-carboxylic acid being 23 times more potent. Enzyme kinetics studies and molecular docking simulations were performed on the most active compounds to identify the mechanism of action and intermolecular interactions between the active site of XO and the inhibitors. The most potent compounds exhibited a mix-type inhibition mechanism and were predicted to interact with the same amino acid residues as allopurinol. These novel purine analogues are promising hits for further new lead development among purine-like drug XO inhibitors with therapeutic potential in the treatment of hyperuricemia and associated diseases."

"Although climate change has received significant global attention, there has been a distinct disregard for the issue of psychological well-being. The elevated floods resulting from climate change have substantial impacts on both physical infrastructure and human well-being. This includes the coerced relocation of individuals from their homes, unemployment, setbacks, and the disruption of communities. The occurrence of significant displacement due to major natural disasters, such as the floods in Pakistan in 2022, is linked to varying degrees of anxiety ranging from moderate to severe. The aim of this research is to perform a comprehensive analysis of the topic by utilizing the available literature. The study aims to ascertain the correlation between floods, caused by environmental shifts, and their influence on mental well-being in Pakistan, specifically focusing on the experiences of susceptible communities. Vulnerable populations, including socioeconomically disadvantaged communities, the older adults, individuals with disabilities, and children, are particularly susceptible to the adverse effects of severe weather conditions. During natural catastrophes, individuals experience elevated levels of psychological, emotional, and physical stress, which subsequently amplifies their vulnerability to these detrimental consequences."
"Proximal femur shaft nonunion is a challenging problem, often occurring after malreduction that results in postoperative malalignment and decreased healing potential. Correction of malalignment is critical to achieving osseous union. Here we present a novel technique for treating proximal femur nonunions with varus malalignment using an intramedullary nail inserted through a medialized trochanteric entry point."
"We investigated the effects of individual and cumulative cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) markers on long-term clinical outcomes in spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) patients. This prospective, single-center cohort study was conducted from 2012 to 2019. SVD markers, including lacunae, cerebral microbleeds, white matter hyperintensity (WMH), and perivascular spaces in the basal ganglia, were assessed to calculate a summary SVD score. Patients were categorized into severe (score ≥3) and non-severe (score 0-2) SVD burden groups. Functional prognosis was defined as recovery, no change, or decline based on modified Rankin Scale changes at 2 years after discharge, excluding death. Associations of SVD burden and individual SVD markers with outcomes were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards modeling for recurrent stroke and all-cause mortality, and using ordinal logistic regression for functional prognosis. Among 155 sICH patients who underwent MRI, 98 showed severe SVD burden. Recurrent stroke and all-cause mortality rates were 2.2 and 8.3 per 100 patient-years, respectively, over a median 2.1-year follow-up. In terms of functional prognosis, 57 patients (51.8%) recovered, 32 (29.1%) showed no change, and 21 (19.1%) declined. A significant association was apparent between severe SVD burden and poorer functional prognosis (odds ratio [OR] 2.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-6.04; p = 0.042), particularly with moderate-to-severe WMH (OR 2.54, 95%CI 1.02-6.54; p = 0.048). The cumulative effects of SVD markers inhibited long-term functional recovery in sICH patients. Severe SVD burden, as well as moderate-to-severe WMH, can be indicators of long-term prognosis after sICH."

"Nanotechnology is an important science that finds a wide range of applications from energy production to industrial production processes and biomedical applications. Nanoparti-cles, which are the most frequently preferred nanomaterials that form the basis of nanotechnolo-gy, are prepared with different composition, size, shape and surface chemistry to provide new techniques in applications in many different fields. The use of nanoparticles in the preparation of plasmonic sensors has increased the interest in plasmonic sensors such as surface plasmon resonance, electrochemical sensors, surface enhanced raman scattering and colorimetric sensors due to their increased sensing capacity on sensor surfaces. Plasmonic sensors are an important option in many different fields, such as medicine, environmental agriculture and food safety, thanks to their ability to solve a multitude of challenges. Because, plasmonic sensors are defined as sensing devices with important features such as sensitive and fast detection, no need for labels, real-time analysis, portability. In this review, the information about nanoparticles and their types and working principles of plasmonic sensors is given. Then, examples in clinical applications using different plasmonic sensors prepared with plasmonic nanoparticles are discussed in detail."
"This study aimed to quantify and assess perioperative costs in an integrated healthcare system for patients undergoing distal biceps tendon (DBT) repair with and without the use of postoperative bracing and formal physical (PT) or occupational (OT) therapy services.

"Mitochondrial disorders exhibit clinical and genetic diversity. Nearly 400 distinct genes, located in both the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes, harbor pathogenic variants that can produce a broad spectrum of mitochondrial diseases. This work aims to explore the genetic etiology of a cohort of Egyptian pediatric patients who were clinically suspected of having a mitochondrial disorder. A total of 49 patients from 44 unrelated families were studied. Selection criteria included age below 18 years and meeting Morava criteria (a score ≥ 3). The mitochondrial disease criteria (MDC) have been developed to quantify the clinical picture and evaluate the probability of an underlying mitochondrial disorder Exome sequencing, including mitochondrial genome sequencing, was carried out for each participant. Causative variants likely responsible for the phenotypes were identified in 68% of the study population. The mitochondrial subgroup constituted 41% of the studied population with a median age of 4 years. No primary pathogenic variants in mitochondrial DNA were detected. Pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in eight mitochondrial genes were identified in 78% of the mitochondrial cohort. Additionally, seven novel variants were identified. Nonmitochondrial diagnoses accounted for 27% of the study population. In 32% of cases, disease-causing variants were not identified. The current study underscores the diverse phenotypic and genetic landscape of mitochondrial disorders among Egyptian patients."
"We examined the relationship between RAAS inhibitor use and Omicron infection in mildly symptomatic patients. This retrospective case-control observational study included 50,121 patients with mild Omicron infection from the largest ""Fangcang"" shelter hospital in Shanghai between April 9, 2022, and May 21, 2022. Using 1:1 propensity score matching (PSM), we classified 4394 COVID-19 patients into hypertension and non-hypertension groups, and 406 hypertensive patients into RAAS inhibitor and non-RAAS inhibitor groups. The risk of initial symptoms of infection, cumulative negative conversion rates, time to nucleic-acid negative conversion, and viral loads were compared. In the hypertension group, the median number of days for nucleic-acid negative conversion was 7.0 (IQR, 5.0-9.0), which was greater than non-hypertensive group (median (IQR) 6.0 (4.0-8.0), P < 0.001, Cohen's d = 0.29); the mean and minimum cycle threshold values (CT-values) were significantly lower (P < 0.001, Cohen's d = 0.23). In the RAAS inhibitors group, the median number of days for nucleic-acid negative conversion was 7.0 days (IQR, 5.0-9.0), which was shorter than the non-RAAS inhibitors group ([median (IQR)] 8.0 (6.0-10.0), P < 0.001, Cohen's d = 0.34), the cumulative negative conversion rates at 3-8 days being all higher than non-RAAS inhibitors groups (P < 0.05). The most significant difference in negative conversion rate between the RAAS inhibitor and non-RAAS inhibitor group was on the 4th day. No significant difference was observed in mean and minimum CT-values from RAAS inhibitor and non-RAAS inhibitor groups (P > 0.05). RAAS inhibitor use in patients with hypertension is associated with nucleic-acid negative conversion duration and negative conversion rate. RAAS inhibitors clearly do not aggravate or prolong COVID-19."
"Recently, silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) were shown to provoke oxidative stress through the release of reactive oxygen species and consequently induce cell damage.

"The sucrose non-fermentation-related kinase 1 (SnRK1) protein complex in plants plays an important role in energy metabolism, anabolism, growth, and stress resistance. SnRK1 is a heterotrimeric complex. The SnRK1 complex is mainly composed of α, β, βγ, and γ subunits. Studies on plant SnRK1 have primarily focused on the functional α subunit, with the β regulatory subunit remaining relatively unexplored. The present study aimed to elucidate the evolutionary relationship, structural prediction, and interaction with the core α subunit of peach SnRK1β3 (PpSnRK1) subunit."
"Many studies have investigated the neuropsychological profile of individuals with sex chromosome trisomies (SCTs) and have identified some fragilities in language development within a wide individual variability. However, only a few studies have focused on children in the second year of life (12-24 months), a crucial stage for neurodevelopment. The present study aimed to identify and describe neurodevelopmental patterns in young children with SCTs. Seventy children with SCTs, ranging in age from 14 to 29 months, were administered the Griffiths Mental Development Scales, and their different neurodevelopmental profiles were identified using cluster analysis. Two-step cluster analysis highlighted two profiles of children equally distributed between groups. The two clusters showed a similar pattern but different levels of functioning, with children in Cluster 1 showing a lower performance in all the areas considered than children in Cluster 2. However, in both clusters, all the mean scores were in the normative range, with a significant gap in the linguistic area. Identifying the subgroups of young children with SCTs at higher risk can contribute to developing early monitoring protocols and targeted therapy approaches."
"With the increased use of digital health innovations in Canadian health care, educating health care users, professionals, and researchers on the ethical challenges and privacy implications of these tools is essential. The Datum project, funded by the Fondation Barreau du Quebec, was created to help these actors better understand legal and ethical issues regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of digital health data for the purposes of scientific research, thereby enhancing literacy around data privacy. The project consists of a multimedia website divided into legislation and policy documents and narrative-based video content. Users can access the core legislation and policies governing the collection and use of health care data geared toward researchers and health practitioners. Users can also view the narrative-based video content explaining key concepts related to digital health data. The Datum project makes an original contribution to the field of law and ethics in health science research by using novel approaches, such as learning health systems and data banks, to improve equity in health care delivery and by generating multimedia content aimed at encouraging health care users to become better consumers and supporting the collective use of their data. The Datum project also promotes digital literacy as a digital communication tool, which has the significant potential to improve health outcomes, bridge the digital divide, and reduce health inequities."

"Ebola virus (EBOV) causes severe disease in humans, with mortality as high as 90%. The small-molecule antiviral drug remdesivir (RDV) has demonstrated a survival benefit in EBOV-exposed rhesus macaques. Here, we characterize the efficacy of multiple intravenous RDV dosing regimens on survival of rhesus macaques 42 days after intramuscular EBOV exposure. Thirty rhesus macaques underwent surgical implantation of telemetry devices for the fine-scale monitoring of body temperature and activity, as well as central venous catheters, to enable treatment administration and blood collection. Treatment, consisting of a loading dose of RDV followed by once-daily maintenance doses for 11 days, was initiated 4 days after virus exposure when all animals were exhibiting disease signs consistent with incipient EBOV disease as well as quantifiable levels of EBOV RNA in plasma. In the RDV treatment groups receiving loading/maintenance doses of 5/2.5 mg/kg, 10/5 mg/kg, and 20/10 mg/kg, a total of 6 of 8 (75%), 7 of 8 (87.5%), and 5 of 7 (71.4%) animals survived, respectively. In the vehicle control group, one of seven animals (14.3%) survived. The improved survival rate compared to the control group was statistically significant only for the 10/5 mg/kg RDV treatment group. This treatment regimen also resulted in a significantly lower systemic viral load compared to the vehicle control after a single RDV treatment. All three RDV regimens produced a significantly lower systemic viral load after two treatments. For most animals, RDV treatment, regardless of dose, resulted in the amelioration of many of the clinical-pathological changes associated with EBOV disease in this model."
"Nuclear dysmorphia, characterized by crumpled or lobulated polymorphic nuclear shapes, has been used as an index for the malignant grades of certain cancers. The expression of vimentin, a type-III intermediate filament protein, is a hallmark of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. However, it remains unclear whether vimentin is involved in cancer cell nuclear dysmorphia. In this study, we found that vimentin intermediate filaments (VIFs) frequently accumulated at the concave of dysmorphic nucleus in breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells. Depletion of vimentin apparently restored the nuclear shape of the cells, which was devastated by re-expression of vimentin, but not its assembly-defective Y117D mutant. Depletion of plectin, a cytoskeletal linker, partially prevented the perinuclear accumulation of VIFs and concomitantly restored the nuclear shape of the cells. In addition, depletion of vimentin in lung cancer A549 cells largely prevented nuclear dysmorphia during the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition induced by TGFβ. Moreover, we found that VIF-mediated nuclear dysmorphia led to defects in DNA repair. Together, our results unveil a novel role of VIFs in cancer cell nuclear dysmorphia, which is associated with genome instability."
"The ZEPHIR clinical trial evaluated the role of [89Zr]trastuzumab-PET/CT (HER2-PET/CT) and 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose PET/CT ([18F]FDG-PET/CT) in predicting outcomes in patients with advanced HER2-positive breast cancer treated with trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1). In this study, we combined molecular/metabolic imaging and transcriptomic data to investigate the biological processes associated with [89Zr]trastuzumab and [18F]FDG uptake and to dissect the mechanisms involved in T-DM1 resistance."

"The challenge of selecting thyroid nodules for fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology has led to the development of the Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System, primarily in 2 formats: European Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (EU-TIRADS) and American College of Radiology Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (ACR-TIRADS). Clinical observations suggest imperfect risk assessment for TIRADS 3 nodules ≥20 mm. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of TIRADS systems in distinguishing benign from malignant nodules in this subgroup."
"Antibacterial activity can be classified as either bactericidal or bacteriostatic, using methods such as the MBC/MIC ratio and time-kill curves. However, such categorization has proven challenging in clinical practice, as these definitions only apply under specific laboratory conditions, which may differ from clinical settings. Several factors, such as the specific bacteria or infectious medium, can affect the action of antibiotics, with many antibacterials exerting both activities. These definitions have also led to the belief that bactericidal antibacterials are superior to bacteriostatic, especially in more severe cases, such as endocarditis, neutropenia and bacteraemia. Additionally, current dogma dictates against the combination of bactericidal and bacteriostatic antibacterials in clinical practice, due to potential antagonism. This review aimed to assess the differences in antibacterial activity of bactericidal and bacteriostatic antibacterials based on in vitro and in vivo studies and examine their antagonistic or synergistic effects. Our findings show that specific bacteriostatic agents, such as linezolid and tigecycline, are clinically non-inferior to bactericidals in multiple infections, including pneumonia, intra-abdominal infections, and skin and soft tissue infections. Studies also support using several bacteriostatic agents as salvage therapies in severe infections, such as neutropenic fever and endocarditis. Additionally, not all combinations of bacteriostatic and bactericidal agents appear to be antagonistic, with many combinations, such as linezolid and rifampicin, already being used. The findings should be interpreted with caution, as most evidence is from observational studies and there is a need for randomized controlled trials to assess their effectiveness and combinations, especially within the context of rising antimicrobial resistance."
"The remarkable ability of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) to differentiate into specialized cells of the human body emphasizes their immense potential in treating various diseases. Advances in hPSC technology are paving the way for personalized and allogeneic cell-based therapies. The first-in-human studies showed improved treatment of diseases with no adverse effects, which encouraged the industrial production of this type of medicine. To ensure the quality, safety and efficacy of hPSC-based products throughout their life cycle, it is important to monitor and control their clinical translation through good practices (GxP) regulations. Understanding these rules in advance will help ensure that the industrial development of hPSC-derived products for widespread clinical implementation is feasible and progresses rapidly."
"Diabetic sensorimotor neuropathy (DSPN) is strongly associated with the extent of cellular oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction in type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) attenuates the progression of DSPN through its antioxidant and vasculoprotective effects. Kallistatin has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. We aimed to evaluate changes in kallistatin levels and markers of endothelial dysfunction in patients with T2DM and DSPN following six months of treatment with 600 mg/day of ALA. A total of 54 patients with T2DM and DSPN and 24 control patients with T2DM but without neuropathy participated in this study. The serum concentrations of kallistatin, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, oxLDL, VEGF, ADMA, and TNF-alpha were measured by an ELISA. Peripheral sensory neuropathy was assessed with neuropathy symptom questionnaires and determination of the current perception threshold. After ALA treatment, the level of kallistatin significantly decreased, as well as the levels of TNF-alpha and ADMA. Changes in kallistatin levels were positively correlated with changes in oxLDL. The improvement in DSPN symptoms following ALA treatment showed a positive correlation with changes in kallistatin, VEGF, oxLDL, and ADMA levels. Based on our results, kallistatin could represent a potential new biomarker for assessing therapeutic response during ALA treatment in patients with DSPN."
"Each branch internode, with the organs growing on it, can be seen as a single morphological phytomer subunit made of structurally and functionally interrelated components. However, allometric relationships between the anatomy and morphology of these subunits remain unclear, particularly in the axial context. The aim of this study was to address this knowledge gap by measuring morpho-anatomical parameters and their allometric relationships along grapevine shoots."
"Despite treatment, prostate cancer commonly progresses into castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), which remains largely incurable, requiring the development of new interventions. Darolutamide is an orally administered second-generation androgen receptor inhibitor indicated for patients with non-metastatic CRPC or metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. Here, we evaluated the effect of androgen receptor (AR) inhibition by darolutamide in combination with DNA double-strand-break-inducing targeted radium-223 alpha therapy in vitro and in an intratibial LNCaP xenograft model mimicking prostate cancer metastasized to bone. The results highlight the synergistic antitumor efficacy of darolutamide in combination with radium-223 both in vitro and in vivo. This effect was most likely driven by the downregulation of genes involved in DDR signaling, which was demonstrated in vitro by a gene set enrichment analysis. The combination treatment also reduced pathological tumor-induced effects in bone by decreasing the number of osteoblasts and osteoclasts and reducing abnormal bone formation in tumor-bearing bone. Additionally, it was shown that darolutamide does not affect the uptake of radium-223 into bone tissue. These results support the investigation of darolutamide in combination with radium-223 for the treatment of patients with CRPC metastasized to bone."
"To date, uterus transplantation is the only option for women with absolute uterine infertility, such as those with Rokitansky syndrome, to experience pregnancy and give birth. Despite the growing interest in uterus transplantation in recent years, several issues still require further research, including ischemia-reperfusion injury and its impact on graft quality and rejection. Recent literature has highlighted a thrombotic complication rate of up to 20% following uterus transplantation. This type of complication may result from hypoxia-induced endothelial cell damage, often leading to uterine graft rejection. Hypoxia is induced during static cold storage, which remains the gold standard for graft preservation in solid organ transplantation. Recently, dynamic preservation using machine perfusion has been shown to improve the long-term storage of conventional and marginal organs by reducing ischemic and hypoxic injury. In this protocol, we aim to describe every surgical step involved in porcine uterus procurement and dynamic preservation, based on both uterine pedicles, to enable the connection and initiation of the machine perfusion protocol."
"Lung cancer is among one of the most commonly diagnosed malignancies and is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in both men and women globally, with an estimated 1.8 million deaths annually. Moreover, it is also the leading cause of cancer related deaths in the United States (U.S.), with an estimated 127,000 deaths annually. Approximately 50% of patients who undergo chest Computed Tomography (CT) are found to have a pulmonary nodule (PN), albeit 95% of these PNs are subsequently found to be benign. Further complicating the challenge of timely detection of lung cancer, is made more difficult by the fact that most patients are totally asymptomatic in early stage of disease. However, given that sponsored studies by National Cancer Institute (NCI) and other organizations showed a 20% reduction in lung cancer specific mortality with low dose CT scanning in patients at risk, it is reasonable to assume that clinicians will confront this clinical scenario more frequently. Consequently, due to these significant findings, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended annual screening of high-risk patients. Therefore, as result of these recommendations, 240,000 new lung cancers were diagnosed in the U.S. in 2020, with an estimated 238,000 new cases in 2023. Given the multitude of challenges, the practice guidelines and recommendations for the management of these PNs are often tailored to available resources and trained personnel familiar with the various techniques and technologies. This review will discuss the evolution of various advancements when tissue biopsy is required: from sputum cytology, nonguided bronchoscopy, percutaneous CT guided biopsy, guided advanced bronchoscopic techniques such as endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS), radial Endobronchial Ultrasound (rEBUS) to the latest advancement of robotic-assisted bronchoscopy (RAB). Furthermore, as many of the aforementioned techniques require anesthesia, as integral members of the multidisciplinary team, anesthesiologists are often in the unique position of facilitating diagnosis and subsequent treatment by other subspecialists when providing anesthetic care for these patients with PNs. Additionally, the common anesthetic considerations and implications for the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative periods will be elucidated further, with special emphasis on the unique considerations for RABs. Combined hybrid procedures with RAB, EBUS and surgery will also be reviewed, as they offer potential reduction in time of diagnosis to definitive treatment. Lastly, the strategies employed to mitigate some of the commonly encountered challenges faced by anesthesiologists when caring for these patients will also be reviewed."
"The process of developing new drugs is arduous and costly, particularly for targets classified as ""difficult-to-drug."" Macrocycles show a particular ability to modulate difficult-to-drug targets, including protein-protein interactions, while still allowing oral administration. However, the determination of membrane permeability, critical for reaching intracellular targets and for oral bioavailability, is laborious and expensive. In silico methods are a cost-effective alternative, enabling predictions prior to compound synthesis. Here, we present a comprehensive online database ( https://swemacrocycledb.com/ ), housing 5638 membrane permeability datapoints for 4216 nonpeptidic macrocycles, curated from the literature, patents, and bioactivity repositories. In addition, we present a new descriptor, the ""amide ratio"" (AR), that quantifies the peptidic nature of macrocyclic compounds, enabling the classification of peptidic, semipeptidic, and nonpeptidic macrocycles. Overall, this resource fills a gap among existing databases, offering valuable insights into the membrane permeability of nonpeptidic and semipeptidic macrocycles, and facilitating predictions for drug discovery projects."

"The consumption forecasting of oil and coal can help governments optimize and adjust energy strategies to ensure energy security in China. However, such forecasting is extremely challenging because it is influenced by many complex and uncertain factors. To fill this gap, we propose a hybrid deep learning approach for consumption forecasting of oil and coal in China. It consists of three parts, i.e., feature engineering, model building, and model integration. First, feature engineering is to distinguish the different correlations between targeted indicators and various features. Second, model building is to build five typical deep learning models with different characteristics to forecast targeted indicators. Third, model integration is to ensemble the built five models with a tailored, self-adaptive weighting strategy. As such, our approach enjoys all the merits of the five deep learning models (they have different learning structures and temporal constraints to diversify them for ensembling), making it able to comprehensively capture all the characteristics of different indicators to achieve accurate forecasting. To evaluate the proposed approach, we collected the real 880 pieces of data with 39 factors regarding the energy consumption of China ranging from 1999 to 2021. By conducting extensive experiments on the collected datasets, we have identified the optimal features for four targeted indicators (i.e., import of oil, production of oil, import of coal, and production of coal), respectively. Besides, we have demonstrated that our approach is significantly more accurate than the state-of-the-art forecasting competitors."
"Women are disproportionately affected by chronic autoimmune diseases (AD) like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), scleroderma, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and Sjögren's syndrome. Traditional evaluations often underestimate the associated cardiovascular disease (CVD) and stroke risk in women having AD. Vitamin D deficiency increases susceptibility to these conditions. CVD risk prediction in AD can benefit from surrogate biomarker for coronary artery disease (CAD), such as carotid ultrasound. Due to non-linearity in the CVD risk stratification, we use artificial intelligence-based system using AD biomarkers and carotid ultrasound. Investigate the relationship between AD and CVD/stroke markers including autoantibody-influenced plaque load. Second, to study the surrogate biomarkers for the CAD and gather radiomics-based features such as carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT), and plaque area (PA). Third and final, explore the automated CVD/stroke risk identification using advanced machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) paradigms. Analysed biomarker data from women with AD, including carotid ultrasonography imaging, clinical parameters, autoantibody profiles, and vitamin D levels. Proposed artificial intelligence (AI) models to predict CVD/stroke risk accurately in AD for women. There is a strong association between AD duration and elevated cIMT/PA, with increased CVD risk linked to higher rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPAs) levels. AI models outperformed conventional methods by integrating imaging data and disorder-specific factors. Interdisciplinary collaboration is crucial for managing CVD/stroke in women with chronic autoimmune diseases. AI-based assisted risk stratification methods may improve treatment decision-making and cardiovascular outcomes."
Tianeptine is an atypical tricyclic antidepressant not approved for medical use in the US but is found in dietary supplements. This study investigates single-substance tianeptine exposures reported to US poison centers.
"Plant electrical signals serve as a medium for long-distance signal transmission and are intricately linked to plant stress responses. High-fidelity acquisition and analysis of plant electrophysiological signals contribute to early stress identification, thereby enhancing agricultural production efficiency. While traditional plant electrophysiology monitoring methods like gel electrodes can capture electrical signals on plant surfaces, which face limitations due to the plant cuticle barrier, impacting signal accuracy. Moreover, the vast and intricate nature of plant electrical signal data, coupled with the absence of specialized large-scale models, impedes signal interpretation and plant physiological correlation. In light of these challenges, we engineered an implantable microneedle array using micromachining technology for monitoring and decoding plant electrical signals in a minimally invasive manner. This innovative sensor can securely adhere to plant tissue over extended periods, enabling the precise recording of electrical signals triggered by transient (mechanical injury) and long-term stresses (drought and salt stress). Based on the collected plant electrophysiological data, we utilized a machine learning model to analyze these signals for the early detection of plant stress with an accuracy of 99.29%. This sensor has great potential and is expected to revolutionize precision agricultural production and provide valuable help in managing plant stress more effectively."
"Heart failure (HF) is strongly associated with inflammation. In pressure overload (PO)-induced HF, cardiac stress triggers adaptive immunity, ablation or inhibition of which blocks disease progression. We hypothesized that PO-HF might fulfill the often-used criteria of autoimmunity: if so, the associated adaptive immune response would be not only necessary but also sufficient to induce HF; it should also be possible to identify self-antigens driving the autoimmune response. Finally, we hypothesized that such an antigen-specific response can be manipulated to preventively reduce the severity of PO-HF in a tolerizing vaccine."
"Stuttering is associated with disparities in labor market outcomes among young adults, but little is known about how labor market outcomes associated with stuttering change over time. Therefore, this study characterized longitudinal associations between stuttering and early life expectations, job satisfaction, receipt of employer-provided insurance benefits, and income."
"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by persistent inflammation of the synovial joints, leading to cartilage and bone destruction. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic utility of specific microRNAs (miRNAs) as potential biomarkers for RA. The study was conducted on 60 patients with RA disease along with 20 control participants. Comprehensive analysis of patient data, encompassing serological, hematological, and biochemical markers, revealed significantly elevated levels of miR-99b-5p, miR-101-3p, and miR-431-5p in RA patients compared to healthy controls. Among these, miR-101-3p demonstrated the highest diagnostic accuracy, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.873. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of RA pathogenesis and suggest that miR-101-3p may serve as a valuable biomarker for early disease detection and potentially improved patient management. Further research is warranted to elucidate the precise mechanisms underlying miRNA involvement in RA and to explore their potential as therapeutic targets."
"The past decades have witnessed the rise and fall of several, largely unsuccessful, therapeutic attempts to bring the escalating obesity pandemic to a halt. Looking back to look ahead, the field has now put its highest hopes in translating insights from how the gastrointestinal (GI) tract communicates with the brain to calibrate behavior, physiology, and metabolism. A major focus of this review is to summarize the latest advances in comprehending the neuroendocrine aspects of this so-called 'gut-brain axis' and to explore novel concepts, cutting-edge technologies, and recent paradigm-shifting experiments. These exciting insights continue to refine our understanding of gut-brain crosstalk and are poised to promote the development of additional therapeutic avenues at the dawn of a new era of antiobesity therapeutics."
"Intermittent fasting remains a safe and effective strategy to ameliorate various age-related diseases, but its specific mechanisms are not fully understood. Considering that transcription factors (TFs) determine the response to environmental signals, here, we profiled the diurnal expression of 600 samples across four metabolic tissues sampled every 4 over 24 h from mice placed on five different feeding regimens to provide an atlas of TFs in biological space, time, and feeding regimen. Results showed that 1218 TFs exhibited tissue-specific and temporal expression profiles in ad libitum mice, of which 974 displayed significant oscillations at least in one tissue. Intermittent fasting triggered more than 90% (1161 in 1234) of TFs to oscillate somewhere in the body and repartitioned their tissue-specific expression. A single round of fasting generally promoted TF expression, especially in skeletal muscle and adipose tissues, while intermittent fasting mainly suppressed TF expression. Intermittent fasting down-regulated aging pathway and upregulated the pathway responsible for the inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Intermittent fasting shifts the diurnal transcriptome atlas of TFs, and mTOR inhibition may orchestrate intermittent fasting-induced health improvements. This atlas offers a reference and resource to understand how TFs and intermittent fasting may contribute to diurnal rhythm oscillation and bring about specific health benefits."
"The global emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2019 posed unprecedented challenges to healthcare systems, disrupting routine services and necessitating swift adaptations. Harm reduction programs, vital for addressing substance use-related health risks, faced unique challenges during the pandemic, impacting vulnerable populations.

"TPE drastically reduces serum triglyceride (sTG), but its role in the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia-induced acute pancreatitis (HTG-AP) or at risk of developing it, is not well established. The objectives were to assess the effectiveness and safety of TPE in the treatment of severe HTG (sHTG), as well as to evaluate the severity of HTG-AP treated with TPE."
"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a prevalent disease that poses a significant threat to global public health. Digestive dysfunction, as a common complication, is of particular importance to understand its pathogenesis, diagnostic criteria, and relevant treatment strategies. TBI can affect digestive function through inflammatory immune responses, the enteric nervous system, and hormonal levels. Furthermore, TBI can also impact neurologic recovery through bidirectional communication along the brain-gut axis. Therefore, this article aims to summarize the underlying mechanisms and further explore individualized feeding strategies, therapeutic approaches, long-term prognosis for TBI patients, as well as recent advancements in related technologies. Further understanding of the pathogenesis of digestive system dysfunction after TBI on the basis of the interaction of gut-brain axis is conducive to more future therapies to treat TBI and improve the long-term prognosis of patients through improving digestive function, and achieve good clinical efficacy."
"Therapy-exposed surviving cancer cells may have encountered profound epigenetic remodeling that renders these drug-tolerant persisters candidate drivers of particularly aggressive relapses. Typically presenting as slow-to-nongrowing cells, persisters are senescent or senescence-like cells. In this issue of Cancer Research, Ramponi and colleagues study mTOR/PI3K inhibitor-induced embryonic diapause-like arrest (DLA) as a model of persistence in lung cancer and melanoma cells and compare this persister condition with therapy-induced senescence in the same cells. The DLA phenotype recapitulated some but not all features attributed to senescent cells, lacking, for instance, an inflammatory secretome otherwise known as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype. A CRISPR dropout screen pointed to methyl group-providing one-carbon metabolism and further to H4K20me3-mediated repression of senescence-associated secretory phenotype-related IFN response genes selectively in DLA-like persister cells. Conversely, inhibition of H4K20-active KMT5B/C methyltransferases derepressed inflammatory programs and was toxic in DLA cells. These findings not only suggest exploitable vulnerabilities of DLA-like persister cells but also unveil general technical and conceptual challenges of cultured multipassage cell line-based persister studies. Collectively, the approach chosen and insights obtained will stimulate a productive scientific debate on senescence-like features and their reversibility across drug-tolerant persister cells. See related article by Ramponi et al., p. 32."
"Capsid Integrity qPCR (CI-qPCR) assays offer a promising alternative to cell culture-based infectivity assays for assessing pathogenic human virus viability in wastewater. This study compared three CI-qPCR methods: two novel (Crosslinker, TruTiter) and one established (PMAxx dye). These methods were evaluated on heat-inactivated and non-heat-inactivated 'live' viruses spiked into phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and wastewater, as well as on viruses naturally present in wastewater samples. The viral panel included Human adenovirus 5 (HAdV), enterovirus A71 (EV), hepatitis-A virus (HAV), influenza-A H3N2 (IAV), respiratory syncytial virus A2 (RSV), norovirus GI, norovirus GII, and SARS-CoV-2. All three methods successfully differentiated between degraded, heat-inactivated, and live viruses in PBS. While all three methods were comparable for HAdV and norovirus GI, PMAxx detected significantly lower gene copies for EV and IAV. In spiked wastewater, PMAxx yielded significantly lower gene copies for all heat-inactivated viruses (HAdV, EV, HAV, IAV, and RSV) compared to the Crosslinker and TruTiter methods. For viruses naturally present in wastewater (un-spiked), no significant difference was observed between PMAxx and TruTiter methods. Intact, potentially infectious viruses were detected using both PMAxx and TruTiter on untreated and treated wastewater samples. A comparative analysis of qPCR data and TEM images revealed that viral flocculation of IAV may interfere with capsid integrity assays using intercalating dyes. In summary, our findings not only advance the development of more effective methods for assessing viral viability in wastewater, but also highlight the potential of CI-qPCR techniques to enhance early warning systems for emerging pathogens, thereby strengthening public health preparedness and response strategies."
"Obesity presents a growing challenge to public health, and its intricate association with genetics continues to be a compelling field of study. In countries such as Malaysia, where diverse genetic backgrounds converge, exploring the molecular genetics of obesity is even more imperative."
"The basis of all improvement in (re)production performance of animals and plants lies in the genetic variation. The underlying genetic variation can be further explored through investigations using molecular markers including single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and microsatellite, and more recently structural variants like copy number variations (CNVs). Unlike SNPs, CNVs affect a larger proportion of the genome, making them more impactful vis-à-vis variation at the phenotype level. They significantly contribute to genetic variation and provide raw material for natural and artificial selection for improved performance. CNVs are characterized as unbalanced structural variations that arise from four major mechanisms viz., non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR), fork stalling and template switching (FoSTeS), and retrotransposition. Various detection methods have been developed to identify CNVs, including molecular techniques and massively parallel sequencing. Next-generation sequencing (NGS)/high-throughput sequencing offers higher resolution and sensitivity, but challenges remain in delineating CNVs in regions with repetitive sequences or high GC content. High-throughput sequencing technologies utilize different methods based on read-pair, split-read, read depth, and assembly approaches (or their combination) to detect CNVs. Read-pair based methods work by mapping discordant reads, while the read-depth approach works on detecting the correlation between read depth and copy number of genetic segments or a gene. Split-read methods involve mapping segments of reads to different locations on the genome, while assembly methods involve comparing contigs to a reference or de novo sequencing. Similar to other marker-trait association studies, CNV-association studies are not uncommon in humans and farm animals. Soon, extensive studies will be needed to deduce the unique evolutionary trajectories and underlying molecular mechanisms for targeted genetic improvements in different farm animal species. The present review delineates the importance of CNVs in genetic studies, their generation along with programs and principles to efficiently identify them, and finally throw light on the existing literature on studies in farm animal species vis-à-vis CNVs."
"Metastasis is a major cause of poor prognosis of pancreatic cancer. Exosomes (Exos) regulate cancer progression by modulating macrophage polarization. This study aimed to investigate the effects of cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF)-released Exos on macrophage polarization in pancreatic cancer and the molecular mechanisms. THP-1 cells or xenografted tumor mice were treated with Exos from CAFs, and macrophage polarization was analyzed using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and flow cytometry. THP-1 cells were cocultured with BXPC-3 cells, and metastasis was analyzed using Transwell assay and scratch test. Exosomal PTGS2 was detected using qPCR, and the NOD1 pathway was evaluated using western blot analysis. The results showed that Exos promoted M2-type polarization and inhibited M1-type polarization, and then facilitated pancreatic cancer cell migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. PTGS2 expression was increased in Exo-treated macrophages, and its knockdown in CAFs facilitated M2 to M1 macrophage polarization. Moreover, Exos promoted the NOD1 pathway via PTGS2, and inhibition of NOD1 reversed the polarization caused by Exos. Additionally, NOD1 was required in M1/M2 polarization in vivo mediated by Exos. In conclusion, CAF-secreted Exos facilitated M2 macrophage polarization by carrying PTGS2 to activate the NOD1 pathway, thereby promoting pancreatic cancer metastasis, providing evidence that CAF-Exos accelerating pancreatic cancer progression."

"Efficient sampling materials are essential for assessing nicotine levels in vape shops and other settings where nicotine exposures may exist. Two different treatments of Whatman glass fiber type A (GF/A) filters (sodium bisulfate treated and citric acid treated) were evaluated for nicotine capture, desorption efficiency, and holding capacity using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). The Filters were treated with 0.8 mL of 0.1 M sodium bisulfate or citric acid solution and oven-dried (80 °C) for 30 min. Nicotine was desorbed off the filters using a modified analytical method. The average nicotine desorption efficiency for sodium bisulfate-treated GF/A filters (98.4%) was significantly higher than that of citric acid-treated GF/A filters (60.9%) over a range of 1-100 µg nicotine. Sodium bisulfate-treated and citric acid-treated GF/A filters experienced a 10% nicotine breakthrough after being dosed with about 550 and 2,750 µg of nicotine, respectively compared to 75 µg for untreated GF/A filters. Citric acid-treated GF/A filters had a much greater nicotine-holding capacity, but nicotine desorption from citric acid-treated GF/A filters was below the recommended criteria. Therefore, we recommend that sodium bisulfate-treated GF/A filters are employed for sample of nicotine with the GC-MS method."
"After radical prostatectomy (RP), it is rarely acknowledged that several sexual dysfunctions can arise. These include issues in the orgasmic domain (e.g., decreased orgasm intensity, dysorgasmia), problems with ejaculation (e.g., absence of ejaculation), the development of penile deformities, and low sexual desire. This article aims to report the occurrence of orgasmic and ejaculatory dysfunction when actively investigated, documenting those rates and characterizing specific features of these conditions following RP."

"This study aimed to systematically investigate the value of the pre-treatment neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in prognosticating the outcome of patients with advanced cancer receiving immunotherapy. We searched Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library to identify studies about cancer patients with immunotherapy until November 29, 2024. Retrospective or prospective cohort studies with pretreatment NLR data were included. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated to evaluate the predictive value of NLR in prognosis and immunotherapy efficacy. The random effect model was applied for meta-analysis and the risk of bias was assessed by Egger test and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) method. A total of 129 articles involving 18780 cases were finally selected. Most cases were advanced cancers with the median follow-up period ranged 2-48.6 months. The high pretreatment NLR level was associated with the significantly reduced OS (HR (95%CI) = 2.26 (2.03, 2.53)), PFS (HR (95% CI) = 1.83 (1.69, 1.98)), ORR (OR (95%CI) = 0.53 (0.46, 0.61)) and DCR (OR (95% CI) = 0.36 (0.29, 0.43)) in patients with advanced cancer receiving immunotherapy. The quality of evidence was low, attributed to the serious risk of bias and incon¬sistency. An elevated NLR before immunotherapy was significantly associated with poor clinical outcomes in patients with advanced cancer."
"This study was aimed to create a bioactive hydrogel form with PVA/PVP (polyvinyl alcohol/poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone) polymer using acetone and ethanol extractions of Jania rubens red algae and investigate some pharmaceutical properties. The anti-candidal activity and some inhibition performance of J. rubens/PVA/PVP hydrogel were investigated on Candida tropicalis which is one of the important causes of bloodstream infections. The physicochemical properties of J. rubens/PVA/PVP hydrogel were revealed using FTIR and swelling-absorption tests. The volatile compounds of J. rubens extracts were examined by GCMS. By mixing the extracts in equal proportions, PVA/PVP-based hydrogel was prepared. According to the results, Cumulative Drug Release was stable at 25 °C for the first 5 h. The IZ (inhibition zone) and MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) of J. rubens/PVA/PVP hydrogel were 9.01 mm and 80.20 mg/mL, respectively. It was found that logarithmic reduction and percent reduction were seen as 1.5 CFU/mL and 97.5%, respectively, on C. tropicalis exposed to J. rubens/PVA/PVP hydrogel in the first 5 min of the incubation. After exposure of C. tropicalis to J. rubens/PVA/PVP, the number of viable cells transferred from the gel to water was between 76.1 and 73.1% in high glucose medium, while it was between 92.2 and 80.8% for the PVA/PVP hydrogel under the same conditions. As a result, PVA/PVP hydrogel was made bioactive with J. rubens extracts for the first time in this study, and its potential for use as a functional anticandidal hydrogel on C. tropicalis has been demonstrated."
"Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) is characterized by vision loss due to the degeneration of retinal ganglion cells. LHON-Plus refers to LHON with additional extraocular findings. Neurological conditions observed in LHON-Plus include seizures, encephalopathy, movement disorders, neuropathy, and myopathy. Herein, we present a case with atypical LHON-Plus caused by a novel DNAJC30 disease-causing gene variant. A 15-year-old boy presented with acute headache, and blurred and decreased vision in both eyes. Although initial evaluation pointed toward idiopathic intracranial hypertension, the subsequent diagnostic process revealed unusual features like area postrema syndrome and T2 hyperintensity in brain magnetic resonance imaging. Consequently, antibody-negative neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) was diagnosed and treatment was commenced. Recurrent episodes of elevated intracranial pressure necessitated the insertion of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. Exome sequencing (ES) revealed a novel homozygous variant in the DNAJC30 gene 2 years after symptom onset. Atypical LHON presentations due to nuclear gene mutations may mimic other neuroinflammatory conditions like NMOSD, necessitating thorough clinical evaluation and genetic testing. ES plays a crucial role in diagnosing complex neurological cases, enabling the identification of novel genetic variants associated with LHON and related disorders."
"With the progress of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation technology, the reduction of pretreatment intensity, the shortening of bone marrow suppression time and the reduction of infection risk, especially the physical and psychological stress for doctors and patients caused by rigorous protection procedures, the protective environment strategies need improvement. It has been found that, regardless of whether total environment protection is implemented, there is no significant difference in the outcomes of chemotherapy patients with neutropenia. Therefore, the traditional protective environment strategies are being improved. The protective environment strategies for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation patients have developed rapidly in the past two decades, from the replacement of laminar flow equipment by high-efficiency filtration devices to the development of home care after transplantation. In this article, the progress in protective environment strategies for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation patients is reviewed and further reflect, providing reference for future improvement."
"Growth Differentiation Factor 15 (GDF15) is an emerging biomarker that significantly increases during acute stress responses, such as infections, and is moderately elevated in chronic and inflammation-driven conditions. While evidence suggests that high levels of GDF15 in cardiac surgery are associated with worse outcomes, its utility as an evaluator of early postoperative complications remains unclear. This study aims to characterize the postoperative profile of GDF15 in patients undergoing isolated surgical aortic valve replacement, evaluating its association with short-term outcomes. Serum samples from patients undergoing cardiac surgery were collected preoperatively and at defined postoperative time points (1 h, 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, and 48 h) to measure GDF15 levels. GDF15 levels significantly increased after surgery, peaking at 6 h. A positive correlation was observed between GDF15 levels and both cardiopulmonary bypass and aortic cross-clamp times. Notably, patients who developed postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) or required prolonged hemodynamic support had significantly higher GDF15 levels, with increased mechanical ventilation time and extended intensive care unit length of stay. Furthermore, GDF15 levels correlated with postoperative SOFA scores at 24 h after surgery. GDF15 may be a valuable biomarker for risk stratification and guiding therapeutic decisions in cardiac surgery patients. Higher GDF15 levels were significantly associated with prolonged hemodynamic support, postoperative AKI, and measures of illness severity."
First-line pembrolizumab monotherapy is a standard of care for platinum-ineligible patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma (UC). No global standardized definition of platinum ineligibility exists. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab monotherapy in patients with UC who met various criteria for platinum ineligibility.
"Late-phase clinical trials and systematic reviews find results that have the potential to improve health outcomes for people. However, there are often delays in these results influencing clinical practice. We developed a knowledge transfer and exchange strategy to support research teams, aiming to identify activities along the research process to maximise and accelerate the research impact."
"Free functional muscle transfer (FFMT) for brachial plexus injury (BPI) requires adequate donor arterial flow for successful anastomosis. However, concomitant BPI and subclavian artery injury are not uncommon. Arteriovenous (AV) loop graft is one of the methods used to extend vessels to areas with vascular depletion. This case series aims to report the feasibility and outcomes of AV loop grafts for FFMT in BPI patients with subclavian artery injury."
Rapid maxillary expansion (RME) is a widely used technique to treat maxillary transverse deficiency. Piezo1 is a cation channel that is activated by mechanical force and regulates bone formation. This study aims to elucidate the role of Piezo1 in bone remodelling during the RME process.
"Neck pain is a common condition across various populations, with a substantial impact on daily life and quality of life. Forward head posture is frequently observed in individuals with neck pain and is closely associated with lifestyle factors. This study aimed to examine the relationship between lifestyle factors and forward head posture in young adults with neck pain and determine the optimal cutoff value for assessing the risk of forward head posture."
"It is necessary to identify which factors or comorbidities are associated with more severe hidradenitis suppurativa, aiming to identify which patients may benefit more from early systemic treatment or a more aggressive approach. A retrospective study was conducted, including patients diagnosed with HS at the dermatology department of a Spanish hospital over a 5-year period. A total of 322 patients were included. A relationship was found between diagnostic delay, the presence of acne conglobata, pilonidal sinus, cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, dyslipidemia, and/or diabetes mellitus) and more severe HS. No significant relationship was found between psychiatric comorbidities and the severity of the HS. The presence of perianal or truncal involvement was significantly associated with severe HS. Female sex and the presence of a family history of HS were associated with an earlier onset of the disease."
"Despite a wide range of available wound treatments, hard-to-heal wounds still pose a challenge. Hydrogels are often used as dressings for these wounds, because they sustain moisture in the wound environment, supporting the natural healing process. However, it is still not fully understood how physicochemical properties of hydrogel matrix affect the drug release process. Thus, detailed swelling kinetics examination coupled with modeling is needed together with studies on drug release. In this regard, several hydrogels based on plant-derived agar and modified with amikacin sulfate were investigated. The main properties of hydrogels were examined focusing on detailed swelling kinetics. Drug release was studied as microbiological activity against E. coli and S. Epidermidis strains. The obtained hydrogels were characterized by high swelling, reaching values in range from 465-1300 %, fitting the second order kinetics mode and exhibiting the quasi-Fickian diffusion properties. Furthermore, there was no correlation found between swelling properties and antibacterial activity against tested strains. The results confirmed that presented hydrogel materials have desirable properties for application as dressings for hard-to-heal wounds. The suggested compositions are a promising base for modification with other active substances (e. g., regenerative, anti-inflammatory) and studying the broader correlation between swelling and drug release."
"Recent studies suggest cGAS-STING pathway may play a crucial role in the genesis and development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), closely associated with classical pathways and tumor immunity. We aimed to develop models predicting survival and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 outcomes centered on the cGAS-STING pathway in HCC. We identified classical pathways highly correlated with cGAS-STING pathway and constructed transformer survival model preserving raw structure of pathways. We also developed explainable XGBoost model for predicting anti-PD-1/PD-L1 outcomes using SHAP algorithm. We trained and validated transformer survival model on pan-cancer cohort and tested it on three independent HCC cohorts. Using 0.5 as threshold across cohorts, we divided each HCC cohort into two groups and calculated P values with log-rank test. TCGA-LIHC: C-index = 0.750, P = 1.52e-11; ICGC-LIRI-JP: C-index = 0.741, P = .00138; GSE144269: C-index = 0.647, P = .0233. We trained and validated [area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) = 0.777] XGBoost model on immunotherapy datasets and tested it on GSE78220 (AUC = 0.789); we also tested XGBoost model on HCC anti-PD-L1 cohort (AUC = 0.719). Our deep learning model and XGBoost model demonstrate potential in predicting survival risks and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 outcomes in HCC. We deployed these two prediction models to the GitHub repository and provided detailed instructions for their usage: deep learning survival model, https://github.com/mlwalker123/CSP_survival_model; XGBoost immunotherapy model, https://github.com/mlwalker123/CSP_immunotherapy_model."
"Anthropogenically fragmented populations may have reduced fitness due to loss of genetic diversity and inbreeding. The extent of such fitness losses due to fragmentation and potential gains from conservation actions are infrequently assessed together empirically. Controlled crosses within and among populations can identify whether populations are at risk of inbreeding depression and whether inter-population crossing alleviates fitness loss. Because fitness depends on the environment and life stage, studies quantifying cumulative fitness over a large portion of the lifecycle in conditions that mimic natural environments are most informative. To assess the fitness consequences of habitat fragmentation, we leveraged controlled within-family, within-population, and between-population crosses to quantify inbreeding depression and heterosis in seven populations of Echinacea angustifolia within a 6,400-ha area. We then assessed cumulative offspring fitness after 14 yr of growth in a natural experimental plot (N = 1,136). The mean fitness of progeny from within-population crosses varied considerably, indicating genetic differentiation among source populations, even though these sites are all less than 9 km apart. The fitness consequences of within-family and between-population crosses varied in magnitude and direction. Only one of the seven populations showed inbreeding depression of high effect, while four populations showed substantial heterosis. Outbreeding depression was rare and slight. Our findings indicate that local crossings between isolated populations yield unpredictable fitness consequences ranging from slight decreases to substantial increases. Interestingly, inbreeding depression and heterosis did not relate closely to population size, suggesting that all fragmented populations could contribute to conservation goals as either pollen recipients or donors."

"Gestational Weight Gain (GWG) modulates pregnancy outcomes and long-term offspring metabolic health. The 2009 Institute of Medicine (IOM) GWG recommendations have largely been validated in Caucasian and mono-ethnic East Asian cohorts. Asians are at higher metabolic risk at a lower body mass index (BMI), and this has prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to identify lower BMI cut-offs for risk evaluation amongst Asians. This prospective observational cohort study aimed to determine if 2009 IOM GWG thresholds are applicable in a contemporary multi-ethnic South-East Asian cohort. We recruited 875 mothers from an urban Malaysian tertiary clinic during screening for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) from 2014-2021. Data collected included measures of insulin-sensitivity, total GWG (maternal weight at delivery-self-reported pre-gravid weight), and neonatal anthropometrics (birthweight and skinfold-thickness measured with Harpenden calipers). BMI was stratified by Caucasian (overweight ≥25kg/m2, obese ≥30kg/m2) as well as Asian (overweight ≥23kg/m2, obese ≥27.5kg/ m2) cut-offs, and patients categorized by 2009 IOM GWG reference ranges. The cohort comprised 67% Malay-, 23% Chinese- and 10% Indian-descent mothers with a high prevalence of overweight/obesity (Asian cut-offs 56.9% vs Caucasian 44%). When Asian BMI cut-offs were deployed, excessive GWG incidence increased (34.1% → 40.6%) whilst inadequate GWG declined (30% → 24.8%) (p<0.05). Upon multivariate-analysis (adjusting for age, parity, race, GDM, insulin-sensitivity, baby-gender) excessive GWG categorized with Caucasian BMI cut-offs was significantly associated with increased risk of macrosomia (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 8.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07-70.01), Neonatal-Fat-Mass (NFM) >90th centile (aOR 2.14, 95% CI 1.02-4.45) and Sum-of-Skinfold Thickness (SSFT) >90th centile (aOR 3.88, 95% CI 1.77-8.51). Excessive GWG by Asian cut-offs was also associated with increased risk of SSFT >90th centile (aOR 5.75, 95% CI 2.35-14.10). Inadequate GWG by both Caucasian and Asian BMI cut-offs was associated with Small-for-Gestational-Age (SGA) status (aOR 4.30, 95% CI 2.48-7.45 and aOR 3.66, 95% CI 2.13-6.30 respectively). In conclusion, the 2009 IOM GWG recommendations, using either Caucasian or regional Asian BMI cut-offs, are applicable in a contemporary Malay majority South-East Asian cohort in terms of predicting abnormal neonatal adiposity. Importantly, the association with neonatal adiposity is independent of increased maternal insulin resistance characteristic of Asians."
"Rwanda achieved unprecedented malaria control gains from 2000 to 2010, but cases increased 20-fold between 2011 and 2017. Vector control challenges and environmental changes were noted as potential explanations, but no studies have investigated causes of the resurgence or identified which vector species drove transmission. We conducted a retrospective study in four sites in eastern Rwanda that conducted monthly entomological surveillance and outpatient malaria care. We compared sporozoite rates, human blood index (HBI), and relative abundance of the primary vectors, Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles arabiensis, from 2017 to 2020. We then modeled the effects of vector control interventions, insecticide resistance, and temperature changes on species composition and reported malaria incidence. Sporozoite rates were 28 times higher and HBI was four times higher in An. gambiae compared with An. arabiensis. Insecticide-treated bed nets, first distributed nationally in 2010, were associated with decreased An. gambiae relative abundance. However, increased pyrethroid resistance was associated with increased An. gambiae relative abundance and malaria incidence. Epidemic malaria peaks corresponded to periods of model-predicted An. gambiae re-emergence, and increased regional air temperatures during the period were further associated with increased malaria incidence. Indoor residual spraying (IRS), implemented with non-pyrethroid insecticides later in the period, was associated with 86% reductions in An. gambiae relative abundance and 75% reductions in malaria incidence. These findings suggest that increased pyrethroid resistance and the re-emergence of An. gambiae were closely linked to the malaria resurgence in eastern Rwanda. Non-pyrethroid IRS or other control measures that effectively target An. gambiae may help prevent future resurgences."
"The objective of the present study was to examine the impact of different plyometric training (PT) surfaces on the adaptive changes of jumping ability, sprinting speed, change of direction ability and strength performance in volleyball players. Forty male players participated in the study and were divided into four equal groups performing PT in aquatic (APT), sand (SPT), and land (LPT) surfaces, or an active control group (CON). All training groups indicated small to large significant (p = 0.001) improvements in countermovement vertical jump (CMVJ), standing long jump (SLJ), spike jump, block jump, 10-m sprint, T-test, and maximal strength after the 6 weeks of progressive volume-based overload PT and in comparison to CON group (p < 0.05). Both the APT (standardized mean difference [SMD] = 0.97, p = 0.01) and SPT (SMD = 1.10, p = 0.04) exhibited superior training advancements compared to LPT in the CMVJ performance. Notably, the APT displayed significantly greater improvements than the LPT in SLJ (SMD = 0.31, p = 0.043), sprint (SMD = -0.63, p = 0.028), T-test, (SMD = -0.46, p = 0.022) and strength (SMD = 0.61, p = 0.03) performance. Based on these results, it is recommended that incorporating APT and SPT induced greater training benefits than LPT in the CMVJ, while the application of APT is suggested for greater enhancing in linear sprint, change of direction ability, and maximal strength compared to land training method."
"Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) is an acute inflammatory polyradiculoneuropathy that affects the peripheral nervous system, predominantly impairing motor function. Pain, both somatic and neuropathic, is reported in 89% of cases and is refractory to first-line analgesics in most of these. We present the case of a 75-year-old woman with an acute presentation of areflexic flaccid tetraparesis compatible with GBS. She received treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), which improved the motor component, but she experienced pain refractory to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and pregabalin, as well as persistent urinary retention with unsuccessful attempts to remove the urinary catheter. Transdermal fentanyl was administered with good response and tolerance, in addition to tamsulosin and intermittent catheterization, resulting in the successful removal of the catheter after six weeks. Based on this case, individualized evaluation of pain and urinary retention in GBS is suggested, considering the use of transdermal opioids and non-invasive bladder emptying measures, respectively."
"This study aims to compare the prevalence of depression and related geriatric syndromes in earlier-onset rheumatoid arthritis (EORA) patients, who have experienced prolonged inflammation and medication use, with those with late-onset rheumatoid arthritis (LORA) patients, who often present with an acute and severe course."
"Male tephritid fruit flies typically emit pheromones from rectal glands to attract mates. Consistent with this, virgin females of the cucumber fruit fly, Zeugodacus cucumis (French), were found to be attracted to volatiles emitted by crushed male rectal glands in Y-tube olfactometer bioassays. Electrophysiological studies identified several male rectal gland compounds that triggered responses in female antennae. In other studied tephritids, the proportion of each compound is similar in excised rectal glands and headspace of calling intact flies, but our initial investigations revealed substantial discrepancies in the abundance of aliphatic amides, suggesting additional sources of these compounds. To address the discrepancies, we examined the volatile chemistry of headspace, rectal glands, tergal glands, and cuticles from both sexes using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Our analyses confirmed previously identified compounds and also detected several previously unreported compounds. Notably, the aliphatic amides were found to be more abundant in both tergal glands and cuticle than in rectal glands in both sexes, suggesting glands associated with these sites as additional sources of these compounds in headspace. Most studies of tephritid sex pheromones have focused on rectal gland extracts, but insights of the present study indicate that headspace volatiles of live flies can also reflect contributions from other glands."
"Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a common neurological trauma that cannot be completely cured with surgical techniques and medications. In this study, we established a mouse SCI model and used an adeno-associated virus (AAV) to achieve the high expression of sonic hedgehog (Shh) at the injury site to further investigate the therapeutic effect and mechanism of Shh on SCI. The results of the present study show that Shh may promote motor function recovery. The present findings demonstrate the protective effect of Shh overexpression in SCI by regulating the proliferation and apoptosis of nerve cells at the site of SCI. Shh promotes the proliferation of early microglia, inhibits the proliferation of early astrocytes, and promotes the formation of neurons at the site of injury. In addition, Shh may inhibit apoptosis at the SCI site. The mechanism by which Shh regulates nerve cells at the site of SCI may involve glioma-associated oncogene 1 (Gli1). The present research indicates that Gli1 regulates the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling pathway, inhibiting the classic TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway and activating the TGF-β1/extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK) signaling pathway. Collectively, these findings suggest that Shh is a regulatory molecule involved in nerve cell proliferation and apoptosis. High Shh expression can accelerate motor function recovery after SCI, indicating that it may be a promising therapeutic approach for SCI."
"IgE antibodies raised against innocuous environmental antigens cause allergic diseases like allergic rhinitis, food allergy, and allergic asthma. While some allergies are often outgrown, others (peanut, shellfish, tree nut) are lifelong in the majority of individuals. Lifelong allergies are the result of persistent production of allergen-specific IgE. However, IgE antibodies and the plasma cells that secrete them tend to be short-lived. Persistent allergen-specific IgE titres are thought to be derived from the continued renewal of IgE plasma cells from memory B cells in response to allergen encounters. The initial generation of allergen-specific IgE is driven by B cell activation by IL-4 producing Tfh cells, but the cellular and molecular mechanisms of the long-term production of IgE are poorly characterized. This review investigates the mechanisms governing IgE production and Tfh activation in the primary and recall responses, towards the objective of identifying molecular targets for therapeutic intervention that durably inactivate the IgE recall response."

"Medical volume data are rapidly increasing, growing from gigabytes to petabytes, which presents significant challenges in organisation, storage, transmission, manipulation, and rendering. To address the challenges, we propose an end-to-end architecture for data compression, leveraging advanced deep learning technologies. This architecture consists of three key modules: downsampling, implicit neural representation (INR), and super-resolution (SR). We employ a trade-off point method to optimise each module's performance and achieve the best balance between high compression rates and reconstruction quality. Experimental results on multi-parametric MRI data demonstrate that our method achieves a high compression rate of up to 97.5% while maintaining superior reconstruction accuracy, with a Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 40.05 dB and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of 0.96. This approach significantly reduces GPU memory requirements and processing time, making it a practical solution for handling large medical datasets."

"Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are severe mucocutaneous disorders characterized by extensive tissue necrosis; they are often accompanied by severe ocular complications (SOC). The regulatory role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in modulating immune responses in SJS/TEN is not fully understood, particularly in relation to chronic SOC. We explored the expression profiles of specific miRNAs and their potential impact on the regulation of key innate immune genes in patients with SJS/TEN with SOC. We analyzed plasma samples from 100 patients with chronic stage SJS/TEN with SOC and 92 healthy controls to examine the expression levels of eight specific miRNAs (let-7a-5p, let-7d-3p, let-7e-5p, miR-146a-5p, miR-130a-3p, miR-151a-3p, miR-151a-5p, miR-27b-3p) using quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR). In addition, we subjected mononuclear cells from 12 SJS/TEN patients and 9 controls to RT-qPCR to assess the expression of the innate immune-related genes IFI44L, TNFSF10, AIM2, RSAD2, CXCL10, TRIM22, IFI27, and IFIT2. Significant upregulation of 4 miRNAs (let-7a-5p, let-7e-5p, miR-146a-5p, and miR-27b-3p) was observed in the plasma of SJS/TEN patients; this correlated with the increased expression of TLR3, RIG-I, and MDA5. Furthermore, MDA5, IFI44L, RSAD2, CXCL10, and IFIT2 were also significantly up-regulated in the mononuclear cells from these patients, indicating a systemic modulation of immune response genes. Our findings demonstrate that specific miRNAs are up-regulated in SJS/TEN with SOC and associated with the upregulation of critical immune response genes, suggesting their involvement in the pathogenesis and persistence of SOC. These miRNAs and their target genes may serve as potential biomarkers or therapeutic targets in managing SJS/TEN with SOC."
"Survivors of critical illness and their caregivers are at risk for long-term cognitive, physical and psychiatric impairments known as post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) and PICS-family, respectively.

"The advent of deepfake technology has raised significant concerns regarding its impact on individuals' cognitive processes and beliefs, considering the pervasive relationships between technology and human cognition. This study delves into the psychological literature surrounding deepfakes, focusing on people's public representation of this emerging technology and highlighting prevailing themes, opinions, and emotions. Under the media framing, the theoretical framework is crucial in shaping individuals' cognitive schemas regarding technology. A qualitative method has been applied to unveil patterns, correlations, and recurring themes of beliefs about the main topic, deepfake, discussed on the forum Quora. The final extracted text corpus consisted of 166 answers to 17 questions. Analysis results highlighted the 20 most prevalent critical lemmas, and deepfake was the main one. Moreover, co-occurrence analysis identified words frequently appearing with the lemma deepfake, including video, create, and artificial intelligence-finally, thematic analysis identified eight main themes within the deepfake corpus. Cognitive processes rely on critical thinking skills in detecting anomalies in fake videos or discerning between the negative and positive impacts of deepfakes from an ethical point of view. Moreover, people adapt their beliefs and mental schemas concerning the representation of technology. Future studies should explore the role of media literacy in helping individuals to identify deepfake content since people may not be familiar with the concept of deepfakes or may not fully understand the negative or positive implications. Increased awareness and understanding of technology can empower individuals to evaluate critically the media related to Artificial Intelligence."

"Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) presents significant treatment challenges due to its complex etiology and late-stage diagnosis. The traditional Chinese medicine Selaginella doederleinii Hieron (S. doederleinii) has shown potentiality in NPC treatment due to its multi-target, multi-pathway anti-cancer mechanisms. First, we identified NPC related target genes from databases like GeneCards, OMIM, and DisGeNET, and performed WGCNA analysis on the GSE53819 dataset to identify several important gene modules related to NPC. Active components and their targets in S. doederleinii were screened from the TCMSP and other databases, identifying 32 overlapping genes. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis revealed that these genes are primarily involved in critical biological processes like protein phosphorylation and cell cycle regulation. A protein-protein interaction network was constructed, and cytoHubba identified six key genes (BCL2, MAPK14, ABCB1, PLK1, ATM, HMOX1). Kaplan-Meier analysis and immune infiltration analysis further showed that these key genes are closely related to the prognosis and immune microenvironment of NPC patients. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis revealed the expression distribution of key genes across different immune cell types and explored their roles in the differentiation process of malignant cells through pseudotime trajectory analysis. Molecular docking and dynamics simulation results indicated that the Berberine-MAPK14 and Matairesinol-PLK1 complexes have high binding affinity and stability. Binding free energy calculations confirmed the stability of these complexes. Based on our comprehensive multi-level analysis, the active components of S. doederleinii may play a significant role in the treatment of NPC through multi-pathway and multi-target synergistic effects."
"Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FL-HCC) is a primary liver tumour presenting at a young age. Aggressive surgery of FL-HCC is the mainstay of management unlike other malignancies where metastatic stage precludes curative surgery. There are limited reports of response of FL-HCC to systemic therapies predominantly owing to its rarity. In the index case, a young boy presented with the awareness of abdominal lump with minimal systemic complaints. Radiological imaging showed arterially enhancing liver and pancreatic lesions leading to clinical suspicion of non-functional pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour with neuroendocrine liver metastases in non-cirrhotic liver. Histopathological examination with immunohistochemistry following left lateral hepatectomy with pancreaticoduodenectomy and lymphadenectomy showed FL-HCC with lymph nodal metastases involving intrapancreatic lymph node and station 7, 8 lymph nodes. The patient had an uneventful postsurgical recovery and was kept under close follow-up. FL-HCC with nodal metastasis involving intrapancreatic lymph node is an unusual phenomenon and a challenging clinicopathological diagnosis."
"Age and growth-related data are basic biological parameters, essential in population ecology, evolution, and conservation biology. There is a growing body of published information on reptile demography derived from sclerochronology, a technique based on counting the growth layers deposited in bones (skeletochronology) and other hard body structures. Since the data are not always easily available, we compiled the existing published data, described the current status of knowledge, synthetized the conclusions of disparate studies, and identified patterns of research and information gaps, prioritizing the needs for future research. Our database includes the results of 468 published studies covering 236 reptile species from 41 families. These represent less than 2% of the total number of known extant species. Turtles and crocodiles are proportionally better studied, while snakes are the least examined group. The distribution of the research does not reflect conservation needs; we found an important geographic bias, with an overrepresentation of Northern temperate species. Only 23% of the studies checked the assumption of periodicity of growth marks deposition, and the method was found to be reliable or adequate in 79% of the cases. Overall, the data obtained through sclerochronology can be considered robust, especially if validation methods are employed, since the general goal is to characterize population parameters, trends, and dynamics, rather than determining the exact age of any specimen in particular."
"A new method is developed using elastic lipid nanovesicles (ELNs) loaded with ethanolic extract of Lantana camara (LC) to enhance skin permeation of plant actives. The ELNs contained cholesterol, 1, 2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, span 80, and tween 80. Firstly, 15 formulations were produced to examine critical factors likely affecting formulation characteristics. In addition, surface characteristics, vesicle size, polydispersity index, zeta potential, degree of deformability, and % entrapment efficiency (% EE) of ELN were examined. As a significant parameter, skin permeation was measured (using Start-M; it highly resembles human skin). The influence of size, hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB), and surface ratio were vital to permeation through Start-M. In particular, the % LC extract permeation decreased at more extensive size ranges, 400, and 350-450 nm. In contrast, the % LC extract permeation increased significantly at smaller size ranges, such as 200 and 100 nm. More than 75% of the LC extract was permeated within 8 h when the surfactant ratio was (span 80:tween 80; 25%:75%). Permeation studies conducted based on HLB values revealed that 78% of LC extract was permeated in 8 h when HLB was 12.2, and that permeation decreased with an increase in HLB. Cell viability assay using SK-MEL-37 cells (skin cancer) revealed that ELN reduced the viability by ~80% in 24 h, further validating the formulation. Future research could investigate the long-term safety and therapeutic potential of these ELNs in clinical settings and their effectiveness in delivering other plant-based extracts for transdermal applications via ELNs."

"Basic mechanism of ventricular functional mitral regurgitation (FMR) is subvalvular tethering. Left ventricular (LV) dilatation, in association with mitral valve (MV) annular dilatation, causes outward displacement of papillary muscles (PMs), which abnormally pulls or tethers MV leaflets, resulting in MV tenting, reduction in leaflets coaptation and MR. Because surgical annuloplasty does shorten distance between anterior and posterior MV annuli to improve coaptation but does not address this subvalvular tethering, ventricular FMR frequently persists or recurs in the chronic stage after surgical annuloplasty. This high incidence of persistent/recurrent MR requires additional procedures to reduce subvalvular tethering. Although patients occasionally show marked improvements after annuloplasty with surgical tethering reduction procedures such as PM approximation, evidence to support benefits of such surgery is limited, requiring further trials. Recently, MV adaptation or MV leaflets tissue growth associated with LV dilatation attracts attention. Patients with larger MV leaflets with significant LV dilatation/dysfunction show less MV tethering and MR compared to those with smaller MV leaflets but with similar LV remodeling, suggesting the protective or beneficial role of MV leaflets tissue growth against LV remodeling. The MV leaflets tissue growth has the potential to lead to novel strategies of treatment for ventricular FMR. It is well known that atrial FMR is frequent in patients with left atrial dilatation, typically in those with isolated atrial fibrillation. The degree of atrial FMR is usually mild, even when it is present, and occasionally moderate, and severe atrial FMR is really rare. It is known that only severe regurgitation causes heart failure in primary MR, resulting in description on indications of surgery or intervention for only severe MR in current guidelines. Therefore, this atrial FMR up to moderate degree did not attract attention for a long time. However, recent studies have shown that patients with only moderate atrial FMR develop severe heart failure, suggesting more aggressive indication of MV surgery or intervention for ""moderate"" regurgitation in patients with atrial FMR. Therefore, atrial FMR is now recognized highly important. The unveiled malignant nature of atrial FMR arises many questions, including (1) why patients with only moderate atrial FMR develop heart failure? (2) do patients with mild atrial FMR develop heart failure or not?, and many others. Atrial FMR seems even more mysterious after the unveiling of its significance."
"Attending university marks a pivotal yet stressful phase in students' lives, characterized by significant adjustments to a new environment that can impact mental, emotional, and physical well-being.

"Microneedles represent a miniaturized mechanical structure with versatile applications, including transdermal drug delivery, vaccination, body-fluid extraction, and bio-sensing. Over the past two decades, microneedle-based devices have garnered considerable attention in the biomedicine field, exhibiting the potential for mitigating patient discomfort, enhancing treatment adherence, avoiding first-pass effects, and facilitating precise therapeutic interventions. As an application-oriented technology, the innovation of microneedles is generally carried out in response to a specific demand. Currently, three most common applications of microneedles are drug delivery, fluid extraction, and bio-sensing. This review focuses on the progress in the materials, fabrication techniques, and design of microneedles in recent years. On this basis, the progress and innovation of microneedles in the current research stage are introduced in terms of their three main applications."
"As people with cystic fibrosis (PWCF) live longer due to the breakthrough drug elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor (ETI), they have questioned whether other CF therapies could be safely discontinued. SIMPLIFY was the first prospective, randomized trial to evaluate non-inferiority of discontinuing versus continuing two therapies. The QUEST (Qualitative Understanding of Experiences in the SIMPLIFY Trial) study was conducted to understand experiences of PWCF enrolled in SIMPLIFY, including why they joined, perceptions of randomization, decision-making around study withdrawal, and considerations for future discontinuation studies."
"Extramammary Paget disease (EMPD) is a rare skin cancer that typically occurs in the anogenital area of older people. Since efficacy of treatments for metastatic or unresectable EMPD remains poor, development of a novel therapeutic approach is strongly desired. However, the lack of EMPD models has hampered investigation of EMPD. Here we investigated whether trophoblast cell surface antigen 2 (TROP2) could be a promising therapeutic target for EMPD. We retrospectively collected 108 samples from 54 patients with primary and metastatic EMPD from 10 Japanese institutions, and compared TROP2 expression between primary and metastatic lesions of each paired sample. In vitro assays were performed using a newly established EMPD cell line, KS-EMPD-1. TROP2 was strongly and homogeneously expressed in patient tissues, regardless of primary or metastatic lesions. The KS-EMPD-1 cells were treated with a TROP2-targeted antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), sacituzumab govitecan, and it significantly reduced cell viability in a dose-dependent manner compared with that of the cells treated with sacituzumab alone. Knockdown of TROP2 reduced cell viability and cell migration, and caused slight upregulation of the apoptosis-related factors, together with downregulation of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition-related factors. These findings suggest that a TROP2-targeted ADC may be a promising treatment option for unresectable EMPD."
"Insomnia, a known cardiovascular risk factor, is common in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. There is growing acknowledgment of a potential bidirectional relationship between cardiovascular diseases and sleep disorders. We previously assessed the risk factors for common sleep disorders in ESRD patients. This follow-up study assesses the demographic and clinical cardiovascular-related risk factors for insomnia diagnosis in ESRD patients, given their increased cardiovascular burden."
"This comprehensive longitudinal study explored for the first time the interrelations between neonatal brainstem abnormalities, focused attention (FA), and learning-following a preterm cohort (N = 175; 46.3% female; predominantly White) from birth (2003-2006) to 17 years. The findings indicated that FA during early childhood was associated with language outcomes in toddlerhood (n = 131) and academic and attention self-report indices in late adolescence (n = 44). Pilot assessments indicated that FA at 17 years (n = 25) was also associated with concurrent academic and attention functioning. Structural equation modeling analyses revealed that neonatal brainstem functioning, manifested in auditory brainstem response patterns, was associated with early-life FA competence, which affected learning development. Implications underscore the essential role of early brainstem function and FA in shaping childhood learning trajectories."

"Liver cancer is the sixth most frequent malignancy and the fourth major cause of deaths worldwide. The current treatments are only effective in early stages of cancer. To overcome the therapeutic challenges and exploration of immunotherapeutic options, broad spectral therapeutic vaccines could have significant impact. Based on immunoinformatic and integrated machine learning tools, we predicted the potential therapeutic vaccine candidates of liver cancer. In this study, machine learning and MD simulation-based approach are effectively used to design T-cell epitopes that aid the immune system against liver cancer. Antigenicity, molecular weight, subcellular localization and expression site predictions were used to shortlist liver cancer associated proteins including AMBP, CFB, CDHR5, VTN, APOBR, AFP, SERPINA1 and APOE. We predicted CD8+ T-cell epitopes of these proteins containing LGEGATEAE, LLYIGKDRK, EDIGTEADV, QVDAAMAGR, HLEARKKSK, HLCIRHEMT, LKLSKAVHK, EQGRVRAAT and CD4+ T-cell epitopes of VLGEGATEA, WVTKQLNEI, VEEDTKVNS, FTRINCQGK, WGILGREEA, LQDGEKIMS, VKFNKPFVF, VRAATVGSL. We observed the substantial physicochemical properties of these epitopes with a significant binding affinity with MHC molecules. A polyvalent construct of these epitopes was designed using suitable linkers and adjuvant indicated significant binding energy (>-10.5 kcal/mol) with MHC class-I and II molecule. Based on in silico cloning, we found the considerable compatibility of this polyvalent construct with the E. coli expression system and the efficiency of its translation in host. The system-level and machine learning based cross validations showed the possible effect of these T-cell epitopes as potential vaccine candidates for the treatment of liver cancer."
"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) constitutes approximately 80-85% of cancer-related fatalities globally, and direct and indirect comparisons of various therapies for NSCLC are lacking. In this study, we aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutated NSCLC."
"The field of plant non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) has seen significant advancements in recent years, with many ncRNAs recognized as important regulators of gene expression during plant development and stress responses. Moreover, the coding potential of these ncRNAs, giving rise to ncRNA-encoded peptides (ncPEPs), has emerged as an essential area of study. However, existing plant ncRNA databases lack comprehensive information on ncRNA-encoded peptides (ncPEPs) and cell type-specific interactions. To address this gap, we present ncPlantDB (https://bis.zju.edu.cn/ncPlantDB), a comprehensive database integrating ncRNA and ncPEP data across 43 plant species. ncPlantDB encompasses 353 140 ncRNAs, 3799 ncPEPs and 4 647 071 interactions, sourced from established databases and literature mining. The database offers unique features including translational potential data, cell-specific interaction networks derived from single-cell RNA sequencing and Ribo-seq analyses, and interactive visualization tools. ncPlantDB provides a user-friendly interface for exploring ncRNA expression patterns at the single-cell level, facilitating the discovery of tissue-specific ncRNAs and potential ncPEPs. By integrating diverse data types and offering advanced analytical tools, ncPlantDB serves as a valuable resource for researchers investigating plant ncRNA functions, interactions, and their potential coding capacity. This database significantly enhances our understanding of plant ncRNA biology and opens new avenues for exploring the complex regulatory networks in plant genomics."

"Dancers require adequate nutrition support for growth and development during the pre-professional stage, as well as to fuel classes and rehearsals and to enhance performance for both pre-professional and professional dancers. The aim of this study is to understand the energy status and diet of pre-professional and professional dancers in the genres of ballet, contemporary, musical theatre, and opera."
There is a paucity of confirmatory randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effectiveness of totally laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (TLDG) vs laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy (LADG) for early gastric cancer (EGC).
"An asymptomatic 79-year old woman presented with a 40 mm pancreatic cystic lesion, located in the pancreatic body-tail and consistent with branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (BD-IPMN) without ""high risk stigmata"". During a 4-year follow-up period, imaging showed no mural nodules or main pancreatic duct dilation, and serum CEA and CA19.9 were within normal range. Later, computed tomography showed a rapid increase in cyst size up to 59 mm, which led to a clinical suspicion of malignant transformation. The patient underwent distal pancreatectomy, and final histology revealed the presence of three distinct pancreatic neoplasms: serous cystadenoma (SCA), BD-IPMN, and well-differentiated G1 neuroendocrine tumour (PanNET-G1). The co-occurrence of pancreatic neuroendocrine and exocrine tumours is exceedingly rare. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of the concomitant presence of three different pancreatic tumors in the same pancreatic specimen arose adjacent one to each other within the same macroscopic lesion."
"Haploinsufficiency of SF3B2 is associated with craniofacial microsomia, characterized by mandibular hypoplasia and microtia, often with preauricular tags or pits, epibulbar dermoids, and cleft palate. In addition, extracraniofacial anomalies may be present, such as skeletal, cardiac renal, and abnormalities of the central nervous system. Variants have been either de novo or inherited, and both inter- and intrafamilial variability has been observed. Here we describe a patient referred for exome sequencing for a complex congenital heart defect and Hirschsprung disease found by exome sequencing to be heterozygous for a loss of function variant, c.945dup (p.Val316SerfsTer5), in SF3B2. This variant was inherited from a parent with an isolated cardiac defect. Interestingly, neither have the defining craniofacial features or other dysmorphisms. This report further illustrates the degree of phenotypic variability seen in SF3B2-related disease and expands the spectrum to include Hirschsprung disease."
Mumps infections primarily affect childhood and the hallmark of infection is swelling of the parotid glands. The mumps cases decreased noticeably in Chile with the introduction of the triple virus vaccine.
"Adzuki bean (AB) is a legume with a low glycemic index and is traditionally used in Asian cultures to modulate type 2 diabetes (T2D). Our objectives were to characterize the functional peptides from purified AB β-vignin after simulated gastrointestinal digestion in comparison to soybean β-conglycinin, to evaluate their DPP IV inhibitory capacity, and to determine in vitro the effect of digested AB β-vignin on diabetic-related outcomes using HepG2 cells in healthy and insulin-resistant states. Five peptides (215-742 Da) from AB β-vignin and five peptides (215-447 Da) from β-conglycinin were identified to exhibit bioactivity as DPP IV inhibitors. Molecular docking demonstrated peptides could bind to DPP IV at the same binding site as a diabetic medication, linagliptin. Digested AB β-vignin significantly increased (p < 0.05) hepatic glucose uptake (> 290 %) via DPP IV inhibition (> 40 %) in healthy and insulin-resistant states. IRS-1, Akt-1, and Glut 2 increased after treating cells with digested AB β-vignin in healthy and insulin-resistant states."
"TP53 gene disruption, including 17p13 deletion [del(17p)] and/or TP53 mutations, is a negative prognostic biomarker in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) associated with disease progression, treatment failure and shorter survival. Germline variants in p53 signaling pathway genes could also lead to p53 dysfunction, but their involvement in CLL has not been thoroughly evaluated. The aim of this study was to determine the association of TP53, MDM2 and NQO1 gene variability with clinical and genetic data of CLL patients. Individual genotype and haplotype data of CLL patients were compared with clinical prognostic factors, cytogenetic and molecular cytogenetic findings as well as IGHV and TP53 mutational status. The study included 116 CLL patients and 161 healthy blood donors. TP53 (rs1042522, rs59758982, rs1625895), NQO1 (rs1800566) and MDM2 (rs2279744, rs150550023) variants were genotyped using different PCR approaches. Analysis of genotype frequencies revealed no association with the risk of CLL. TP53 rs1042522, rs1625895 and MDM2 rs2279744 variants were significantly associated with abnormal karyotype and the presence of del(17p). Similarly, these two TP53 variants were associated with TP53 disruption. Moreover, TP53 C-A-nondel and G-A-del haplotypes (rs1042522-rs1625895-rs59758982) were associated with an increased likelihood of carrying del(17p) and TP53 disruptions. MDM2 T-nondel haplotype (rs2279744-rs150550023) was found to be a low risk factor for del(17p) (OR = 0.32; CI: 0.12-0.82; p = 0.02) and TP53 disruptions (OR = 0.41; CI: 0.18-0.95; p = 0.04). Our findings suggest that TP53 and MDM2 variants may modulate the risk to have chromosome alterations and TP53 disruptions, particularly del(17p). To our knowledge this is the first study of several germline variants in p53 pathway genes in Argentine patients with CLL."
"Under ideal conditions, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii can photoacclimate to excess light through various short- and long-term mechanisms. However, how microalgae handle excess light stress once they exit exponential growth, and especially in stationary phase, is less understood. Our study explored C. reinhardtii's photoprotection capacity and acclimation strategies during high-light stress once batch culture growth reached stationary phase. We monitored cultures of wildtype strain (CC125) over five days once they reached stationary phase under both low-light (LL) and high-light (HL) conditions. Under HL, many photosynthetic proteins were degraded but the stress-related light harvesting complex protein (LHCSR) was rapidly induced and contributed to the rapid activation of nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ). However, the LHCSR3-defective mutant (CC4614, npq4) lacked the rapid induction of quenching typical of post-exponential cultures, indicating that LHCSR3 is required for this response in stationary phase. Collectively, the main strategy for photoacclimation in stationary phase appears to be a dramatic reduction of photosystems while maintaining LHCII-LHCSR antenna complexes that prime the antenna for rapid activation of quenching upon light exposure. Part of this response to HL involves a resumption of cell growth after two days, that we hypothesized is due to the stimulation of growth-regulating pathways due to increased metabolite pools from the HL-induced protein turnover in the cell, something that remains to be tested. These findings demonstrate how C. reinhardtii manages high-light stress during stationary phases to maximize longevity."
"Bipolar disorder is a severe recurrent, episodic psychiatric condition with a worldwide prevalence of approximately 1%, affecting more than 5 million adults in the United States in 2020. A subtype, bipolar I disorder (BP-I), which accounts for approximately one-quarter of cases, is associated with impairments in psychosocial functioning and quality of life. Recommended treatment options include daily oral, or long-acting injectable, antipsychotics, including the aripiprazole once every month formulation, which has been shown to improve adherence compared with oral treatments. A new formulation of aripiprazole for administration once every 2 months ready to use (Ari 2MRTU) has been shown to have similar efficacy to monthly treatment, with only 6 doses annually."
"Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury (MIRI) is a serious clinical complication that is caused by reperfusion therapy following myocardial infarction (MI). Mitochondria-related genes (Mito-RGs) play important roles in multiple diseases. However, the role of mitochondria-related genes in MIRI remains largely unknown. The GSE67308 dataset from the GEO database was utilized to identify MIRI-related gene modules through WGCNA. Meanwhile, differential expression analysis was conducted to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the GSE61592 dataset. Next, candidate Mito-RGs related to MIRI were screened by Venn analysis. Thereafter, a myocardial hypoxia/reperfusion (H/R) H9C2 cell model and a mouse ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) model were established to verify the expression level of glycine decarboxylase (Gldc) in MIRI in vitro and in vivo. Based on data from the GEO database, Gldc levels were notably upregulated in murine MIRI samples, compared to the control group. RT-qPCR and western blot confirmed that Gldc levels were obviously elevated in the heart of I/R mice and H/R-exposed cardiomyocytes. Moreover, the deficiency of Gldc notably increased the viability and reduced the apoptosis and inflammatory responses in H9C2 cells exposed to H/R. Meanwhile, Gldc downregulation significantly reduced p-NF-κB p65, Bax and cleaved caspase 3 levels and elevated p-Akt and Bcl-2 levels in H9C2 cells exposed to H/R. The ROC curve analysis further demonstrated that Gldc gene exhibited good diagnostic value for MIRI. Collectively, Gldc deficiency could attenuate H/R injury in cardiomyocytes in vitro through activating Akt and inactivating NF-κB signalings. These data suggested that GLDC may serve as both a diagnostic and therapeutic target for MIRI."
"Mecoptera is a small relict order of insects within the Holometabola. Panorpidae is the most speciose family in Mecoptera. They are also known as scorpion flies due to the enlarged and upward recurved male genital bulb. Panorpa liui Hua, 1997, a member of Panorpidae, is a bivoltine species of seasonal color polyphenism in the lowland plain of northeastern China. In this study, we applied PacBio HiFi and Hi-C sequencing technologies to generate a chromosome-level genome reference of P. liui. The assembled genome is 678.26 Mbp in size, with 91.3% being anchored onto 23 pseudo-chromosomes. Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO) estimation reveals the completeness of this assembly as 95.1%. By integrating full-length transcriptome and homologs of related species, we generated full annotation of this assembly, yielding a total of 15,960 protein-coding genes, of these, 15,892 genes were anchored on the 23 chromosomes. The high-quality genome provides critical genomic resources for population genetics and phylogenetic research on Mecoptera. It also offers valuable information for exploring the mechanisms underlying seasonal color polymorphism."
"The aim of our study is to examine the persistence of EEG coherence in the fundamental waves-delta, theta, alpha, and beta-both across spatial domains (within the brain, interhemispheric) and over extended periods (interannual). The long-term stability of a specific EEG wave coherence suggests its potential as a neural fingerprint. A total of 28 participants were included in the intrahemispheric-interannual FFT coherence analysis, comparing EEG data collected years apart. The average interannual interval between the first and second EEG recordings was 7.11 ± 4.56 years, with a range from 1.88 to 19.19 years. The combined data from the two EEG sessions shared 62.7 % of their variance, underscoring significant overlap in their information content. The interannual canonical correlation between the first and second EEGs was 0.792, indicating a strong relationship over time. Overall, alpha coherence, particularly in the frontal lobe, showed marked long-term stability, suggesting it as a strong candidate for an EEG fingerprint. Notably, when comparing fundamental wave coherences in the occipital lobe between the first and second EEGs, only the beta coherence exhibited a remarkable correlation over the years."
"It is often the case that serious, end-stage manifestations of disease result from secondary complications in organs distinct from the initial site of injury or infection. This is particularly true of diseases of the heart-lung axis, given the tight anatomical connections of the two organs within a common cavity in which they collectively orchestrate the two major, intertwined circulatory pathways. Immune cells and the soluble mediators they secrete serve as effective, and targetable, messengers of signals between different regions of the body but can also contribute to the spread of pathology. In this review, we discuss the immunological basis of interorgan communication between the heart and lung in various common diseases, and in the context of organ crosstalk more generally. Gaining a greater understanding of how the heart and lung communicate in health and disease, and viewing disease progression generally from a more holistic, whole-body viewpoint have the potential to inform new diagnostic approaches and strategies for better prevention and treatment of comorbidities."
"Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) refers to a clinical condition characterized by gastric content reflux into the esophagus, causing symptoms like acid regurgitation and heartburn. While patient education is essential for GERD treatment, traditional educational models often struggle to effectively improve treatment outcomes."
"Accurate differentiation between placenta accreta spectrum (PAS) and uterine-scar dehiscence with underlying non-adherent placenta is often challenging, even for PAS experts, both prenatally and intraoperatively. We investigated the use of standardized two-dimensional grayscale ultrasound and Doppler imaging markers in differentiating between these closely related, yet distinct, conditions."
"Aging is a complex process manifesting at molecular, cellular, organ, and organismal levels. It leads to functional decline, disease, and ultimately death, but the relationship between these fundamental biomedical features remains elusive. By applying elastic net regularization to plasma proteome data of over 50,000 human subjects in the UK Biobank and other cohorts, we report interpretable organ-specific and conventional aging models trained on chronological age, mortality, and longitudinal proteome data. These models predict organ/system-specific disease and indicate that men age faster than women in most organs. Accelerated organ aging leads to diseases in these organs, and specific diets, lifestyles, professions, and medications influence organ aging rates. We then identify proteins driving these associations with organ-specific aging. Our analyses reveal that age-related chronic diseases epitomize accelerated organ- and system-specific aging, modifiable through environmental factors, advocating for both universal whole-organism and personalized organ/system-specific anti-aging interventions."
"Research has not demonstrated whether multiple cups of negative pressure cupping therapy would induce interactions of hemodynamic responses between different areas. A multichannel near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) was used to assess oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin oscillations in response to cupping therapy. Wavelet transform and wavelet phase (WPC) coherence were used to quantify NIRS signals. Three levels of negative pressure (-75, -225, and -300 mmHg) were applied to the gastrocnemius in 12 healthy adults. Oxyhemoglobin coherence between the two inside-cup areas was higher at -75 mmHg compared to -300 mmHg in both metabolic (WPC = 0.80 ± 0.11 vs. 0.73 ± 0.13) and neurogenic (WPC = 0.70 ± 0.11 vs. 0.60 ± 0.17) controls. Deoxyhemoglobin coherence was also higher at -75 mmHg compared to -300 mmHg in both metabolic (WPC = 0.78 ± 0.11 vs. 0.66 ± 0.14) and neurogenic (WPC = 0.67 ± 0.11 vs. 0.58 ± 0.13) controls. Our study provides first evidence on the interaction of hemodynamic responses between the two cups of cupping therapy using WPC analysis of NIRS signals."
"Trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) has demonstrated remarkable efficacy as a third- or later-line chemotherapy for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive advanced gastric and gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinomas. However, it may cause pneumonitis, and its efficacy in rare histologies such as gastric adenocarcinoma with enteroblastic differentiation (GAED) remains unclear. A 74-year-old woman with unresectable HER2-positive GAED and lung metastasis received T-DXd as a fifth-line chemotherapy. Treatment was discontinued after 15 cycles owing to drug-induced pneumonitis; however, the patient achieved a sustained complete response for 14 months without subsequent chemotherapy or the exacerbation of pneumonitis. T-DXd was effective in HER2-positive GAED."
"In this study, we develop a comprehensive two-phase model to analyze the dynamics of bacterial swarming on porous substrates. The two distinct phases under consideration are the cell and aqueous phases. We use the thin-film approximation, as the characteristic height of the swarm is significantly lower than its characteristic radius. Our model incorporates surfactant generation by microorganisms, drag forces between the cell and aqueous phases, osmotic influx, and Marangoni stresses. The disjoining pressure is included to account for substrate wettability, and a precursor film is used to address the contact line singularity. Several morphologies of bacterial swarms, such as arrested, circular, modulated, branching, droplet, fingering, and dendrite, have been observed experimentally. The model developed is capable of predicting all these shapes for realistic parameter values. An increase in the wettability of the substrate leads to faster expansion, while increased surface tension helps redistribute biomass radially. The role of biomass growth and surfactant production rate, surfactant diffusivity, and osmotic influx on the morphology of bacterial swarms are explained."
"Resting energy expenditure (REE) and metabolic fuel utilization (carbohydrate or fat) proxied by respiratory quotient (RQ) from indirect calorimetry enables more precise measurement of energy needs and fat oxidation capacity. The study compared the effectiveness of providing energy expenditure information during diet and exercise weight intervention versus standard of care (SOC) on weight loss outcomes. Fifty-two participants with obesity were recruited from a specialist weight loss service, randomized 1:1 to intervention (INT) or SOC only. Participants in INT received four-weekly dietetic counselling, using biofeedback from energy expenditure data to recommend caloric restriction and physical activity goals, in addition to SOC. The primary outcome was the mean difference in weight loss between both groups after 24 weeks. Secondary outcomes include participant acceptability and tolerability using indirect calorimetry. Participants in the INT group demonstrated additional weight loss (-2.3 kg [95% CI: -3.1, -1.5]; p <.001), reduced waist circumference (-3.9 cm [95% CI: -5.48, -2.26]; p <.001), and decreased body fat percentage (-1.5% [95% CI:-2.31, -0.72], p <.001), compared to SOC, after adjusting for baseline body mass index, age, and sex. Forty-two percent (10/24) of participants in INT group achieved the minimum clinically significant threshold of 5% weight loss from baseline, compared to 8% (2/26) in the SOC group (p = .007). Participant acceptability and tolerability of indirect calorimetry were high, with mean scores of 4.5 ± 0.6 and 4.2 ± 0.7 (5-point Likert scale). The study establishes the safety and practical integration of biofeedback using indirect calorimetry promoting improved self-regulation and enhancing weight loss."
"Effective evidence-based physical activity and nutrition interventions to prevent overweight and obesity and support healthy child development need to be sustained within Early Childhood Education and Care (ECEC) services. Despite this, little is known about factors that influence sustainability of these programs in ECEC settings. Therefore, the aim of this study was to describe the factors related to sustainability of physical activity and nutrition interventions in ECEC settings and examine their association with ECEC service characteristics."

"Controversy persists regarding the representation of linguistically negated actions, specifically concerning activation and inhibitory mechanisms in the motor system, and whether negated action sentences evoke an initial motor simulation of the action to be negated. We conducted two experiments probing corticospinal excitability (CSE) and short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) in the primary motor cortex at different latencies while reading affirmative and negative action sentences. In experiment one, twenty-six participants read action and non-action sentences in affirmative or negative forms. Using transcranial magnetic stimulation, we probed CSE in hand muscles at rest and at several latencies after verb presentation. We observed a greater CSE for action sentences compared to non-action sentences, regardless of verb form. In experiment two, nineteen participants read affirmative and negative action sentences. We measured CSE and SICI at short and long latencies after verb presentation. CSE was greater for affirmative and negative action sentences at both latencies compared to rest. SICI did not change at the short latency but increased at longer latencies, regardless of verb form. Negated action sentences showed the same motor excitability as affirmed action sentences with no additional inhibition at early latencies. These results lend support for the idea that actions to be negated are initially simulated within the motor system. Neural differences between affirmative and negative action sentences may occur outside the primary motor cortex."
"We aimed to evaluate the association of coffee consumption with different additives, including milk and/or sweetener (sugar and/or artificial sweetener), and different coffee types, with new-onset acute kidney injury (AKI), and examine the modifying effects of genetic variation in caffeine metabolism. 194 324 participants without AKI at baseline in the UK Biobank were included. The study outcome was new-onset AKI. During a median follow-up of 11·6 years, 5864 participants developed new-onset AKI. Compared with coffee non-consumers, a significantly lower risk of new-onset AKI was found in coffee consumers adding neither milk nor sugar to coffee (hazard ratio (HR), 0·86; 95 % CI, 0·78, 0·94) and adding only milk to coffee (HR,0·83; 95 % CI, 0·78, 0·89), but not in coffee consumers adding only sweetener (HR,1·14; 95 % CI, 0·99, 1·31) and both milk and sweetener to coffee (HR,0·96; 95 % CI, 0·89, 1·03). Moreover, there was a U-shaped association of coffee consumption with new-onset AKI, with the lowest risk at 2-3 drinks/d, in unsweetened coffee (no additives or milk only to coffee), but no association was found in sweetened coffee (sweetener only or both milk and sweetener to coffee). Genetic variation in caffeine metabolism did not significantly modify the association. A similar U-shaped association was found for instant, ground and decaffeinated coffee consumption in unsweetened coffee consumers, but not in sweetened coffee consumers. In conclusion, moderate consumption (2-3 drinks/d) of unsweetened coffee with or without milk was associated with a lower risk of new-onset AKI, irrespective of coffee type and genetic variation in caffeine metabolism."
"In recent years, a smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment (EMA) approach for assessing awake bruxism (AB) has attracted growing interest, both in clinical and research settings. The present study was designed to investigate subjects' experience using an EMA-based smartphone application to detect factors that could hamper or facilitate its use for clinical and research purposes."

"Throughout the 20th century, radiographs and fluoroscopies became essential elements to complete clinical evaluation. Images of the most relevant cases, together with their clinical records, were stored in the radiological collections of the hospitals. Over time, the need for physical space due to the emergence of new equipment, together with the digitization of radiographs and their digital storage, put an end to the collections, many of which were lost in a corner of modern X-ray services. That could have been the history of the analog radiological collection of the Hospital Manuel Arriarán, very prolific while its main supporters, Dr. Julio Hasbún Salamé and his successor Dr. Manuel Mena Castro, were active, but then it was forgotten. However, after a great fire occurred in the Hospital Clínico San Borja-Arriarán (HCSBA) in 2021, among the water and debris of the Radiology Department, the boxes containing the Pediatric Radiological Collection were found. Although a large number of images were also affected, an important part was rescued and digitized. The aim of this manuscript is to describe the history of the analog radiological collection of the HCSBA, showing its contribution to numerous manuscripts published in the Revista Chilena de Pediatría, today Andes Pediatrica, in the last century and, through the images, to review a part of the history of Chilean pediatrics and radiology in the last century."
"Depression is a common and debilitating psychiatric disorder worldwide. Recognizing the relationships between depression-related factors can play a significant role in depression management. However, no study has yet used path analysis to examine the mediating role of physical activity, morning wake-up time, and sleep-inducing medication in the relationship between age and depression."
"For many years, the European Forum for Good Clinical Practice (EFGCP) Children Medicines Working Party has organised a Paediatric conference annually. In the past, this event was organised jointly with the European Medicines Agency who was used to host it, along with the Drug Information Association (DIA). This conference is the opportunity for all involved in paediatric drug development, i.e., regulators, HTA bodies, patients' representatives, academia and industry, to share learnings and raise awareness about new regulatory requirements of interest to optimise paediatric drug development. The theme of the 2021 conference was ""Challenges and Solutions - the path forward"" while in 2022 it focused on ""Progress made and Continuing Challenges"". Because of the COVID-19 pandemic these two conferences were organised virtually. However, this has not impacted the attendance and value of the conference, since because of a broad and attractive agenda there was a wide stakeholder participation, which provided a compendious overview of the leading issues to improve children's access to innovative medicines."
"Modern anti-myeloma therapies have broken new ground in the treatment of the disease, and the incorporation of ide-cel in the treatment landscape represents one of the major scientific and clinical advances."
"Urbanization-driven biotic homogenization has been recorded in various ecosystems on local and global scales; however, it is largely unexplored in developing countries. Empirical studies on different taxa and bioregions show conflicting results (i.e. biotic homogenization vs. biotic differentiation); the extent to which the community composition changes in response to anthropogenic disturbances and the factors governing this process, therefore, require elucidation. Here, we used a compiled database of 760 bird species in China to quantify the multiple-site β-diversity and fitted distance decay in pairwise β-diversities between natural and urban assemblages to assess whether urbanization had driven biotic homogenization. We used generalized dissimilarity models (GDM) to elucidate the roles of spatial and environmental factors in avian community dissimilarities before and after urbanization. The multiple-site β-diversities among urban assemblages were markedly lower than those among natural assemblages, and the distance decays in pairwise similarities in natural assemblages were more rapid. These results were consistent among taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional aspects, supporting a general biotic homogenization driven by urbanization. The GDM results indicated that geographical distance and temperature were the dominant predictors of avian community dissimilarity. However, the contribution of geographical distance and climatic factors decreased in explaining compositional dissimilarities in urban assemblages. Geographical and environmental distances accounted for much lower variations in compositional dissimilarities in urban than in natural assemblages, implying a potential risk of uncertainty in model predictions under further climate change and anthropogenic disturbances. Our study concludes that taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional dimensions elucidate urbanization-driven biotic homogenization in China."
"BACKGROUND: Planned tracheal extubation failure is a common occurrence among patients in the neurosurgical intensive care unit (NICU) because of the complex nature of neurocritical injuries, and the failure could result in a poor prognosis. METHODS: We observed and recorded the patients with tracheal intubation in the NICU of a hospital in Shanghai from June 2021 to December 2022 and analyzed data from planned tracheal extubation, categorizing patients by success or failure, and compared outcomes between the two groups while investigating contributing factors. RESULTS: A total of 156 patients were included, 133 (85.3%) of whom were successfully extubated and 23 (14.7%) were not. The results of logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the Glasgow Coma Scale score before extubation (OR, 0.643; 95% CI, 0.444-0.931; P = .020) and the frequency of respiratory secretions suctioning before tracheal extubation (OR, 0.098; 95% CI, 0.027-0.354; P < .001) were independent risk factors for extubation failure. We also found that the extubation failure group experienced a significantly longer ICU stay and incurred higher hospitalization costs. CONCLUSIONS: Poor Glasgow Coma Scale scores and a high frequency of respiratory secretions suctioning before tracheal extubation were the main factors contributing to tracheal extubation failure in NICU patients. To avoid tracheal extubation failure and adverse outcomes, these two factors should be carefully assessed before tracheal extubation."
"Studies have noted the connection between Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) and autoimmunity. MAP is an intracellular pathogen that infects and multiplies in macrophages. To overcome the hostile environment elicited by the macrophage, MAP secretes a battery of virulence factors to neutralize the toxic effects of the macrophage. One of the virulence factors is the Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase A (PtpA), a protein secreted by MAP that interferes in the phago-lysosome fusion, rendering the pathogen unnoticed in the cytoplasm of the macrophage. This study aimed to assess the presence of PtpA antibodies in the sera of Mexican individuals with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and investigate its possible use as a biomarker for disease activity. We compared RA patients (n = 100) to control subjects (CS) (n = 100) by assessing specific immune responses to PtpA (the antigen) by an indirect ELISA method. Results showed a significant difference in PtpA levels between RA and CS, with RA patients having a median OD of 0.4645 compared to 0.1372 in CS. Antibodies against PtpA were present in 95% of RA patients and 16% of CS (AUC = 0.9163, p = 0.0001). Male control subjects showed higher PtpA reactivity than female CS. The Disease Activity Score (DAS-28) analysis showed that individuals with moderate to high disease activity had lower levels of PtpA reactivity. The results suggest a potential connection between RA and MAP infection."
"The evolution of man on Earth took place under conditions of constant exposure to background ionizing radiation (IR). From this point of view, it would be reasonable to hypothesize the existence of adaptive mechanisms that enable the human organism to safely interact with IR at levels approximating long-term natural background levels. In some situations, the successful operation of molecular mechanisms of protection against IR is observed at values significantly exceeding the natural background level, for example, in cancer cells. In 15-25% of cancer patients, cancer cells develop a phenotype that is resistant to high doses of IR. While further investigations are warranted, the current evidence suggests a strong probability of observing positive health effects, including an increased lifespan, a reduced cancer risk, and a decreased incidence of congenital pathologies, precisely at low doses of ionizing radiation. This review offers arguments primarily based on a phenomenological approach and critically reconsidering existing methodologies for assessing the biological risks of IR to human health. Currently, in the most economically developed countries, there are radiation safety rules that interpret low-dose radiation as a clearly negative environmental factor. Nowadays, this approach may pose significant challenges to the advancement of radiomedicine and introduce complexities in the regulation of IR sources. The review also examines molecular mechanisms that may play a key role in the formation of the positive effects of low-dose IR on human radioadaptive capabilities."
"Antimicrobial compounds of natural origin are of interest because of the large number of reports regarding the harmfulness of food preservatives. These natural products can be derived from plants, animal sources, microorganisms, algae, or mushrooms. The aim of this review is to consider known antimicrobials of natural origin and the mechanisms of their action, antimicrobial photodynamic technology, and ultrasound for disinfection. Plant extracts and their active compounds, chitosan and chitosan oligosaccharide, bioactive peptides, and essential oils are highly potent preservatives. It has been experimentally proven that they possess strong antibacterial capabilities against bacteria, yeast, and fungi, indicating the possibility of their use in the future to create preservatives for the pharmaceutical, agricultural, and food industries."
"This study aims to compare the accuracy of Demirjian's and Cameriere's methods in determining adult age at the 18-year threshold using mandibular third molars in the Thai population. Panoramic radiograph images of 504 healthy subjects aged between 14 and 23 years were retrospectively collected. The developmental stages of mandibular third molars were evaluated using Demirjian's method, while the maturity index of mandibular third molars (I3M) was assessed using Cameriere's method. Comparing the development of the left and right mandibular third molars, slight differences were observed: the left side developed 0.06 stages faster (p = 0.01) and had an I3M 0.01 higher (p < 0.01). For the 18-year age threshold, Demirjian's Stage H demonstrated a specificity of 1.00 for both sexes on the left mandibular third molar, and 0.97 for males and 1.00 for females on the right. I3M < 0.08 yielded specificities of 0.84 for males and 0.93 for females on the left, and 0.82 for males and 0.91 for females on the right. Reducing the cut-off to I3M < 0.02 improved specificity to 1.00 for both sexes on the left side, and 0.96 for males and 1.00 for females on the right. Notably, using Demirjian's Stage H and I3M < 0.02, the probability of being over 18 years was 1.00 for females on both sides, and 0.96 for males on the left and 1.00 on the right. Our study recommends using an I3M cutoff of <0.02 for adult age assessment in the Thai population, as it achieves high specificity comparable to Demirjian's Stage H, with effective differentiation of adults."
"The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) coverage with evidence development (CED) program provides coverage for items and services not meeting Medicare's ""reasonable and necessary"" standard while requiring participation in clinical studies. As additional evidence is available, CMS may reconsider CED decisions. Of twenty-six items and services in the CED program since its 2005 inception, CMS has reconsidered coverage for ten (38 percent). Of 235 publications that CMS cited as evidence supporting reconsideration, 57 (24 percent) were CED-approved studies, and 116 (49 percent) were non-CED-approved studies. Compared with non-CED-approved studies, CED-approved studies had more robust designs (67 percent versus 13 percent randomized clinical trials), larger enrollment (median sample size of 1,000 versus 125), and more frequent inclusion of US patients (93 percent versus 44 percent). CMS's reliance on non-CED-approved studies for CED reconsiderations, despite CED-approved studies being higher quality and more representative of Medicare beneficiaries, highlights opportunities to strengthen the CED program."
"Spray drying is a well-established method for preparing amorphous solid dispersion (ASD) formulations to improve the oral bioavailability of poorly soluble drugs. In addition to the characterization of the amorphous phase, particle attributes of spray-dried intermediates (SDIs), including particle size, morphology, and microstructure, need to be carefully studied and controlled for optimizing drug product performance. Although recent developments in microscopy technology have enabled the analysis of morphological attributes for individual SDI particles, a high-throughput method is highly desirable. In this work, a fingerprinting method exploiting high-speed dynamic imaging, laser diffraction (LD), and a convolutional neural network (CNN) was developed to characterize and quantify size and morphological distributions of particles in batches of spray-dried ASDs. This imaging technology enables the generation of hundreds of thousands of single-particle images in a few minutes that are analyzed by both unsupervised and supervised CNN models. The unsupervised data mining analysis demonstrated that a batch of SDI is a mixture of diverse particle subpopulations with varying sizes and morphological attributes. Motivated by this observation, we developed a CNN model that enabled rapid computation of the volumetric composition of the distinct particle subpopulations in a SDI batch, thus generating a morphological fingerprint. We implemented this high-speed imaging-based particle attribute analysis method to investigate SDIs containing hypromellose acetate succinate as a model system. The CNN fingerprint results enabled quantification of the changes in the morphological distribution of SDI batches prepared with variations in the spray drying process parameters, and the results were in line with the LD and electron microscopy data. Our experiments and analysis demonstrate the robustness and throughput of this fingerprinting approach for quantifying particle size and morphological distributions of individual SDI batches, which can help guide spray drying process development and thereby enable the development of a drug product with more robust process and optimized performance."
"In 2020, Taiwan experienced a dramatic disruption of daily life due to measures aimed at limiting the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), although domestic COVID-19 cases were extremely rare. This provided a chance to investigate the change of incidence and possible triggers of Kawasaki disease (KD) without the interference of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children."
"Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death worldwide, and effectively repairing the heart following myocardial injuries remains a significant challenge. Research has increasingly shown that exosomes derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSC-Exo) can ameliorate myocardial injuries and improve outcomes after such injuries. The therapeutic benefits of MSC-Exo are largely due to their capacity to deliver specific cargo, including microRNAs and proteins. MSC-Exo can modulate various signaling pathways and provide several beneficial effects, including cytoprotection, inflammation modulation, and angiogenesis promotion to help repair the damaged myocardium. In this review, we summarize the cardioprotective effects of MSC-Exo in myocardial injury, the underlying molecular mechanism involved in the process, and various approaches studied to enhance their efficacy based on recent findings."
Mechanical circulatory support with a microaxial flow pump (MAFP) has been shown to improve survival in ST-elevation myocardial infarction-induced cardiogenic shock (STEMI-CS). Understanding the impact on hemodynamic stability over time is crucial for optimizing patient treatment.

Acanthamoeba species are eucaryotic protozoa found predominantly in soil and water. They cause ulceration and vision loss in the cornea (Acanthamoeba keratitis) and central nervous system (CNS) infection involving the lungs (granulomatous amoebic encephalitis). Antiparasitic drugs currently used in the treatment of infections caused by Acanthamoeba species are not effective at the desired level in some anatomical regions such as the eye and CNS. The existence of an agent effective against both cysts and trophozoites has not yet been proven. Drugs used for treatment of Acanthamoeba infrections are still limited.
"Leptospirosis is a zoonotic bacterial infection occurring worldwide. It is of particular public health concern due to its global distribution, epidemic potential and high mortality without appropriate treatment. The method for the management of leptospirosis, particularly in severe disease, is clouded by methodological inconsistency and a lack of standardized outcome measures. The study this protocol details aims to develop a core outcome set (COS) for leptospirosis research. A COS is a set of outcomes with international consensus as a minimum for reporting in future studies focusing on leptospirosis. Establishing a COS will contribute to harmonizing Leptospirosis treatment research and will be instrumental in constructing a high-quality evidence base to feed into a planned future rigorous international clinical trial on leptospirosis."

"Doxorubicin (DOX) is a widely used anticancer drug; However, its nephrotoxicity limits its therapeutic efficacy. This study investigates the protective effects of Perilla Alcohol (PA) against DOX-induced nephrotic syndrome (NS), focusing on its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties through the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) pathways."
"Tarhana, a traditional fermented food made from cereal flours, yogurt, vegetables, and spices, is recognized for its rich nutritional value and prolonged shelf life. This study investigated the effect of pea protein isolate (PPI) enrichment on select compositional, physical, techno-functional and nutritional properties of tarhana. Six different formulations were prepared by blending PPI and wheat flour (WF) in varying PPI: WF ratios from 0:100 (control) to 100:0. The protein content of the tarhana samples increased proportionally with the PPI concentration, reaching 76.6% in the PPI: WF of 100:0 PPI tarhana compared to 25.1% in the control tarhana. The total phenolic content (TPC) varied, ranging from 534.1 to 702.9 mg GAE/100 g dry basis (db), with higher values observed in PPI enriched tarhana samples. PPI enrichment significantly (p < 0.05) enhanced the antioxidant capacity, measured by ABTS, DPPH, and FRAP assays. PPI-enriched tarhana powders showed improved levels of key polyphenols, including gallic acid, quercetin and ferulic acid. Pasting profile of the tarhana samples showed a decrease in peak viscosity with increasing PPI, indicating the decrease in starch concentration. In-vitro protein digestibility of tarhana samples improved with PPI incorporation, showing values exceeding 84% for all PPI enriched formulations. The glycemic index (GI) of the tarhana samples decreased with increased PPI levels. Tarhana soups made from PPI: WF of 80:20 and 100:0 showed GI values 50.5 and 42.6, respectively, enabling them to be classified as low-GI foods. This research highlighted the potential of PPI to enhance the nutritional and functional properties of traditional tarhana."
"Differentiation of syncope from transient loss of consciousness can be challenging in the emergency department (ED). Natural Language Processing (NLP) enables the analysis of free text in the electronic medical records (EMR). The present paper aimed to develop a large language models (LLM) for syncope recognition in the ED and proposed a framework for model integration within the clinical workflow. Two models, based on both the Italian and Multilingual Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) language model, were developed using consecutive EMRs. The ""triage"" model was only based on notes contained in the ""triage"" section of the EMR. The ""anamnesis"" model added data contained in the ""medical history"" section. Interpretation and calibration plots were generated. The Italian and Multi BERT models were developed and tested on both 15,098 and 15,222 EMRs, respectively. The triage model had an AUC of 0·95 for the Italian BERT and 0·94 for the Multi BERT. The anamnesis model had an AUC of 0·98 for the Italian BERT and 0·97 for Multi BERT. The LLM identified syncope when not explicitly mentioned in the EMR and also recognized common prodromal symptoms preceding syncope. Both models identified syncope patients in the ED with a high discriminative capability from nurses and doctors' notes, thus potentially acting as a tool helping physicians to differentiate syncope from others transient loss of consciousness."
"Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is one of the main causes of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), but its mechanism has not been clearly studied. We utilized integrative transcriptome analysis to explore the pathogenesis of DN."
"Human cancer cell lines are the mainstay of cancer research. Recent reports showed that highly mutated adult carcinoma cell lines (mainly HeLa and MCF-7) present striking diversity across laboratories and that long-term continuous culturing results in genomic/transcriptomic heterogeneity with strong phenotypical implications. Here, we hypothesize that oligomutated pediatric sarcoma cell lines mainly driven by a fusion transcription factor, such as Ewing sarcoma (EwS), are genetically and phenotypically more stable than the previously investigated adult carcinoma cell lines. A comprehensive molecular and phenotypic characterization of multiple EwS cell line strains, together with a simultaneous analysis during 12 months of continuous cell culture show that fusion-driven pediatric sarcoma cell line strains are genomically more stable than adult carcinoma strains, display remarkably stable and homogenous transcriptomes, and exhibit uniform and stable drug response. Additionally, the analysis of multiple EwS cell lines subjected to long-term continuous culture reveals that variable degrees of genomic/transcriptomic/phenotypic changes among fusion-driven cell lines, further exemplifying that the potential for reproducibility of in vitro scientific results may be rather understood as a spectrum, even within the same tumor entity."
Does adjuvant growth hormone (GH) therapy in GnRH antagonist cycles improve reproductive outcomes in the general IVF population?
"Immune checkpoints are essential for regulating excessive autoimmune responses and maintaining immune homeostasis. However, in the tumor microenvironment, these checkpoints can lead to cytotoxic T cell exhaustion, allowing cancer cells to evade immune surveillance and promote tumor progression. The expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) in cancer cells is associated with poor prognoses, reduced survival rates, and lower responses to therapies. Consequently, downregulating PD-L1 expression has become a key strategy in developing immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs)."
"People with severe mental illnesses have complex needs that require coordinated care. However, students in different health professions are usually educated in silos without an emphasis on collaborative skills. Students would benefit from exposure to other disciplines that would increase appreciation of collaboration. This pilot study sought to understand how a mental health simulation (SIM) would influence a student's perception of collaboration. The mental health SIM involved nursing, social work, occupational therapy and public health students who worked with standardized patients. Students were given the Interprofessional Socialization and Valuing Scale-21 (ISVS-21) that measures attitudes, values, and feelings about interprofessional collaboration. A baseline of 113 students in the four health professions were administered the pretest and a subset of nine who participated in the SIM completed the posttest. This study suggests that SIM may be a promising way of improving attitudes toward collaborative care, though it is important for the SIM to reflect real life treatment conditions."
"The risk of severe outcomes of influenza increases during pregnancy. Whether vaccine-induced T cell memory-primed prepregnancy retains the ability to mediate protection during pregnancy, when systemic levels of several hormones with putative immunomodulatory functions are increased, is unknown. Here, using murine adoptive transfer systems and a translationally relevant model of cold-adapted live-attenuated influenza A virus vaccination, we show that preexisting virus-specific memory T cell responses are largely unaltered and highly protective against heterotypic viral challenges during pregnancy. Expression of the transcription factor T-bet, which is upregulated in antiviral T cells responding in pregnant mice, is critical in preventing hormone-associated gain of detrimental T helper type 2 (TH2) attributes reported in other settings. Beyond antiviral effects, preexisting vaccine-primed T cell immunity prevents metabolic dysfunction in gravid dams and adverse neonatal outcomes often associated with maternal influenza infection. These results demonstrate robust protection of the maternal-fetal unit from severe consequences of respiratory virus infection by preexisting T cell immunity."
"The gut microbiome affects the occurrence and development of metabolic diseases, with a significant amount of research focused on intestinal bacteria. As an important part of the gut microbiome, gut viruses were studied recently, particularly through fecal virome transplantation (FVT), revealing manipulating the gut virus could reverse overweight and glucose intolerance in mice. And human cohort studies found gut virome changed significantly in patients with metabolic disease. By summarizing those studies, we compared the research and analytical methods, as well as the similarities and differences in their results, and analyzed the reasons for these discrepancies. FVT provided potential value to improve metabolic diseases, but the mechanisms involved and the effect of FVT on humans should be investigated further. The potential methods of regulating intestinal virome composition and the possible mechanisms of intestinal virome changes affecting metabolic diseases were also discussed."
"Opioid analgesics can alleviate ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in chronic heart failure. However, the underlying mechanisms and targets remain unknown. Here, we investigate if caveolin-3 (Cav3) interacts with μ opioid receptors and if Cav3-μ receptor interactions play a role in morphine-induced cardioprotection in failing hearts."
"Organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) is a non-compulsory but beneficial behavior for effective organizational operation. OCB can be largely determined by the type of leadership style, among which responsible leadership has been attracting considerable attention in the organizational context nowadays. The objective of this study was to examine the parallel mediating effect of gratitude and organizational identification between responsible leadership and OCB among the academic staff in China."
"Pain management is a crucial component of patient care that promotes relaxation, lowers complications, improves quality of life, and shortens hospital stays. Several studies assessed the nurses' pain management practices in Ethiopia. However, the findings of these studies are highly variable and inconsistent. Therefore, the study aims to determine the overall prevalence of pain management practice and associated factors among nurses working in Ethiopia."
The association between specific types of malignancies and the subsequent risk of dementia remains unknown.
"The effectiveness of exercise for obesity is contentious due to individual response variability. Owing to the roles of dopamine in motor functions, metabolism, and appetite, this study aimed to identify striatal dopamine as a predictor of variability in exercise response, specifically in terms of fat loss and muscle gain. Healthy non-exercising males completed an 8-week program, exercising 1 h, 4 days a week. Striatal dopaminergic tone was assessed by measuring dopamine transporter availability using technetium-99 m labelled tropane derivative, [99mTc]TRODAT-1 (TRODAT), single-photon emission computed tomography, and body composition (fat and muscles mass) was analysed using bioelectrical impedance. Lower baseline dopamine levels were associated with greater fat mass loss (r = 0.58, p = 0.006), percentage fat mass loss (r = 0.53, p = 0.013), and increase in muscle mass (β = -0.53, p = 0.035, after taking age and smoking status as covariates). These findings enhance our understanding of obesity neurobiology and exercise response variability, necessitating further research for targeted interventions based on dopaminergic profiles."
"Interleukin-18 (IL-18) serves a dual function in the immune system, acting as a ""double-edged sword"" cytokine. Depending on the microenvironment and timing, IL-18 can either drive harmful inflammation or restore immune homeostasis. Pathologies characterized by elevated IL-18, recently proposed to be termed IL-18opathies, highlight the therapeutic potential for IL-18 blockade. IL-18 Binding Protein (IL-18BP) is one of only four natural cytokine antagonists encoded by a separate gene, distinguishing it from canonical soluble receptors. IL-18BP's exceptionally high affinity and slow dissociation rate make it an effective regulator of IL-18, essential for maintaining immune balance and influencing disease outcomes, and positions IL-18BP as a promising alternative to more aggressive treatments that carry risks of severe infections and other complications. Tadekinig alfa, the drug form of IL-18BP, represents a targeted therapy that modulates the IL-18/IL-18BP axis, offering a safe adverse-effect-free option. With orphan drug designation, Phase III clinical trial completion, and seven years of compassionate use, Tadekinig alfa holds promise in treating autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, cancer, and genetically linked disorders. Levels of IL-18, free IL-18 and IL-18BP, may serve as biomarkers for disease severity and therapeutic response. Given its pivotal role in immune balance, the IL-18/IL-18BP dyad has attracted interest from over ten pharmaceutical companies and startups, which are currently developing innovative strategies to either inhibit or enhance IL-18 activity depending on the therapeutic need. The review focuses on the features of the dyad members and screens the therapeutic approaches."
"Loud footsteps from upstairs cause disturbance to downstairs neighbours in multi-story residential buildings. In this experiment, we examined how participants walk when asked to walk quietly and evaluated the efficiency of their quiet walking patterns. Changes in vertical impact loading rates during the early stance phase, walking speed, and lower limb muscle activity when asked to walk quietly were evaluated from twenty-six young participants. Study data show that participants who struck the ground with the rearfoot reduced the impact loading rate by 44.6% with 29.3% slower walking speed than normal walking. Those who struck with the fore- or mid-foot reduced the impact loading by 69.2% with a 23.4% decrease in speed. Quiet walking with the non-rearfoot strike pattern reduced the impact loading by 48.7%, even when asked to walk as fast as normal walking. The results support the non-rearfoot strike pattern as an efficient walking strategy for lowering footstep impact."
"Reduced social attention-looking at faces-is one of the most common manifestations of social difficulty in autism that is central to social development. Although reduced social attention is well characterized in autism, qualitative differences in how social attention unfolds across time remains unknown."
"Mainland Japanese have been recognized as having dual ancestry, originating from indigenous Jomon people and immigrants from continental East Eurasia. Although migration from the continent to the Japanese Archipelago continued from the Yayoi to the Kofun period, our understanding of these immigrants, particularly their origins, remains insufficient due to the lack of high-quality genome samples from the Yayoi period, complicating predictions about the admixture process. To address this, we sequenced the whole nuclear genome of a Yayoi individual from the Doigahama site in Yamaguchi prefecture, Japan. A comprehensive population genetic analysis of the Doigahama Yayoi individual, along with ancient and modern populations in East Asia and Northeastern Eurasia, revealed that the Doigahama Yayoi individual, similar to Kofun individuals and modern Mainland Japanese, had three distinct genetic ancestries: Jomon-related, East Asian-related, and Northeastern Siberian-related. Among non-Japanese populations, the Korean population, possessing both East Asian-related and Northeastern Siberian-related ancestries, exhibited the highest degree of genetic similarity to the Doigahama Yayoi individual. The analysis of admixture modeling for Yayoi individuals, Kofun individuals, and modern Japanese respectively supported a two-way admixture model assuming Jomon-related and Korean-related ancestries. These results suggest that between the Yayoi and Kofun periods, the majority of immigrants to the Japanese Archipelago originated primarily from the Korean Peninsula."
"Communication between the foregut and the hindgut is amply illustrated by the gastro-colonic reflex and the impact of constipation on gastric function. Less well studied are the effects of the small intestinal or colonic microbiome and its metabolites on motor and secretory activities in the esophagus and stomach. In the study, the authors posit that small intestinal bacterial overgrowth promotes gastroesophageal and laryngo-pharyngeal reflux and in support of this hypothesis report an amelioration of related symptoms with antibiotic and dietary therapies. This editorial explores this hypothesis and also proposes an alternative one: changes in gastric and esophageal function consequent upon increased bacterial fermentation, not in the small intestine, but in the colon."
"Anti-seizure medications and deep brain stimulation are widely used therapies to treat seizures; however, both face limitations such as resistance and the unpredictable nature of seizures. Recent advancements, including responsive neural stimulation and on-demand drug release, have been developed to address these challenges. However, a gap remains, as electrical stimulation provides only transient effects while medication has a delayed onset. To bridge this gap, we developed a Bimodal Closed-loop Neurostimulation Implant System that integrates real-time neural recording, immediate electrical stimulation, and on-demand drug release to achieve more effective seizure suppression. This dual-modality system combines rapid electrical intervention with sustained pharmacological treatment to provide comprehensive seizure control. An embedded platform powered by a Long Short-Term Memory network detects seizures and autonomously triggers these interventions. In vivo studies in an epileptic mouse model revealed that electrical stimulation achieved rapid seizure suppression, terminating 75.16% of seizures, with 90% of episodes suppressed within 10 s. The subcutaneous drug capsule provided additional control, with an onset of action approximately 15 min after release. The dual-modality approach bridged the gap between immediate and delayed intervention, stabilizing neural activity and reducing seizure recurrence. Furthermore, we confirmed the long-term viability of neurons, observing no significant changes in morphology or signal quality following stimulation and drug release. These results suggest that the system offers rapid, stable, and minimally invasive seizure control, making it a promising therapeutic tool for epilepsy. By bridging the gap between electrical effects and delayed pharmacological action, the system presents a novel approach to epilepsy management."
"Advancements in forensic DNA typing technology and methods have increased sensitivity and, while beneficial, carry the weight of more challenging profile interpretation. In response, the forensic DNA community has often requested more complex reference materials to address commonly encountered measurement and interpretation issues such as complex DNA mixtures, DNA degradation, and PCR inhibition. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) released Research Grade Test Material 10235: Forensic DNA Typing Resource Samples to support the forensic DNA community. Components include three single source samples, two degraded samples, and three mixture samples. As part of the Research Grade Test Material (RGTM) process, automated methods for bottling, alternative sample tube types, and the addition of carrier RNA for stabilizing low-quantity samples were investigated. Both internal and external testing demonstrate the stability of the material over time at 4°C through qPCR testing. In the development of a data portal, users have been allowed to anonymously upload results and compare their data with NIST and others. This report describes the preparation and stability of this material."
"Early-life exposure to famine has been hypothesized to influence long-term bone health, potentially increasing the risk of osteoporosis and fractures in later life. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the association between early-life famine exposure and the risk of osteoporosis, bone mineral density (BMD) loss, and fractures."
"The challenges faced by caregivers of people living with serious mental illness in Canada are well documented in the literature including emotional distress, financial strain, social isolation, and concerns about their physical health following the impact of caregiving. Peer support programs (including peer support groups) emerged as a promising method to attempt to address these challenges. While there is evidence on the positive impacts of peer support groups in providing support for caregivers, the mechanisms by which peer support groups operate and influence support for caregivers of people living with serious mental illness are less understood. This qualitative study took on a co-designed participatory research approach. Fifteen adult caregivers of people living with serious mental illness across Canada were engaged through key informant interviews that lasted for 45 - 60 min each. A thematic analysis was carried out to help understand the operational mechanisms of peer support groups in influencing support for caregivers. The key informant interviews allowed for the identification and description of the following operational mechanisms that influenced the support caregivers received from peer support groups: (1) Group dynamics; (2) Messaging/content; (3) Equity and inclusion, (4) Group philosophy; and (5) Privacy concerns. Findings from this study showed that caregivers identified a number of operational mechanisms of peer support groups that explained how they felt supported when they participated in peer support groups. Among other operational mechanisms, group dynamics in terms of the gathering of caregivers of different age brackets and varying caregiving experience negatively influenced the peer support experience of caregivers. This pointed to the need for group dynamics that consider close age ranges and similar caregiving experience during group meetings to enhance support for caregivers. Caregivers also identified a gap in equity and inclusion in peer support groups that could have otherwise enriched their experience and enhanced the support they looked to receive from the group. Practical examples to enhance equity and inclusion include promoting active listening, using inclusive language, encouraging diverse representation and asking for feedback from peer support group members. While peer support groups in Canada exist independently of one another, it may help to consolidate evidence-based recommendations in the operational mechanisms of these groups, for the benefit of caregivers who turn to these groups for support, having been left on their own by an otherwise fractured mental health system."
"The integration of advanced technologies such as augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) into surgical procedures has garnered significant attention. However, the introduction of these innovations requires thorough evaluation in the context of human-machine interaction. Despite their potential benefits, new technologies can complicate surgical tasks and increase the cognitive load on surgeons, potentially offsetting their intended advantages. It is crucial to evaluate these technologies not only for their functional improvements but also for their impact on the surgeon's workload in clinical settings. A surgical team today must increasingly navigate advanced technologies such as AR and VR, aiming to reduce surgical trauma and enhance patient safety. However, each innovation needs to be evaluated in terms of human-machine interaction. Even if an innovation appears to bring advancements to the field it is applied in, it may complicate the work and increase the surgeon's workload rather than benefiting the surgeon."
"Schwannomas are tumors that originate from the glial cells of the nervous system and can occur on myelinated nerve fibers throughout the body, especially in the craniofacial region. However, pancreatic schwannomas are extremely rare. We report a case of a pancreatic schwannoma that was difficult to differentiate from other pancreatic tumors preoperatively. A 44-year-old female patient was found to have a pancreatic mass on Computed Tomography imaging and the preoperative diagnosis was a pancreatic solid pseudopapillary neoplasm. Meanwhile, the patient had type 2 diabetes and the blood glucose was controlled at 8-15mmol/L by taking oral antidiabetic drugs. During exploratory laparotomy, an 8 cm × 7 cm × 4 cm mass was discovered in the middle part of the pancreas. Considering the preoperative diabetes, the patient underwent a central pancreatectomy (CP) and Roux-en-Y pancreaticojejunostomy. Postoperative histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of a pancreatic epitheloid schwannoma. After surgery, the patient developed Grade B pancreatic fistula, which disappeared after treatment. At the same time, the patient's blood glucose remained basically stable by insulin therapy, which was adjusted to oral antidiabetic medications in about 40 days after surgery. At a 32-month follow-up after discharge, no tumor recurrence was observed, and the patient's blood glucose was controlled below 11.1mmol/L with only oral antidiabetic drugs. The radiological diagnosis of pancreatic schwannomas lacks specific features, and diagnosis primarily relies on histopathological examination and immunohistochemical testing. Although pancreatic schwannomas are extremely rare, they must be differentiated from other solid or cystic pancreatic lesions. For patients with pancreatic schwannoma and diabetes, CP may represent a favorable surgical option."
"KEGG (https://www.kegg.jp/) is a database resource for representation and analysis of biological systems. Pathway maps are the primary dataset in KEGG representing systemic functions of the cell and the organism in terms of molecular interaction and reaction networks. The KEGG Orthology (KO) system is a mechanism for linking genes and proteins to pathway maps and other molecular networks. Each KO is a generic gene identifier and each pathway map is created as a network of KO nodes. This architecture enables KEGG pathway mapping to uncover systemic features from KO assigned genomes and metagenomes. Additional roles of KOs include characterization of conserved genes and conserved units of genes in organism groups, which can be done by taxonomy mapping. A new tool has been developed for identifying conserved gene orders in chromosomes, in which gene orders are treated as sequences of KOs. Furthermore, a new dataset called VOG (virus ortholog group) is computationally generated from virus proteins and expanded to proteins of cellular organisms, allowing gene orders to be compared as VOG sequences as well. Together with these datasets and analysis tools, new types of pathway maps are being developed to present a global view of biological processes involving multiple organism groups."
"Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a chronic condition characterized by disproportional pain typically affecting an extremity. Management of CRPS is centered around specific symptomatology, which tends to be a combination of autonomic dysfunction, nociceptive sensitization, chronic inflammation, and/or motor dysfunction. Targeting the autoimmune component of CRPS provides a way to both symptomatically treat as well as minimize progression of CRPS."

"Current agricultural practices face numerous challenges, including declining soil fertility and heavy reliance on chemical inputs. Rhizosphere microbial metabolites have emerged as promising agents for enhancing crop health and yield in a sustainable manner. These metabolites, including phytohormones, antibiotics, and volatile organic compounds, play critical roles in promoting plant growth, boosting resistance to pathogens, and improving resilience to environmental stresses. This review comprehensively outlines the mechanisms through which rhizosphere microbial metabolites influence crop health, traits, functional components, and yield. It also discusses the potential applications of microbial secondary metabolites in biofertilizers and highlights the challenges associated with their production and practical use. Measures to overcome these challenges are proposed, alongside an exploration of the future development of the functional fertilizer industry. The findings presented here provide a scientific basis for utilizing rhizosphere microbial metabolites to enhance agricultural sustainability, offering new strategies for future crop management. Integrating these microbial strategies could lead to increased crop productivity, improved quality, and reduced dependence on synthetic chemical inputs, thereby supporting a more environmentally friendly and resilient agricultural system."
"The current study aimed to investigate the trophocidal and cysticidal activities of cinnamaldehyde (Cinn), a natural compound with known antimicrobial properties, against environmental and reference strains of Acanthamoeba castellanii.

"Posterior uveitis is a leading cause of vision impairment and blindness globally due to its detrimental effects on the choroid and retina. The condition is worsened by oxidative stress, which heightens inflammation and perpetuates a cycle of damage that current treatments only temporarily relieve. To address this, a novel treatment involving the in situ crystallization of ultrasmall cerium oxide nanoparticles (≈3 nm) on mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) extracellular vesicles (EVs) for the management of primed mycobacterial uveitis (PMU) is developed. This nanohybrid leverages the individual and synergistic effects of its components for a comprehensive therapeutic approach. The cerium oxide nanoparticles act as a nanozyme to reduce inflammation and scavenge excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS), while the MSC EVs, with their biocompatibility, modulate inflammatory cell infiltration and alleviate tissue damage. This synergistic system offers a promising new treatment strategy for ocular diseases characterized by oxidative stress and inflammation."

"Bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) plays an important role in gene transcription in a variety of diseases, including inflammation and cancer. However, the mechanism by which the BRD4 inhibitors bind selectively to its bromodomain 1 (BRD4-BD1) and bromodomain 2 (BRD4-BD2) remains unclear. Studying the interaction mechanism between bromodomain of BRD4 and inhibitors will provide new ideas for drug development and disease treatment. To explore the molecular mechanism of selective binding of three novel phenoxypyridone Cpd11, Cpd14, and Cpd23 to BRD4-BD1 and BRD4-BD2, respectively, molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, and free energy calculation containing molecular mechanics generalized born surface area (MM-GBSA) and solvation interaction energy (SIE) were achieved. The results show that these three inhibitors have different effects on the internal dynamics of BRD4-BD1 and BRD4-BD2, but the key interactions are similar. Key residues of BRD4-BD1 and BRD4-BD2, Ile146/Val439, Trp81/Trp374, Phe83/Phe375, Val87/Val380, Leu92/Leu385, Leu94/Leu387, Tyr97/Tyr390, and Asn140/Asn433, play a key role in selective binding of BRD4-BD1 and BRD4-BD2 to these three inhibitors. At the same time, non-polar interactions, especially van der Waals interactions, are the main drivers of the interactions of these three inhibitors with BRD4-BD1 and BRD4-BD2. These results provide useful dynamic and energy information for the development of novel highly selective phenoxypyridone inhibitors targeting BRD4-BD2."

Providing ongoing support to the increasing number of caregivers as their needs change in the long-term course of dementia is a severe challenge to any health care system. Conversational artificial intelligence (AI) operating 24/7 may help to tackle this problem.
"Microtubule nucleation is important for microtubule organization in dendrites and for neuronal injury responses. The core nucleation protein, γTubulin (γTub), is localized to dendrite branch points in Drosophila sensory neurons by Wnt receptors and scaffolding proteins on endosomes. However, whether Wnt ligands are important is unknown. We found that Wnt secretion from epithelial cells was required for γTub localization to dendrite branch points. Using RNAi and mutant approaches, we demonstrated that Wnt4 and wntD both position γTub. Moreover, injury-induced increases in neuronal microtubule dynamics required Wnt secretion from epithelial cells. Overexpression of Wnts in epithelial cells increased microtubule dynamics to the same extent as axon injury indicating surrounding cells have an instructive role in neuronal nucleation. To determine how Wnt ligands concentrate microtubule nucleation at dendrite branch points, we tested whether endocytosis is restricted to specific regions of dendrites. Markers of clathrin-mediated endocytosis localized to puncta at branch points. Behavior of these puncta was sensitive to inhibition of endocytosis suggesting they represented endocytic sites. In addition to previously described colocalization of Wnt receptors and scaffolds with Rab5 endosomes, we identified a separate set of Wnt signaling puncta that colocalized with clathrin in dendrites. Moreover, γTub and Wnt scaffolding protein recruitment to branch points was reduced by clathrin RNAi, and injury-induced up-regulation of microtubule dynamics was sensitive to clathrin reduction. We propose that the localization of Wnt endocytic sites to dendrite branch points results in the local generation of microtubule nucleating endosomes."
"Lower diversity of the gut microbiome prior to allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) correlates with reduced survival after the intervention. Most patients undergoing HCT for a haematological malignancy have previously received intensive chemotherapy, resulting in prolonged neutropenic episodes requiring broad-spectrum antibiotics; use of these has been linked to reduced microbiome diversity. Intestinal microbiota transplant (IMT) is a novel treatment approach that restores this diversity. We hypothesised that IMT performed prior to initiation of HCT conditioning restores microbiome diversity during the early stages of HCT, leading to decreased frequency of complications and improved outcomes of HCT."
"Monoclonal antibodies recognizing nonprotein antigens remain largely underrepresented in our understanding of the molecular repertoire of innate and adaptive immunity. One such antibody is Mannitou, a murine IgM that recognizes paucimannosidic glycans. In this work, we report the production and purification of the recombinant antigen-binding fragment (Fab) of Mannitou IgM (Mannitou Fab) and employ a combination of biochemical and biophysical approaches to obtain its initial structural characterization. To this end, recombinant Mannitou Fab comprising the light chain (VL-CL) and heavy chain (VH-Cμ1) was produced in HEK293 FreeStyle cells and purified by cobalt-affinity chromatography followed by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), which revealed two distinct oligomeric states consistent with a predominant monomeric form and a minor dimeric form. We employed SEC inline with multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) and SEC coupled to small-angle X-ray scattering (SEC-SAXS) to establish that Mannitou Fab indeed adopts monomeric and dimeric forms in solution. Interestingly, Mannitou Fab is N-glycosylated at Asn164 of the heavy chain via HexNAc(5)Hex(6)Fuc(1-3) as revealed by mass spectrometry. We leveraged this information in conjunction with predicted structures of Mannitou Fab to facilitate the interpretation and modelling of SAXS data, leading to a plausible model for glycosylated Mannitou Fab. Analysis of the two chromatographically isolatable forms of Mannitou Fab using synchrotron-radiation circular dichroism revealed that the heat-denaturated Mannitou Fab monomer shares similar secondary-structural elements with the Mannitou Fab dimer, indicating that the latter may be misfolded. Collectively, the findings of this study will set the stage for future structural studies of Mannitou Fab and contribute to our understanding of possible side products due to misfolding during the production of recombinant Fabs, highlighting the importance of glycosylation in obtaining stable and monodisperse monomeric forms of recombinant Fabs."
"Epigenetic regulation in the rumen, a unique ruminant organ, remains largely unexplored compared with other tissues studied in model species. In this study, we perform an in-depth analysis of the epigenetic and transcriptional landscapes across fetal and adult bovine tissues as well as pluripotent stem cells. Among the extensive methylation differences across various stages and tissues, we identify tissue-specific differentially methylated regions (tsDMRs) unique to the rumen, which are crucial for regulating epithelial development and energy metabolism. These tsDMRs cluster within super-enhancer regions that overlap with transcription factor (TF) binding sites. Regression models indicate that DNA methylation, along with H3K27me3 and H3K27ac, can be used to predict enhancer activity. Key upstream TFs, including SOX2, FOSL1/2, and SMAD2/3, primarily maintain an inhibitory state through bivalent modifications during fetal development. Downstream functional genes are maintained mainly in a stable repressive state via DNA methylation until differentiation is complete. Our study underscores the critical role of tsDMRs in regulating distal components of rumen morphology and function, providing key insights into the epigenetic regulatory mechanisms that may influence bovine production traits."

"Gene therapy, which involves the delivery of genetic material into cells to correct an underlying genetic problem, has emerged as a promising approach for treating various conditions. To promote research in this rapidly evolving field, we developed the Gene Therapy Omnibus (GTO) (http://www.inbirg.com/gto/), a comprehensive resource containing detailed clinical trial data and molecular information related to gene therapy. The GTO includes 6333 clinical trial records and 3466 transcriptome profiles, with information on 614 altered genes and 22 types of gene therapy, including DNA therapies, RNA therapies and genetically-modified cell therapies. For each gene therapy product in a clinical trial, detailed information, such as altered gene name, structural components, indication, vector information, phase of the clinical trial, clinical outcomes and adverse effects, is provided when available. Additionally, 345 comparison datasets, including 29 single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets comprising information on both gene therapy and control samples, were established. Differential gene expression and downstream functional enrichment analyses were performed through standardized pipelines to elucidate the molecular alterations induced by gene therapy. The user-friendly interface of the GTO supports efficient data retrieval, visualization and analysis, making it an invaluable resource for researchers and clinicians performing clinical research on gene therapy and the underlying mechanisms."
"To summarize the recent literature regarding the interaction between the public health concerns of obesity and depression and provide preliminary recommendations for assessment and management of patients with co-occurring obesity and depression. RECENT FINDINGS : Recent studies have reinforced that while there is a bi-directional link between obesity and depression, there is stronger evidence that obesity contributes to the development of depression. Recent research has also elucidated potential mediating factors in the association between depression and obesity (e.g., demographical, biological, and psychological) as well as a moderating effect of treatment of depression on outcomes for treatment of obesity. There is evidence to suggest that in co-occurring depression and obesity, it is beneficial to treat depression first. Cognitive behavioral therapies have demonstrated effectiveness in treating co-occurring depression and obesity and there is preliminary evidence suggesting that increasing emotion regulation and reducing weight bias internalization may be important treatment targets."
"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a growing health concern, projected to be a major cause of death by 2040, due to an increasing risk of acute kidney injury (AKI). Systems biology-derived data suggest that the unmet need for an orally available drug to treat AKI and improve CKD outcomes may be addressed by targeting kidney inflammation and, specifically, nuclear factor κB-inducing kinase (NIK), a key signaling molecule that activates the noncanonical nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathway. We have prepared and identified a small family of imidazolone derivatives that bind NIK and inhibit the noncanonical NF-κB activation pathway. The introduction of heterocyclic substituents in position 2 of the imidazolone core provides compounds with affinity against human NIK. Three candidates, with best affinity profile, were tested in phenotypic experiments of noncanonical NF-κB activation, confirming that the derivative bearing the 4-pyridyl ring can inhibit the processing of NFκB p100 to NFkB2 p52, which is NIK-dependent in cultured kidney tubular cells. Finally, exhaustive docking calculations combined with molecular dynamics studies led us to propose a theoretical binding mode and rationalize affinity measures, in which the aminopyridine motif is a key anchoring point to the hinge region thanks to several hydrogen bonds and the interaction of heterocyclic rings in position 2 with Ser476 and Lys482. Our result will pave the way for the development of potential drug candidates targeting NIK in the context of CKD."
"The aim of this study was to assess roughness profile and surface roughness after simulated toothbrushing cycles, as well as the degree of conversion (DC) of bulk-fill resin composites at different depths. Forty nine composite discs were made from three low-viscosity bulk-fill resins (Filtek Bulk-Fill Flowable/3M Oral Care - FBF, Beautifil-Bulk Flowable/Shofu Inc. - BBF and Surefill SDR Flow/Dentsply Caulk - SDR), three high-viscosity bulk-fill resin composites (Filtek Bulk-Fill Restorative/3M Oral Care - FBR, Beautifil-Bulk Restorative/Shofu Inc. - BBR and Tetric EvoCeram Bulk Fill/Ivoclar Vivadent - TEB) and one conventional composite (Filtek Supreme Ultra/3M Oral Care - FSU) (n=7), using addition silicon molds (2 mm thick x 10 mm diameter). The roughness profile (Rv) and surface roughness (Sa) were analyzed after 30,000 brushing cycles using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Five samples (4 mm thick x 2 mm diameter) were produced per resin composite and light-cured for 20 seconds using a LED-curing unit. After 24 hours at 37oC, DC of samples was evaluated at four depths, using a confocal Raman microscope. The data were analyzed by ANOVA and Tukey post hoc multiple-comparison tests (α = 0.05). The Rv values of FSU were lower than those obtained for BBR and BBF. The toothbrushing significantly decreased the Sa for all composites. The DC was significantly reduced at 4 mm depth. Toothbrushing changed composite surface of all materials, especially for BBR and BBF. Composites were not able to maintain the DC values shown at the top compared with those at the bottom (4 mm depth)."
"Neuroimmunology is reshaping the understanding of the central nervous system (CNS), revealing it as an active immune organ rather than an isolated structure. This review delves into the unprecedented discoveries transforming the field, including the emerging roles of microglia, astrocytes, and the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in orchestrating neuroimmune dynamics. Highlighting their dual roles in both repair and disease progression, we uncover how these elements contribute to the intricate pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases, cerebrovascular conditions, and CNS tumors. Novel insights into microglial priming, astrocytic cytokine networks, and meningeal lymphatics challenge the conventional paradigms of immune privilege, offering fresh perspectives on disease mechanisms. This work introduces groundbreaking therapeutic innovations, from precision immunotherapies to the controlled modulation of the BBB using nanotechnology and focused ultrasound. Moreover, we explore the fusion of immune modulation with neuromodulatory technologies, underscoring new frontiers for personalized medicine in previously intractable diseases. By synthesizing these advancements, we propose a transformative framework that integrates cutting-edge research with clinical translation, charting a bold path toward redefining CNS disease management in the era of precision neuroimmunology."

"The male reproductive impairment caused by environmental estrogens (EEs) stands as a pivotal research area in environmental toxicology. Alpha2-macroglobulin (A2M) emerges as a promising molecule capable of counteracting oxidative stress induced by EEs. This study conducted exposure experiments spanning PND1 to PND56 employing ICR mice, aiming to delve into the expression patterns of A2M and its modulated IL-6 in the testicular tissue of mice subsequent to diethylstilbestrol (DES) and benzophenone (BP) exposure, while elucidating the pivotal role of ERs in this intricate process. Our findings revealed that upon DES exposure (10 and 100 nM), there was a pronounced upregulation of A2M (mRNA and in situ protein levels) in mouse testicular tissue. Similarly, exposure to BPs (BP-1, BP-2, and BP-3, each at 10 and 1000 nM) exhibited comparable effects and increasing A2M levels in serum. Notably, BP exposure also caused an elevation in IL-6 levels (which could be directly regulated by A2M) within testicular tissue (mRNA and in situ protein). Remarkably, the specific estrogen receptor antagonist ICI 182780 (0.5 mg/kg/day) was effective in reversing the upregulation of both A2M and IL-6 induced by BP exposure. Significantly, the results of theoretical prediction of the potential ERE site in the A2m gene promoter region and ChIP-qPCR experiment provide essential and strong evidence for the key conclusion that A2m is the target gene of ER. Taken together, our study highlights EEs' ability to regulate A2M expression in the male reproductive system via the ER signaling pathway. This vital insight deepens our understanding of molecular mechanisms protecting against oxidative stress caused by EEs."

"Intentional binding (IB) refers to the compression of subjective timing between a voluntary action and its outcome. In this study, we investigate the IB of a multimodal (audiovisual) outcome. We used a modified Libet clock while depicting a dynamic physical event (collision). Experiment 1 examined whether IB for the unimodal (auditory) event could be generalized to the multimodal (audiovisual) event, compared their magnitudes, and assessed whether the level of integration between modalities could affect IB. Planned contrasts (n = 42) showed significant IB effects for all types of events; the magnitude of IB was significantly weaker in both audiovisual integrated and audiovisual irrelevant conditions compared with auditory, with no difference between the integrated and irrelevant conditions. Experiment 2 separated the components of the audiovisual event to test the appropriate model describing the magnitude of IB in multimodal contexts. Planned contrasts (n = 42) showed the magnitude of IB was significantly weaker in both the audiovisual and visual conditions compared with the auditory condition, with no difference between the audiovisual and visual conditions. Additional Bayesian analysis provided moderate evidence supporting the equivalence between the two conditions. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that the IB phenomenon can be generalized to multimodal (audiovisual) sensory outcomes, and visual information shows dominance in determining the magnitude of IB for audiovisual events."

"Mozambique addressed critical malaria surveillance system challenges by rolling out an integrated malaria information storage system (iMISS) at the district level in February 2021. The iMISS integrates malaria data from existing systems across thematic program areas to improve data availability and use. In seven districts, the platform was extended to health facilities (HFs), allowing HFs to access iMISS and use tablets to submit monthly malaria reports to a central database, eliminating the need for paper-based reporting to districts. A structured evaluation of the iMISS rollout to HFs was carried out in February-July 2021. The four evaluation areas were data quality (reporting rate, timeliness, and fidelity) of monthly malaria reports electronically submitted to the iMISS, adoption of the iMISS for data-informed decision-making, system maintenance, and acceptability of the iMISS among target users. All 94 HFs in the seven targeted districts were assessed. Over the 6-month period, 86.1% of reported cases on the iMISS were consistent with cases recorded in paper-based reports, allowing for up to 10% discrepancy. In addition, 69.0% of expected monthly district meetings were held, and information from iMISS was discussed during 58.6% of these meetings. Maintenance issues, mostly related to tablet access and internet connectivity, were experienced by 74.5% of HFs; 33.7% of issues were resolved within 1 month. The iMISS and electronic submission of malaria reports were well accepted by HF- and district-level users. Continued political commitment and timely execution of issue management workflows are crucial to ensure trust in the new platform and facilitate higher levels of data use."
"Streamflow records are biased toward large streams and rivers, yet small headwater streams are often the focus of ecological research in response to climate change. Conventional flow measurement instruments such as acoustic Doppler velocimeters (ADVs) do not perform well during low-flow conditions in small streams, truncating the development of rating curves during critical baseflow conditions dominated by groundwater inflow. We revisited an instantaneous solute tracer injection method as an alternative to ADVs based on paired measurements to compare their precision, efficiency, and feasibility within headwater streams across a range of flow conditions. We show that the precision of discharge measurements using salt dilution by slug injection and ADV methods were comparable overall, but salt dilution was more precise during the lowest flows and required less time to implement. Often, headwater streams were at or below the depth threshold where ADV measurements could even be attempted and transects were complicated by coarse bed material and cobbles. We discuss the methodological benefits and limitations of salt dilution by slug injection and conclude that the method could facilitate a proliferation of streamflow observation across headwater stream networks that are highly undersampled compared to larger streams."

"Gene therapy has evolved into a pivotal approach for treating genetic disorders, extending beyond traditional methods of directly repairing or replacing defective genes. Recent advancements in nucleic acid-based therapies-including mRNA, miRNA, siRNA, and DNA treatments have expanded the scope of gene therapy to include strategies that modulate protein expression and deliver functional genetic material without altering the genetic sequence itself. This review focuses on the innovative use of plant-derived nanovesicles (PDNVs) as a promising delivery system for these nucleic acids. PDNVs not only enhance the stability and bioavailability of therapeutic nucleic acids but also improve their specificity and efficacy in targeted gene therapy applications. They have shown potential in the treatment of various diseases, including cancer and inflammatory conditions. By examining the unique properties of PDNVs and their role in overcoming the limitations of conventional delivery methods, this review highlights the transformative potential of PDNV-based nucleic acid therapies in advancing the field of gene therapy."

In these patients, treatment and recovery options are very limited."
"An increased risk of developing respiratory diseases has been linked to exposure to cigarette smoking (CS). The flower buds of Tussilago farfara L., also known as Farfarae Flos (FF), can be used for the treatment of cough, bronchitis, and asthmatic disorders in China. In the present study, we used lung and fecal metabolomics, as well as the intestinal flora analysis, aimed to investigate the protective effect of FF against the CS exposure induced lung inflammation on mice. The results showed that FF administration could relieve the lung inflammation as demonstrated by lung index, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) levels, as well as the pulmonary pathological change. The lung metabolomics coupled with molecular docking showed that FF could alleviate lung inflammation by regulating lysophosphatidylcholine biosynthesis through the caffeoyl quinic acids distributed in the lung tissue. In addition, fecal metabolome coupled with 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed that FF could regulate the tryptophan metabolism by regulating the intestinal flora disorders. This study provided new insights of FF to relieve CS-induced pulmonary inflammation with the multimechanism."
"Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) for pathogen detection offers the potential for broad pathogen detection directly from clinical specimens.

In this study, we evaluate the patient characteristics for which mNGS testing was considered, test yield, and clinical impact of mNGS results when employing this model of diagnostic stewardship."
"Numerous compounds involved in the regulation of the cardiovascular system are also engaged in the control of metabolism. This review gives a survey of literature showing that arginine vasopressin (AVP), which is an effective cardiovascular peptide, exerts several direct and indirect metabolic effects and may play the role of the link adjusting blood supply to metabolism of tissues. Secretion of AVP and activation of AVP receptors are regulated by changes in blood pressure and body fluid osmolality, hypoxia, hyperglycemia, oxidative stress, inflammation, and several metabolic hormones; moreover, AVP turnover is regulated by insulin. Acting on V1a receptors in the liver, AVP stimulates glycogenolysis, reduces synthesis of glycogen, and promotes fatty acid synthesis and acetyl CoA carboxylase activity. Stimulating V1b receptors in the pancreatic islands, AVP promotes release of insulin and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and potentiates stimulatory effects of glucose and ACTH on secretion of insulin. Simultaneously, insulin increases AVP secretion by neurons of the paraventricular nucleus and the supraoptic nucleus. There is strong evidence that secretion of AVP and its metabolic effectiveness are significantly altered in metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. Both experimental and clinical data indicate that inappropriate interactions of AVP and insulin play an important role in the development of insulin resistance in obesity and diabetes mellitus."
"Rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) of respiratory cytology specimens is a critical technique for accurate and timely diagnosis of lung cancer. However, in China, limited familiarity with the Diff-Quik staining method and a shortage of trained cytopathologists hamper utilization of ROSE.

"Osteomyelitis complicates 20% of patients with infected diabetic foot ulcers. In this study, 2 strategies for treating pedal osteomyelitis were compared in a pilot study. This was a retrospective, non-randomized, single center 2 arm cohort study, conducted between 2020 and 2022 involving 53 patients at a tertiary limb salvage unit. All patients were managed with debridement and proximal bone biopsy. Group A was treated with systemic antibiotics for up to 6 weeks. Group B had vancomycin or gentamycin eluting bone void filler implanted into the diseased bone medullary cavity(s) and 1 week of oral antibiotics. Patients were followed independently for the primary endpoint of osteomyelitis treatment failure and secondary endpoints of amputation free survival, wound healing, minor amputation, and treatment-limiting side-effects. Survival analysis demonstrated no significant difference in treatment failure (p = .35) or amputation free survival (p = .46). Limb salvage rates were 88% in Group A and 89% in Group B. Wounds healed in 85% in Group A and 89% in Group B. Minor amputations occurred in 21% in Group A and 11% in Group B. Treatment limiting side effects occurred in 6% in Group A and were absent in Group B. In conclusion, the use of antibiotic eluting bone void filler appeared safe without extended systemic antibiotics in this study. Group B had fewer intravenous lines, requirement for home nursing, and treatment limiting side effects. A larger randomized controlled trial examining longer term clinical and radiological efficacy, treatment costs and side effects is warranted."
"The process of aging is a natural phenomenon characterized by gradual deterioration in biological functions and systemic homeostasis, which can be modulated by both genetic and environmental factors. Numerous investigations conducted on model organisms, including nematodes, flies, and mice, have elucidated several pivotal aging pathways, such as insulin signaling and AMPK signaling. However, it remains uncertain whether the regulation of the aging process is uniform or diverse across different tissues and whether manipulating the same aging factor can result in consistent outcomes in various tissues. In this study, we utilize the Drosophila organism to investigate tissue-specific proteome signatures during the aging process. Although distinct proteins undergo changes in aged tissues, certain common altered functional networks are constituently identified across different tissues, including the decline of the mitochondrial ribosomal network, autophagic network, and anti-ROS defense networks. Furthermore, downregulation of insulin receptor (InR) in the midguts, muscle, and central nervous system (CNS) of flies leads to a significant extension in fly lifespans. Notably, despite manipulating the same aging gene InR, diverse alterations in proteins are observed across different tissues. Importantly, knockdown of InR in the midguts leads to a distinct proteome compared with other tissues, resulting in enhanced actin nucleation and glutathione metabolism, while attenuating age-related elevation of serine proteases. Consequently, knockdown of InR results in rejuvenation of the integrity of the midgut barrier and augmentation of anti-ROS defense capabilities. Our findings suggest that the barrier function of the midgut plays a pivotal role in defending against aging, underscoring the paramount importance of maintaining optimal gut physiology to effectively delay the aging process. Moreover, when considering age-related changes across various tissues, it is more reasonable to identify functional networks rather than focusing solely on individual proteins."
"Gain-of-function polymorphisms in the transcription factor IFN regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) are associated with an increased risk of developing systemic lupus erythematosus. Global homozygous or heterozygous deficiency of IRF5 from birth confers protection in many lupus mouse models. However, less is known about the effects of IRF5 targeting after autoimmunity has already developed. This is an important point to clarify when considering IRF5 as a potential therapeutic target in lupus. In this study, we demonstrate that genetic reduction of IRF5 expression after disease initiation reduces disease severity in the FcγRIIB-/- Y-linked autoimmune accelerating mouse lupus model. Reduction of IRF5 expression resulted in a decrease in splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy and a reduction in splenic B cell activation and plasmablast numbers. Splenic T cell activation and differentiation were also impacted as demonstrated by an increase in the number of naive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and a reduction in the number of memory/effector CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Although serum antinuclear autoantibody levels were not altered, reduction in IRF5 expression led to decreased immune complex deposition and complement activation, diminished glomerular and interstitial disease, and a reduction in immune cell infiltrate in the kidney. Mechanistically, myeloid cells in the kidney produced less inflammatory cytokines after TLR7 and TLR9 activation. Overall, we demonstrate that genetic reduction of IRF5 expression during an active autoimmune process is sufficient to reduce disease severity. Our data support consideration of IRF5 as a therapeutic target and suggest that approaches targeting IRF5 in systemic lupus erythematosus may need to impact IRF5 activity both systemically and in target organs."

"Social work practitioners have experienced increased rates of burnout, fatigue, and occupational stress. To combat deteriorating mental health, the National Association of Social Workers' Code of Ethics has called for a renewed focus on self-care practice. Yet, self-care education often fails to consider how to integrate practices into the workplace, especially with constrained resources and increasing caseloads. The purpose of this study was to examine healthcare social workers' perceptions of self-care in the workplace. Semistructured virtual interviews were conducted with healthcare social workers (N = 43) across the state of Texas. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and redacted to protect participant confidentiality. Through content analysis, the research team analyzed transcripts by selecting meaningful units of text to create codes and categories. Themes were then developed, and the research team refined codes, discussed inconsistencies, and reached consensus. Findings demonstrate self-care in the workplace includes (a) individual strategies, identified by strong and trustworthy peer support systems and boundary management; (b) intrapersonal strategies, identified by formal supervision and advocacy and activism; and (c) institutional strategies, identified by ethical workplace cultures that invest in mental health and explicitly value social work. These data inform a framework to adapt self-care from an individual necessity to a shared responsibility among organizational leadership."
"Acetaminophen (APAP) has emerged as a predominant contributor to acute liver failure (ALF) in United States. Alismatis rhizoma, a commonly used traditional herbal medicine, contains small molecular components with extensive hepatoprotective activity. However, the specific role of Alismatis rhizoma polysaccharide (ARP) in liver protection remains unclear. ARP50 and ARP70, derived through graded alcohol precipitation and refinement, predominantly consisted of varying proportions of glucose, galactose, and arabinose. In vitro experiments on free radical scavenging demonstrated notable antioxidant capabilities of ARP50 and ARP70. To investigate the hepatoprotective effects, an APAP-induced acute liver injury (ALI) model was established in mice. ARP50 and ARP70 exerted dose-dependent therapeutic effects on APAP-induced liver injury. Further analysis of liver metabolites revealed that ARPs facilitated the reconstruction of the liver antioxidant system by modulating the metabolism network centered on l-glutamine. In addition, the abundance of gut microbiota was altered under the influence of ARPs. ARP50 significantly reduced the levels of Pseudarthrobacter and markedly increased the levels of Faecalibacterium，At the same time, ARP50 could increase the levels of acetic acid in the liver and serum. Meanwhile, ARP70 significantly increased the abundance of Dubosiella, Muribaculum, Ileibacterium, and Prevotellaceae UCG 001, while reducing the abundance of Escherichia Shigella and Pseudarthrobacter. The results indicated that ARPs could exert a protective effect against APAP-induced acute liver injury by reshaping the liver metabolic profile and modulating the gut microbiota."
"Neuroblastoma survivors have an increased risk of developing subsequent malignant neoplasms (SMNs), but the risk of subsequent nonmalignant neoplasms (SNMNs) and risk factors are largely unknown.

"Although immunotherapy combinations have revolutionised cancer treatment, the rapid screening of effective and optimal therapies from large numbers of candidate combinations, as well as exploring subgroup efficacy, remains challenging. This necessitates innovative, integrated, and efficient trial designs. In this study, we extend the MIDAS design to include subgroup exploration and propose an enhanced Bayesian information borrowing platform design called MIDAS-2. MIDAS-2 enables quick and continuous screening of promising combination strategies and exploration of their subgroup effects within a unified platform design framework. We use a regression model to characterize the efficacy pattern in subgroups. Information borrowing is applied through Bayesian hierarchical modelling to improve trial efficiency considering the limited sample size in subgroups. Time trend calibration is also employed to avoid potential baseline drifts. Simulation results demonstrate that MIDAS-2 yields high probabilities for identifying the effective drug combinations as well as promising subgroups, facilitating appropriate selection of the best treatments for each subgroup. The proposed design is robust against small time trend drifts, and the type I error is successfully controlled after calibration when a large drift is expected. Overall, MIDAS-2 provides an adaptive drug screening and subgroup exploring framework to accelerate immunotherapy development in an efficient, accurate, and integrated fashion."
"High-quality schematic illustrations are fundamental to the publication of scientific achievements in biomedical research, which are crucial for effectively conveying complex biomedical concepts. However, creating such illustrations remains challenging for many researchers due to the need to devote a significant amount of time and effort to accomplish it. To address this need, we present the Generic Diagramming Platform (GDP, https://BioGDP.com), a comprehensive database of professionally crafted biomedical graphics (bio-graphics). Currently, GDP houses 7 562 high-quality bio-graphics, meticulously categorized into 10 major and 77 minor categories. To increase the design efficiency, GDP provides 204 customizable templates derived from an extensive review of over 2000 literature and 7 textbooks.

"The goal of post-diagnosis diabetes management is the achievement and maintenance of glycaemic control. Most clinical practice guidelines recommend 3-6 monthly HbA1c monitoring. Despite this guidance, there are few data supporting the impact of monitoring frequency on clinical outcomes, particularly from low- and middle-income country settings. This study evaluates the short-term impact of HbA1c monitoring intervals on changes in HbA1c levels, and the impact of adherence to monitoring recommendations on the achievement of HbA1c targets and HbA1c changes over time in a South African cohort."

"This review article will cover both general aspects of hand infections and the most common superficial hand infections. Hand and wrist infections are commonly encountered in clinical practice both by the generalist orthopaedic surgeon and the hand surgeon. Clinically, they appear as a spectrum, from easy to resolve superficial infections, to life and limb threatening deep infections (for example, necrotizing fasciitis). Multiple pathogens can be the causative agents of hand infections (virus, fungi, parasites, mycoplasma, bacterias and mycobacteria). Continuous and prolonged exposure of the hands to the environment expose them to several kinds of infection."
"Different forms of phosphorylated tau (p-tau) have shown strong potential as Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers in both cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma. We hypothesized that p-tau proteoforms simultaneously phosphorylated at two different sites may have an increased diagnostic value compared with tau phosphorylated at a single site. Here, we developed two immunoassays detecting CSF and plasma tau simultaneously phosphorylated at both T181 and T231 (p-tau181&231) and at T217 and T231 (p-tau217&231). Subsequently, we measured CSF and plasma p-tau181&231, p-tau217&231, p-tau181, p-tau217, and p-tau231 levels in two cohorts across the AD continuum and in frontotemporal dementia (FTD) patients (discovery n = 55, validation n = 118). CSF and plasma p-tau217&231, p-tau181, p-tau217, and p-tau231 and CSF, but not plasma, p-tau181&231 were significantly elevated in all AD continuum groups vs. Neurological Disease Control group. Notably, plasma p-tau217&231 consistently showed an improved diagnostic performance compared with single-site phosphorylation assays - p-tau217 or p-tau231. The differences observed between CSF and plasma measurements suggest matrix-specific protein processing, underscoring the need for further research on the dynamics of tau phosphorylation pattern along the AD continuum."

"Lysosomes play a crucial role in various intracellular pathways as their final destination. Various stressors, whether mild or severe, can induce lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP), resulting in the release of lysosomal enzymes into the cytoplasm. LMP not only plays a pivotal role in various cellular events but also significantly contributes to programmed cell death (PCD). Previous research has demonstrated the participation of LMP in central nervous system (CNS) injuries, including traumatic brain injury (TBI), spinal cord injury (SCI), subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). However, the mechanisms underlying LMP in CNS injuries are poorly understood. The occurrence of LMP leads to the activation of inflammatory pathways, increased levels of oxidative stress, and PCD. Herein, we present a comprehensive overview of the latest findings regarding LMP and highlight its functions in cellular events and PCDs (lysosome-dependent cell death, apoptosis, pyroptosis, ferroptosis, and autophagy). In addition, we consolidate the most recent insights into LMP in CNS injury by summarizing and exploring the latest advances. We also review potential therapeutic strategies that aim to preserve LMP or inhibit the release of enzymes from lysosomes to alleviate the consequences of LMP in CNS injury. A better understanding of the role that LMP plays in CNS injury may facilitate the development of strategic treatment options for CNS injury."
"The use of reclaimed water for agricultural activities is being widely employed to address drought and water scarcity. Nevertheless, the disinfection processes do not consistently facilitate the complete removal of all eukaryotic viruses within these reclaimed waters. Consequently, it may pose a risk not only to humans but also to irrigated plants. We analyzed 48 influent and 48 effluent samples from 4 different wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) by high-throughput sequencing (HTS) to characterize plant-associated virome over a one-year period. Our results showed high levels of plant viruses in both influent and effluent waters. The predominant family identified was Virgaviridae, recognized for its high environmental persistence. Notably, the identification of Tomato Brown Rugose Fruit virus (ToBRFV), classified as a harmful organism by the European Union and subject to strict containment measures to control its spread, highlights the importance of monitoring reclaimed water to mitigate the spread of such viruses into the environment. These findings underscore the need of analyzing reclaimed water from a One Health perspective, ensuring its safety for humans, animals, plants, and the environment alike."
"In this paper, an oral liquid containing Magnolia officinalis polysaccharide was formulated and its hypoglycemic effects were investigated. An orthogonal test was conducted based on single-factor experiments to optimize the formulation guided by sensory evaluations. Its stability and safety were also assessed. The oral liquid was administered via gavage to STZ-induced diabetic mice at low (2.5 mL/kg), medium (5 mL/kg) and high (10 mL/kg) doses. Blood glucose levels were monitored weekly. After 8 weeks of treatment, the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed and fasting insulin levels, lipid profiles, oxidative stress levels in serum and liver, and the activities of hexokinase (HK) and pyruvate kinase (PK) in the liver were measured. Results indicated that the optimal formulation contained 0.2% steviol glycosides, 0.2% ascorbic acid, a pH of 5.0, and 0.5% ginger juice, yielding a sensory evaluation score of 94 ± 0.58. The oral liquid remained stable at room temperature for 12 months and passed acute oral toxicity testing. After 8 weeks, diabetic mice exhibited a significant reduction in blood glucose levels (P < 0.01), enhanced glucose metabolism, increased fasting insulin levels, and decreased lipid levels. Additionally, antioxidant capacity improved, and HK and PK activities increased significantly in the diabetic mice. In conclusion, the Magnolia officinalis polysaccharide oral liquid demonstrated potential antidiabetic effects by promoting glucose utilization in peripheral tissues, increasing fasting insulin levels, and enhancing antioxidant capacity alongside HK and PK activities. This formulation could represent a promising hypoglycemic health product."
"The pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis contributes to the pathogenesis of periodontitis and other systemic diseases. The zinc-dependent metallopeptidase PepO is a virulence factor that plays a crucial role in the adhesion and invasion of Porphyromonas gingivalis to human cells. Here, we solved the 2.04 Å crystal structure of wild-type PepO in complex with the inhibitor phosphoramidon. The active-site pocket of PepO appears to exhibit an increased hydrophobicity and a more pronounced negative charge, highlighting distinct structural features compared to its homologs. In addition to phosphoramidon, several zinc metallopeptidase inhibitors, including thiorphan, omapatrilat, and sacubitrilat, exhibited varying degrees of inhibition on PepO enzymatic activity. Notably, the recombinant PepO showed distinct binding profiles to human fibrinogen, a characteristic that likely contributes to its role as virulence factors. These findings provide significant insights into the structural and functional mechanisms of PepO, offering a platform for the rational design of targeted inhibitors against the periodontal pathogen P. gingivalis."
"The sector-wide approach (SWAp) is an instrument of cooperation between external development partners (EDPs) and the government of a country.

"Microneedles (MNs) offer the potential for discrete and painless transdermal drug delivery, yet poor insertion and dosing consistency have hindered their clinical translation. Specifically, hollow MNs are appropriate for the administration of liquid modalities, including insulin, which could prove to be beneficial for patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. This work aimed to design and manufacture a hollow MN with an improved insertion and delivery profile suitable for insulin administration."
"Placental serotonin is recognized as a key component of feto-placental physiology and can be influenced by environmental factors such as maternal diet, drugs, stress, and immune activation. In this study, we compared the contribution of placental and fetal sources to the maintenance of serotonin levels required for normal fetal development during ontogenetic dynamics. Our results demonstrated the leading role of the placenta at almost all stages of development. We investigated the modulatory effect of inflammation on placental serotonin levels. The data obtained showed that the susceptibility to prenatal inflammation depends on its severity and varies considerably at different stages of development. According to our results, inflammation-induced modulation of placental serotonin levels can be prevented by immunoglobulin administration at both early and late stages of development. Disturbances in placental serotonin signaling during critical developmental periods may have long-lasting consequences for the health and behavior of the offspring. Therefore, the ability to prevent environmental modulation of placental serotonin, and hence negative effects on the developing fetus, is of great importance."
"There is increasing interest in the potential therapeutic role of 5-HT (serotonin) in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, which are characterized by the progressive degeneration and death of nerve cells. 5-HT is a vital neurotransmitter that plays a central role in regulating mood, cognition, and various physiological processes in the body. Disruptions in the 5-HT system have been linked to several neurological and psychiatric disorders, making it an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. Although the exact causes of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are not fully understood, researchers believe that regulating the 5-HT system could help alleviate symptoms and potentially slow the progression of these diseases. Here, we delve into the potential of harnessing 5-HT as a therapeutic target for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. It is important to note that the current clinical drugs targeting 5-HT are still limited in the treatment of these complex diseases. Therefore, further research and clinical trials are needed to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of its clinical application."

"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an increasingly prevalent disorder that poses a significant global health and socioeconomic burden. East Asian countries such as China, Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea have a higher incidence and prevalence of kidney failure when compared to Western nations, and the reasons for this discrepancy remain unclear. Aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) is an essential detoxifying enzyme for exogenous and endogenous aldehyde metabolism in mitochondria. Inactivating mutations at E504K and E487K are found in 35-45% of East Asian populations and has been linked to a higher risk of various disorders, including cardiovascular diseases and cancer. However, little is known about the role of ALDH2 in CKD. Here, we characterized the expression pattern of ALDH2 in normal and CKD human and mouse kidneys and demonstrated that ALDH2 expression was significantly reduced, and that the protein level was inversely correlated with the degree of CKD and fibrosis. Further, we treated ALDH2∗2 knock-in mice, a loss of ALDH2 function model, with aristolochic acid and found that these mice showed enhanced fibrosis. Moreover, ALDH2 deficiency was associated with kidney fibrosis involving epithelial cell differentiation process in vivo and in vitro. However, ALDH2 overexpression protected proximal tubule epithelial cells from transforming growth factor-β-induced dedifferentiation or partial epithelial-mesenchymal transdifferentiation in vitro. Thus, our findings yield important clinical information regarding the development and progression of CKD involving ALDH2, especially among East Asian populations."
"Bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1) productive infection induces the generation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), which may consequently lead to cell apoptosis. In response to DSBs, the DNA damage repair-related protein 53BP1 is recruited to the sites of DSBs, leading to the formation of 53BP1foci, which are crucial for the repair of damaged DNA and maintaining genomic integrity by repairing DSBs. In this study, we discovered that HMGA1 may play a significant role in counteracting virus infection-induced DNA damage, as the siRNA-mediated knockdown of HMGA1 protein expression or inhibition of HMGA1 activity by the chemical inhibitor Netropsin uniformly exacerbates the DNA damage induced by BoHV-1 productive infection. Interestingly, HMGA1 may positively regulate 53BP1 expression, and treatment with Netropsin reduced the accumulation of 53BP1 protein in the nucleus, suggesting that HMGA1 may potentially influence 53BP1's nuclear localization. However, this effect was reversed in the context of virus infection. Furthermore, Netropsin treatment restored the disruption of 53BP1 foci caused by virus infection, which is consistent with our findings that Netropsin enhances the nuclear accumulation of 53BP1. Collectively, these results indicate that HMGA1 is involved in countering DNA damage induced by virus infection. HMGA1 does indeed modulate the nuclear accumulation of 53BP1 protein, but this effect is counteracted by virus infection. Therefore, the biological function of HMGA1 in countering virus infection-induced DNA damage may be independent of its regulation of 53BP1 signaling. This is the first report suggesting that HMGA1 may be implicated in virus infection-induced DNA damage, although the precise mechanism remains to be elucidated. Furthermore, we report for the first time an interaction between HMGA1 and 53BP1, which is disrupted following virus infection."
"Sniffing is a motivated behavior displayed by nearly all terrestrial vertebrates. While sniffing is associated with acquiring and processing odors, sniffing is also intertwined with affective and motivated states. The systems which influence the display of sniffing are unclear. Here, we report that dopamine release into the ventral striatum in mice is coupled with bouts of sniffing and that stimulation of dopaminergic terminals in these regions drives increases in respiratory rate to initiate sniffing whereas inhibition of these terminals reduces respiratory rate. Both the firing of individual neurons and the activity of post-synaptic D1 and D2 dopamine receptor-expressing neurons are coupled with sniffing and local antagonism of D1 and D2 receptors squelches sniffing. Together, these results support a model whereby sniffing can be initiated by dopamine's actions upon ventral striatum neurons. The nature of sniffing being integral to both olfaction and motivated behaviors implicates this circuit in a wide array of functions."

"Seborrheic dermatitis (SD) is a chronic, inflammatory disease characterized by unknown etiopathogenesis. It affects skin areas rich in sebaceous glands. There are strong data on the relationship between nutrition habits, body mass index (BMI), psychoemotional status, and sebaceous gland diseases such as acne, rosacea, and androgenetic alopecia. However, there are very little data on SD, nutrition habits, BMI, and psychoemotional status."
"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a major risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD), and there are currently no therapies for AKI. Proximal tubules (PTs) are particularly susceptible to AKI, due to nephrotoxins such as aristolochic acid I (AAI). Normal PTs use fatty acid oxidation and branched chain amino acid (BCAA; valine, leucine, and isoleucine) catabolism to generate ATP; however, in AKI, these pathways are downregulated. Our aim was to investigate the utility of a pharmacological activator of BCAA catabolism, BT2, in preventing nephrotoxic AKI. Mice were administered two injections of AAI 3 days apart to induce AKI, with or without daily BT2 treatment. Mice treated with BT2 had significantly protected kidney function (reduced serum creatinine and urea nitrogen), reduced histological injury, preservation of PT (Lotus lectin staining), and less PT injury (cytokeratin-20 staining) and inflammatory gene expression compared with mice with AAI alone. Mice with AKI had increased circulating BCAA and accumulation of BCAA in the kidney cortex. Leucine is a potent activator of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling, and mTORC1 signaling was activated in mice treated with AAI. However, BT2 reduced kidney cortical BCAA accumulation and attenuated the mTORC1 signaling. In vitro, injured primary PT cells had compromised mitochondrial bioenergetics, but cells treated with AAI + BT2 had partially restored mitochondrial bioenergetics and improved injury markers compared with cells treated with AAI alone. Thus, pharmacological activation of BCAA catabolism using BT2 attenuated nephrotoxic AKI in mice."
"The purpose of this review is to examine the current state of the evidence, including several recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses, to determine if proportional modes of ventilation have the potential to hasten weaning from mechanical ventilation for adult critically ill patients, compared to pressure support ventilation (PSV), the current standard of care during the recovery and weaning phases of mechanical ventilation."
"This commentary highlights the role of heart rate variability (HRV) indices in predicting diabetic kidney disease (DKD) progression, based on findings from the PERL and ACCORD trials. HRV-derived measures from routine ECGs are shown to be strong predictors of rapid kidney function decline in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, suggesting their potential utility in identifying individuals at high risk for DKD and guiding early preventive interventions."
"Wildlife trade can create adverse impacts for biodiversity and human health globally, including increased risks for zoonotic spillover that can lead to pandemics. Institutional responses to zoonotic threats posed by wildlife trade are diverse; understanding regulations governing wildlife trade is an important step for effective zoonotic spillover prevention measures. In this review, we focused on peer-reviewed studies and grey literature conducted on regulatory approaches that govern domestic and international wildlife trade in order to assess the role of local, national and global-level institutions in the prevention of zoonotic spillover and infection transmission between humans. The five-stage scoping review protocol described by Arksey and O'Malley to map key concepts and main sources and types of evidence available was followed to understand and analyze empirical evidence from peer-reviewed studies and grey literature conducted on regulatory approaches that govern domestic and international wildlife. Sources were included if they discuss at least one of three points: regulatory approaches governing the wild animal trade, including wild animal markets, traditional medicine or exotic pets; regulatory approaches governing importation of wild animals and the international wildlife supply chain; or the role of local, national, and global-level institutions in regulating wild animal trade for food, traditional medicine or exotic pets. A total of 1598 sources were retrieved, from which 32 sources were included in the final review (30 studies + 2 grey literature reports). Based on published literature, regulations governing wildlife trade are inconsistent within and between countries. Organizations regulating wildlife trade may have competing interests, which can lead to fragmentation and a lack in coordination and oversight. National compliance with international regulations can be an issue. Reducing the probability of spillover events in wildlife trade is key to prevent future pandemics. Our results indicate a need for enhanced regulatory harmonization within and between national and supranational regulations. Coordination and collaboration for prevention of zoonotic infection and spillover may be enhanced through future research focused on the effectiveness of timely Information sharing and global- and national- level harmonization of wildlife trade regulations."

"The smoke-derived butenolides, karrikins (KARs), regulate many aspects of plant growth and development. However, KARs and a plant hormone, strigolactones (SLs), have high resemblance in signal perception and transduction, making it hard to delineate KARs response due to the shortage of chemical-genetic tools. Here, we identify a triazole urea KK181N1 as an inhibitor of the KARs receptor KAI2. KK181N1 selectively depress the KAR-induced phenotypes in Arabidopsis. We further elucidate the antagonistic, KAI2 binding mechanism of KK181N1, showing that KK181N1 binds to the catalytic pockets of KAI2 in a non-covalent binding manner. Our experiments also demonstrate the binding affinity of triazole urea compounds are regulated by the structured water molecule networks. By fine-tuning this network, we successfully develop a more potent derivative of KK181N1. We anticipate that these chemicals will be applicable to the elucidation of KARs biology, especially for discriminating the molecular and physiological aspects of KARs and SL signaling."
Deleterious germline variants in certain DNA repair genes are risk factors for developing aggressive prostate cancer. The objective was to quantify their prognostic impact after prostate cancer diagnosis.
"Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne disease in the United States. Recent environmental and socioecological changes have led to an increased incidence of Lyme and other tick-borne diseases, which enhances the urgency of identifying and mitigating adverse outcomes of Lyme disease exposure. Lyme disease during pregnancy, especially when untreated, may lead to adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes; however, long-term child outcomes following utero exposure to Lyme disease have not yet been systematically assessed. This concise review describes the current state of knowledge of Lyme disease as a congenital infection and the potential effects of in utero exposure to Lyme disease infection on the neurodevelopment of infants and children. We highlight the importance of distinguishing between acute Lyme disease and a chronic condition termed Post-Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome, as the impacts of both conditions on the developing fetus and subsequent child development may differ. The importance of placental pathology for patients with acute or chronic symptoms of Lyme disease in pregnancy is explored. Future research aiming to understand and protect neurodevelopment after antenatal Lyme disease must carefully collect potentially confounding variables such as symptomatology and treatment, use clear and standard case definitions, and follow children into school-age and beyond."
"Spatial protein expression technologies can map cellular content and organization by simultaneously quantifying the expression of >40 proteins at subcellular resolution within intact tissue sections and cell lines. However, necessary image segmentation to single cells is challenging and error prone, easily confounding the interpretation of cellular phenotypes and cell clusters. To address these limitations, we present STARLING, a probabilistic machine learning model designed to quantify cell populations from spatial protein expression data while accounting for segmentation errors. To evaluate performance, we develop a comprehensive benchmarking workflow by generating highly multiplexed imaging data of cell line pellet standards with controlled cell content and marker expression and additionally established a score to quantify the biological plausibility of discovered cellular phenotypes on patient-derived tissue sections. Moreover, we generate spatial expression data of the human tonsil-a densely packed tissue prone to segmentation errors-and demonstrate cellular states captured by STARLING identify known cell types not visible with other methods and enable quantification of intra- and inter- individual heterogeneity."

"Dopaminergic neurotransmission plays a crucial role in motor function through the coordination of dopamine receptor (DRD) subtypes, such as DRD1 and DRD2, thus the functional imbalance of these receptors can lead to Parkinson's disease. However, due to the complexity of dopaminergic circuits in the brain, it is limited to investigating the individual functions of each DRD subtype in specific brain regions. Here, we developed a light-responsive chimeric DRD2, OptoDRD2, which can selectively activate DRD2-like signaling pathways with spatiotemporal resolution. OptoDRD2 was designed to include the light-sensitive component of rhodopsin and the intracellular signaling domain of DRD2. Upon illumination with blue light, OptoDRD2 triggered DRD2-like signaling pathways, such as Gαi/o subtype recruitment, a decrease in cAMP levels, and ERK phosphorylation. To explore unknown roles of DRD2 in glutamatergic cell populations of basal ganglia circuitry, OptoDRD2 was genetically expressed in excitatory neurons in lateral globus pallidus (LGP) of the male mouse brain. The optogenetic stimulation of OptoDRD2 in the LGP region affected a wide range of locomotion-related parameters, such as increased frequency of movement and decreased immobility time, resulting in the facilitation of motor function of living male mice. Therefore, our findings indicate a potentially novel role for DRD2 in the excitatory neurons of the LGP region, suggesting that OptoDRD2 can be a valuable tool enabling the investigation of unknown roles of DRD2 at specific cell types or brain regions."
"Promoting academic integrity is an essential role of nurse educators. This scoping review examined best practices for orienting undergraduate nursing students on academic integrity policies. Methods: CINAHL Plus, ERIC, and Academic Search Premier databases were searched for studies published in English since 2013. In addition, reference lists of included studies were hand-searched for supplementary articles. Included studies focused on academic integrity policy orientation practices in higher education."
"The selection of appropriate starter cultures is a crucial factor in determining the quality of fermented soymilk products. This study evaluated the effects of a combined starter culture of Enterococcus faecium CGMCC 29309 and Lactiplantibacillus plantarum CGMCC 29306 on the microbiological, physicochemical, textural and rheological characteristics of fermented soymilk. The results indicated that the mixed-strain fermentation significantly increased the concentrations of free isoflavones, free amino acids, free fatty acids, and aroma compound acetaldehyde, 2,3-butanedione and acetoin, and significantly reduced the level of beany compound hexanal. The fermentation also greatly improved the textural and rheological characteristics of fermented soymilk. The Enterococcus faecium strain played a leading role in the mixed-strain fermentation, whereas the Lactiplantibacillus plantarum strain was found to be necessary due to its greater ability to break down conjugated isoflavones. This study provides a theoretical basis for using the combined lactic acid bacteria starter to prepare premium fermented soymilk products."
"Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a chronic liver disease characterized by immune-mediated liver inflammation. Despite its global prevalence, the pathogenesis of AIH remains poorly understood, and there is a lack of specific biomarkers and targeted treatments. This study aimed to investigate the role of hsa_circ_0109623, hsa-miR-146b-3p, and Sortilin 1 (SORT1) in AIH and their potential as therapeutic targets."
"Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) has garnered significant attention as a promising bioelectronic therapy. In recent years, respiratory-gated auricular vagal afferent nerve stimulation (RAVANS), a novel non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation technique, has emerged. RAVANS integrates respiration with transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) and shares a similar mechanism of action to traditional VNS. Similar to conventional Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS), RAVANS may mitigate brain injury through three primary pathways: reducing neuronal apoptosis, modulating neurotransmitter release, and influencing inflammatory factor pathways. In this paper, we emphasize how RAVANS enhances the activation of nucleus of the solitary tract （NTS）and the locus coeruleus by regulating the monoaminergic and GABA systems through respiratory control. Additionally, it leverages the beneficial effects of respiration on the central nervous system. In this review, we delineate the potential mechanisms of action of RAVANS, provide a comprehensive overview of its clinical applications in chronic low back pain, migraine, depression, hypertension, and cognitive disorders. Furthermore, we offer future perspectives on optimizing the parameters of RAVANS and its application in post-stroke dysphagia. This will pave the way for new avenues in RAVANS research."
"Radiation therapy (RT) is an integral treatment component in patients with glioma but associated with neurotoxicity. Proton RT (PRT), as compared with photon RT (XRT), reduces excess radiation to nontarget tissue. We used a retrospective method to evaluate brain imaging metrics of neurotoxicity after treatment with PRT and XRT for glioma."
"Polarity-corrected inversion time preparation (PCTIP), a myocardial T1 mapping technique, is expected to reduce measurement underestimation in the modified Look-Locker inversion recover method. However, measurement precision is reduced, especially for heart rate variability. We devised an analysis using a recurrence formula to overcome this problem and showed that it improved the measurement accuracy, especially at high heart rates. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the effect of this analysis on the accuracy and precision of T1 measurements for irregular heart rate variability."
"In the analytical quality by design (AQbD) framework, the design of experiments (DOE) plays a very important role, as it provides information about how experimental input variables influence critical method attributes. Based on the information obtained from the DOE, mathematical models are generated and used to build the method operable design region (MODR), which is a robust region of operability. Data treatment steps are usually carried out in software such as Fusion QbD, Minitab, or StaEase 360, among others. Although there are many studies in the literature that use the DOE, none of them address important aspects of data treatment for optimization and MODR generation and compare different software calculations. The purpose of this study is to contribute to a better understanding of data treatment aspects that are frequently misread or not fully understood, such as model selection, ANOVA results, and residual analysis. The discussion will be guided by the separation of curcuminoids, using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography and eight quality attributes as responses. This study highlights the importance of carefully selecting and evaluating models, as they significantly influence the generation of the MODR. Moreover, the findings emphasize that it is essential to incorporate uncertainties into the contour plots to accurately determine the MODR in compliance with the ICH Q14 guidelines and USP General Chapter <1220>."
This study aimed to assess the histological and radiographic effects of sodium hexametaphosphate (SHMP) as a direct pulp capping (DPC) agent in immature permanent dog premolars.
We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis assessing the antiinflammatory effects of various VNS methods while exploring multiple antiinflammatory pathways.
"Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most prevalent form of cardiovascular disease. A growing body of research shows that interleukins (ILs), such as IL-8, IL-18 and IL-16, elicit pro-inflammatory responses and may play critical roles in the pathologic process of CAD. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), capable of generating functional modifications in IL genes, appear to be associated with CAD risk. This study aims to evaluate the associations of ten previously identified SNPs of the three cytokines with susceptibility to or protection of CAD. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted using Pubmed, EMBASE, WOS, CENTRAL, CNKI, CBM, Weipu, WANFANG Data and Google Scholar databases for relevant literature published up to September 2024. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for the four genetic models of the investigated SNPs in overall and subgroups analyses. Thirty-eight articles from 16 countries involving 14574 cases and 13001 controls were included. The present meta-analysis revealed no significant association between CAD and IL-8-rs2227306 or five IL-16 SNPs (rs8034928, rs3848180, rs1131445, rs4778889 and rs11556218). However, IL-8-rs4073 was significantly associated with an increased risk of CAD across all genetic models. In contrast, three IL-18 (rs187238, rs1946518 and rs1946519) variants containing minor alleles were associated with decreased risks of CAD under all models. Subgroups analyses by ethnicity indicated that IL-8-rs4073 conferred a significantly higher risk of CAD among Asians, including East, South and West Asians (allelic OR = 1.46, homozygous OR = 1.96, heterozygous OR = 1.47, dominant OR = 1.65), while it showed an inversely significant association with CAD risk in Caucasians (homozygous OR = 0.82, dominant OR = 0.85). Additionally, IL-18-rs187238 and IL-18-rs1946518 were significantly associated with reduced CAD risks in East Asians (for rs187238: allelic OR = 0.72, homozygous OR = 0.33, heterozygous OR = 0.73, dominant OR = 0.71; for rs1946518: allelic OR = 0.62, homozygous OR = 0.38, heterozygous OR = 0.49, dominant OR = 0.45). IL-18-rs187238 also demonstrated protective effects in Middle Eastern populations (allelic OR = 0.76, homozygous OR = 0.63, heterozygous OR = 0.72, dominant OR = 0.71). No significant associations were observed in South Asians or Caucasians for these IL-18 SNPs. Consistent with the overall analysis results, subgroups analyses further highlighted a significant association between IL-8-rs4073 and increased risk of acute coronary syndrome (heterozygous OR = 0.72). IL-18-rs187238 was significantly associated with decreased risks of myocardial infarction (MI) (allelic OR = 0.81, homozygous OR = 0.55, dominant OR = 0.80) and multiple vessel stenosis (allelic OR = 0.54, heterozygous OR = 0.45, dominant OR = 0.45). Similarly, IL-18-rs1946518 was significantly associated with reduced MI risk (allelic OR = 0.75, heterozygous OR = 0.68). These findings support the role of cytokine gene IL-8 and IL-18 variants as predisposing factors for the development and progression of CAD."
"Quantitative live imaging is a valuable tool that offers insights into cellular dynamics. However, many fundamental biological processes are incompatible with current live-imaging modalities. Drosophila oogenesis is a well-studied system that has provided molecular insights into a range of cellular and developmental processes. The length of the oogenesis, coupled with the requirement for inputs from multiple tissues, has made long-term culture challenging. Here, we have developed Bellymount-pulsed tracking (Bellymount-PT), which allows continuous, noninvasive live imaging of Drosophila oogenesis inside the female abdomen for up to 16 h. Bellymount-PT improves upon the existing Bellymount technique by adding pulsed anesthesia with periods of feeding that support the long-term survival of flies during imaging. Using Bellymount-PT, we measure key events of oogenesis, including egg chamber growth, yolk uptake, and transfer of specific proteins to the oocyte during nurse cell dumping with high spatiotemporal precision within the abdomen of a live female."
"In 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic began worldwide. We examined the association between dental visit status and the incidence of COVID-19 and hospitalisation for it among older people based on medical claims data to help reduce COVID-19 severity. The study included 170,232 people who were 75-85 years old in fiscal 2019, with fiscal 2020 and 2021 serving as the follow-up period to ascertain the status of COVID-19. Using medical claims data, we investigated four types of dental visit (no visit, only periodontal treatment, periodontal and other treatment, and only other treatment) during fiscal 2019 and the incidence of COVID-19 and hospitalisation for COVID-19 during the follow-up period. Logistic regression analyses were performed with the incidence of COVID-19 and hospitalisation for COVID-19 as the dependent variables. Of the participants, 3206 (1.9%) developed COVID-19, of whom, 559 (17.4%) were hospitalised. There was not a significant association between the incidence of COVID-19 and type of dental visit. Participants with dental visits for periodontal treatment during the baseline year had a significantly lower odds ratio (OR) for hospitalisation due to COVID-19 compared to those without dental visits (OR: 0.71, 95% confidence interval: 0.58-0.78). The results suggest that dental visits for periodontal treatment including maintenance are important not only for maintaining oral health but also for preventing severe COVID-19."

"A hybrid in-person and online open plenary meeting of the International Committee on Systematics of Prokaryotes (ICSP) was held on 22 October 2024 at the Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Sesto Fiorentino, Florence, Italy, and via Teams just prior to the IUMS 2024 Congress. To comply with Articles 4(d) and 5(d) (1) of the statutes of the ICSP, the minutes of this meeting are published here."
"The mortality from breast cancer (BC) is still high in Nigeria and other low-and medium-income countries (LMICs) especially among adolescents and young adults. This is partly due to late presentation for diagnosis and treatment. It is recommended that to optimize the effectiveness of treatment, the total time which is the interval from symptom onset to initiation of treatment, should be less than 90 days as recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). The aim of this study was to determine the extent of delays in accessing care and possible reasons for such delays among young adult females with breast cancer in Nigeria."
"Pancreatic cancer remains one of the most lethal malignancies, with limited treatment options and poor prognosis. A common characteristic among pancreatic cancer patients is the biomechanically altered tumor microenvironment (TME), which among others is responsible for the elevated mechanical stresses in the tumor interior. Although significant research has elucidated the effect of mechanical stress on cancer cell proliferation and migration, it has not yet been investigated how it could affect cancer cell drug sensitivity. Here, we demonstrated that mechanical stress triggers autophagy activation, correlated with increased resistance to oxaliplatin treatment in pancreatic cancer cells. Our results demonstrate that inhibition of autophagy using hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) enhanced the oxaliplatin-induced apoptotic cell death in pancreatic cancer cells exposed to mechanical stress. The combined treatment of HCQ with losartan, a known modulator of mechanical abnormalities in tumors, synergistically enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of oxaliplatin in murine pancreatic tumor models. Furthermore, our study revealed that the use of HCQ enhanced the efficacy of losartan to alleviate mechanical stress levels and restore blood vessel integrity beyond its role in autophagy modulation. These findings underscore the potential of co-targeting mechanical stresses and autophagy as a promising therapeutic strategy to overcome drug resistance and increase chemotherapy efficacy."
"Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality for pregnant patients. A significant portion of cardiac morbidity and mortality is preventable and related to poor or delayed recognition of clinical warning signs and oversights in management. The establishment of pregnancy heart teams facilitates multidisciplinary planning to improve management of people with cardiovascular disease. Core members of the pregnancy heart team include obstetricians, midwives, cardiologists, anesthesiologists, nurses, and patient care coordinators. Additional specialists and subspecialists are included on pregnancy heart teams based on individual patient needs. This review discusses the practical aspects of the pregnancy heart team's approach to caring for pregnant people with cardiovascular disease."
Circulating proenkephalin (PENK) is a stable endogenous polypeptide with fast response to glomerular dysfunction and tubular damage. This study examined the predictive value of PENK for renal outcomes and mortality in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS).
"Epidural analgesia is considered the gold standard for labour pain but may not be an option for all parturients due to patient choice or medical contraindication. Non-neuraxial alternatives for labour analgesia have been extensively studied and include both pharmacological and non-pharmacological options. Pharmacological options include the use of opioids and inhalational agents while non-pharmacological options range from non-invasive methods such as continuous labour support to techniques such as sterile water injection. Apart from effective analgesia, such techniques may improve maternal satisfaction. This review summarizes the evidence for available non-neuraxial labour analgesia modalities."

"Rhabdoid tumors, characterized and driven by the loss of the mammalian SWItch/sucrose nonfermentable subunit SMARCB1, are very aggressive childhood cancers that can arise in the brain, the kidney, or soft tissues. Cell lines derived from these tumors are specifically sensitivity to the translation inhibitor homoharringtonine. Having recently demonstrated mammalian SWItch/sucrose nonfermentable roles in translation, we assessed SMARCB1 potential roles in translation in rhabdoid tumor cells. We first revealed by cell viability assays that rhabdoid tumor cells' sensitivity to homoharringtonine were dependent on the absence of SMARCB1. Polysome profiling and immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated the interaction of SMARCB1 with translation machinery. Global translation assays and ribosome profiling experiments further revealed that SMARCB1 re-expression increased global translation and altered translation efficiency of specific mRNAs. Most regulated mRNAs presented an increased translation efficiency and were involved in differentiation. In comparison with the entire transcriptome, these mRNAs presented a longer coding sequence and were enriched in GC. Finally, we demonstrated that SMARCB1 re-expression increased cytoplasmic localization of these mRNAs and that gene encoding these transcripts were bound by SMARCA4 and SMARCC1. In conclusion, this study reveals that the loss of SMARCB1 in rhabdoid tumors has specific consequences on mRNAs translation with potential to unveil new dependencies."
"This review examines the impact of skull base surgery on olfactory function, a critical yet often overlooked aspect of postoperative quality of life. As surgical techniques continue to evolve, understanding their impact on olfaction is key to optimizing patient outcomes."
"Haematologic malignancies are considered among the more common adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancers. Many female AYA patients with haematopoietic malignancies face impaired fertility. Haematologic malignancies patients tend to be treated with more aggressive systemic chemotherapy than that of solid tumours. In adult women, treatment-related contraception causes age-related fertility loss. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation is associated with decreased fertility. Ovarian cryopreservation is often indicated for haematopoietic malignancies; however, follicle loss associated with ovarian cryopreservation and ovarian minimal residual disease, which result in the withdrawal of the transplantation, are important issues. These problems may not be fully addressed by conventional methods of fertility preservation, such as oocyte, embryo, and ovarian cryopreservation, leaving room for research into new treatment approaches, such as fertility preservation drugs. In recent years, preclinical studies have shown that mTOR inhibitors may preserve chemotherapy-induced follicular loss, may have follicle-preserving effects on follicle loss associated with cryopreservation and transplantation of ovarian tissue, may have fertility-preserving effects on aging-related infertility. Clinical studies have shown that mTOR inhibitors may have the potential for indirect fertility preservation by controlling GVHD, have a limited anti-tumor effect against haematopoietic malignancies. The purpose of this article is to outline the various issues faced by female survivors of haematopoietic malignancies and discuss the potential of mTOR inhibitors as a safe treatment option. Based on current research, mTOR inhibitors seem promising and innovative fertility preservation agents regarding preclinical conditions, and further study, including clinical trials, should be expected."
"Anifrolumab is an inhibitor of the type I interferon receptor subunit 1 (IFNAR1) recently approved for the management of moderate-to-severe systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In 2 clinical trials, it has proven effective to treat cutaneous signs. Although anifrolumab has not been indicated for cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE), multiple cases and case series (20 publications with a total of 78 patients) have shown good and rapid responses with this drug, both in subacute CLE and discoid lupus erythematosus, as well as in lupus panniculitis and perniosis. Two case reports of dermatomyositis have also experienced clinical improvement with anifrolumab. Clinical trials of this drug are ongoing for subacute CLE and discoid lupus erythematosus, systemic sclerosis, and progressive vitiligo. Its most common adverse effects are respiratory infections and herpes zoster. Anifrolumab may be a well-tolerated alternative in the management of CLE."
"Linear compartmental models are often employed to capture the change in cell type composition of cancer cell populations. Yet, these populations usually grow in a nonlinear fashion. This begs the question of how linear compartmental models can successfully describe the dynamics of cell types. Here, we propose a general modeling framework with a nonlinear part capturing growth dynamics and a linear part capturing cell type transitions. We prove that dynamics in this general model are asymptotically equivalent to those governed only by its linear part under a wide range of assumptions for nonlinear growth."
"A high infection burden in early childhood is common and a risk factor for later disease development. However, longitudinal birth cohort studies investigating early-life infection burden and later risk of infection and antibiotic episodes are lacking."
"Zhachong-13 pills (ZC-13), as a traditional prescription of Mongolian medicine, are often used in the clinical practice of Mongolian hospitals for the treatment of stroke and rheumatic arthritis. In this experiment, UHPLC-Q-Exactive Orbitrap MS was used to explore the chemical composition of ZC-13. The results showed that 315 compounds were identified or inferred, including 56 alkaloids, 77 2-(2-phenylethyl)chromones, 61 flavonoids, 31 tannins, 8 coumarins, 16 lignans, 21 terpenoids, 5 amino acids, 19 organic acids, and 21 other components. In addition, the pharmacological activities related to anti-cerebral ischemia of these components were summarized. This result laid a foundation for further study on the pharmacodynamic material basis of ZC-13 and provided a scientific basis for the formulation of ZC-13 quality specifications."
"Over the past decades, self-directed models of care have been implemented throughout the world to support older people, including those with dementia, to live at home. However, there is limited information about how self-directed home care is experienced by older people with cognitive impairment and dementia, and how their thinking informs their care choices and quality of life."

"Despite the clinical benefits over nonoperative treatment or meniscectomy, the clinical outcomes of surgical repair for medial meniscus posterior root tear (MMRT) remain suboptimal, which may be attributed to the insufficient restoration of meniscal hoop tension during surgery."
"The first ONTOX Hackathon of the EU Horizon 2020-funded ONTOX project was held on 21-23 April 2024 in Utrecht, The Netherlands (https://ontox-project.eu/hackathon/). This participatory event aimed to collectively advance innovation for human safety through the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI), and hence significantly reduce reliance on animal-based testing. Expert scientists, industry leaders, young investigators, members of animal welfare organisations and academics alike, joined the hackathon. Eight teams were stimulated to find innovative solutions for challenging themes, that were selected based on previous discussions between stakeholders, namely: How to drive the use of AI in chemical risk assessment?; To predict or protect?; How can we secure human health and environmental protection at the same time?; and How can we facilitate the transition from animal tests to full implementation of human-relevant methods? The hackathon ended with a pitching contest, where the teams presented their solutions to a jury. The most promising solutions will be presented to regulatory authorities, industry, academia and non-governmental organisations at the next ONTOX Stakeholder Network meeting and taken up by the ONTOX project in order to tackle the above-mentioned challenges further. This report comprises two parts: The first part highlights some of the lessons learnt during the planning and execution of the hackathon; the second part presents the outcome of the ONTOX Hackathon, which resulted in several innovative and promising solutions based on New Approach Methodologies (NAMs), and outlines ONTOX's intended way forward."
"A 41-year-old woman with an enlarged right supraclavicular lymph node underwent a fine-needle biopsy, which confirmed the presence of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma. To identify the primary tumor, an 18 F-FDG PET/CT scan was performed, revealing multiple metabolically active lymph nodes throughout the body, but no primary lesion was identified. Subsequently, an 18 F-AlF-NOTA-FAPI-04 PET/CT scan was conducted, which demonstrated increased abnormal uptake in the cervix and revealed additional metabolically active lymph nodes. Thus, a biopsy of the uterine cervical region was performed, and the results confirmed cervical squamous cell carcinoma."
"Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) is normally used to measure the kinetic parameters of biomolecular interactions between a molecule immobilized on a gold surface and another one flowing in a microfluidic channel above the surface. During the SPR measurements, convection-diffusion phenomena occur inside the microfluidic channels, but they are generally minimized by appropriate experimental setup in order to obtain diffusion free kinetic parameters of the molecular interactions. In this work, for the first time, a commercial SPR apparatus has been used to obtain non canonical scientific parameters. Indeed, a specifically designed SPR experimental setup is described for carrying out measurements of the diffusion coefficient (D) of molecules in solutions. The high precision and reproducibility of the approach, as well as the wide applicability of the newly proposed SPR based method for the measurement of D of many different molecules and biomolecules, are here demonstrated and illustrated in detail."
The purpose of this study was to compare outcomes between patients undergoing same-day discharge (SDD) total knee arthroplasty (TKA) at an ambulatory surgery center (ASC) versus a tertiary care university hospital setting.
This study was based on the need to predict neurodevelopmental outcomes of children with foetal growth restriction. The aim was to systematically review the correlation between biomarkers of neural injury in children with foetal growth restriction and their neurodevelopment.
"Photosensitization has a wide range of applications in vastly distant fields. Three key components must be present at the same time to trigger the related photodynamic effect: light, the photosensitizer (PS) and oxygen. Irradiating the sensitizer leads to the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Since PSs are accumulated preferably in lipid membranes, the study of photoinduced damage to membrane lipids can greatly increase our understanding of the effect of ROS on membranes in pathological as well as therapeutic conditions. We aimed to characterize the topographical and nanomechanical changes in supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) evoked by light-induced ROS formation. SLBs were prepared on mica surfaces by deposition of liposomes containing unsaturated lipid components. Topographical changes of SLBs were imaged by atomic force microscopy (AFM), and ROS-induced nanomechanical alterations of the membranes were assessed by AFM force measurements. To shed light on chemical alterations of the membrane constituents, infrared spectra were recorded. In the AFM images of porphyrin-containing membranes nanoscopic, bilayer-spanning holes were detected after irradiation. The measured rupture forces increased as a result of irradiation. These phenomena did not occur in membranes lacking unsaturated lipid components, emphasizing their role in ROS-mediated disruption confirmed by infrared spectroscopy results."
"The present study highlights the advances in ultrasound, especially regarding its clinical applications to critically ill patients. Artificial intelligence (AI) is crucial in automating image interpretation, improving accuracy and efficiency. Software has been developed to make it easier to perform accurate bedside ultrasound examinations, even by professionals lacking prior experience, with automatic image optimization. In addition, some applications identify cardiac structures, perform planimetry of the Doppler wave, and measure the size of vessels, which is especially useful in hemodynamic monitoring and continuous recording. The ""strain"" and ""strain rate"" parameters evaluate ventricular function, while ""auto strain"" automates its calculation from bedside images. These advances, and the automatic determination of ventricular volume, make ultrasound monitoring more precise and faster. The next step is continuous monitoring using gel devices attached to the skin."
"Nanomedical applications have increased significantly. This work aimed to fabricate and characterize cobalt oxide nanoparticles (CoOnps) synthesized biologically via aqueous Alhagi maurorum extract and evaluate their cytotoxic and antimicrobial impacts. Green-synthesized CoOnps were prepared and analyzed using UV-Vis spectrophotometer UV-vis, Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Transmission electron microscopy TEM, Energy dispersive X-ray analysis EDAX, Fourier transform infrared, FTIR, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). In vitro traits of green-synthesized CoOnps were studied on ovarian cancer cells (SKOV3) using a Sulforhodamine B (SRB) method. The cytotoxic effect and IC50 were estimated. Moreover, concentrations of 10, 30, 40, 70, 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 μg/mL CoOnps were applied to investigate their antimicrobial effect against Listeria, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus as gram +ve pathogenic bacteria, Bifidobacterium bifidum 2203, Bifidobacterium bifidum LMG 10,645, Bifidobacterium breve LMC 017, Bifidobacterium angulatum 2238 and Bifidobacterium longum ATCC 15,707 as probiotics, E. coli as gram -ve bacterial model and yeast strain Candida albicans. CoOnps showed anti-ovarian cancer effects at 24.02 μg/mL. Furthermore, it exerted antimicrobial activity versus Listeria, Streptococcus, S. aureus, and E. coli were 31.66 ± 0.88, 24.33 ± 2.08, 25.66 ± 0.33, and 33.00 ± 6.08; however, they did not suppress the growth of Candida albicans and all tested Bifidobacterial strains up to concentrations of 500 μg/mL with significant difference compared to all concentrations p < 0.05. Green synthesis of CoOnps is a low-cost, eco-friendly and easily prepared method. Its impressive features as cytotoxic SKOV3, a cell line ovarian cancer and antibacterial effect for some gram +ve and -ve bacteria, besides maintaining probiotics, could candidate them as competitive agents for medical, pharmacological, agricultural and food applications."
"Malignant esophageal mediastinal fistula is a severe complication that occurs in both the advanced stages of esophageal cancer and after radiotherapy for esophageal cancer. Esophageal mediastinal fistula is very susceptible to complications such as mediastinitis and mediastinal abscess, resulting in a significantly elevated mortality rate for patients. We reported a rare case of esophageal mediastinal fistula after immunotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)."
"Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are a class of flame-retarding synthetic compounds. They may cause a potential threat to human health due to their bio-accumulative and toxicological properties, and ubiquitous presence in the environment. Food, and ingested dust constitute principal sources of human exposure to PBDEs. The aim of this study was to assess the potential human exposure to selected polybrominated diphenyl ethers measured in dust found in cars and airplane cabins to characterize the health risk."
"Proactively preventing postpartum weight retention (PPWR) is one of the effective intervention strategies to reduce the occurrence of obesity in women. Population studies have shown that serum folate levels are closely related to body weight. The regulation of folic acid on lipid metabolism has been fully confirmed in both in vivo and in vitro studies. For many years, folic acid supplementation has been widely used in periconceptional women due to its role in preventing fetal neural tube defects. However, whether folic acid supplementation prior to and throughout pregnancy exerts preventive effects on PPWR remains uncertain. This study aims to investigate the preventive effect of folic acid on PPWR in rats and further explore the underlying mechanisms."
"The APLAR has published a set of recommendations on the management of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in 2021. The current consensus paper supplements and updates specifically the treatment of lupus nephritis (LN) according to two rounds of Delphi exercise from members of the APLAR SLE special interest group, invited nephrologists, histopathologists, and lupus nephritis patients. For initial treatment of LN, we recommend a combination of glucocorticoids (GCs) with cyclophosphamide (CYC), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), or the calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) as first-line options. An upfront combination of immunosuppressive drugs and the biological agents may be considered in patients at significant risk of disease progression and renal function deterioration. Switching or ""add-on"" among different immunosuppressive agents, including biological agents, may be considered for refractory disease. Subsequent/maintenance therapy of LN should continue for at least 3 years to reduce the risk of renal flares. Lower dose MMF and azathioprine are options, but MMF maintenance should follow induction by the same drug. Prednisolone or equivalent should be maintained at a dose of 5 mg/day or less. The APLAR consensus for the management of LN includes recommendations for adjunctive therapies, monitoring and treatment of LN-related co-morbidities, and renal replacement therapies. It is hoped that this consensus paper can provide an evidence-based and pragmatic approach to the management of LN, taking into account the evidence level of therapies in Asian patients, cost-effectiveness, and differences in health care resources and reimbursement policies in the Asia-Pacific region."

"The implementation of computerised clinical decision support systems has the potential to enhance healthcare by improving patient safety, practitioner performance, and patient outcomes. Notwithstanding the numerous advantages, the uptake of clinical decision support systems remains constrained, thereby impeding the full realisation of their potential. To ensure the effective and successful implementation of these systems, it is essential to identify and analyse the reasons for their low uptake and adoption. This protocol outlines an umbrella review, which will synthesise the findings of existing literature reviews to generate a comprehensive overview of the barriers and facilitators to the implementation and adoption of decision support systems across healthcare settings."
"The practical application of infectious disease emergency plans in mental health institutions during the ongoing pandemic has revealed significant shortcomings. These manifest as chaotic management of mental health care, a lack of hospital infection prevention and control (IPC) knowledge among medical staff, and unskilled practical operation. These factors result in suboptimal decision-making and emergency response execution. Consequently, we have developed a digital-based emergency prevention and control system to reinforce IPC management in psychiatric hospitals and enhance the hospital IPC capabilities of medical staff."
"Titanium (Ti) implants have become widespread especially in dentistry and orthopedics, where macrophage-driven osteoimmunomodulation is crucial to their success. Hydrophilic modification of Ti represents a promising strategy to enhance its immune and osteogenic responses. Herein, the osteoimmunomodulatory performance and integrin-mediated mechanism of novel non-thermal atmospheric plasma (NTAP) treatment to induce a hydrophilic Ti were investigated for the first time. Compared to a hydrophobic surface, NTAP-modified Ti possessed a 3-fold increase of pro-healing M2 macrophage makers, and the doubled osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells was demonstrated in this immune microenvironment, thus improving early osseointegration. Mechanistically, the ameliorative osteoimmunomodulatory properties of NTAP were attributed to its positive and negative modulation in macrophages' integrin β1 or β2, and the subsequent FAK-PI3K/Akt or NF-κB signaling pathway. Collectively, this study highlighted the role of integrins and related signaling pathways in hydrophilic implant-caused macrophage polarization, therefore inventively unveiling the underlying mechanism of NTAP-enhanced osteoimmunomodulation. Furthermore, it established a robust theoretical foundation for the clinical application of this cost-effective, versatile, and transformation-valuable surface engineering strategy for the development of next-generation Ti implants."
This study aims to elucidate the therapeutic efficacy and safety of a taxane-based chemotherapy in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors regimen in patients diagnosed with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).
"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with extraintestinal manifestations that can affect multiple body systems. Extraintestinal manifestations (EIMSs) are seen in up to 50% of patients with IBD. Skin involvement is particularly common occurring in up to 15%-20% of patients. Skin reactivity presents in multiple forms with unique pathology. Therapy for IBD also may affect the skin directly through inflammatory processes or indirectly because of skin infections. This review will concentrate on the most common nonmalignant dermatologic conditions associated with IBD with a focus on prevalence, diagnostic approaches, and management strategies."
"The advent of highly effective and well-tolerated direct-acting antiviral therapy has made it more feasible to transplant hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected organs into HCV-negative recipients. This case report presents the outcomes of 4 patients who underwent multivisceral transplantation from HCV-nucleic acid test (NAT)-viremic donors, with 1 recipient also requiring a kidney transplant. All recipients received posttransplant direct-acting antiviral therapy with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (SOF/VEL [Epclusa]). By the fourth week of therapy, none of the recipients exhibited detectable viral loads, and all achieved sustained virologic response at 12 weeks. Allograft function for HCV D+/R- recipients remained excellent throughout follow-up. One recipient died from posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder and another developed end-stage renal disease; both outcomes were ostensibly unrelated to HCV-donor status. The other 2 patients are progressing well without any evidence of allograft rejection."
"Patients with hormone receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-negative (HER2-) breast cancers have the lowest response to neoadjuvant therapy of all subtypes. The role of neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (NET) in clinically node-positive (cN+), HR+, HER2- patients is evaluated in this meta-analysis."
"Nurses holding terminal degrees, Doctor of Philosophy (PhD), Doctor of Nursing Science (DNS), and Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP), fulfill different roles in nursing. The continued growth of nursing science and practice is dependent on alliances between these nurses that produce state-of-the-art knowledge and support the translation of evidence to practice. This integrative review described characteristics of scholarly collaborations between nurses holding a research-focused degree, the PhD, and those holding a practice-focused degree, the DNP. Five major nursing, medicine, and education databases were searched for peer-reviewed, original articles addressing or describing the characteristics of PhD-DNP scholarly collaborations, published through March 2023. In total, 15 articles met the inclusion criteria, and an integrative synthesis was conducted using constant comparison and thematic analysis. Findings included one overarching theme, Role Clarification, as well as four subthemes that emerged across the sample, describing key characteristics of collaborative PhD-DNP scholarship: (1) Mutual understanding and appreciation of strengths; (2) Strategic project planning and team building; (3) Clear organizational/administrative directives and guidance; and (4) Shared goals for the nursing profession. Articles describing the collaboration between nurses holding doctoral degrees are limited and provide primarily lower-level research evidence and evidence-based practice outcomes. Despite efforts to foster scholarly collaborations among nurses holding terminal degrees, more research is needed to clarify individual roles, offer tangible strategies for collaboration, and measure outcomes of collaboration benefitting healthcare systems, patient outcomes, and the nursing profession. This integrative review involved only the review of the extant literature."
"Retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) is recognized as an effective intervention for renal stones measuring less than 20 mm. This study aims to assess the efficacy and safety of a novel flexible kidney-fixed position compared to the conventional lithotomy position, focusing on lithotripsy efficiency and stone-free rates (SFR). A total of 100 patients undergoing unilateral RIRS between January 2023 and September 2024 were randomly allocated to either the conventional lithotomy position group or the kidney-fixed position group. Comparative analyses were conducted on demographic data, stone characteristics, intraoperative parameters, kidney movement metrics, and postoperative complications. A total of 97 patients successfully completed the study, with 47 participants assigned to the conventional lithotomy group and 49 to the kidney-fixed group. The kidney-fixed position was associated with a significant reduction in kidney movement (4.00 mm compared to 15.30 mm, p < 0.001) and a decrease in operative time (48.35 min versus 71.72 min, p < 0.001). Additionally, the SFR for stones measuring ≤ 4 mm was significantly higher in the kidney-fixed group (91.84% compared to 68.09%, p = 0.020). The implementation of a flexible kidney-fixed position markedly improves the efficacy of lithotripsy during RIRS, resulting in reduced operative time and an elevated SFR without a corresponding increase in postoperative complications. This technique holds promise for advancing the surgical management of renal calculi, warranting further investigation to substantiate these findings and assess long-term outcomes."
"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the predominant form of lung cancer and poses a significant public health challenge. Early detection is crucial for improving patient outcomes, with serum biomarkers such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCCAg), and cytokeratin fragment 19 (CYFRA 21-1) playing a critical role in early screening and pathological classification of NSCLC. However, due to being mainly based on corresponding antibody binding reactions, existing detection technologies for these serum biomarkers have shortcomings such as complex operations, high false positive rates, and high costs. This study aimed to develop new methods for detecting CEA, SCCAg, and CYFRA 21-1 to assist in the diagnosis of NSCLC. Affinity peptides of CEA, SCCAg, and CYFRA 21-1, respectively, were screened by phage display technology, and the peptides' binding affinities were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and biolayer interferometry. Peptides with high affinity were then integrated as binding domains into biosensors by fusing them with circularly permuted fluorescent proteins (cpFPs) through genetic coding. The resulting biosensors, C4 biosensor for CEA, S1 biosensor for SCCAg, and Y3 biosensor for CYFRA 21-1, demonstrated robust sensitivity and specificity even at concentrations as low as 1 ng/mL for their respective tumor markers. When applied to clinical samples and recalibrated for the upper limit of normal concentrations, the biosensors exhibited enhanced sensitivity and specificity for NSCLC diagnosis. This study introduced innovative biosensors for the detection of CEA, SCCAg, and CYFRA 21-1, providing a highly sensitive, specific, rapid, and cost-effective diagnostic alternative that could significantly improve NSCLC screening rates."
"Aging-related metabolic disorders seriously affect the lifespan of middle-aged and older people, potentially due to disruptions in the adaptive immune and gut microbial profiles. Dietary intervention offers a promising strategy for maintaining metabolic health. This study aimed to investigate the ameliorative effect of 2'-fucosyllactose (2'-FL) on aging-induced metabolic dysfunction and the underlying mechanisms. The results revealed that 2'-FL significantly relieved aging-related metabolic disorders, including weight gain, lipid deposition, dyslipidemia, glucose intolerance, systemic inflammation, and abnormal hepatic metabolism. Flow cytometry analysis revealed a significant reduction in T cytotoxic (Tc), T helper (Th), and regulatory T (Treg) cells and a significant increase in Th17 cells in aged mice, while 2'-FL relieved the aging-induced proportional changes in Th and Th17 subtypes. The aging intestinal microecology was characterized by higher Th17/Treg ratios, impaired gut barrier function, lower gut bacterial diversity, decreased abundance of beneficial genera including Ligilactobacillus, Colidextribacter, Mucispirillum, and Lachnoclostridium, and increased abundance of harmful bacteria including Turicibacter and Desulfovibrio, which was ameliorated by 2'-FL treatment. These findings highlight that 2'-FL is an ideal dietary prebiotic for improving aging-related metabolic disorders by modulating both the adaptive immune system and the gut microbial profile."
"Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) is a cutaneous sarcoma with an infiltrative growth pattern that makes it challenging to clear margins. High quality data regarding DFSP natural history, management, and outcomes are limited."
"Humans are driven by an intrinsic motivation to learn, but the developmental origins of curiosity-driven exploration remain unclear. We investigated the computational principles guiding 4-year-old children's exploration during a touchscreen game (N = 102, F = 49, M = 53, primarily white and middle-class, data collected in the Netherlands from 2021-2023). Children guessed the location of characters that were hiding following predictable (yet noisy) patterns. Children could freely switch characters, which allowed us to quantify when they decided to explore something different and what they chose to explore. Bayesian modeling of their responses revealed that children selected activities that were more novel and offered greater learning progress (LP). Moreover, children's interest in making LP correlated with better learning performance. These findings highlight the importance of novelty and LP in guiding children's exploration."
"Electronic medical records (EMRs) have the potential to improve and streamline the quality and safety of patient care. Harnessing the full benefits of EMR implementation depends on the utilisation of advanced features, defined as ""mature usage."" At present, little is known about the maturity of EMR usage by allied health professionals (AHPs)."
"Although the Notch signaling pathway is known to play an important role in ovarian follicle development in mammals, whether it is involved in oocyte maturation remains unclear. Therefore, this study was performed to elucidate the existence and role of the Notch signaling pathway during oocyte maturation in a porcine model."
"Feeding parent's milk with supplemental donor milk (DM) is the optimal way to feed very low birth weight (VLBW) infants instead of formula; however, suboptimal neurodevelopment persists. This is believed due, in part, to suboptimal nutrition. Given vitamin B12's role in neurodevelopment and increased adoption of plant-based diets among females of child-bearing age, we aimed to determine the adequacy of vitamin B12 in DM (n = 380 donors) and associated donor characteristics."
"Radiomics models trained on data from one center typically show a decline of performance when applied to data from external centers, hindering their introduction into large-scale clinical practice. Current expert recommendations suggest to use only reproducible radiomics features isolated by multiscanner test-retest experiments, which might help to overcome the problem of limited generalizability to external data."
To investigate the clinical situation and pregnancy outcome of pregnant women with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).
"Cerebral bypass surgery is one of the most complex and elegant procedures in neurosurgery. It involves several meticulous steps that test the skills of even the most prepared neurosurgeons. This surgery has transcended its traditional role in arterial stenosis and atherosclerosis, expanding its applications to include flow preservation techniques for complex conditions such as aneurysms, tumors, and vascular malformations. The decreased number of procedures performed across many hospitals reflects the development of newer endovascular therapies but is also due to the results of the extracranial-intracranial bypass study, the Carotid Occlusion Surgery Study, and the Carotid and Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion Surgery Study, which have raised questions about the efficacy of cerebral bypass surgery for individuals with carotid artery occlusion who are prone to ischemic stroke. Despite this, there is still a potential benefit of bypass surgery for patients with hemodynamic impairment refractory to medical management. Also, revascularization in moyamoya vasculopathy is an effective strategy for preventing ischemic and hemorrhagic events in both children and adults. Additionally, innovations in the technique, such as the flow-regulated bypass and intraoperative flow assessment, aim to minimize perioperative morbidity. Despite bypass surgery being less performed in this current era, the teaching and development of these skills are still encouraged for future neurosurgeons, as a role for bypass will exist for the foreseeable future."
"Annulus fibrosus' (AF) ability to transmit multi-directional spinal motion is contributed by a combination of chemical interactions among biomolecular constituents-collagen type I (COL-I), collagen type II (COL-II), and proteoglycans (aggrecan and hyaluronan)-and mechanical interactions at multiple length scales. However, the mechanistic role of such interactions on spinal motion is unclear. The present work employs a molecular mechanics-finite element (FE) multiscale approach to investigate the mechanistic role of molecular-scale collagen and hyaluronan nanostructures in AF, on spinal motion. For this, an FE model of the lumbar segment is developed wherein a multiscale model of AF collagen fiber, developed from COL-I, COL-II, and hyaluronan using the molecular dynamics-cohesive finite element multiscale method, is incorporated. Analyses show AF collagen fibers primarily contribute to axial rotation (AR) motion, owing to angle-ply orientation. Maximum fiber strain values of 2.45% in AR, observed at the outer annulus, are 25% lower than the reported values. This indicates native collagen fibers are softer, attributed to the softer non-fibrillar matrix and higher interfibrillar sliding. Additionally, elastic zone stiffness of 8.61 Nm/° is observed to be 20% higher than the reported range, suggesting native AF lamellae exhibit lower stiffness, resulting from inter-collagen fiber bundle sliding. The presented study has further implications towards the hierarchy-driven designing of AF-substitute materials."
"Adolescents with idiopathic scoliosis (IS) are often prescribed an orthosis to prevent curve progression and avoid surgery. Standard-of-care scoliosis orthoses are designed for full-time (FT) wear, which can be burdensome for some patients. Nighttime (NT) hypercorrective scoliosis orthoses are another option that has a lower impact on daily life, however, additional research is needed to guide the prescription of NT orthoses. The aim of this study was to assess the willingness of patients with IS and their parents/guardians to enroll in a randomized controlled study on bracing in scoliosis."
"Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Alzheimer's Related Dementias (ADRD) are projected to affect 50 million people globally in the coming decades. Clinical research suggests that Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), a precursor to dementia, offers a critical window of opportunity for lifestyle interventions to delay or prevent the progression of AD/ADRD. Previous research indicates that lifestyle changes, including increased physical exercise, reduced caloric intake, and mentally stimulating activities, can reduce the risk of MCI. Early detection of MCI is challenging due to subtle and often unnoticed cognitive decline and is traditionally monitored through infrequent clinical tests. In this research, the Smart Driving System, a novel, unobtrusive, and economical technology to detect early stages of neurodegenerative diseases, is presented. The system comprises a multi-modal biosensing array (MMS) and AI algorithms, including driving performance and driver's biometrics, offering insights into a driver's cognitive function. This publication is the first work reported towards the ultimate goal of developing the Smart Driving Device and App, integrating it into vehicles, and validating its effectiveness in detecting MCI through comprehensive pilot studies."
"Cerebellar transcranial alternating current stimulation (ctACS) has the potential to be an appealing, non-invasive treatment option for psychiatric and neurological disorders. However, realization of this potential has been limited by gaps in our knowledge of how ctACS affects cerebellar output on single cell and population levels. Previously, we showed that AC stimulation applied to the cerebellar surface produced a strong, frequency-dependent modulation of Purkinje cell (PC) and cerebellar nuclear (CN) cell activity. Here, to approximate more closely the ctACS conditions, we investigated how AC stimulation applied to the external skull surface overlying crus 1 altered PC and CN activity in anesthetized adult female Sprague-Dawley rats. PC and CN activity showed a frequency-dependent modulation in response to ctACS at frequencies ranging from 0.5 to 80 Hz. A unimodal response was seen for most PCs across all frequencies, whereas most CN cells transitioned to bimodal patterns as stimulus frequency increased. The frequency-dependence of the phases of the local minima of the CN cell modulation were consistent with CN cells being driven synaptically by PC activity. Furthermore, comparison of responses with ipsilateral and contralateral placement of the stimulus electrode with respect to the recording site showed that the strength and pattern of the entrainment depended on the stimulus electrode location, suggesting that ctACS electrode placement could be used to target specific cerebellar output channels. In sum, the results show that transcranial stimulation of the cerebellar cortex can modulate cerebellar output, which has potential implications for its use in treating neurological and psychiatric disorders."
"Gram-negative bacteria increase in ovarian cancer (OC) tissues, but its association with OC progression remains largely unknown. The present study aimed to investigate whether and how cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) pretreated by the main components of bacterial outer membrane lipopolysaccharide (LPS) influence the malignancy of OC cells. Specifically, the culture medium of LPS-preconditioned CAFs (LPS-CM) further accelerated cell proliferation, colony formation and tumorigenesis of OC cells SKOV3 and HEY A8, compared with culture medium of CAFs. Next, we found that LPS pretreatment activated the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB) pathway in CAFs to secret cytokines, including interleukin 1β (IL-1β), interleukin 6 (IL-6), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), etc. Neutralization of IL-6 in LPS-CM abolished the promoting effect of LPS-CM on cell proliferation, survival and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in SKOV3 and HEY A8 cells. Mechanistically, LPS-CM activated the Janus kinases 2 (JAK2)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway, while application with JAK2 inhibitor also reversed the promoting effect of LPS-CM on malignancy of OC cells. In summary, LPS-pretreated CAFs IL-6-dependently accelerate OC progression via activating the JAK2/STAT3 signal pathway, which enriches our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying ovaries-colonized gram-negative bacteria in OC progression."
"To evaluate the effectiveness of postoperative intravitreal bevacizumab (IVB) in preventing neovascular glaucoma (NVG) and identify associated risk factors in patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) undergoing phacovitrectomy. Patients with PDR who underwent phacovitrectomy were enrolled and categorized into two subgroups based on their postoperative treatment regimen: one group received IVB within 2 months following phacovitrectomy (Group 1); the other did not receive IVB during this period (Group 2). A comparative analysis evaluated the distinguishing characteristics of the two groups after 1:1 propensity score matching. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was utilized to determine the incidence of NVG after phacovitrectomy. Multivariate analysis with the Cox proportional hazards model identified risk factors associated with NVG postphacovitrectomy. A total of 206 eyes of 206 patients were investigated in this study. NVG developed in 15 eyes (7.28%). The probabilities of NVG occurrence at 6, and 12 months following phacovitrectomy were 4.85%, and 7.28%, respectively. When comparing Groups 1 (n = 57) and 2 (n = 57), a significant difference was observed in the occurrence of NVG (P < 0.001). In Group 1, only one case of NVG (1.75%) were noted, whereas all other NVG cases occurred in Group 2 (9.39%). Male sex and high preoperative intraocular pressure (IOP) were associated with NVG occurrence following phacovitrectomy, and the administration of IVB within 2 months postphacovitrectomy demonstrated efficacy in preventing the development of NVG. Male sex and high preoperative IOP were associated with a higher incidence of NVG, and postoperative IVB had a protective effect against NVG occurrence."

"(1) Background: Medical graduates who have undertaken longitudinal rural training have consistently been found to be more likely to become rural doctors and work in primary care settings. A limitation of such findings is the heterogeneous nature of rural medical education and contested views of what constitutes 'rurality', especially as it is often reported as a binary concept (rural compared to metropolitan). To address the identified gaps in workforce outcomes for rural medical training and to demonstrate accountability to the communities we serve, we investigated whether Longitudinal Integrated Clerkship (LIC) graduates are practicing in communities with similar rural classification to those where they trained. Within an LIC, students learn the curriculum in an integrated, simultaneous manner. (2) Material and Methods: A retrospective cohort study analysing variables associated with working in smaller rural communities. (3) Results: LIC graduates who undertook an additional year of rural training were five times more likely to work in communities of similar rurality to the program's training footprint. (4) Conclusions: The duration of rural training alone did not lead to optimal rural workforce outcomes. However, graduates who had trained in a combination of rural settings, an LIC, and block rotation were the most likely to practice in communities of similar rurality to the clerkship's training footprint. This highlights the impact of both the training duration and setting inclusive of an LIC on fostering positive rural workforce outcomes and the need to develop innovative solutions to expand these models of training in smaller rural communities."
"This study introduces an advanced bioanalytical platform that combines digital microfluidics (DMF) with Raman spectroscopy, effectively addressing common issues in bioanalysis such as sample contamination, excessive consumption of samples and reagents, and manual handling. Our innovative system is engineered to handle diverse sample types and enables both sample preparation and in-situ analysis on a single device, utilizing less than 5 μL of samples and reagents. It incorporates a Translucent Raman Enhancement Stack (TRES) sensor, which boosts the detection signal, and includes droplet-driving functionality for automated processing of complex samples in a compact setting. The hydrophilic surface of the TRES sensor draws analytes into the detection zone, expediting sample attachment and enhancing the surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). Moreover, the TRES sensors are cost-effective, straightforward to manufacture, and scalable, making them suitable for widespread production and single-use bioanalytical applications. This integrated and automated approach streamlines the sample preparation and analysis processes, enhances detection efficiency, and achieves high sensitivity, excellent linearity, and effective detection of different biochemical analytes. We validate the system's accuracy through on-device enrichment and analysis of exosomes from serum, demonstrating its capability for real-time, on-site analysis of complex biological samples."
Previous studies have shown that colorectal cancer incidence is increasing among younger adults (aged <50 years) in multiple high-income western countries in contrast with stabilising or decreasing trends in incidence in older adults (aged ≥50 years). This study aimed to investigate contemporary colorectal cancer incidence trends in younger adults versus older adults.
"Carbohydrate-rich solid foods, such as bread, pasta, and steamed rice, are applied for test meals in studies examining digestion and absorption of food related to glucose metabolism and sports science. Such research must consider that drinking water is sometimes better as it avoids the risk of choking or aspiration. However, the water increases test meal volume and dilutes glucose concentration, which may influence the digestion and absorption of ingested foods, as well as energy metabolism. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate whether the peak time and concentration of glucose and energy metabolism will differ among the intake of steamed rice alone (Rice), simultaneous intake of steamed rice and water (Mixed), and water alone (Water). Following the intake of the test meals, there was an immediate increase in blood glucose in Mixed compared to Rice and Water. The glucose peak time of Rice (60 (56-68) min; median and quartile) was also delayed compared to Mixed (38 (29-45) min). The blood lactate peak time was also significantly different in Mixed and Rice. Although meal and time interaction was not found in energy expenditure, Mixed increases the respiratory quotient by 40 min compared to Water. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that simultaneous intake of steamed rice and water hasted digestion and absorption of glucose and activates glycolysis. Future studies investigating gastric emptying rate and glucose metabolism should ensure that the conditions of fluid intake and the test meal volumes are consistent and do not differ significantly."
To investigate the association of accelerometer-measured intensity-specific physical activity (PA) with all-cause and cause-specific mortality among individuals with cardiovascular disease (CVD).
"Acute respiratory distress syndrome is a disease triggered by severe pulmonary and systemic inflammation that may lead to fibrosis and the decline of lung function. Lung capillary endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) is one of the primary sources of fibroblasts in pulmonary fibrosis. The role of miRNAs as molecular markers of pulmonary fibrosis, and miRNAs as nucleic acid drugs has attracted increasing attention. To mock EndMT process, Human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMECs) were induced with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Similarly, LPS treatment was used to generate a mouse model of LPS-induced EndMT and pulmonary fibrosis. LPS-induced EndMT in HPMECs resulted in a significant reduction of miR-23b-3p. miR-23b-3p inhibited the interstitial transition of HPMECs, and miR-23b-3p could mediate this process via inhibiting dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4). Dual-luciferase assays confirmed the regulatory mechanism of miR-23b-3p. In our mouse model of LPS-induced pulmonary fibrosis, miR-23b-3p and a DPP4 inhibitor (sitagliptin) individually alleviated LPS-induced EndMT progression and pulmonary fibrosis, and their combined use achieved the strongest remission effect. To sum up, miR-23b-3p alleviates EndMT in pulmonary fibrosis by inhibiting the expression of DPP4."
"The marsupial moles are arguably Australia's most enigmatic marsupials. Almost indistinguishable from placental (eutherian) moles, they provide a striking example of convergent evolution. Exploring the genome of the southern marsupial mole, we provide insights into its unusual biology. We show definitively by retrophylogenomic analysis that marsupial moles are most closely related to bandicoots and bilbies (order Peramelemorphia). We find evidence of a marked decline in marsupial mole effective population size, most likely preceding the arrival of humans in regions near its range, and potentially corresponding to periods of climatic change. Our analysis of loss of eye function-an adaptation to subterranean life-reveals a structured order of loss of gene function associated first with the lens, then cone, and finally rod cells. Last, we identify genetic changes suggestive of adaptation to an oxygen-poor environment and of its evolution of partially descended testes."
"Surgical treatment of inguinal hernias in children is one of the most common operative procedures worldwide. During surgery for inguinal hernias in adults, chronic pain develops in approximately 10% of all cases. In children, there has been limited research to determine whether they may also develop this chronic postsurgical inguinal pain (CPIP). The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of CPIP in children after open inguinal hernia surgery and to identify possible risk factors and protective factors for the development of CPIP."

"Zoonotic malaria presents a major public health challenge in Southeast Asia. Plasmodium cynomolgi coinfects the same macaque hosts and mosquito vectors as the most common cause of zoonotic malaria, Plasmodium knowlesi. Plasmodium cynomolgi appears morphologically similar to Plasmodium vivax on microscopy and can amplify P. vivax polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays, confounding transmission estimates. We screened 2,103 samples for P. cynomolgi across all 26 districts in Sabah, Malaysia, from 2010 to 2021. Samples comprised 1,425 P. knowlesi, 256 P. vivax, 293 P. falciparum, and 31 Plasmodium malariae PCR-confirmed malaria cases and 100 malaria microscopy-positive and species-specific PCR-negative samples. A nested PCR assay targeting P. cynomolgi-specific 18S small subunit ribosomal ribonucleic acid with a detection limit of ∼2 parasites/µL was conducted on whole blood samples. No P. cynomolgi infections were detected. Symptomatic P. cynomolgi co-infections appear rare in Malaysia, although prevalence may be underestimated owing to the absence of routine molecular screening and the sensitivity of available assays."

"Plasmids are extrachromosomal genetic molecules that replicate independent of chromosomes in bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotic organisms. They contain diverse functional elements and are capable of horizontal gene transfer among hosts. While existing plasmid databases have archived plasmid sequences isolated from individual microorganisms or natural environments, there is a need for a comprehensive, standardized, and annotated plasmid database to address the vast accumulation of plasmid sequences. Here, we propose PlasmidScope (https://plasmid.deepomics.org/), a plasmid database offering comprehensive annotations, automated online analysis, and interactive visualization. PlasmidScope harbors a substantial collection of 852 600 plasmids curated from 10 repositories. Along with consolidated background information, PlasmidScope utilizes 12 state-of-the-art tools and provides comprehensive annotations for the curated plasmids, covering genome completeness, topological structure, mobility, host source, tRNA, tmRNA, signal peptides, transmembrane proteins and CRISPR/Cas systems. PlasmidScope offers diverse functional annotations for its 25 231 059 predicted genes from 9 databases as well as corresponding protein structures predicted by ESMFold. In addition, PlasmidScope integrates online analytical modules and interactive visualization, empowering researchers to delve into the complexities of plasmids."
"Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide and is on the rise. Diet is considered to be a key modifiable risk factor for reducing the incidence of cardiovascular disease. Dietary approaches have proved advantageous for preventing disease morbidity and mortality but tend to focus on fruit, vegetables, fiber, lean protein and healthy fats. Coffee is one of the most popular beverages worldwide but is often surrounded by controversy with regard to its impact on health. This review aims to explore the relationship between coffee consumption and cardiovascular disease. The evidence from observational trials as well as randomized controlled trials is discussed. By focusing on specific bioactive compounds in coffee, potential mechanisms are explored, and future directions of research in the field are considered."

"The Rcs (regulator of capsule synthesis) phosphorelay is a conserved cell envelope stress response mechanism in enterobacteria. It responds to perturbations at the cell surface and the peptidoglycan layer from a variety of sources, including antimicrobial peptides, beta-lactams, and changes in osmolarity. RcsF, an outer membrane lipoprotein, is the sensor for this pathway and activates the phosphorelay by interacting with an inner membrane protein IgaA. IgaA is essential; it negatively regulates the signaling by interacting with the phosphotransferase RcsD. We previously showed that RcsF-dependent signaling does not require the periplasmic domain of the histidine kinase RcsC and identified a dominant negative mutant of RcsD that can block signaling via increased interactions with IgaA. However, how the inducing signals are sensed and how signal is transduced to activate the transcription of the Rcs regulon remains unclear. In this study, we investigated how the Rcs cascade functions without its only known sensor, RcsF, and characterized the underlying mechanisms for three distinct RcsF-independent inducers. Previous reports showed that Rcs activity can be induced in the absence of RcsF by a loss of function mutation in the periplasmic oxidoreductase DsbA or by overexpression of the DnaK cochaperone DjlA. We identified an inner membrane protein, DrpB, as a multicopy RcsF-independent Rcs activator in E. coli. The loss of the periplasmic oxidoreductase DsbA and the overexpression of the DnaK cochaperone DjlA each trigger the Rcs cascade in the absence of RcsF by weakening IgaA-RcsD interactions in different ways. In contrast, the cell-division associated protein DrpB uniquely requires the RcsC periplasmic domain for activation; this domain is not needed for RcsF-dependent signaling. This suggests the possibility that the RcsC periplasmic domain acts as a sensor for some Rcs signals. Overall, the results add new understanding to how this complex phosphorelay can be activated by diverse mechanisms."
"Small intestinal neuroendocrine tumors (SI-NETs) typically follow an indolent disease course and are often accompanied by mesenteric lymph node metastases upon diagnosis. These tumors can incite a fibroblastic reaction within the mesenteric root. Here, we present two cases of patients with symptomatic small bowel obstruction due to such mesenteric involvement. These patients underwent peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT), resulting in the stabilization of the mesenteric mass and remarkable improvements in obstructive symptoms. They experienced a return to oral intake and were able to discontinue parenteral nutrition. Despite some controversies, PRRT emerges as a promising tool in managing the mesenteric mass and achieving a reversal of debilitating complications such as obstruction and mesenteric ischemia."
"We model an adaptive agent-based environment using selfish algorithm agents (SA-agents) that make decisions along three choice dimensions as they play the multi-round prisoner's dilemma game. The dynamics that emerge from mutual interactions among the SA-agents exhibit two collective-level properties that mirror living systems, thus making these models suitable for societal/biological simulation. The properties are: emergent intelligence and collective agency. The former means there is observable intelligent behavior as a unitary collective entity. The latter means the collective exhibits observable adaptability that enables it to reorganize its network structure to meet its objectives in response to a changing environment. In this study, we generate these capabilities in a single, simple case. We do this first by letting a temporal complex network among SA-agents emerge and second by changing conditions in the ecosystem to test adaptability. This latter phase is done by introducing an artificial virus that infects SA-agents during interactions and can remove (or 'kill') the SA-agents. We then study the dynamics of the contagion within the collective as the virus spreads through the population and impacts collective reward-seeking performance. Specifically, we compare two strategies to control the spread of the virus: exogenous top-down control and endogenous bottom-up self-isolation strategies."
"This cross-sectional, nationwide, population-based study aimed to elucidate sex differences in psychiatric comorbidities of Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) across children, adolescents, and adults. We analyzed data from Taiwan's comprehensive healthcare database, including 112,225 individuals diagnosed with ADHD, categorized by age (0-12, 13-18, ≥18 years) and sex. Psychiatric comorbidities were assessed using ICD-9-CM codes, focusing on age and sex-specific prevalence. Among the cohort, 83.50% were children (0-12 years) presenting primarily with learning disabilities and tics, while adolescents (13-18 years; 11.88%) had higher instances of oppositional defiant and conduct disorders. In adults (≥18 years; 4.62%), the prevalence of anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, and substance misuse was notably higher. Males under 18 predominantly had ADHD, whereas females exhibited increased vulnerability to emotional disorders. In adulthood, males showed greater susceptibility to most psychiatric comorbidities, except sleep disorders. The study highlights the evolving nature of ADHD-related psychiatric comorbidities across different life stages, with distinct sex-based patterns. The transition from childhood to adulthood sees an increased prevalence of various psychiatric conditions, particularly impacting adult males. These findings underscore the need for age- and sex-specific therapeutic approaches in ADHD management. The cultural context of the study necessitates further research in diverse populations for broader applicability of the findings."
"Chronic cluster headache (CCH) is a relatively rare primary headache disorder whose management is often challenging. The prevalence of refractory CCH (rCCH) is unknown. Our aim is to describe the frequency of rCCH within a population of CCH, define the clinical profile of the refractory patients and the treatments they underwent."
"Instrumental variable (IV) methods are widely employed to estimate causal effects when concerns regarding unmeasured confounders. Although comparisons among several IV methods for binary outcomes exist, comprehensive evaluations are insufficient. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to conduct a simulation with some settings for a detailed comparison of these methods, focusing on scenarios where IVs are valid and under effect homogeneity with different instrument strengths."
"Major research and recruitment efforts have focused on diversifying the orthopaedic surgery workforce, with a focus on gender diversity. This study aimed to characterize gender trends in the adult reconstruction fellowship match and the American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons (AAHKS) membership over the past decade. We hypothesized that there would be increases in the percentage of women adult reconstruction fellows and AAHKS members."
"This study addresses occupational safety in reinforced concrete construction, an area marked by high accident rates and significant worker injury risks. By focusing on activity-body part (A-BP) combinations, this research introduces a novel framework for quantifying injury risks across construction activities. Reinforced concrete construction tasks are categorized into ten specific activities within three major work types: rebar work, formwork, and concrete placement. These are further analyzed concerning six critical body parts frequently injured on-site: head/face, arm/shoulder, wrist/hand, torso, leg/pelvis, and foot/ankle. Using data from 2283 construction accident reports and expert surveys, the probability and severity of injuries for each A-BP element were calculated. Probability scores were derived from actual incident data, while severity scores were determined via expert evaluations, considering injury impact and the required recovery time. To ensure precision and comparability, scores were standardized across scales, enabling a final risk assessment for each A-BP. Results identified that wrist and hand injuries during rebar work activities, particularly cutting and shaping, exhibited the highest risk, underscoring the need for focused protective measures. This study contributes to construction safety management by providing detailed insights into injury risk based on activity-body part interactions, offering safety managers data-driven recommendations for tailored protective equipment, enhanced training, and preventive protocols. This research framework not only helps optimize safety interventions on conventional construction sites but also establishes a basis for future studies aimed at adapting these strategies to evolving construction methods."
"Zoonotic spillover events pose a significant and growing threat to global health. By focusing on preventing these cross-species transmissions, we can significantly mitigate pandemic risks. This review aims to analyze the mechanisms of zoonotic spillover events, identify key risk factors, and propose evidence-based prevention strategies to reduce future pandemic threats. Through a comprehensive literature review and analysis of major databases including PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus from 1960-2024, we examined documented spillover events, their outcomes, and intervention strategies. This article emphasizes that targeting the root cause-the spillover event itself-is key to averting future pandemics. By analyzing historical and contemporary outbreaks, we extract crucial insights into the dynamics of zoonotic transmission. Factors underlying these events include increased human-animal contact due to habitat encroachment, agricultural intensification, and wildlife trade. Climate change, global travel, and inadequate healthcare infrastructure exacerbate risks. The diversity of potential viral reservoirs and rapid viral evolution present major challenges for prediction and prevention. Solutions include enhancing surveillance of wildlife populations, improving biosecurity measures, investing in diagnostic capabilities, and promoting sustainable wildlife management. A ""One Health"" approach integrating human, animal, and environmental health is crucial. Predictive modelling, international cooperation, and public education are key strategies. Developing pre-exposure prophylactics and post-exposure treatments is essential for mitigating outbreaks. While obstacles remain, advances in genomics and ecological modelling offer hope. A proactive, comprehensive approach addressing the root causes of spillover events is vital for safeguarding global health against future pandemics."
"The functional properties of the human brain arise, in part, from the vast assortment of cell types that pattern the cerebral cortex. The cortical sheet can be broadly divided into distinct networks, which are embedded into processing streams, or gradients, that extend from unimodal systems through higher-order association territories. Here using microarray data from the Allen Human Brain Atlas and single-nucleus RNA-sequencing data from multiple cortical territories, we demonstrate that cell-type distributions are spatially coupled to the functional organization of cortex, as estimated through functional magnetic resonance imaging. Differentially enriched cells follow the spatial topography of both functional gradients and associated large-scale networks. Distinct cellular fingerprints were evident across networks, and a classifier trained on postmortem cell-type distributions was able to predict the functional network allegiance of cortical tissue samples. These data indicate that the in vivo organization of the cortical sheet is reflected in the spatial variability of its cellular composition."
"Increasing demand for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) places greater emphasis on the efficiency of pathways and services. A significant limitation to increasing TAVI capacity is the availability of cardiac catheterisation laboratory time. We have developed a novel complexity scoring system (TAVI ComplEXity; TEX score) which can aid in planning lists with appropriate case selection. To validate the TEX score, we have undertaken a retrospective analysis of TAVI cases. The hypothesis is that increasing TEX score correlates with increased procedural duration and reduced valve academic research consortium (VARC) 3 technical and device success."
"Frequently, we perceive emotional information through multiple channels (e.g., face, voice, posture). These cues interact, facilitating emotional perception when congruent (similar across channels) compared to incongruent (different). Most previous studies on this congruency effect used stimuli from different sets, compromising their quality. In this context, we created and validated a new static stimulus set (ECIFBSS) featuring 1952 facial and body expressions of basic emotions in congruent and incongruent situations. We photographed 40 actors expressing facial emotions and body postures (anger, disgust, happiness, neutral, fear, surprise, and sadness) in both congruent and incongruent situations. The validation was conducted in two parts. In the first part, 76 participants performed a recognition task on facial and bodily expressions separately. In the second part, 40 participants performed the same recognition task, along with an evaluation of four features: intensity, authenticity, arousal, and valence. All emotions (face and body) were well recognized. Consistent with the literature, facial emotions were recognized better than body postures. Happiness was the most recognized facial emotion, while fear was the least. Among body expressions, anger had the highest recognition, while disgust was the least accurately recognized. Finally, facial and bodily expressions were considered moderately authentic, and the evaluation of intensity, valence, and arousal aligned with the dimensional model. The ECIFBSS offers static stimuli for studying facial and body expressions of basic emotions, providing a new tool to explore integrating emotional information from various channels and their reciprocal influence."
"HIV poses a significant global health concern, affecting adolescents among other populations. This is attributed to various vulnerabilities including biological factors, gender inequalities and limited access to comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services in sub-Saharan Africa. In Tanzania, adolescent girls, and young women (AGYW) face double the risk of HIV infection compared to their male counterparts. The introduction of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in early 2018 brought hope for changing the HIV cascade in the country. However, numerous challenges still hinder PrEP uptake. Therefore, this study explored experiences of PrEP uptake among vulnerable AGYW in Tanzania."
"Percutaneous tumor ablation has become a widely accepted and used treatment option for both soft and hard tissue malignancies. The current standard-of-care techniques for performing these minimally invasive procedures require providers to navigate a needle to their intended target using two-dimensional (2D) US or CT to obtain complete local response. These traditional image-guidance systems require operators to mentally transpose what is visualized on a 2D screen into the inherent three-dimensional (3D) context of human anatomy. Advanced navigation systems designed specifically for percutaneous needle-based procedures often fuse multiple imaging modalities to provide greater awareness and planned needle trajectories for the avoidance of critical structures. However, even many of these advanced systems still require mental transposition of anatomy from a 2D screen to human anatomy. Augmented reality (AR)-based systems have the potential to provide a 3D view of the patient's anatomy, eliminating the need for mental transposition by the operator. The purpose of this article is to review commercially available advanced percutaneous surgical navigation platforms and discuss the current state of AR-based navigation systems, including their potential benefits, challenges for adoption, and future developments."
"Frataxin is an evolutionarily conserved mitochondrial protein responsible for iron homeostasis and metabolism. A deficiency of frataxin (encoded by FXN) leads to Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA), a progressive disorder that affects both the central and peripheral nervous systems, most commonly via a pathogenic GAA trinucleotide expansion. In contrast, pathogenic variants in ALG1 in humans cause a form of congenital disorder of glycosylation. Here, we present a 15-year-old boy with a clinical presentation that raised concern for complex hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), with motor features including progressive spastic paraparesis, cervical dystonia, cerebellar dysfunction, and diminished lower extremity reflexes. The proband was initially found to have a novel compound heterozygous variant in ALG1 on exome sequencing, along with N-glycan profiling revealing evidence of defective mannosylation and Western blot analysis demonstrating an 84% reduction in ALG1 expression. Although several of his clinical features could be explained by the ALG1 variant specifically or considered as part of the presentation of CDGs in general, there were additional phenotypes that suggested an alternative, or additional, genetic diagnosis. Subsequently, he was found to have biallelic pathogenic GAA repeat expansions in FXN on genome sequencing, leading to a diagnosis of FRDA. Given that FRDA explained all his clinical features, the ALG1 variant may have been a hypomorphic form and/or a biochemical phenotype. Our findings underscore the importance of considering FRDA as a differential diagnosis in cases of complex HSP and demonstrate the utility of unbiased genome sequencing approaches that include detection of trinucleotide repeat expansions for progressive motor disorders."
"This review examines the impact of oral retinoids, particularly isotretinoin, on incisional wound healing across surgical specialties. Commonly prescribed for dermatologic conditions, concerns persist regarding oral retinoids' potential adverse effects on wound healing, prompting the widespread practice of discontinuing these medications before surgery. We performed a PubMed search and analyzed research published regarding the use of oral retinoids in a variety of surgical subspecialties: dermatologic, plastic, ophthalmologic, orthopedic, ENT/otologic, and maxillofacial. Contrary to conventional practices, our review challenges the necessity of discontinuing oral retinoids before surgery in many instances based currently available research. Our literature review underscores the need for individualized risk-benefit assessment when deciding whether to hold retinoid therapy prior to surgical intervention as well as the need for more data surrounding systemic retinoids and wound healing interactions. While encouraging a reevaluation of current practices, we advocate for evidence-based decision-making in perioperative care across various surgical specialties in collaboration between dermatologists and surgeons."
"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by limited interests, difficulties in social interactions, repetitive behaviors, and impairments in social communication. ASD tends to run in families, and twin studies suggest a strong genetic basis for the disorder. However, the definition of a genetic profile that indicates a risk for ASD remains unclear."
"This review includes recent literature on adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and perinatal mental health. We summarize key findings, including meta-analytic reviews and emerging data on broad risks for psychopathology, mechanistic pathways, protective factors, and ACEs screening within clinical care contexts."
"The use of synthetic data in pharmacology research has gained significant attention due to its potential to address privacy concerns and promote open science. In this study, we implemented and compared three synthetic data generation methods, CT-GAN, TVAE, and a simplified implementation of Avatar, for a previously published pharmacogenetic dataset of 253 patients with one measurement per patient (non-longitudinal). The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of these methods in terms of data utility and privacy trade off. Our results showed that CT-GAN and Avatar used with k = 10 (number of patients used to create the local model of generation) had the best overall performance in terms of data utility and privacy preservation. However, the TVAE method showed a relatively lower level of performance in these aspects. In terms of Hazard ratio estimation, Avatar with k = 10 produced HR estimates closest to the original data, whereas CT-GAN slightly underestimated the HR and TVAE showed the most significant deviation from the original HR. We also investigated the effect of applying the algorithms multiple times to improve results stability in terms of HR estimation. Our findings suggested that this approach could be beneficial, especially in the case of small datasets, to achieve more reliable and robust results. In conclusion, our study provides valuable insights into the performance of CT-GAN, TVAE, and Avatar methods for synthetic data generation in pharmacogenetic research. The application to other type of data and analyses (data driven) used in pharmacology should be further investigated."
Patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) in the setting of atrial fibrillation (Afib) will need to start/resume anticoagulation (AC) as it is the mainstay for secondary stroke prevention. Several studies have compared the safety and outcomes of starting/resuming AC in early or late start windows (ESW or LSW) but there is no consensus in clinical practice on the optimal timing of anticoagulation. This meta-analysis aims to compare the safety and outcome measures after resuming AC in the ESW versus LSW in patients with Afib after AIS.
"Acute rejection (AR) is a significant complication in liver transplantation, impacting graft function and patient survival. Kupffer cells (KCs), liver-specific macrophages, can polarize into pro-inflammatory M1 or anti-inflammatory M2 phenotypes, both of which critically influence AR outcomes. Angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4), a secretory protein, is recognized for its function in regulating inflammation and macrophage polarization. This study investigates the effects of ANGPTL4 on KC polarization through cellular interactions between hepatocytes (HCs) and KCs. Using a rat orthotopic liver transplantation model, we observed reduced ANGPTL4 expression during AR, whereas increased ANGPTL4 levels were linked to immune tolerance. Administration of ANGPTL4 recombinant protein improved liver function, suppressed inflammation, and promoted M2 polarization of KCs. Co-culture experiments demonstrated that hepatocyte-derived ANGPTL4 significantly modulates KC polarization and inflammatory responses, mainly by inhibiting the NF-κB signaling pathway. The results emphasize the promise of ANGPTL4 as a therapeutic target to reduce AR and improve liver transplant outcomes by influencing hepatocyte-KC interactions."
"Among the cultivated crop species, the economically and culturally important grapevine plays host to the greatest number of distinctly characterized viruses. A critical component of the management and containment of these viral diseases in grapevine is both the identification of infected vines and the characterization of new pathogens. Next-generation high-throughput sequencing technologies, i.e., HTS technologies, have been widely adopted for their ability to quickly, broadly and directly characterize molecular sequences associated with potential pathogens. We empirically analyze the performance of HTS as a diagnostic tool in a phytosanitary context and make recommendations on its deployment for detecting known and novel viruses in grapevine. Three popular and widely used modalities for analyzing HTS data are characterized and compared using the standard diagnostic performance criteria of sensitivity (the true positive rate), specificity (the true negative rate) and analytical sensitivity (dilution series)."
"The physician order for life-sustaining treatment has been implemented in clinical practice for several years. However, the determination that a patient is in the terminal phase of life, a prerequisite for the withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment, lacks objective criteria. This study aimed to evaluate whether hyperlactatemia could serve as a reliable objective indicator for determining the terminal phase."
"XPR1 is the sole protein known to transport inorganic phosphate (Pi) out of cells, a function conserved across species from yeast to mammals. Human XPR1 variants lead to cerebral calcium-phosphate deposition and primary familial brain calcification (PFBC), a hereditary neurodegenerative disorder. Here, we present the cryo-EM structure of human XPR1 in both its Pi-unbound and various Pi-bound states. XPR1 features 10 transmembrane α-helices forming an ion channel-like structure, with multiple Pi recognition sites along the channel. Pathogenic mutations in two arginine residues, which line the translocation channel, disrupt Pi transport. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that Pi ion undergoes a stepwise transition through the sequential recognition sites during the transport process. Together with functional analyses, our results suggest that this sequential arrangement allows XPR1 to facilitate Pi ion passage via a ""relay"" process, and they establish a framework for the interpretation of disease-related mutations and for the development of future therapeutics."
"BACKGROUND Recipient hepatic arteries are generally used for arterial reconstructions in living donor liver transplantation. When the hepatic arteries are not feasible, the right gastroepiploic artery is one of the options for arterial reconstructions. In this study, we evaluate the feasibility of using the right gastroepiploic artery and report the analyzed retrospective patient outcomes. MATERIAL AND METHODS We included 324 patients who underwent primary living donor liver transplantation between August 1997 and December 2023. The rates of complications and surgical outcomes for different arteries used for reconstruction were compared between the groups. RESULTS For primary arterial reconstruction, the right gastroepiploic artery was used in 18 patients. The incidence of arterial complications and biliary strictures was higher than in the remaining 306 patients (P=0.01 and P=0.21, respectively). The 1-year and 5-year graft survival rates were 83.3% and 77.8% in the right gastroepiploic artery group, and 83.7% and 70.1% in the hepatic artery group, respectively (P=0.58). Eleven patients underwent arterial re-reconstruction secondary to arterial complications. The right gastroepiploic artery was used for the first time in 7 of these patients because the hepatic arteries were not reusable. Arterial complications after arterial re-reconstruction occurred in 4 patients (36.4%). CONCLUSIONS Arterial reconstruction using the right gastroepiploic artery was an effective option when the hepatic arteries were not suitable options, as it offered graft outcomes comparable to those of hepatic artery reconstruction, despite an increased risk of arterial and biliary complications."
"Posttraumatic growth (PTG) is of increased theoretical and clinical interest. However, less is known about PTG in older adults specifically. This systematic review aimed to identify domains where PTG is studied for older adults; investigate factors associated with PTG in older adults; consider how these might differ between historical and later life traumas."
"This retrospective observational multicentre cohort study compared the rate of postoperative cystoid macular oedema (CME) between two intraocular lens (IOL) scleral fixation (SFIOL) techniques: a flanged IOL fixation technique (Yamane technique) and a suture IOL transscleral fixation technique (conventional technique). The study included 207 eyes with postoperative CME that had undergone SFIOL and were observed for > 12 weeks between January 2019 and January 2021. The primary endpoint was a comparison of the rate of postoperative CME at 3 months between groups. Secondary endpoints were a comparison of postoperative best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at 3 months between groups and an analysis of characteristics associated with postoperative CME in the Yamane technique group. The Yamane technique group developed postoperative CME in 13.0% of eyes at 3 months, compared with 1.9% in the conventional technique group (odds ratio: 7.99, P = 0.045). Postoperative BCVA was consistently significantly higher in the Yamane technique group. Although many retinal surgeons have performed the Yamane technique because of its convenience for SFIOL, our findings suggest that the Yamane technique carries an increased risk of postoperative CME compared with the conventional suture method. Therefore, careful management of postoperative CME is needed after SFIOL."
"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease with rising prevalence, marked by eczematous lesions, itching, and a weakened skin barrier often tied to filaggrin gene mutations. This breakdown allows allergen and microbe entry, with thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) playing a crucial role by activating immune pathways that amplify the allergic response. TSLP's central role in AD pathogenesis makes it a promising therapeutic target. Consequently, in this study, we used the virtual drug screening, molecular dynamics simulation, and binding free energies calculation approaches to explore the African Natural Product Database against the TSLP protein. The molecular screening identified four compounds with high docking scores, namely SA_0090 (-7.37), EA_0131 (-7.10), NA_0018 (-7.03), and WA_0006 (-6.99 kcal/mol). Furthermore, the KD analysis showed a strong binding affinity of these compounds with TSLP, with values of -5.36, -5.36, -5.34, and -5.32 kcal/mol, respectively. Moreover, the strong binding affinity of these compounds was further validated by molecular dynamic simulation analysis, which revealed that the WA_0006-TSLP is the most stable complex with the lowest average RMSD. However, the total binding free energies were -40.5602, -41.0967, -27.3293, and -51.3496 kcal/mol, respectively, showing the strong interaction between the selected compounds and TSLP. Likewise, these compounds showed excellent pharmacokinetics characteristics. In conclusion, this integrative approach provides a foundation for the development of safe and effective treatments for AD, potentially offering relief to millions of patients worldwide."
"Tea wine has garnered significant attention due to its unique fusion of tea and wine flavors, as well as its alleged health benefits. This study aimed to investigate the effects of various treatments on the physicochemical properties of tea wine, including viable cell counts, pH, acidity, total ester content, tea polyphenol content, and volatile flavoring substances during the storage period. The findings indicated that tea wine subjected to low-temperature plasma (LTPS) treatment exhibited superior quality maintenance and an enhanced tea polyphenol content compared to untreated, UV-treated, and HTHP-treated tea wine. Analysis of volatile compounds revealed that the LTPS group exhibited the highest relative content of alcohols and esters (89.72%) during storage, thereby enhancing the fruity and sweet aroma of the tea wine. This study provides a theoretical basis for the application of low-temperature plasma technology in the storage of tea wine."
"Esophagectomy and lymphadenectomy for esophageal cancer carry an inherent risk of recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) injury. Intraoperative nerve monitoring (IONM) may help prevent RLN damage, though evidence on its effectiveness is still limited. This systematic review and meta-analysis (SRMA) evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of IONM during minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) for esophageal cancer. This SRMA followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines, with a registered protocol on PROSPERO (CRD42022367916). Two independent authors conducted a comprehensive literature search across multiple databases, screening studies on MIE for esophageal cancer using IONM. Case-control studies were included, focusing on the RLN palsy (RLNP) rate as the primary outcome. A total of 11 studies involving 1907 patients (IONM group: 752 patients; non-IONM group: 1155 patients) were included in the SRMA. IONM significantly reduced the incidence of RLNP (OR = 0.47, P < 0.001). Length of hospital stay (LOHS) and lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) rates were significantly reduced with IONM use. No significant differences were observed in anastomotic leak, chylothorax, total number of lymph nodes dissected, operation time, aspiration rates, or intraoperative blood loss. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of IONM for detecting RLN injury were 83.3% and 81%, respectively. IONM during MIE significantly reduces the incidence of RLNP, postoperative LRTI, and shortens the LOHS, without adding operative risks. Further research is needed to evaluate its long-term survival benefits and cost-effectiveness."
"Paraganglioma, a catecholamine-producing tumor originating in extra-adrenal paraganglion cells, is rare in children. Although diagnosis of paraganglioma is based on the presence of catecholamine symptoms, some patients lack such symptoms. Delayed diagnosis is associated with tumor growth and invasion of surrounding vessels. Herein, we report a case of pediatric retroperitoneal paraganglioma invading the inferior vena cava. The tumor was completely resected and the patient has been free of recurrence for 2 years. Our findings suggest that complete resection can help prevent recurrence in cases of invasion of the inferior vena cava."
"Adrenal tumors in children are frequently neoplastic and malignant, and surgical resection is the first management option. Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has proven to be a safe management alternative and is suggested as a preferred alternative approach."
"Spinal manipulation (MAN) and mobilization (MOB) are biomechanically different yet both elicit pain reduction and increased range of motion. Previous investigations have focused on quantifying kinetics (e.g., applied forces) or, recipient kinematics (i.e., movements) during MAN and MOB. While these studies provide valuable information, they do not report on the strategies adopted by providers when performing the complex motor tasks of MAN and MOB. This review sought to synthesise the literature reporting on provider kinematics during the delivery of MAN and MOB."
"Xanthelasma palpebrarum (XP), characterized by soft, yellowish plaque primarily on the eyelids, is often associated with lipid metabolism disorders. XP can cause aesthetic concerns that affect social interactions and requires careful treatment evaluations due to potential complications and associations with systemic conditions. We aimed to assess the efficacy of and recurrence rates with erbium:yttrium aluminum garnet (Er:YAG) laser therapy in the treatment of XP. This was a retrospective review involving 214 patients treated with a 2,940 nm Er:YAG laser for XP from January 2021 to June 2023. Treatment efficacy was evaluated using standardized photography and the Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS), with follow-up assessments noting any complications or recurrence. The 214 patients with 457 lesions exhibited a complete removal of lesions post-treatment. Complications were minimal, with hypertrophic scarring occurring in 1.5% of patients and a recurrence rate of 10.5%. Patients with multiple lesions had a higher recurrence rate compared with those with single lesions. Based on VSS evaluation, 66.8% of patients (n = 143) were categorized as having excellent outcomes, while 29.0% (n = 62) were classified as having good outcomes. Er:YAG laser therapy has proven to be an effective and safe treatment modality for XP, accurately and safely removing lesions with minimal recurrence rates. It can achieve complete lesion removal, with recurrence at the treated site being very low. Additionally, Er:YAG laser treatment offers several advantages over surgical methods, making it a promising candidate to become the first-line treatment of choice for XP."
"Severe asthma is a heterogeneous disease with subtype classification according to dominant airway infiltrates, including eosinophilic (Type 2 high), or non-eosinophilic asthma. Non-eosinophilic asthma is further divided into paucigranulocytic or neutrophilic asthma characterized by elevated neutrophils, and mixed Type 1 and Type 17 cytokines in the airways. Severe non-eosinophilic asthma has few effective treatments and many patients do not qualify for biologic therapies. The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is dysregulated in multiple respiratory diseases including cystic fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and has proven a valuable therapeutic target. We hypothesized that the CFTR may also play a role in non-eosinophilic asthma."
"Monitoring fibrosis in patients with chronic liver disease (CLD) is an important management strategy. We have already reported a novel stacked microvascular imaging (SMVI) technique and an examiner scoring evaluation method to improve fibrosis assessment accuracy and demonstrate its high sensitivity. In the present study, we analyzed the effectiveness and objectivity of SMVI in diagnosing the liver fibrosis stage based on artificial intelligence (AI)."
"Photon (X-ray) radiotherapy is the most common treatment used in cancer therapy. However, the exposure of normal tissues and organs at risk to ionising radiation often results in a significant incidence of low-grade adverse side effects, whilst high-grade toxicities also occur at concerningly high rates. As an alternative, boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) aims to create densely ionising helium and lithium ions directly within cancer cells, thus sparing the surrounding normal cells and tissues but also leading to significantly more effective tumour control than X-rays. Although very promising for patients with recurring and highly invasive tumours, BNCT does not currently have widespread use worldwide, in part due to limited and reliable neutron sources for clinical use. Another limitation is devising strategies leading to the selective and optimal accumulation of boron within the cancer cells. Boronophenylalanine (BPA) is currently the major compound used in BNCT which takes advantage of the amino acid transporter LAT1 that is overexpressed in a number of human cancers. Additionally, there is a lack of in-depth knowledge regarding the impact of BNCT on cellular DNA, and the molecular mechanisms that are responsive to the treatment, which are important in developing optimal therapeutic strategies using BNCT, are unclear. In this review, we highlight the current knowledge of the radiobiology of BNCT acquired from in vitro and in vivo studies, particularly in the context of DNA damage and repair, but also present evidence of established and new boron-containing compounds aimed at enhancing the specificity and effectiveness of the treatment."
"Human dentin performs its function throughout life, even though it is not remodeled like bone. Therefore, dentin must have extreme durability against daily repetitive loading. Elucidating its durability requires a comprehensive understanding of its shape, structure, and anisotropy at various levels of its structure. However, few studies have examined the nanostructure of dentin as a whole and not much is known about its age-related changes. Our aim is to characterize the mineral particle characteristics of human dentin and age-related changes using synchrotron scanning small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering. 30 molar and premolar teeth extracted from 16 to 77-year-old individuals for orthodontic or periodontal reasons were used. Synchrotron-based X-ray scattering was employed to acquire two-dimensional maps of nanostructural features. These maps revealed a negative gradient of particle size toward the pulp chamber. The preferential orientation of particles was position-dependent, with a higher orientation in the area from the pulp horn to the cusp tip and root region. These patterns were maintained in different tooth types. The mineral particle thickness of the inner crown increased significantly with age. This increase could relate to the filling of tubules and, therefore, likely contribute to the deterioration of the mechanical performance of teeth with age."
"Limited evidence suggests that autoimmune diseases are associated with an increased risk of cervical artery dissection (CeAD). We hypothesized individuals with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) would have an increased risk of CeAD following SLE diagnosis compared to matched non-lupus controls. We queried a de-identified United States electronic medical records network (TriNetX, Inc.) for individuals aged 10 and older from 2012 to 2020, for two cohorts: (1) SLE and (2) non-lupus controls, excluding those with prior CeAD. We used propensity matching to control for confounding variables and calculated the risk ratio (RR) for CeAD occurring over four years' follow-up, secondarily exploring cumulative incidence. After matching, both cohorts contained 77,008 patients, who were mostly female (89%). The incidence and risk of CeAD was significantly greater among those with SLE compared to matched non-lupus controls [95% CI] (0.08% vs. 0.04%; RR = 2.33 [1.49;3.66]; P < 0.0001). These findings support the hypothesis that SLE is a risk factor for CeAD. Additional research is needed to identify the mechanisms that may underly the SLE-CeAD association and examine the potential association between other autoimmune diseases and CeAD."
"Leptospirosis is a spirochetal disease caused by Leptospira spp. bacteria with global distribution affecting multiple mammalian species, including humans. The disease is endemic in many geographic areas and is of particular concern in tropical regions with abundant rainfall, such as the Caribbean. Currently, there are no published reports on Leptospira exposure or infection in Grenadian cat populations, and the role of cats in the epidemiology of the disease is unknown. Our hypothesis is that Grenadian cat population may be a reservoir host for zoonotic Leptospira on the island. During 2019-2021, 160 feral cats were captured from three parishes in Grenada, and their urine and blood were tested for Leptospira. Urine from 4 of 148 (2.7%) cat samples tested PCR-positive for Leptospira. Serum from 6 of 136 (4.4%) cat samples tested PCR-positive for Leptospira. Sequence analysis of the Leptospira rpoB gene showed 86-100% similarity to known or presumed pathogenic Leptospira species. The findings of this study suggest that Grenadian cat populations are infected with and are shedding Leptospira genotypes that are phylogenetically related to known pathogenic Leptospira, including known zoonotic strains. These observations support the hypothesis that Grenadian cat populations may be a reservoir host for zoonotic Leptospira on the Island."

"Neurodegenerative tauopathies may progress based on seeding by pathological tau assemblies, whereby an aggregate is released from one cell, gains entry to an adjacent or connected cell, and serves as a specific template for its own replication in the cytoplasm. Seeding into the complex cytoplasmic milieu happens within hours, implying the existence of unknown factors that regulate this process."

"Symbioses are major drivers of organismal diversification and phenotypic innovation. However, how long-term symbioses shape whole genome evolution in metazoans is still underexplored. Here, we use a giant clam (Tridacna maxima) genome to demonstrate how symbiosis has left complex signatures in an animal's genome. Giant clams thrive in oligotrophic waters by forming a remarkable association with photosymbiotic dinoflagellate algae. Genome-based demographic inferences uncover a tight correlation between T. maxima global population change and major paleoclimate and habitat shifts, revealing how abiotic and biotic factors may dictate T. maxima microevolution. Comparative analyses reveal genomic features that may be symbiosis-driven, including expansion and contraction of immunity-related gene families and a large proportion of lineage-specific genes. Strikingly, about 70% of the genome is composed of repetitive elements, especially transposable elements, most likely resulting from a symbiosis-adapted immune system. This work greatly enhances our understanding of genomic drivers of symbiosis that underlie metazoan evolution and diversification."
"Protozoan parasites such as Eimeria tenella and Toxoplasma gondii pose significant health challenges in livestock and humans. The limited treatment options and rising drug resistance underscore the urgent need for new therapies. This study investigates myrcene, a monoterpene hydrocarbon classified for its antiprotozoal potential against E. tenella and T. gondii infections. Initially, we examined its effect on the sporulation process of E. tenella oocysts in vitro and its anti-E. tenella activity in vivo. Myrcene significantly reduced the sporulation rate of E. tenella oocysts at 3 and 4 mg/kg. In vivo experiments demonstrated that treatment with 4 mg/kg myrcene significantly reduced E. tenella load and oocyst output, as well as cecal lesion and weight loss caused by E. tenella infection, showing moderate anti-E. tenella activity, with an Anticoccidial Index (ACI) of 161.4. Furthermore, we investigated the anti-T. gondii activity of myrcene both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro studies showed that treatment with myrcene effectively inhibited the invasion rate and intracellular proliferation ability of T. gondii tachyzoite in DF-1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. In vivo administration prolonged the survival time in T. gondii-infected mice, suggesting notable protective effects. Additionally, it mitigated T. gondii-induced hepatosplenic toxicity by reducing parasite load in the liver and spleen, and ameliorating liver function as evidenced by decreased serum transaminase levels. In conclusion, the findings demonstrate promising anti-E. tenella and anti-T. gondii activity exhibited by myrcene warranting further exploration into its mechanisms and potential therapeutic applications."

"Central nervous system infections (CNS) are life-threatening infections in children, requiring urgent intervention and rapid diagnosis. In this study, we aimed to investigate the efficacy of syndromic tests in diagnosing CNS infections and the distribution of viral pathogens in pediatric patients. A total of 145 pediatric patients with a prediagnosis of CNS infection based on clinical findings by a pediatric infectious disease specialist were included in the study. Microscopic examination, biochemical tests, bacteriologic culture, and syndromic test (BioFire® FilmArray® Meningitis/Encephalitis Panel) were performed on cerebrospinal fluid samples obtained from the patients. Nearly half (44.8%) of the patients were younger than one year of age, the median age was 12 months (6-60 months), and the male-to-female ratio was 1.7, with 92 male and 53 female patients. Viral pathogens were observed in most of the 29 (18.8%) patients with syndromic test positivity (n= 23, 79.4%), while bacterial pathogens were detected in 20.6% (n= 6). No fungal pathogens were detected. Bacterial pathogens were Streptococcus pneumoniae [3.4% (5/145)] and Neisseria meningitidis [0.7% (1/145)]. Viruses were enterovirus [6.9% (10/145)], human herpesvirus-6 [5.5% (8/145)], herpes simplex virus type 1 [1.4% (2/145)], cytomegalovirus [0.7% (1/145)], human parechovirus [0.7% (1/145)], varicella zoster virus [0.7% (1/145)]. The main finding in cases with positive syndromic test was fever (n= 19, 65.5%), followed by vomiting (n= 15, 51.7%), convulsion (n= 14, 48.3%) and rash (n= 6, 20.6%). For turnaround time the median was 111 minutes and the mean was 119 minutes. Despite the lack of a performance study including sensitivity and specificity for syndromic testing or alternative tests for viral etiology, our study demonstrates the benefits of syndromic testing in children with presumed CNS infections, such as shortening the diagnostic period and guiding empirical treatment. It also constitutes an affirmative example of laboratory and clinical collaboration."
The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of quantitatively assessed bone SPECT/CT parameters for predicting the success of conservative treatment for symptomatic basal joint arthritis of the thumb.

"Canada, as one of the largest oil and gas producer in the world, is responsible for large emissions of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas. At low levels, methane is not a direct threat to human health; however, human health is affected by exposure to pollutants co-emitted with methane. The objectives of this research were to estimate and map pollutants emitted by the oil and gas industry, to assess the demographic of the population exposed to oil and gas activities, and to characterize the impact of well density on cardiovascular- and respiratory-related outcomes with a focus on Alberta. We estimated that ~13% and 3% people in Alberta reside, respectively, within 1.5 km of an active well and 1.5 km of a flare. Our analysis suggests that racial and socioeconomic disparities exist in residential proximity to active wells, with people of Aboriginal identity and people with less education being more exposed to active wells than the general population. We found increased odds of cardiovascular-related (1.13-1.29 for low active well density) and respiratory-related (1.07-1.19 for low active well density) outcomes with exposure to wells. Close to 100 countries produce oil and gas, making this a global issue. There is an important need for additional studies from other producing jurisdictions outside the United States."
This study aimed to present clinical and immunological features in patients with neuroimmune complications of COVID-19 during Omicron wave in China.
"One factor considered essential to successful implementation is organizational readiness. The purpose of this study was to explore ways to improve the measurement of organizational readiness, and in particular to refine a preliminary measure based on the Readiness = Motivation x innovation Specific Capacity x General Capacity (R = MC2) heuristic. We assessed the experiences of staff in Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHC) implementing evidence-based interventions (EBIs) designed to increase colorectal cancer screening (CRCS) who previously completed the survey and aimed to understand their perspectives on why our data were positively skewed."
"Recombinant human thrombopoietin (rhTPO) is commonly used to improve low platelet status in immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), as one protein product, even with a very low rate, there is still the possibility to produce neutralizing antibodies of thrombopoietin (TPO). We described a 7-year-old boy with ITP and normal TPO levels who had previously received rhTPO for 2 weeks but showed persistent thrombocytopenia and was misdiagnosed as acquired amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia (AATP) and ineffectively treated with cyclosporine A (CsA) in combination with avatrombopag (AVA). As suspicious the TPO neutralizing antibody development as re-test of TPO level is 0, the CD20 + deletion antibody drug rituximab (RTX) was prescribed and received efficacy. rhTPO serves as one bio-protein drug and should be cautious with developing neutralizing antibodies if the drug effect is lost. The tests for antibody and/or TPO level should be done for the diagnosis, and the antibody eradication medication as an anti-CD20 antibody, RTX, should be prescribed to delete thes e neutralizing antibodies to recover the TPO level to reattain the response of ITP treatment."
"This study was conducted to determine the effect of the sound of running water, which we had not previously encountered being used in dialysis patients, on invasive pain and anxiety experienced during cannulation."
"Rapid morphological change is emerging as a consequence of climate change in many systems. It is intuitive to hypothesize that temporal morphological trends are driven by the same selective pressures that have established well-known ecogeographic patterns over spatial environmental gradients (e.g., Bergman's and Allen's rules). However, mechanistic understanding of contemporary morphological shifts is lacking."
"Alkaline stress can induce significant injury to plants, resulting in a range of negative effects, including ion toxicity, oxidative stress, and damage from high pH values. These stress factors can substantially affect normal plant growth and development, as well as yield and quality loss. To counteract alkaline stress, plants have developed a range of defense strategies, enabling them to adapt and thrive in challenging environments. These defense mechanisms operate at multiple levels such as morphological, physiological, biochemical, and molecular. The continuous advancement of genetic engineering has enabled significant breakthroughs in enhancing plant alkali resistance through human intervention. This research provides a scientific basis for crop production and ecological environment construction, and also promotes the effective development and utilization of saline-alkali lands, improving the sustainability of agricultural production."
"Comparative studies across multiple species provide valuable insights into the evolutionary diversification of developmental strategies. While the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has long been the primary insect model organism for understanding molecular genetics and embryonic development, the Mediterranean fruit fly Ceratitis capitata, also known as medfly, presents a promising complementary model for studying developmental biology. With its sequenced genome and a diverse array of molecular techniques, the medfly is well-equipped for study. However, an integrative framework for studying its embryogenesis is currently lacking. In this study, we present a two-level staging system for the medfly based on nine datasets recorded using light sheet fluorescence microscopy. The upper level features of six consecutive embryogenetic events, facilitating comparisons between insect orders, while the lower level consists of seventeen stages, adapted from the fruit fly, allowing for comparisons within the Diptera. We provide detailed descriptions of all identifiable characteristics in multiple formats, including a detailed timetable, comprehensively illustrated figures for all embryogenetic events, glossary-like tables for selected structures and processes, as well as a stage-based quick lookup chart. One remarkable difference between the fruit fly and the medfly is that in the latter, the amnioserosa differentiates and unfolds already during gastrulation. Our staging system, which is based on systematically acquired fluorescence live imaging data, provides standard deviations for each developmental time point and serves as a template for future studies seeking to establish an integrative morphogenic framework for other emerging model insect species."
"Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are a promising class of epigenetic modulators in cancer therapy. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of recent synthetic strategies and clinical applications of key HDAC inhibitors for oncology. HDACs play a critical role in modulating chromatin structure and gene expression by removing acetyl groups from histone proteins, leading to transcriptional repression of tumor suppressor genes. By inhibiting HDAC activity, HDAC inhibitors restore normal acetylation patterns, reactivating silenced tumor suppressor genes and inducing cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and autophagy in cancer cells. The review explores synthetic approaches to developing representative HDAC inhibitors that have been approved or in various clinical trials. Through an integrated perspective on the synthesis, mechanism of action, and clinical advancements of HDAC inhibitors, this review aims to guide future research toward next-generation HDAC inhibitors that could enhance cancer treatment efficacy while minimizing toxicity, offering insights for chemists and clinicians in the field of oncology."

"Oral microenvironmental disorders are associated with an increased risk of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) technology enables the detection of substances that are visually indistinguishable to the human eye, providing a noninvasive approach with extensive applications in medical diagnostics."
"There is a growing tendency in global discourse to describe a health issue as a security issue. But why is this health security language and framing necessary during times of crisis? Why is the term ""health security"" used when perhaps simply saying ""public health"" would do? As reference to 'health security' grows in contemporary discourse, research, advocacy, and policymaking, its prominence is perhaps most consequential in public health. Existing power dynamics in global health are produced and maintained through political processes. Securitisation of health, which facilitates urgent and exceptional measures in response to an event, is a politically charged process with the tendency to further marginalise already marginalised individuals, groups, and nations. By exploring the ethical and practical consequences of a powerful actor's move to securitise health, the essay highlights the importance of considering the perspectives and well-being of marginalised individuals, groups and nations who may be impacted by the move. The essay challenges the assumption that securitising health or framing health as a security issue necessarily leads to good outcomes. It highlights the historical roots and explores the contemporary implications of ""health security"", and invites critically informed discourse on its use within global health."
"Post-stroke cognitive impairment is a common consequence of stroke, characterized by deficits in language, cognitive functioning, functional abilities. Innovative technological approaches, such as computerized cognitive retraining, offer promising strategies for mitigating the cognitive challenges. Despite their potential, the impact of these interventions on neuropsychological function and daily living capabilities has poor outcomes. In this randomized controlled trial (RCT), we assessed the effectiveness of a 4-week, remotely-delivered, multi-domain, computer-adaptive cognitive retraining (CACT) program in patients with post-cognitive cognitive impairment. Fifty male participants were randomly assigned to either the experimental group, which underwent the CACT program tailored to individual performance levels, or an active control group that received standard care. The evaluation focused on neuropsychological functions such as attention, memory, and executive processes, alongside daily living skills. Results indicated that participants in the CACT group exhibited notable improvements in several cognitive areas, including processing speed, category fluency, and visual confrontation naming, when compared to the control group. Nonetheless, enhancements in functional abilities, encompassing basic and instrumental activities of daily living (ADL), were minimal, with no significant changes reported post-intervention. This study demonstrates that CACT effectively improves cognitive functions in patients with post-stroke cognitive impairment during the spontaneous recovery period, suggesting that training patients at their optimal performance levels can lead to meaningful cognitive benefits. These findings are specific to patients recovering from stroke-induced cognitive deficits and highlight the need for further research to generalize these results to other populations with vascular cognitive impairment."
"Autophagy is a catabolic process involved in different cellular functions. However, the molecular pathways governing its potential roles in different cell types remain poorly understood. We investigated the role of autophagy in the context of proteotoxic stress in two central nervous system cell types: the microglia-like cell line BV2 and the neuronal-like cell line N2a. Proteotoxic stress, induced by proteasome inhibition, produced early apoptosis in BV2 cells, due in part to a predominant activation of the PERK-CHOP pathway. In contrast, N2a cells showcased greater resistance and robust induction of the IRE1α-sXbp1 arm of the UPR. We also demonstrated that proteotoxic stress activated autophagy in both cell lines but with different kinetics and cellular functions. In N2a cells, autophagy restored cellular proteostasis, while in BV2 cells, it participated in regulating phagocytosis. Finally, proteotoxic stress predominantly activated the mTORC2-AKT-FOXO1-β-catenin pathway in BV2 cells, while N2a cells preferentially induced the PDK1-AKT-FOXO3 axis. Collectively, our findings suggest that proteotoxic stress triggers cell-specific responses in microglia and neurons, with different physiological outcomes."
"Edible fungal fruiting bodies develop from mycelia that experienced physiological knotting, establishing a tight nutrient connection between mycelia and fruiting bodies. Despite this connection, limited research has explored this field. This study aimed to elucidate the crude polysaccharide and protein contents in mycelia and fruiting bodies of 5 main edible fungi cultivars: Flammulina velutipes, Hypsizygus marmoreus, Lyophyllum decastes etc., under defined nutrient conditions. H. marmoreus was selected as an example, the study investigated nutrient relationships in both mycelia and fruiting bodies across 5 media with varying carbon to nitrogen ratios (C/N). Results indicated higher crude polysaccharide and protein contents in mycelia compared to fruiting bodies. A predictive model for the crude polysaccharide and protein contents of H. marmoreus fruiting bodies was developed using partial least squares (PLS) method. Predicted values closely matched experimental determinations, providing the model's accuracy. The impact of different C/N on crude fiber content in the culture media was minimal. Metabolomics analysis of H. marmoreus revealed significant up-regulation of carbohydrate metabolites (72 %) and amino acid metabolites (84 %) in mycelia relative to fruiting bodies. Specifically, metabolites involved in polysaccharide precursor synthesis pathways (Gal1P, Glc-1P, UDP-Glc) and protein precursor synthesis pathways (9 amino acids) showed heightened levels in mycelia, which suggested a possible reason for the observed higher crude polysaccharide and protein content in mycelia compared to fruiting bodies. Overall, these results provide a crucial theoretical foundation for predicting and enhancing edible fungal quality and diversity through mycelial studies. They also establish a cornerstone for accelerating new variety development and optimizing high-quality mushroom production formulations."
"Analysis of exome data from the latest release of the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD v.4.1.0) revealed a significant carrier burden of pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants in genes associated with autosomal-recessive conditions across diverse ancestral populations. Carrier screening panels are routinely offered to reproductive partners to inform their risk of having an affected child. Current guidelines from the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) recommend screening for genes with a carrier frequency of at least 1/200 and associated with moderate/severe conditions. Here, we systematically analyzed >700,000 gnomAD v.4.1.0 exomes spanning eight ancestries to estimate the carrier frequency of P/LP variants in 2,987 genes associated with autosomal-recessive conditions. After expert curation for clinical severity, we identified 286 genes meeting the criteria for carrier screening. The number of genes exceeding the 1/200 threshold varied across populations, with 40 in the South Asian ancestry and up to 119 in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. Simulations showed that pan-ethnic screening panels offer advantages for individuals of diverse or admixed ancestry, while ancestry-specific panels may be preferable for genetically homogeneous populations. This study leveraged the most comprehensive genomic dataset to date to provide an updated candidate gene list for equitable carrier screening across diverse populations. Our findings highlight the need for continued expansion of genomic resources to better understand rare disease risk and inform screening efforts in underrepresented groups."
"The absence of a biological parent from a child's existence had a negative impact on the child's growth, socialization, psychological wellbeing, and economic productivity. Developing nations like Ethiopia experience a huge number of orphans and family-unbounded children. But the exact figure has not been reported yet at the national level recently. Thus, this study aimed to assess the magnitudes and determinants of children living with non-biologic parents in Ethiopia."
The aim of the study was to assess the clinical features of women infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) using Holter monitoring.
"The metabolic genetics clinic is a crucial hub for the management of patients with inborn errors of metabolism and other complex genetic conditions. Because more patients are being identified due to the expanded diagnostics, including newborn screening, and living longer with the advent of improved therapies, the multidisciplinary metabolic genetics team has been challenged in growing proportionally to meet patients' needs. Insufficient rates of recruitment to the field and increased levels of attrition have led to concerns about a rising shortage of metabolic genetics health care providers and necessitate creative solutions to grow the workforce. Here, we describe the roles and responsibilities of the multidisciplinary metabolic genetics team and describe opportunities to support patient care and promote clinician work-life balance in a rapidly changing field."

"Distal radioulnar joint instability is commonly seen after surgical fixation of a distal radial fracture, and surgeons' ability to reliably determine stability on examination is poor. Debate remains regarding whether to fix the ulnar styloid or reinsert the triangular fibrocartilaginous complex. Four surgeons with Level 5 expertise were asked to respond to questions surrounding this debate."
"Evaluating classifications is crucial in statistics and machine learning, as it influences decision-making across various fields, such as patient prognosis and therapy in critical conditions. The Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), also known as the phi coefficient, is recognized as a performance metric with high reliability, offering a balanced measurement even in the presence of class imbalances. Despite its importance, there remains a notable lack of comprehensive research on the statistical inference of MCC. This deficiency often leads to studies merely validating and comparing MCC point estimates-a practice that, while common, overlooks the statistical significance and reliability of results. Addressing this research gap, our paper introduces and evaluates several methods to construct asymptotic confidence intervals for the single MCC and the differences between MCCs in paired designs. Through simulations across various scenarios, we evaluate the finite-sample behavior of these methods and compare their performances. Furthermore, through real data analysis, we illustrate the potential utility of our findings in comparing binary classifiers, highlighting the possible contributions of our research in this field."
"WHAT IS KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT?: Taking care of an autistic child at home can be tough for parents. They struggle to balance caring for their child and other tasks. This can affect their emotional well-being and cause guilt and other psychological problems. WHAT DOES THE PAPER ADD TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing with finger movements can reduce guilt in parents of autistic children. Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing with Elite mobile health software movements can reduce guilt in parents of autistic children. The bilateral eye stimulation method using finger movements has a more sustained impact than the Elite app's bilateral stimulation method. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: Healthcare providers are encouraged to learn Eye Movements Desensitization and Reprocessing. Healthcare providers are encouraged to use these methods to help with psychological issues in children with autism. Psychiatric nurses are encouraged to utilize this treatment approach for parents of children with autism, as well as to help alleviate feelings of guilt more broadly."
"Phototherapy is a low-risk alternative to traditional antibiotics against drug-resistant bacterial infections. However, optimizing phototherapy agents, refining treatment conditions, and addressing misuse of agents, remain a formidable challenge. This study introduces a novel concept leveraging the unique customizability of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) to house size-matched dye molecules in ""single rooms"". The mesoporous iron(III) carboxylate nanoMOF, MIL-100(Fe), and the hydrophobic heptamethine cyanine photothermal dye (Cy7), IR775, are selected as model systems. Their combination is predicted to minimize dye-dye interactions, leading to exceptional photostability and efficient light-to-heat conversion. Furthermore, MIL-100(Fe) preserves the antimicrobial nature of hydrophobic IR775, enabling it to disrupt bacterial cell envelopes. Through electrospinning, MIL-100(Fe)@IR775 nanoparticles are shaped into a gelatin-based film dressing for the treatment of skin wounds infected by Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Activation of the dressing requires only a portable near-infrared light-emitting diode (NIR LED) and induces both low-dose photodynamic therapy (LPDT) and mild-temperature photothermal therapy (MPTT). Combined with the antimicrobial properties of IR775 and ferroptosis-like lipid peroxidation induced by MIL-100(Fe), the photoactive dressing eradicates MRSA and the healing is as quick as the uninfected wounds. This safe, cost-effective, and multifunctional therapeutic wound dressing offers a promising solution to overcome the current bottleneck in phototherapy."
"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication in hospitalized older patients, associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and health care costs. Major adverse kidney events within 30 days (MAKE30), a composite of death, new renal replacement therapy, or persistent renal dysfunction, has been recommended as a patient-centered endpoint for clinical trials involving AKI."
"The COVID-19 pandemic has unevenly affected regions, countries, and ethnic-racial segments. Socioenvironmental factors were associated with worse disease evolution, with a greater likelihood of mortality in vulnerable people. This study aimed to investigate the association between the proportion of vulnerable populations (Black, brown, and Indigenous people) and mortality from COVID-19 in Brazil from March 2020 to February 2021. Mortality rate ratios and respective 95% Confidence Intervals (95%CI) were estimated using negative binomial regression models. Statistically significant associations were found between the proportion of these populations and mortality rates, emphasizing Blacks in the first four-month period, mixed race in the second four-month period, and Indigenous people in the third four-month period, in which an increase of 54%, 16% and 27% in mortality rates was observed, respectively, for every 10% increase in the proportion of these populations. We highlight the existence of ethnic-racial inequalities in COVID-19 mortality in Brazil and that efforts must be made to mitigate health inequalities, an expression of the perpetuated structural racism and social exclusion of historically vulnerable groups."

Ferritin level and erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) responsiveness are each associated with hemodialysis patient survival. We assessed interrelationships between these two vs. survival.
"Observational studies have shown that the risk of developing herpes zoster (HZ) increases with the use of statins. However, there are many confounding factors in observational studies. Therefore, our Mendelian randomization (MR) study aimed to explore the causal role of lipids in HZ and to assess the causal impact of lipid-lowering drug targets on HZ risk. Our study used low-density lipoprotein (LDL) as a biomarker, and MR analysis was applied to study the effects of genetic inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase (HMGCR, targeted by statins), Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1, targeted by ezetimibe), and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9, targeted by, e.g., alirocumab) on the risk of HZ. Second, we analyzed the overall effect of different lipid traits, including LDL, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides (TGs), on the HZ. Finally, we analyzed the causal association between cardiovascular disease (CVD) and HZ. The primary MR analysis employed the inverse variance weighted (IVW) approach, which MR supplemented‒Egger, weighted median and weighted mode methods. In addition, we performed sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of the results and the presence of bias. Heterogeneity and pleiotropy analyses were performed to ensure the accuracy of the results. Genetically modified HMGCR inhibition was significantly associated with an increased risk of HZ (OR: 2.02, per standard deviation reduction in LDL; 95% CI 1.05-3.90; P = 0.035, P(BH) = 0.0525 < 0.1). Moreover, genetically proxied PCSK9 inhibition was associated with a reduced risk of HZ (OR: 0.58, per standard deviation reduction in LDL; 95% CI 0.42-0.80; P = 0.001, P(BH) = 0.003 < 0.1). Sensitivity analysis did not provide statistical evidence of bias from pleiotropy or genetic confounding. No robust association was found for NPC1L1 inhibition. No significant effect of lipid traits or CVD on HZ risk was found. Our findings did not support dyslipidemia and CVD as causal factors for HZ. Among the three lipid-lowering drug targets, HMGCR inhibition (targeted by statins) was associated with an increased risk of HZ, and PCSK9 is a promising candidate drug target in HZ. These findings have important implications for understanding the pathogenesis of HZ and for the development of new therapeutic strategies."
We investigated the effects of resveratrol (Res) and MCC950 on the pyroptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and the potential pathway.
"Temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) were linked to poor sleep on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), whereas polysomnography revealed no major sleep disturbances, implying sleep state misperception. This study investigates sleep state misperception in TMD and control participants; correlates sleep state misperception with objective short sleep duration (SSD), depression symptoms, daytime sleepiness, and orofacial pain; and compares objective SSD between the groups."
"In this study, a lytic phage, named PG216, was obtained from seawater collected in Qingdao, using Vibrio parahaemolyticus strain G299 as its host. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that phage PG216 has an icosahedral head with a diameter of 100 ± 6.7 nm and a contractible tail with a length of 126 ± 6.7 nm. The spot assay and EOP assay for host range testing revealed that the phage displayed extensive lytic activity against five Vibrio species: V. alginolyticus, V. parahaemolyticus, V. vulnificus, V. mimicus, and V. harveyi. The one-step growth curve indicated that the phage has a latent period of 25 min, a lysis duration of 115 min, and an average burst size of 135 ± 02 PFU/cell. The genome of PG216 is 244,027 bp in length with a GC content of 42.89%, and itcontains383 ORFs and encodes 28 tRNAs. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that PG216 belongs to the genus Schizotequatrovirus within the family Straboviridae. Phage PG216 was found to be able to eradicate mature biofilms produced by V. parahaemolyticus G299. Phage PG216 demonstrates notable lytic activity while lacking virulence and antibiotic-resistance genes and therefore might be a viable candidate for use in phage therapy of vibriosis."
"Technologies, both simple and sophisticated, have always played a major role in the negotiation of a range of disabilities that are assumed to impede the expression of autonomous selfhood. Whether deployed as mechanical aides to ideally normalise physical differences, as organic-and often internal-supplements to bolster the performance of body and mind, or as digital enhancements that override the supposed shortcomings of neurodiversity, the widely accepted claim is that such technologies have a clear therapeutic value. It conjures the illusion of an unproblematised sequence of more complex technologies leading to increasingly enhanced function and the advent of superior selfhood. Those who identify as having disabilities, either physical or cognitive, are assured of a better future in which anomalies are sufficiently offset to the extent that they no longer attract disvalue.My paper offers a less conventional perspective that leaves behind the desire for individual autonomy and opens up the question of the transhuman and the posthuman. Rather than focusing on the bounded self at the centre of humanist thought, I ask what is at stake when human embodiment becomes intricately entangled with non-human materialities and digital coding. It is likely that the major developments in such 'prosthetic' technologies will strongly impact the field of disability. Beyond a merely functional usage, which is likely to dominate in the short term, urgent questions arise about the extent to which the category of the human can or should be sustained as the anchor of continuing life. In exploring the practical, philosophical and bioethical implications of newly emerging technologies, I distinguish between the motivation of transhumanism, which focuses on self-perfectibility and mastery, and a posthumanism that in seeking to radically decentre the very notion of human privilege and hierarchical distinctions offers an optimistic view of disability futures."
"In regions with a high prevalence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections, coinfected patients face a heightened risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), termed HBV/HCV-related HCC (HBCV-HCC). We aimed to investigate the contribution of preexisting chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and subsequent chronic hepatitis C (CHC) to the development of HBCV-HCC."

"Hepatitis D virus (HDV) prevalence data and country-specific HDV guidelines are not widely available in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states. We developed consensus recommendations to guide healthcare professionals, policymakers, and researchers in improving HDV management and patient health outcomes in three GCC states: Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. A consensus panel comprising hepatology experts (n = 6) from the three GCC societies was formed. The panel identified two broader areas related to clinical practice (screening and diagnosis, and treatment and management), addressed critical questions, and developed draft recommendations in February 2024. The strength of the final set of recommendations was subjected to consensus voting in March 2024. A majority was defined apriori with a two-thirds vote (67%). The paper outlines those recommendations alongside showcasing the current epidemiology of HDV in the GCC states, emphasizing the variability in prevalence, demographic patterns, and region-specific risk factors. It also highlights the current state of screening and diagnosis practices, identifying key obstacles, such as access to advanced screening protocols and diagnostic tools. Furthermore, HDV treatment landscape and preventative strategies are outlined, focusing on vaccination, public health initiatives, and the crucial role of public awareness and education. Ethical and sociocultural considerations are discussed, underscoring the importance of culturally sensitive healthcare practices. These recommendations present a comprehensive overview of the challenges and strategies for managing HDV in these states. Policy recommendations are provided to support HDV management, including standardizing care protocols and promoting public health measures."
"Insomnia is a common and challenging complaint in older adults (> 65 years) because of age-related alterations in sleep physiology. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia is the gold standard for treatment of insomnia in young as well as older patients. Both clinicians and patients often prefer the simplicity of medication, but risks associated with some hypnotics increase with age. Pharmacologic options for older adults include low-dose doxepin, melatonin, ramelteon, and the dual orexin receptor antagonists. A well-informed clinician can help patients navigate the risks and benefits of both pharmacologic and behavioral options."
"Suicidal ideation and behavior and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) among Black emerging adults is a major public health concern. Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a significant risk factor for suicidal ideation and behavior and NSSI, but there is little work examining the buffering effect of psychological well-being (PWB). The purpose of this study was to examine the associations between IPV, suicide ideation and behavior, and NSSI, and the moderating role of PWB on these associations."
"Enhancing the performance of 5ph-IPMSM control plays a crucial role in advancing various innovative applications such as electric vehicles. This paper proposes a new reinforcement learning (RL) control algorithm based twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) algorithm to tune two cascaded PI controllers in a five-phase interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (5ph-IPMSM) drive system based model predictive control (MPC). The main purpose of the control methodology is to optimize the 5ph-IPMSM speed response either in constant torque region or constant power region. The speed responses obtained using RL control algorithm are compared with those obtained using four of the most recent metaheuristic optimization techniques (MHOT) which are Transit Search (TS), Honey Badger Algorithm (HBA), Dwarf Mongoose (DM), and Dandelion-Optimizer (DO) optimization techniques. The speed response are compared in terms of the settling time, rise time, maximum time and maximum overshoot percentage. It is found that the suggested RL based TD3 give minimum settling time and relatively low values for the rise time, max time and overshoot percentage which makes the RL provide superior speed responses compared with those obtained from the four MHOT. The drive system speed responses are obtained in the constant torque region and constant power region using MATLAB SIMULINK package."
Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) guidance during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) allows better assessment of coronary artery lesion characteristics than angiography alone. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to comprehensively synthesize the available evidence regarding the efficacy of IVUS guidance compared to angiography-guided PCI.
"Biobanks are essential for biomedical research, particularly in the era of personalized medicine. In Germany, 36 biobanks have been established over the past decade that are connected under the German Biobank Alliance (GBA). These biobanks store high-quality biological samples along with clinical data to support research projects. Biobanks can be integrated, handling both tissue and liquid samples, or set up as separate entities depending on specific requirements.Tissue biobanking is especially complex due to the invasive nature of tissue collection and the non-replicability of the samples. Close collaboration between clinics, pathologists, IT specialists, and biobank managers is crucial to ensure the quality of samples and promote interdisciplinary research.The integration of pathology and biobanking is key, both organizationally and technically. Shared IT systems, standardized protocols, and collaborative governance structures are vital for efficient data management. Quality assurance, ethical guidelines, and data protection are critical to maintaining public trust and legal compliance.Long-term financial models are needed to ensure the sustainability of biobanks. The GBA supports emerging biobanks through its ""Starterkit"" initiative, offering guidance and best practices to help new biobanks develop.Tissue biobanks are indispensable for advancing the understanding of diseases and developing new therapies. However, they must adhere to strict ethical and legal standards to maximize their scientific and societal value."
"Smart cities, artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare, and low-carbon building materials are pivotal to public health, environmental sustainability, and green efficiency. Despite their critical importance, understanding public perceptions and attitudes toward these domains remains underexplored. Additionally, the effective use of advanced technologies like convolutional neural networks (CNN) in predicting and promoting low-carbon solutions in construction is gaining attention."
"The processing quality of indica rice stabilizes after a period of post-harvest storage known as after-ripening, during which proteins play an important role according to our previous research. The present study investigated the effects of rice storage proteins (RSPs) on the physicochemical properties of after-ripening rice, employing protein analysis, rapid viscosity analyzer, hydration properties assessment, morphological analysis and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The results indicated that the crude protein content remained relatively unchanged during after-ripening, while the band intensities of 13 kDa and 20 kDa protein subunits increased with increasing storage time. Removing RSPs decreased the setback viscosity, final viscosity and pasting temperature of after-ripening indica rice flour but led to an increase in its breakdown viscosity, especially by 93.45 % after storage at 36 °C for 90 d. Protein-removal also contributed to increasing the water solubility and swelling power of after-ripening indica rice flour by 31.66 % and 37.31 % for 90 d respectively. Morphological analysis revealed that RSPs had wrapped the starch granules, thus delaying the migration of water into the starch during heating. FTIR spectra indicated that the presence of RSPs enhanced the short-range ordered structure of starch. These findings will contribute to further elucidating the mechanisms underlying indica rice quality changes during storage."
"Tricuspid valve-in-valve (TVIV) implantation has traditionally included post-procedure overnight in-hospital observation with next-day discharge. Recently, our practice has shifted toward same-day discharge for most patients after vascular access site hemostasis and adequate recovery from anesthesia. However, data on the safety of this approach remains scarce."
"Fragrance is an important feature of ornamental lilies. Components of volatile substances and important genes for monoterpene synthesis in the 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway were examined in this study. Twenty volatile compounds (2 in the budding stage, 3 in the initial flowering stage, 7 in the semi-flowering stage, 17 in the full-flowering stage, and 5 in withering stage) were detected in the Oriental lily 'Sorbonne' using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The semi- and full-flowering stages were key periods for volatile substance production and enzyme function. Sequence assembly from samples collected during all flowering stages resulted in the detection of 274,849 genes and 129,017 transcripts. RNA sequencing and heatmapping led to the detection of genes in the MEP monoterpene metabolism pathway. Through gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis, we extracted key genes (LiDXS2, LiLIS, and LiMYS) and transcription factors (in the bHLH, MYB, HD-ZIP, and NAC families) associated with the MEP pathway. Tissue localization revealed that LiDXS2, LiLIS, and LiMYS were expressed in Lilium 'Sorbonne' petals in the full-flowering stage. Genes regulating the 1-deoxy-D-X-lignone-5-phosphate synthase family of rate-limiting enzymes, involved in the first step of monoterpene synthesis, showed high expression in the semi- and full-flowering stages. LiDXS2 was cloned and localized in chloroplast subcells. The relative expression of terpene-related genes in the MEP and mevalonic acid pathways of wild-type and LiLIS/LiMYS transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana, and changes in chemical composition, confirmed that LiLIS/LiMYS regulates the monoterpene synthesis pathway. The results of this study provide a theoretical basis for the synthesis of lily aromatic substances and the cultivation of new garden flower varieties."
"We assessed the impact of loiasis and its treatment with ivermectin on hemostasis and inflammation in 38 adults in Cameroon. Participants were divided into four balanced groups based on their Loa loa microfilarial densities. At baseline, eosinophils and platelets increased with microfilarial densities (p<0.001 and p = 0.044, respectively). At day 4 following ivermectin administration, median eosinophils rose from 171/μL to 1,095/μL (p<0.001) and median D-dimers increased from 582 ng/mL to 745 ng/mL (p = 0.024) with a median relative variation of +34.7%. C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, and alpha-1-globulin also increased significantly after treatment. Ivermectin treatment appeared to induce inflammation, coagulation activation and fibrinolysis."
"Planar cell polarity (PCP) is an evolutionarily conserved process for development and morphogenesis in metazoans. The well-organized polarity pattern in cells is established by the asymmetric distribution of two core protein complexes on opposite sides of the cell membrane. The Van Gogh-like (VANGL)-PRICKLE (PK) pair is one of these two key regulators; however, their structural information and detailed functions have been unclear. Here, we present five cryo-electron microscopy structures of human VANGL1, VANGL2, and their complexes with PK1 at resolutions of 2.2-3.0 Å. Through biochemical and cell imaging experiments, we decipher the molecular details of the VANGL-PK interaction. Furthermore, we reveal that PK1 can target VANGL-containing intracellular vesicles to the peripheral cell membrane. These findings provide a solid foundation to understand the explicit interaction between VANGL and PK while opening new avenues for subsequent studies of the PCP pathway."
"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) comprises alterations in brain anatomy and physiology that ultimately affect information processing and behavior. In most cases, autism is considered idiopathic, involving alterations in numerous genes whose functions are not extensively documented. We evaluated the C58/J mouse strain as an idiopathic model of ASD, emphasizing synaptic transmission as the basis of information processing. Through in silico analysis, we found that the C58/J strain carries single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) compared to the C57BL/6J control strain related to synaptic structure and LTP induction. These SNPs have human orthologs previously associated with ASD. We then assessed chemical potentiation (cLTP) in synaptosomes, the electrophysiological properties of hippocampal CA3 cells, and the induction of LTP in ex-vivo slices. An increased proportion of synaptosomes expressing the GluA1 subunit of AMPA receptor and Nrx1β in the membrane was found in the C57BL/6J control strain, but not in C58/J mice, after cLTP induction. Additionally, several electrophysiological properties of CA3 pyramidal cells and hippocampal communication were altered. Behaviorally, C58/J mice exhibited hyperactivity and subtle memory changes. Our results demonstrate that an idiopathic model of ASD exhibits alterations in hippocampal physiology from the cellular to the circuitry and behavioral levels."

"Kyasanur forest disease (KFD) is an endemic flaviviral hemorrhagic fever in south India. We report seven cases of oral candidiasis in patients from Karnataka, India, who presented in March and April 2024 with the first phase of KFD. Except for lymphopenia, no other risk factors for oral candidiasis were identified in these patients. All patients were managed with antifungals and did well at the 28-day follow-up. We report this case series to highlight the possibility of transient immunosuppression and the occurrence of opportunistic infections in flaviviral infections such as KFD."

"Carbendazim abuse in agriculture can lead to the residue in water and food, which may bring about adverse effects to human's health. In this study, we report the solvothermal synthesis of free-metal single TT-COF with one-step strategy and the TT-COF-based electrochemical sensor is fabricated for the further sensing of carbendazim. The TT-COF possesses high surface area, excellent conductivity and outstanding electrocatalytic activity. Therefore, the TT-COF/GCE is applied for the determination of carbendazim with CV and DPV techniques. This TT-COF/GCE sensor shows wide linear range of 0.005-5 μM and the low limit of detection (LOD) of 2.21 nM towards the detection of carbendazim. More importantly, the projected TT-COF/GCE sensor demonstrates satisfactory recoveries by estimating carbendazim in apple, tomato and pear juice real samples."
"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of acute lower respiratory tract infections in young children, elderly and immunocompromised patients worldwide. The RSV fusion (F) protein, which has 5-6 N-glycosylation sites depending on the strain, is a major target for vaccine development. Two to three of these sites are located in the p27 peptide, which is considered absent in virions. Prior research from our group showed that removing the N-glycan at position 116 (N116) in p27 led to higher neutralizing antibody responses and better protection against RSV. In this study, the effect of single, double and triple N-glycan deletion mutations in F p27 was evaluated. Surprisingly, all mutants exhibited similar expressions and functionality to the wild-type F protein. All F p27 glycomutants induced neutralizing antibodies and lowered lung viral loads after an RSV challenge in a mouse model. Although N-glycans in p27 influence immune responses, their exact role in RSV biology remains unclear. Possibly, these glycans, which are mostly conserved, play a role in other aspects of virus replication and biology."

"The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score is a widely utilized clinical tool for evaluating the severity of organ failure in critically ill patients and assessing their condition and prognosis in the intensive care unit (ICU). Research has demonstrated that higher SOFA scores are associated with poorer outcomes in these patients. However, the predictive value of the SOFA score for acute kidney injury (AKI), a common complication of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), remains uncertain. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the relationship between SOFA scores and the incidence of AKI in patients with DKA."
"Following resection of posterior superior frontal gyrus (PSFG) tumors, patients can experience supplementary motor area (SMA) syndrome consisting of contralateral hemiapraxia and/or speech apraxia. Given the heterogeneity of PSFG tumors, the authors sought to determine the risk of postoperative deficits and assess predictors of outcomes for all intraparenchymal PSFG tumors undergoing surgery (biopsy or resection), regardless of histology."

"Chronic cough is a common clinical condition requiring comprehensive assessment. This review employs a symptom-focused approach, prioritizing the presenting symptom of ""chronic cough"" to mirror real-world clinical practice. Ten key questions regarding the investigations in the uncertain areas were systematically addressed based on the PICO framework and applying the GRADE system for evidence synthesis to provide the strength of recommendation and quality of evidence for key questions. Practical diagrams were developed to facilitate clinical decision-making. The initial evaluation involves screening for red flag signs requiring urgent attention, followed by a detailed history-taking and physical examination. A chest radiograph is recommended as the first-line investigation. The primary objective of the initial evaluation is to identify the cause and initiate appropriate treatment. If history and physical examination prove insufficient for a definitive diagnosis, referral to a specialist is advised for further specific testing. The recommendations on specific testing include fractional exhaled nitric oxide for cough variant asthma, nasal endoscopy or digital endoscopy (optional) for upper airway cough syndrome, paranasal sinus computed tomography (CT) for chronic rhinosinusitis, and laryngoscopy for hoarseness. Spirometry is for the diagnosis of obstructive airway diseases, and peak flow variability or bronchial challenge tests are complements particularly if asthma is suspected. Gastroesophageal reflux (GERD) investigations are for patients with chronic cough without typical GERD symptoms. Sinus radiographs and chest CT are not routinely recommended. Our guideline distinguishes itself by prioritizing a symptom-based clinical evaluation to guide clinicians toward the most probable diagnosis, streamlining the diagnostic process."
"Accurate segmentation of retinal blood vessels from retinal images is crucial for detecting and diagnosing a wide range of ophthalmic diseases. Our retinal blood vessel segmentation algorithm enhances microfine vessel extraction, improves edge texture clarity, and normalizes vessel distribution. It stabilizes neural network training for complex retinal vascular features. Channel-aware self-attention (CAS) improves microfine vessel segmentation sensitivity. Heterogeneous adaptive pooling (HAP) facilitates accurate vessel edge segmentation through multi-scale feature extraction. The ghost fully convolutional Rectified Linear Unit (GFCReLU) module in the output convolutional layer captures deep semantic information for better vessel localization. Optimization training with Sparrow-Integrated Lion Optimization Algorithm (SLOA) employs sparrow stochastic updating and annealing to fine-tune parameters. The results of the experiments on our homemade dataset and three public datasets are as follows: Mean Intersection over Union (MIoU) of 80.61%, 76.14%, 76.90%, 74.11%; Dice coefficients of 78.97%, 72.51%, 72.84%, 68.93%; and accuracies of 94.83%, 95.74%, 96.67%, 95.81% respectively. The model effectively segments retinal blood vessels, offering potential for diagnosing ophthalmic diseases. Our dataset is available at https://github.com/ZhouGuoXiong/Retinal-blood-vessels-for-segmentation ."
"Flavivirus infection, especially dengue virus infection caused by DENV, is known to be a significant health concern globally owing to the high incidence and mortality rate. The expanding and increasing disease burden calls for the need to develop an effective treatment and prevent the event of fatal complications, including dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome. The DENV-induced immune response has been described as paradoxical because it has a protective role in viral clearance but, at the same time, causes more severe infection through viral-specific immunity. This is further complicated by high homology and cross-reactivity between different serotypes of DENV, causing a more severe disease presentation during secondary infection by a heterologous serotype. This serotype complexity poses a challenge for the development of a universal flavivirus vaccine. This review highlights the significance of high motility group box 1 (HMGB1) and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, leucine rich repeat and pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation pathways in initiating an inflammatory response through the downstream activation of nuclear factor κB and proinflammatory cytokine Interleukin (IL)-1B, IL-18 release in DENV infection. It also discusses the role of NLRP3 in activating cellular apoptosis and pyroptosis leading to systemic failure, especially in peripheral tissues. Over the decades, there has been much progress in understanding the immunopathogenesis of DENV infection. Researchers have been studying key pathogenic molecules for potential therapeutic targets including HMGB1 and NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors, which is explored in this review. Ultimately, although there is not yet an effective antiviral or vaccine for DENV, immunomodulators continue to pave the way to decrease disease severity in infected individuals."
"The management of gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage in a prehospital setting presents significant challenges, particularly in arresting the hemorrhage and initiating resuscitation. This case report introduces a novel instance of prehospital whole blood transfusion to an 8-year-old male with severe lower GI hemorrhage, marking a shift in prehospital pediatric care. The patient, with no previous significant medical history, presented with acute rectal bleeding, severe hypotension (systolic/diastolic blood pressure [BP] 50/30 mmHg), and tachycardia (148 bpm). Early intervention by Emergency Medical Services (EMS), including the administration of 500 mL (16 mL/kg) of whole blood, led to marked improvement in vital signs (BP 97/64 mmHg and heart rate 93 bpm), physiology, and physical appearance, underscoring the potential effectiveness of prehospital whole blood transfusion in pediatric GI hemorrhage. Upon hospital admission, a Meckel's diverticulum was identified as the bleeding source, and it was successfully surgically resected. The patient's recovery was ultimately favorable, highlighting the importance of rapid, prehospital intervention and the potential role of whole blood transfusion in managing acute pediatric GI hemorrhage. This case supports the notion of advancing EMS protocols to include interventions historically reserved for the hospital setting that may significantly impact patient outcomes from the field."

"Limb salvage surgery has become the primary means of treatment for patients with malignant tumors of the extremities and pelvis. For these patients, endoprostheses have become the principal means to reconstruct the extremity following an oncologic resection because they offer an off-the-shelf-option that is modular, cost effective, and durable. As with other forms of arthroplasty, several modes of failure can occur, with infection being common. Management of an infected endoprosthesis is individualized based on numerous factors that the treating surgeon needs to consider. It is important to provide a framework for the workup and subsequent treatment of patients with an infected endoprosthesis."
"WHAT IS KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT?: Suicide is an important health problem that has been common all over the world in recent years. Nursing students are a high-risk group for suicide. Factors affecting suicide risk should be investigated and included in psychiatric nursing interventions. Psychological pain is a predisposing condition for suicide risk. Studies focus on the relationship between suicide risk and psychological pain. Studies examining the moderator factors affecting this relationship are limited. WHAT THE PAPER ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: By means of the structural equation model, the effect of resilience mediation on the relationship of suicide risk and psychological pain has been shown. In the process of going from psychological pain to suicide, resilience takes on a buffer function with its mediating effect, and this process can be prevented by the development of resilience. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: Resilience can be added as a protective factor for suicide to the practices of psychiatric nursing. Initiatives to strengthen resilience can be added to psychiatric nursing practices. In this way, psychological pain and the risk of suicide can be reduced by strengthening resilience. Psychological pain can be added as a risk factor for suicide to the practices of psychiatric nursing. Within the scope of psychiatric nursing practices, nursing interventions can be structured to assess and reduce psychological pain. Interventions on strategies to manage and cope with psychological pain and initiatives to strengthen resilience can be added to suicide prevention programs created for nursing students."

"Visfatin, an adipokine secreted by various cell types, plays multifaceted pathophysiological roles in inflammatory conditions, including obesity, which is closely associated with osteoclastogenesis, a key process underlying bone loss and increased osteoporosis (OP) risk. However, the role of visfatin in osteoclastogenesis remains controversial. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of visfatin on receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclast differentiation from precursor cells in vitro. Our results demonstrated that although visfatin exhibited a modest osteoclast-inductive effect relative to that of RANKL, co-stimulation of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) with visfatin and RANKL led to significantly enhanced osteoclast differentiation and activation compared to individual stimulation. Neutralization of visfatin activity using blocking antibodies before differentiation markedly suppressed RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis, as evidenced by a near-complete absence of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive multinucleated osteoclasts, decreased levels of nuclear factor of activated T cells cytoplasmic 1 and osteoclast-specific proteins, inhibition of nuclear factor-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways, and a decrease in resorption pit formation. Our findings underscore the critical role of visfatin in RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis in vitro and highlight the RANKL/visfatin signaling axis as a potential therapeutic target for destructive bone loss-related diseases."
"The dynamics unfolding during predator-prey interactions encapsulate a critical aspect of the natural world, dictating the survival and evolutionary trajectories of animal species. Underlying these complex dynamics, sensory-motor control strategies orchestrate the locomotory gates essential to guarantee survival or predation. While analytical models have been instrumental in understanding predator-prey interactions, dissecting sensory-motor control strategies remains a great challenge due to the adaptive and stochastic nature of animal behavior and the strong coupling of predator-prey interactions. Here, we propose a data-driven mathematical model describing the adaptive learning response of a dolphin while hunting a fish. Grounded in feedback control systems and stochastic differential equations theory, our model embraces the inherent unpredictability of animal behavior and sheds light on the adaptive learning strategies required to outmaneuver agile prey. The efficacy of our model was validated through numerical experiments mirroring crucial statistical properties of locomotor activity observed in empirical data. Finally, we explored the role of stochasticity in predator-prey dynamics. Interestingly, our findings indicate that varying noise levels can selectively favor either fish survival or dolphin hunting success."
"Early warning of geological hazards requires monitoring extreme weather conditions, such as heavy rainfall. Atmospheric circulation models are used for weather forecasting and climate simulation. As a critical physical process in atmospheric circulation models, the Zhang-McFarlane (ZM) deep convective physical parameterization scheme involves computationally intensive calculations that significantly impact the overall operational efficiency of the model. However, many of these calculations are independent and can be computed in parallel. Therefore, this paper proposes a GPU-based acceleration algorithm for the ZM scheme. Based on the computation characteristics of the ZM scheme, we propose its one-demensional and two-demensional acceleration algorithms based on GPU. These algorithms are implemented using CUDA C and compared against a single Kunpeng-920 (Dual Socket) CPU core and the OpenMP version on multi-core CPUs. In the absence of I/O transmission, the proposed algorithm achieves a speedup of 413.6×. Experimental results demonstrate the significant acceleration effect of the proposed algorithms and methods. It is of great significance for the development of deep convective parameterization schemes and their further generalization in climate models. Additionally, we propose a performance optimization method utilizing the CUDA streaming technology to improve data transmission efficiency between CPU and GPU. In the presence of I/O transmission, the proposed algorithm achieves a speedup of 350.1× on A100 GPU."
"The goal of surgery for patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM) is maximum safe resection of the contrast-enhancing (CE) lesion on magnetic resonance imaging. However, there is no consensus on the efficacy of FLAIRectomy, which is defined as the possible resection of fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR)-hyperintense lesions surrounding the CE lesion. Although retrospective analyses suggested the potential benefits of FLAIRectomy, such outcomes have not been confirmed by prospective studies. Therefore, we planned a multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled phase III trial to evaluate the efficacy of FLAIRectomy compared with gross total resection of CE lesions in patients with newly diagnosed GBM. The primary endpoint is overall survival. In total, 130 patients will be enrolled from 47 institutions over 5 years. This trial has been registered at the Japan Registry of Clinical Trials (study number jRCT1031230245)."
"The importance of nutritional status is underappreciated in patients with heart failure (HF). This study aimed to describe the range of the prognostic nutrition index (PNI), and the clinical characteristics and outcomes according to PNI, in patients with HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). The primary outcome was the composite of HF hospitalization or cardiovascular death."
"Cardiovascular diseases resulting from myocardial infarction (MI) remain a leading cause of death worldwide, imposing a substantial burden on global health systems. Current MI treatments, primarily pharmacological and surgical, do not regenerate lost myocardium, leaving patients at high risk for heart failure. Engineered heart tissue (EHT) offers a promising solution for MI and related cardiac conditions by replenishing myocardial loss. However, challenges like immune rejection, inadequate vascularization, limited mechanical strength, and incomplete tissue maturation hinder clinical application. The discovery of human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) has transformed the EHT field, enabling new bioengineering innovations. This review explores recent advancements and future directions in hiPSC-derived EHTs, focusing on innovative materials and fabrication methods like bioprinting and decellularization, and assessing their therapeutic potential through preclinical and clinical studies. Achieving functional integration of EHTs in the heart remains challenging due to the need for synchronized contraction, sufficient vascularization, and mechanical compatibility. Solutions such as genome editing, personalized medicine, and AI technologies offer promising strategies to address these translational barriers. Beyond MI, EHTs also show potential in treating ischemic cardiomyopathy, heart valve engineering, and drug screening, underscoring their promise in cardiovascular regenerative medicine."
"Advanced triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has poorer outcomes due to its aggressive behavior and restricted therapeutic options. While therapies like checkpoint inhibitors and PARP inhibitors offer some benefits, chemotherapy remains ineffective beyond the first line of treatment. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) like sacituzumab govitecan-hziy (SG) represent a significant advancement. SG combines SN-38, an irinotecan derivative, with a Trop-2-targeting antibody via a pH-sensitive linking moiety, achieving a good drug:antibody ratio. In a phase I-II study involving metastatic TNBC (mTNBC) individuals, SG achieved an overall response rate of 33.3% and a median response period of 7.7 months. The phase III ASCENT trial demonstrated SG's efficacy in relapsed or refractory TNBC, improving median progression-free survival and median overall survival compared to chemotherapy. Common side effects include neutropenia, nausea, and fatigue. This article highlights the clinical potential, pharmacokinetics, safety profile, and resistance mechanisms of SG along with key ongoing clinical trials, emphasizing its role in managing refractory mTNBC, especially in third-line therapy. The review also discusses current strategies for managing adverse reactions and sequencing ADC treatments in clinical practice, along with the predicted basis of resistance. The optimal sequencing of SG relative to other ADCs, such as trastuzumab deruxtecan or T-DXd, remains an evolving question, especially as newer agents with distinct mechanisms of action and safety profiles enter the field. Further research is essential to establish evidence-based strategies for sequencing SG and addressing disease progression post-ADC therapy."
"Plants host diverse assemblages of fungi on their foliar tissues, both in internal compartments and on exterior surfaces. When plant distributions shift, they can move with their fungal associates (i.e., co-introduction) or acquire new associates present in the novel environment (host-jumping). The fungal communities that plants acquire influence a plant's ability to establish and spread in this new environment. Here, we aimed to assess whether invasive C. ciliaris hosts similar groups of fungi in its native and introduced ranges and to evaluate community overlap of fungi associated with foliar tissue of C. ciliaris and native and non-native plants within the introduced range. In the introduced range, the majority of OTUs associated with C. ciliaris were not found in its native range, although 3.2% of OTUs were common to both ranges. Of these shared OTU, 77.6% were found on co-occurring natives and non-natives in the introduced range, whereas 22.4% were unique to C. ciliaris indicating a possible co-introduction. Fungal communities within the introduced range contained a higher proportion of generalist symbionts and increased heterogeneity of foliar communities than in its native range. Within the introduced range, host phylogenetic distance explained more variation than native status. Our findings provide evidence that non-natives acquire fungi opportunistically from their environment, although host and environmental filtering is present suggesting that successful invasive plants may be able to limit the effect of poor symbionts and select for better ones. Future experimental work will be needed to confirm the occurrence of host selection and identify its mechanisms."
There are conflicting findings regarding the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) and mortality with vancomycin/piperacillin-tazobactam combination (VPT) and vancomycin/meropenem (VM). The aim of this meta-analysis was to compare the risk of AKI and mortality between VPT and VM.
"Despite the widespread use of narrow diameter inflatable penile prosthesis (IPP) cylinders in patients with corporal fibrosis, outcomes data is sparse. We evaluated patients who underwent IPP placement with AMS™ 700 Controlled Expansion Restricted (CXR) cylinders from 2007-2021. Patient characteristics, device details, and surgical outcomes were assessed. A non-validated questionnaire was also distributed to patients to assess satisfaction. Among 982 IPPs placed over the study period at our institution, 49 (5.0%) used CXR cylinders. Indications for narrow cylinders: prior explant for infection (67.3%), ischemic priapism (16.3%), and idiopathic fibrosis (16.3%). Median corporal length was 19 cm (IQR 17-21 cm). Discordant intraoperative corporal measurements (24.5%) and RTE lengths (26.5%) were common. Post-operative complications occurred in 8 patients (16.3%) and included 3 infections (6.1%), 2 cylinder herniations (4.1%), 2 mechanical failures (4.1%), and one case of glans necrosis (2.0%). Five of these (10.2%) required explantation, while 4 (8.2%) were managed with revision. Over the follow-up period, 73.5% of patients reported satisfaction with rigidity. Primary drivers of dissatisfaction were perceived loss of penile length and girth. The AMS™ 700 CXR is a useful tool for challenging corporal fibrosis cases and shows acceptable surgical outcomes with moderate patient acceptability."

"This letter aims to provide valuable insights into broader evidence triangulation (i.e., a well-designed primary association analysis followed by elaborate approaches to control residual confounding effects from various design and modeling perspectives) for clarifying the association between air pollutants and health outcomes. It also highlights the importance of selecting appropriate instrumental variable for instrument-based causal modeling, emphasizing that all causal questions can be effectively addressed within the Mendelian randomization framework."
"Gregarines from the families Dactylophoridae and Trichorhynchidae parasitize exclusively centipedes and have a distinct morphology among other terrestrial eugregarines, but their evolutionary relationships have not yet been studied with molecular methods. Here we obtain rDNA operon sequences for the dactylophorids and trichorhynchids. We describe a new species Trichorhynchus efeykini sp. n. from a scutigeromorph Thereuopoda longicornis from Vietnam. Phylogenetic analyses with combined SSU, 5.8S and LSU rDNA dataset support the previously proposed separation of Trichorhynchus to the Trichorhynchidae based on morphology and recover the dactylophorids and trichorhynchids as sister groups in a monophyletic clade. This clade appears sister to the clade of the Actinocephaloidea and Stylocephaloidea, and represents a new major lineage of terrestrial gregarines that we designate as a new superfamily Dactylophoroidea."
Two veterinary issues that look set to dominate 2025 - the ongoing Competition and Markets Authority investigation and access to veterinary medicines in Northern Ireland - featured high on the agenda at a hybrid online/in person BVA Council meeting on 11 December 2024.
"Dengue is the most important viral vector-borne disease in the tropics, with Colombia being one of the most affected countries. In this context, it is essential to identify and synthesize the existing evidence on the epidemiology of dengue in Colombia. A systematic review (PROSPERO CRD42021257985) was conducted by searching for epidemiological data in populations with suspected or confirmed dengue in Colombia from 2012 to 2020. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, the LILACS, and SciELO databases, and 104 publications out of 1,234 records were selected. The dengue annual incidence rate varied through the years without a clear trend. The lowest annual incidence rate was observed in 2017 (90.7 per 100,000 population) and the highest in 2013 (476.2 per 100,000 population). The proportion of severe cases in the same period ranged between 0.89% in 2016 and 2.7% in 2012. The four dengue virus (DENV) serotypes co-circulated in the country, and DENV-2 was the predominant serotype. Fifty percent of dengue cases occurred in people under 20 years, and those between 5 and 14 years had the highest incidence rate. The mortality rate for all dengue cases ranged from 0.07% in 2020 to 0.16% in 2012 and 2015. In conclusion, dengue is a hyperendemic disease in Colombia with the circulation of four serotypes. New strategies must be implemented to prevent the contagion and impact of the disease on the population at risk."
"Zinc knuckle (ZCCHC) motif-containing proteins are present in unicellular and multicellular eukaryotes, and most ZCCHC proteins with known functions participate in the metabolism of various classes of RNA, such as mRNAs, ribosomal RNAs, and microRNAs. The Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) genome encodes 69 ZCCHC-containing proteins; however, the functions of most remain unclear. One of these proteins, CAX-INTERACTING PROTEIN 4 (CXIP4, encoded by AT2G28910), has been classified as a PTHR31437 family member. This family includes human Splicing regulatory glutamine/lysine-rich protein 1 (SREK1)-interacting protein 1 (SREK1IP1), which is thought to function in pre-mRNA splicing and RNA methylation. Metazoan SREK1IP1-like and plant CXIP4-like proteins only share a ZCCHC motif, and their functions remain almost entirely unknown. Here, we studied two loss-of-function alleles of Arabidopsis CXIP4: cxip4-1 is likely null and shows early lethality, and cxip4-2 is hypomorphic and viable, with pleiotropic morphological defects. The cxip4-2 mutant exhibited deregulation of defense genes and upregulation of transcription factor genes, some of which might explain its developmental defects. The cxip4-2 mutant also exhibited increased intron retention events, being more evident in cxip4-1. The specific functions of misspliced genes, such as those involved in ""gene silencing by DNA methylation"" and ""mRNA polyadenylation factor"" suggest that CXIP4 has additional functions. In cxip4-2 plants, polyadenylated RNAs accumulate in the nucleus; these could be misspliced mRNAs. The CXIP4 protein localizes to the nucleus in a pattern resembling nuclear speckles rich in splicing factors. Therefore, CXIP4 is required for plant development and survival and mRNA maturation."

"2022 survey data showed 29% of Veterans utilized Veterans Affairs (VA) paid health care at a non-VA facility, 6% higher than in 2021. Despite an increase in the number of Veterans accessing care in the community via the MISSION Act Community Care Program (CCP), there is limited information on the quality of mental health care delivered to Veterans in these settings. Further, Veterans report barriers to quality care, including poor communication between CCP and VA providers, which can result in negative patient outcomes. We aimed to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of using electronic screening, eScreening, as part of a process involving remote symptom screening, symptom monitoring, and clinically driven communication from VA to CCP providers, for Veterans accessing mental health treatment in CCP settings."
"In this study, the moisture and biogenic element quantities of most wild and cultivated edible dried fruits were investigated. Macroelements found in highest amounts in fruits were K, P, Ca, and Mg. While K quantities of the fruits are recorded between 5212.77 (""white myrtle"") and 25550.60 mg/kg (""black nightshade""), P amounts of the fruits were characterized to be between 949.08 (black myrtle) and 4420.75 mg/kg (""black nightshade""). Ca and Mg amounts of the fruits were assessed to be between 359.83 (plum) and 4330.89 mg/kg (""yellow hawthorn"") to 214.98 (plum) and 1852.04 mg/kg (""black nightshade""), respectively. Fe and B quantities of the fruitss were established to be between 2.69 (""black myrtle"") and 60.13 mg/kg (cherry) to 3.76 (""black myrtle"") and 76.25 mg/kg (sour cherry), respectively. In general, except for white and black myrtle fruits, it is thought that other fruits can be good sources of P, K, and Fe. P contents of ""laurel cherry,"" ""cherry,"" ""black nightshade,"" and ""Fragrant black grapes"" were found partly high than those of other fruits. ""Cherry laurel,"" ""sour cherry,"" ""cherry,"" ""pear,"" ""black nightshade,"" ""black fig,"" and ""hawthorn (yellow)"" fruits contain more K than other fruits."

"Thalassemia is an inherited hematological disorder characterized by a decrease in the synthesis of or absence of one or more globin chains. Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a major cause of acute viral hepatitis, constituting a major global health burden and emerging as a critical public health concern. HEV infection is mainly transmitted via the fecal-oral route; however, parenteral transmission through blood components has been reported in both developing and developed countries. Although HEV infection is typically self-limiting, immunocompromised individuals, patients with chronic liver disease, and thalassemic patients are at a heightened risk of contracting the infection and may develop chronic hepatitis and life-threatening complications that require treatment. The reported prevalence rates of HEV in thalassemia patients vary significantly by country. Age, gender, residential area, and the cumulative amount of blood transfusions received have been identified as associated risk factors for HEV infection. In order to enhance blood safety and ensure the protection of vulnerable patient populations, such as thalassemia patients, several countries have introduced universal or targeted HEV screening policies in blood donations. Other preventive measures include vigilant monitoring of thalassemic patients and screening for anti-HEV antibodies. The aim of this review is to explore the prevalence, risk factors, clinical impact and management of HEV infection in patients with thalassemia."
"The Lie group method is a powerful technique for obtaining analytical solutions for various nonlinear differential equations. This study aimed to explore the behavior of nonlinear elastic wave equations and their underlying physical properties using Lie group invariants. We derived eight-dimensional symmetry algebra for the (3+1)-dimensional nonlinear elastic wave equation, which was used to obtain the optimal system. Group-invariant solutions were obtained using this optimal system. The same analysis was conducted for the damped version of this equation. For the conservation laws, we applied Noether's theorem to the nonlinear elastic wave equations owing to the availability of a classical Lagrangian. However, for the damped version, we cannot obtain a classical Lagrangian, which makes Noether's theorem inapplicable. Instead, we used an extended approach based on the concept of a partial Lagrangian to uncover conservation laws. Both techniques account for the conservation laws of linear momentum and energy within the model. These novel approaches add an application of variational calculus to the existing literature. This offers valuable insights and potential avenues for further exploration of the elastic wave equations."

"The extent to which individuals with intellectual disabilities (ID) can exercise self-determination in their adult lives is largely influenced by various contextual factors, including their family environment, the institutions they interact with, and the legal and social conditions in which they function. In this study, we aimed to explore the lived experiences of people with ID in the context of the environmental challenges they face on the path to self-determination. To achieve this goal, we conducted an inclusive study involving co-researchers with ID. Thirty-three adults with mild to severe ID participated in focus groups or individual interviews. Using reflexive thematic analysis, we generated four superordinate themes: microsystemic factors that impact self-determination; Exosystemic factors that impact self-determination; macrosystemic factors that impact self-determination; and consequences. The implications for practice are discussed."
"Empowerment, the process by which a person is enabled to increase control over decisions concerning their life, is a multidimensional construct that has been extensively discussed by various disciplines for more than four decades. Several empowerment models have been presented, based on different approaches. This paper proposes a four-step model, based on individual and contextual awareness and advancement. Disparate factors may positively or negatively affect empowerment, including gender, race, culture, education, financial autonomy, socioeconomic status, family, neighborhood, religion, social cohesion, civic society, and political context. Empowerment has been extensively discussed in parallel with health promotion, since it is expected to positively affect health, both on the level of the individual and community, as well as in the context of the patient-healthcare professional relationship. Considering the position of women in patriarchal societies, where women may experience feelings of powerlessness, their social position and more importantly health may be adversely affected. Gender biases that were developed due to the marginalized position of women in different societies, coupled with paternalistic approaches of healthcare professionals, may significantly contribute to higher comorbidity, albeit longer life expectancy for women. Empowerment can therefore be a powerful tool for achieving equity in health and improving women's well-being."

"Fever is a complication after colorectal endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD). The objective of this study was to explore the incidence and risk factors of fever after colorectal ESD and establish a predictive nomogram model. This retrospective analysis encompassed patients with colorectal lesions who underwent ESD between June 2008 and December 2021 in our center. Multivariate analyses were performed to identify the independent risk factors of fever after colorectal ESD based on univariate analysis, and derived predictive nomogram model was constructed. The performance of nomogram model was evaluated through the receiver operating characteristic curve, calibration curve, decision curve analysis (DCA) and clinical impact curve (CIC). Among the 1096 enrolled patients with colorectal lesions, fever after colorectal ESD occurred in 204 (18.6%) patients. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that tumor size (P < 0.001), ESD procedure time > 30 min (P < 0.001), injury to muscle layer (P < 0.001) and intraoperative perforation (P = 0.046) were estimated to be independent risk factors of fever after colorectal ESD. A predictive nomogram model, incorporating these four predictors, were established and performed well in both training and validation groups. Both DCA and CIC showed this nomogram model had a good potential for clinical practicability."
"The provision of treatment for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutated nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients has increased in Korea.

"Peg-IFNα is one of the current therapeutic strategies for Hepatitis B virus (HBV) seroclearance. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms are not yet adequately understood. The objective of this study was to explore the potential mechanisms using multiomics approach. For the first time, we revealed the transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic characterizations of Peg-IFNα-induced HBsAg seroclearance. We found that Peg-IFNα caused significant changes during the treatment. Patients who achieved HBsAg seroclearance were characterized as having decreased transcriptional activity of genes involved in fatty acid metabolism and the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway, with up-regulated expression of fatty acid degradation-related proteins. Consistently, mitochondrial TCA cycle metabolites, including citric, isocitric, and malic acids, were significantly elevated in patients who achieved HBsAg seroclearance. We also observed up-regulated transcriptional activity of NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity, positive regulation of B cell activation, immunoglobulin production, and T cell receptor complex in functional-cured patients. Conversely, the metabolites associated with unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis were increased in HBsAg persistent patients, and the transcriptional activity of immunoglobulin production and T cell receptor complex was down-regulated after 48 weeks of Peg-IFNα treatment. Our findings provided valuable resources to better understand the process of HBsAg seroclearance and shed new light on the pathways to facilitate higher functional cure rates for CHB."
"Rice is a short-day thermophilic crop that originated from the low latitudes of the tropics and subtropics; it requires high temperatures for growth but is sensitive to low temperatures. Therefore, it is highly important to explore and analyze the molecular mechanism of cold tolerance in rice to expand rice planting areas. Here, we report a phenotypic evaluation based on low-temperature stress in indica rice (R998) and wild rice (GZW) and a comparative transcriptomic study conducted at six time points. After 7 days of low-temperature treatment at 10 °C, R998 exhibited obvious yellowing and greening of the leaves, while GZW exhibited high low-temperature resistance, and the leaves maintained their normal morphology and exhibited no yellowing; GZW has a higher survival rate. Principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis of the RNA-seq data revealed that the difference in low-temperature resistance between the two cultivars was caused mainly by the difference in low-temperature treatment after 6 h. Differential expression analysis revealed 2615 unique differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the R998 material, 1578 unique DEGs in the GZW material, 1874 unique DEGs between R998 and GZW, and 2699 DEGs that were differentially expressed not only between cultivars but also at different time points in the same material under low-temperature treatment. A total of 15,712 DEGs were detected and were significantly enriched in the phenylalanine metabolism, photosynthesis, plant hormone signal transduction, and starch and sucrose metabolism pathways. These 15,712 DEGs included 1937 genes encoding transcription factors (TFs), of which 10 have been identified with functional validation in previous studies. In addition, a gene regulatory network was constructed via weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA), and 12 key genes related to low-temperature tolerance in rice were identified, including five genes encoding TFs, one of which was identified and verified in previous studies. These results provide a theoretical basis for an in-depth understanding of the molecular mechanism of low-temperature tolerance in rice and provide new genetic resources for the study of low-temperature tolerance in rice."

"Artificial intelligence (AI) applications are complex and rapidly evolving, and thus often poorly understood, but have potentially profound implications for public health. We offer a primer for public health professionals that explains some of the key concepts involved and examines how these applications might be used in the response to a future pandemic. They include early outbreak detection, predictive modelling, healthcare management, risk communication, and health surveillance. Artificial intelligence applications, especially predictive algorithms, have the ability to anticipate outbreaks by integrating diverse datasets such as social media, meteorological data, and mobile phone movement data. Artificial intelligence-powered tools can also optimise healthcare delivery by managing the allocation of resources and reducing healthcare workers' exposure to risks. In resource distribution, they can anticipate demand and optimise logistics, while AI-driven robots can minimise physical contact in healthcare settings. Artificial intelligence also shows promise in supporting public health decision-making by simulating the social and economic impacts of different policy interventions. These simulations help policymakers evaluate complex scenarios such as lockdowns and resource allocation. Additionally, it can enhance public health messaging, with AI-generated health communications shown to be more effective than human-generated messages in some cases. However, there are risks, such as privacy concerns, biases in models, and the potential for 'false confirmations', where AI reinforces incorrect decisions. Despite these challenges, we argue that AI will become increasingly important in public health crises, but only if integrated thoughtfully into existing systems and processes."
"The necessity of routinely placing closed suction wound drainage in spinal surgery has been questioned. This study aims to assess if closed suction wound drainage is necessary for posterior atlantoaxial fixation via intermuscular approach. The functional outcomes of these 40 patients who underwent posterior atlantoaxial fixation via intermuscular approach without drainage tube (Group A) were compared with that of a control group, which consisted of 68 randomly enrolled cases with posterior atlantoaxial fixation via intermuscular approach with drainage tube (Group B). Outcome assessments included American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) scoring grade and Visual Analog Scale Score for Neck Pain (VASSNP). The postoperative analgesic consumption, the incidence of subcutaneous and surrounding ecchymosis and the time of ambulation were compared between two groups. Bone fusion was evaluated through computed tomography (CT) reconstruction. Postoperative paravertebral tissue edema was evaluated by the edema coefficient. The use of drainage tube had no significant influence on the postoperative analgesic consumption, wound ecchymosis, the time of ambulation and paravertebral tissue edema (P > 0.05). There were no statistically significant differences in the VASSNP and bone fusion rates during the follow-up period between the two groups (P > 0.05). All patients achieved ASIA grade E 3 months after surgery. No complications such as wound infection occurred in either group. Posterior atlantoaxial fixation via intermuscular approach does not necessitate postoperative drainage tube placement if there is no accidental vascular injury or excessive muscle bleeding occurs intraoperatively."
"Nucleosome is the basic structural unit of the genome. During processes like DNA replication and gene transcription, the conformation of nucleosomes undergoes dynamic changes, including DNA unwrapping and rewrapping, as well as histone disassembly and assembly. However, the wrapping characteristics of nucleosomes across the entire genome, including region-specificity and their correlation with higher-order chromatin organization, remains to be studied. In this study, we investigate the wrapping length of DNA on nucleosomes across the whole genome using wrapping-seq. We discover that the chromatin of mouse ES cells forms Nucleosome Wrapping Domains (NRDs), which can also be observed in yeast and fly genomes. We find that the degree of nucleosome wrapping decreases after DNA replication and is promoted by transcription. Furthermore, we observe that nucleosome wrapping domains delineate Hi-C compartments and replication timing domains. In conclusion, we have unveiled a previously unrecognized domainization principle of the chromatin, encoded by nucleosome wrapping states."
"Oestrogen receptor alpha (ER; gene symbol ESR1) is the most important prognostic and treatment-predictive biomarker in breast cancer. Drugs targeting oestrogen and ER for endocrine therapy of breast cancer include aromatase inhibitors, the selective ER modulator tamoxifen and the selective ER degrader fulvestrant. Tumours can develop resistance to endocrine therapy through several mechanisms, which is often linked to altered expression of ER. To investigate the role of promoter methylation in the regulation of ESR1 expression, we used bisulfite sequencing to measure methylation at CpG sites in alternative ER promoter regions for six cell line models of fulvestrant resistance. Both CpG methylation and expression of alternative first exons changed dynamically, with striking differences between cell lines that had stable or unstable resistance upon fulvestrant withdrawal. Methylation at some CpG sites was strongly negatively correlated with expression of specific first exons. In a breast tumour cohort, higher relative expression of upstream alternative first exons was associated with worse prognosis in post-menopausal women with ER-positive tumours who received endocrine therapy."

"The field of social work has been invested in assessing the alignment between direct practice skills and qualitative research techniques. Nevertheless, some of the debates surrounding this relationship have not been attended to recently-and less so in empirical ways. This qualitative study aimed to assess the relationship between practice and research skills with the goal of enhancing training in our field. Twenty academic social workers who conduct qualitative research participated in semistructured interviews. Thirteen were female, 13 were White, 11 had a doctoral degree, and their ages ranged from 27 to 65 years. Autoethnography and constructivist grounded theory approaches guided the analysis. Findings were contained in three themes: transferable techniques, bidirectional benefits, and pedagogical possibilities. Data underscore the role of reflexivity and boundaries in forging spaces amenable to appropriate data collection. Findings also supported a nuanced assessment of how qualitative research in social work may deliver benefits to both researcher and interviewee. Respondents suggest guidelines to ensure that training opportunities are ethically sound and consistent with social work values. Findings from this study may inform innovative enrichment opportunities for the field of social work across both research and practice."

"Diabetes is one of the most prevalent metabolic disorders, and its incidence has been experiencing a steady annual rise in recent years. Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) represents the most frequent adverse complication, exerting a profound impact on the quality of life for those suffering from diabetes. The etiology of DPN is complex, including impaired mitochondrial function. Iron-sulfur clusters (Fe-S) are essential cofactors for numerous essential enzymes crucial for mitochondrial function. Our previous study showed that expression of Frataxin, encoded by the Fxn gene, is downregulated in leptin receptor knockout (so-called db/db) mice, a commonly used DPN mouse model. Fxn is one of the core components of Fe-S biogenesis machinery. Here, we found that the mitochondria-targeted antioxidant SS-31 markedly improved the behavioral indices and significantly mitigated the damage to the sciatic nerve. SS-31 treatment effectively elevated Fxn expression, meliorated mitochondrial function, and inflammation in the sciatic nerve (SCN). We also found that SS-31 effectively mitigated high glucose-induced disruption of iron and redox homeostasis in RSC96 cells, a typical cell model of DPN, thereby improving mitochondrial function. These findings suggest enhancing Fe-S biogenesis could be an effective therapeutic strategy for treating DPN."

"The objectives of this study were to examine the association between financial wellbeing and somatization, in addition to the mediating effect of anxiety, depression and stress. To test such hypotheses, a cross-sectional study was carried out between September and October 2021; 403 participants (264 females; age = 32.76 ± 13.24 years) were recruited. Depression mediated the association between financial wellbeing and somatization. A worse financial wellbeing was significantly associated with more depression, which was associated with more somatization. Moreover, a worse financial wellbeing was significantly and directly associated with more somatization. Our study adds to the narrow body of research revolving around the relationship between financial wellbeing and somatization in Lebanese adults. Understanding that the effects of, depression are aggravated in a country such as Lebanon would help establish more preventative guidelines and mental health awareness campaigns. Identifying the correlates of somatization can also be translated into improved interventions."

"Sentiment analysis has become a difficult and important task in the current world. Because of several features of data, including abbreviations, length of tweet, and spelling error, there should be some other non-conventional methods to achieve the accurate results and overcome the current issue. In other words, because of those issues, conventional approaches cannot perform well and accomplish results with high efficiency. Emotional feelings, such as fear, anxiety, or traumas, often stem from many psychological issues experienced during childhood that can persist throughout life. In addition, people discuss and share their ideas on social media, often unconsciously representing their hidden emotions in the comments. This study is about sentiment analysis of tweets shared by several people. In fact, sentiment analysis can determine whether the shared comments and tweets are positive or negative. The paper introduces the use of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a kind of neural network, optimized by the Enhanced Gorilla Troops Optimization Algorithm (CNN-EGTO). Two datasets provided by the SemEval-2016 are used to evaluate the system, while the polarity of tweets were manually determined. It was determined by the findings of the present study that the suggested model could approximately achieve the values of 98%, 95%, 98%, and 96.47% for accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, respectively, for positive polarity. In addition, the suggested model could gain the values of 97, 96, 98, and 97.49 for precision, recall, accuracy, and F1-score, respectively, for negative polarity. Consequently, it was found that the suggested model could outperform the other models by considering their performance and efficiency. These values of performance metrics represent that the suggested model could determine the polarity of sentence, positive or negative, with great efficiency."

We prospectively examined HED and hookups as mechanisms of incapacitated SA (ISA) and other SA (OSA) risks for Black and White first-year college women and sociocontextual factors that may contribute differentially to risk. In mediation analyses, Black women's less frequent HED predicted lower ISA. SA characteristics (e.g., setting) also differed by race. Mechanisms and types of assault risk may not be the same for all college women, an important consideration for intervention efforts."
"The scope for natural colours is increasing because of the awareness of allergic, toxic, and hazardous reactions associated with synthetic dyes. Natural colours are extracted from sources that are naturally available, such as flora, fauna, and minerals. Nature sourced us multiple possibilities of colours with varied shades and hues that are subtle and harmonious when combined. Reasons like the instability of natural colours during industrial processing, seasonal availability of raw materials, fading of colour over time, cost of the benefit, and struggles in attaining sustainability have reduced commercialisation success as synthetic colours. Some plants that yield natural colours are also included in crop rotation practice. Natural dye extraction is a source of employment for the countrified subdivisions of poor developing countries. Indigenous technologies on natural colour extraction are available and have been practiced over the years; due to a lack of documentation and information on colour-yielding plants or products from horticultural crops, and their extraction methods, the use of natural colours is diminishing day by day. Even in recent years, emerging techniques have been adopted in research and development, and the information has not been brought together for the use of industries and allied sectors. Several modern approaches, such as Ultrasonication, microwave, enzymatic, supercritical, pressurised liquid extraction, etc., have proven to give better results in extracting natural colours. Thereby, having instantaneous information will help to go green, be eco-friendly, and effectively utilise all the resources without compromising industrial benefits. Reviewing the availability of natural colours from horticultural crops, classifications, recent trends in their extraction process, and applications in various fields will help achieve the above."
"The Arc of Bühler (AoB) is a rare anatomical variant in gastrointestinal vasculature where there is an aberrant anastomotic vessel between coeliac and superior mesenteric arteries. We present a rare case where AoB was noted intraoperatively to have haemodynamically significant flow in the context of coeliac artery stenosis, supplementing arterial supply to the hepatic artery proper via the gastroduodenal artery (GDA). An interpositional jump graft between the aorta and the GDA stump was created using the long saphenous vein, and flow was restored. The patient recovered well postoperatively. This case highlights the importance of understanding variations in gastrointestinal vasculature and the role of preoperative planning."
"Clinical trials and meta-analyses are considered high-level medical evidence with solid credibility. However, such clinical evidence for traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is scattered, requiring a unified entrance to navigate all available evaluations on TCM therapies under modern standards. Besides, novel experimental evidence has continuously accumulated for TCM since the publication of HERB 1.0. Therefore, we updated the HERB database to integrate four types of evidence for TCM: (i) we curated 8558 clinical trials and 8032 meta-analyses information for TCM and extracted clear clinical conclusions for 1941 clinical trials and 593 meta-analyses with companion supporting papers. (ii) we updated experimental evidence for TCM, increased the number of high-throughput experiments to 2231, and curated references to 6 644. We newly added high-throughput experiments for 376 diseases and evaluated all pairwise similarities among TCM herbs/ingredients/formulae, modern drugs and diseases. (iii) we provide an automatic analyzing interface for users to upload their gene expression profiles and map them to our curated datasets. (iv) we built knowledge graph representations of HERB entities and relationships to retrieve TCM knowledge better. In summary, HERB 2.0 represents rich data type, content, utilization, and visualization improvements to support TCM research and guide modern drug discovery. It is accessible through http://herb.ac.cn/v2 or http://47.92.70.12."
"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nanosized particles that are released by various cell types and play vital roles in intercellular communication. They carry biological molecules reflecting the physiological and pathological states of their source cells and tissues, showing potential as biomarkers. However, the impact of demographic factors like age and sex on the properties of blood plasma EVs remains underexplored. This study aims to fill this gap by evaluating how these factors influence the particle count and proteomic profiles of plasma EV preparations and corresponding protein fractions. Plasma samples from 120 healthy volunteers were collected and pooled into six groups: young males (age: 27.6 ± 4.0), young females (27.4 ± 3.8), middle-aged males (48.8 ± 3.8), middle-aged females (48.9 ± 3.9), old males (69.3 ± 3.9), and old females (69.4 ± 4.3). EV- and protein-enriched fractions were separated by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). Fractions were characterized for particle number concentration and protein composition to identify characteristics affected by age and biological sex. Plasma EVs and corresponding protein fractions exhibited distinct characteristics, with differential enrichment of markers related to EVs and other blood components, including lipoproteins. Proteomic profiles of both EVs and protein fractions displayed sex- and age-dependent differences. Differentially abundant proteins displayed functions previously identified in the context of aging and sex differences, highlighting their utility as biomarkers. Age and sex significantly affect the characteristics of plasma EVs and proteins, potentially influencing their efficacy and interpretation as biomarkers in clinical applications. This study lays the groundwork for detailed mechanistic research to understand how EVs mediate age- and sex-related effects in health."
"While adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are known to impart significant risk for negative mental health and cognitive outcomes in youth, translation of ACE scores into clinical intervention is limited by poor specificity in predicting negative outcomes. This work expands on the ACE framework using a data-driven approach to identify 8 different forms of traumatic and adverse childhood experiences (TRACEs) and reveal their differential associations with psychiatric risk and cognition across development."
"This study reports on the facile development of star-shaped gold nanoparticles via seed-mediated growth protocol. Gold nanostars (AuNSTs) demonstrated average particle size of 48 nm using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Chemical composition of AuNSTs was verifired using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) mapping. AuNSTs demonstrated high optical response under visible spectrum, with maximum absorption at 685 nm, using UV-Vis spectroscopy. Therefore AuNSTs could be involoved into photocatalytic reaction under visible spectrum. AuNSTs demonstrated superior performance in degradation of rhodamine B dye (RB), and disinfection of some pathogenic bacteria. AuNSTs offered enhanced removal efficiency against rhodamine B dye (82.0 ± 0.35% in 135 min) under visible irradiation. Remarkably, under proper conditions of pH = 9, approximately 94 ± 0.55% of a 10 ppm RB solution was effectively photodegraded after 135 min; this could be ascribed to the strong electrostatic attraction between negatively charged AuNSTs surface and positive RB contaminant. This superior photocatalytic activity of AuNSTs could be correlated to high interfacial charge transfer efficiency for Au, and enhanced charge pair separation under visible spectrum. Additionally, AuNSTs exhibited potential antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). AuNSTs demonstrated substantial antibacterial activity via disk diffusion and microbroth dilution tests with zones of inhibition and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for E. coli (20.0 ± 0.54 mm, 1.25 µg/ml) and S. aureus (23.0 ± 0.35 mm, 0.625 µg/ml), respectively. In conclusion, AuNSTs demonstrated efficient dye removal capabilities along with significant antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains."
"This study demonstrates how complex bone microarchitectural features can be summarized to describe bone adaptations seen with aging in women, which are consistent with the stages of osteoporosis. Additionally, we showed familial resemblance in these bone microarchitectural traits between mothers and daughters that can be used to predict bone adaptations."
"The objective of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of the wrist blood pressure (BP) monitor (TMB-2285-BT) in general population according to international standard of ISO 81060-2:2018+Amd.1:2020. The TMB-2285-BT BP monitor is an oscillometric device measuring BP from wrist. A single cuff for wrist sizes of 13.5-21.5 cm was used for the test device. The study was performed according to the 'International Standard (ISO 81060-2:2018 + Amd.1:2020) protocol' using the same-arm sequential BP measurement method. Subjects ( n ≥ 85) fulfilling the age, gender, BP, and cuff distribution criteria of the protocol were enrolled. For criterion 1, the mean difference of SBP and DBP between the test device and the reference device was -0.27 mmHg and -0.80 mmHg, respectively. For criterion 2, the SD of the averaged paired determinations of SBP and DBP for the test device and the reference device was 2.60 and 2.06 mmHg, respectively, both of which were less than 6.95 and 6.89 mmHg. The accuracy of the test device fulfilled the requirements of the criterion 1 and 2 of ISO 81060-2:2018 + Amd.1:2020. The TMB-2285-BT wrist BP monitor can be recommended for home BP measurement for general population."
"Syphilis is rising globally, with resultant increases in morbidity and mortality that disproportionately impact underserved populations. Appropriate screening and testing for syphilis with accurate, reliable, affordable, and timely assays is crucial for combating this epidemic. This review provides a brief overview of laboratory methods for syphilis diagnosis, with a focus on recent updates in diagnostics and directions for future research."
"The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aim to eradicate poverty and promote sustainable development; however, socioeconomic disparities persist globally, particularly in Colombia. With a Gini index of 0.556 in 2022, Colombia ranks among the most unequal countries in Latin America, with its southwest region of Nariño facing severe socioeconomic challenges. Concurrently, Nariño registers the highest levels of coca cultivation in Colombia, accounting for 65% of national cocaine production, reflecting the region's precarious conditions. This study investigates the extent to which the spatial distribution of socioeconomic factors explains coca cultivation patterns in Nariño. Grounded in conflict economics, social capital, and social marginalization theories, the research constructs composite indices representing education, health, public services, economic conditions, and vulnerability. Using spatial analysis, it identifies areas with heightened poverty and vulnerability and examines their relationship with illicit crops. The findings highlight spatial non-stationarity in the factors influencing coca cultivation, offering region-specific insights and policy recommendations to combat illicit crops and foster sustainable development. These results provide a foundation for targeted interventions and contribute to broader strategies addressing inequality and illegal economies in Colombia."
"Bilateral risk-reducing mastectomy (BRRM) is the surgical removal of both breasts to reduce the risk of cancer. In this Society of Surgical Oncology position statement, we review the literature addressing the indications, outcomes, and risks of BRRM to update the society's 2017 statement. We held a virtual meeting to outline key topics and conducted a literature search using PubMed to identify relevant articles. After literature review, recommendations were made according to group consensus. Individuals with a high lifetime risk of breast cancer due to pathogenic variants in high penetrance breast cancer-predisposition genes, early chest or breast radiation exposure, or a compelling family history should be counseled on the option of BRRM. However, BRRM is not recommended for most patients with high-risk lesions and may be contraindicated in patients who have other competing cancers and/or a high risk of surgical complications. BRRM effectively reduces the risk of breast cancer development, although the survival benefit is unclear. For patients with low-to-moderate breast cancer risk, alternative management strategies should be encouraged, including lifestyle modifications, high-risk screening, and risk-reducing medications. Discussions of BRRM should cover: (1) breast-cancer risk estimates; (2) the procedure's degree of risk reduction and impact on survival; (3) surgical techniques, potential surgical complications and long-term sequelae; and (4) alternatives to surgery. Surgeons should encourage shared and informed decision making with patients who have an elevated lifetime risk of developing breast cancer."
"This study evaluated the influence of maternal consumption of pequi pulp and nuts during pregnancy and lactation on reflex and somatic maturation and memory performance in rat offspring. The pups were divided into three groups: Control, treated with distilled water; a Pulp group and a Nuts group, treated with 2000 mg/kg of body weight of pequi pulp and nuts, respectively. Reflex and somatic maturation of the offspring were evaluated during lactation. Short and long-term memory consolidation in adolescent offspring were measured by evaluating habituation to the open field and object recognition. Data showed an acceleration of reflex maturation in three of the seven parameters evaluated in the Nuts group and four parameters in the Pulp group compared to the control. There was an acceleration in the appearance of somatic maturation in one parameter in the Nuts group and three in the pulp group compared to the control. The long-term object recognition rate was higher in the Nuts group compared to the control and highest in the Pulp group. Maternal levels of malonaldehyde in the brain were measured and their levels in the Pulp and Nuts groups were lower than those in the Control group. We can conclude that consumption of both pulp and pequi nuts promoted a reduction in oxidative stress in the maternal brain, promoted acceleration of reflex and somatic maturation, and improved long-term memory in the offspring, with these effects being more intense in the Pulp group."
"The rich dynamics of magnetic materials makes them promising candidates for neural networks that, like the brain, take advantage of dynamical behaviors to efficiently compute. Here, we experimentally show that integrate-and-fire neurons can be achieved using a magnetic nanodevice consisting of a domain wall racetrack and magnetic tunnel junctions in a way that has reliable, continuous operation over many cycles. We demonstrate the domain propagation in the domain wall racetrack (integration), reading using a magnetic tunnel junction (fire), and reset as the domain is ejected from the racetrack with over 100 continuous cycles. Both the pulse amplitude and pulse number encoding are shown. By simulating a spiking neural network task, we benchmark the performance of the devices against an ideal leaky, integrate-and-fire neuron, showing that the spintronic neuron can match the performance of the ideal. These results achieve demonstration of reliable integrated-fire reset in domain wall-magnetic tunnel junction-based neuron devices for neuromorphic computing."
"With the improvement of living standards, implant dentures have become the choice of more and more patients with missing teeth. Dentures are not natural teeth, and may cause different degrees of negative impacts on patients in physiological, psychological and social aspects. The objective of this study was to examine the current status of psychological resilience among implant denture patients and the factors that influence it. Additionally, we aimed to analyse the correlation between psychological resilience, social support, and oral health behaviours, with a view to providing a scientific basis for the development of targeted interventions for patients with implant dentures."
"Artocarpus lakoocha agglutinin (ALA), which specifically targets the Gal/GalNAc components of complex glycans, was isolated from the seeds of Artocarpus lakoocha. This study is the first to explore the role of ALA in identifying aberrant glycans, designated ALA-binding glycans (ALAG), and its implications in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). ALA-histochemistry was used to evaluate ALAG expression in liver fluke-induced CCA tissues from hamsters (n = 60). Elevated ALAG expression was observed in hyperplastic ducts and significantly increased in CCA tissues, while normal biliary epithelium and hepatocytes showed no expression. Similar results were found in patient CCA tissues (n = 68), where higher ALAG levels correlated with shorter survival rates, indicating the involvement of ALAG in CCA development and progression. Furthermore, ALA treatment inhibited cell viability in CCA cell lines, as demonstrated by MTT and colony formation assays, and Ki-67 expression. ALA treatment also decreased cell migration and invasion, as shown by Transwell assays. Gelatin zymography suggested that these effects might be associated with reduced MMP-9 activity. Overall, these findings may position ALAG as a potential marker for poor prognosis in CCA, while ALA may serve as a novel lectin for both detection and therapeutic applications in CCA."
"Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), a highly aggressive form of cancer, is known for its high mortality rate. A Disintegrin and Metalloprotease Domain-like Protein Decysin-1 (ADAMDEC1) can promote the development and metastasis in various tumors by degrading the extracellular matrix. However, its regulatory mechanism in CCA remains unclear. Public databases and clinical tissue samples were used to evaluate whether ADAMDEC1 expression was correlated with the prognosis of CCA. We investigated the expression of ADAMDEC1-related regulatory genes and proteins in CCA and assessed the biological behaviors of CCA cells in vitro through functional experiments. Meanwhile, the interacting proteins of ADAMDEC1 and its involvement in the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway were screened and verified through bioinformatics analysis. The tumorigenicity of CCA was also assessed in a xenograft nude mouse model. Our results showed that ADAMDEC1 was highly expressed in tumor tissues from CCA patients and was positively correlated with poor prognosis. Interference cell lines targeting ADAMDEC1 in CCA cells were successfully constructed. Knockdown of ADAMDEC1 or MMP12 both affected the biological behaviors of CCA cells, and ADAMDEC1 silencing inhibited tumorigenicity and tumor growth of CCA in vivo. Moreover, ADAMDEC1 interacted with MMP12, modulating its expression and promoting the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. Our study uncovered the expression patterns and functional roles of ADAMDEC1 in CCA cells and tissues, highlighting its connection to the NF-κB pathway and MMP12 in the development of CCA. Therefore, ADAMDEC1 may serve as a potential therapeutic target for CCA."
"The aim of this this study was to evaluate the surface roughness and color stability of resin composites (RCs) with color adjustment potential (CAP): Omnichroma (OM), (Tokuyama Dental, Tokyo, Japan); Neo Spectra ST (NS) (Dentsply Sirona, York, PA,USA); and Charisma Diamond One (CD) (Kulzer, Hanau, Germany), compared to a conventional RC, Filtek Z350XT (FZ) (3M ESPE, St. Paul, MN,USA), after immersion in three staining solutions, cola, coffee, and black tea, with distilled water as a control. Forty specimens (8 mm diameter x 2 mm thickness) were prepared for each RC material and divided into subgroups (n=10/group) based on the immersion solution. Surface roughness was measured at baseline and after 21 days of immersion using a non-contact optical profilometer. Color change (ΔE00) was evaluated at baseline, 1, 7, and 21 days with a spectrophotometer. The results showed that FZ demonstrated the lowest surface roughness (0.14), significantly differing from that of the other RCs with CAP (p<0.05), while no significant differences in surface roughness were observed between RCs with CAP (p>0.05). There were no significant changes in surface roughness before and after immersion in various solutions. The results for color change (ΔE00) were statistically significant. Neo Spectra ST showed the lowest tendency for color change, while Filtek Z350XT displayed a moderate potential, and Omnichroma and Charisma Diamond One showed the highest potential for color change."
"Schools play a key role in supporting, protecting, and advocating for LGBTQ students. However, educational programs worldwide tend to exclude and marginalize LGBTQ issues, especially when it comes to ethnic and racial minorities. In the current study, we examined Arab school counselors' experiences of working with Arab-Muslim LGBTQ youth. After 100 counselors declined to participate, the study included semi-structured interviews with 60 female counselors in Arab-Muslim schools in Israel. Data were analyzed using interpretive phenomenological analysis. Four main themes emerged: religious considerations, causal explanations of LGBTQ orientation, working practices, and supportive resources. Our findings point to the unique challenges facing Arab school counselors who are torn between their professional values and traditional norms. Among the strategies counselors used for managing this tension were separating LGBTQ orientation from LGBTQ adolescents, passive listening while avoiding proactive inquiry, and referring to LBGTQ orientation as a transient phase. Our findings emphasize the need to develop culturally relevant programs that address LGBTQ orientation for students, teachers, and families."
"The resolution of most spatially resolved transcriptomic technologies usually cannot attain the single-cell level, limiting their applications in biological discoveries. Here, we introduce ImSpiRE, an image feature-aided spatial resolution enhancement method for in situ capturing spatial transcriptome. Taking the information stored in histological images, ImSpiRE solves an optimal transport problem to redistribute the expression profiles of spots to construct new transcriptional profiles with enhanced resolution, together with extending the gene expression profiles into unmeasured regions. Applications to multiple datasets confirm that ImSpiRE can enhance spatial resolution to the subspot level while contributing to the discovery of tissue domains, signaling communication patterns, and spatiotemporal characterization."
"In-vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a non-invasive method of analyzing choline metabolism that has been used to predict breast cancer prognosis. A strong choline peak may be a surrogate for aggressive tumor biology but its clinical relevance is unclear. The present study assessed whether total choline (tCho), as measured by proton MRS, can predict late recurrence in patients with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, HER2-negative early breast cancer."
This study sought to conduct a comprehensive search for genetic risk of cognitive decline in the context of geriatric depression.
"Tumor associated epilepsy is a common and debilitating co-morbidity of brain tumors, for which inadequate treatments are available. Additionally, animal models suggest a potential link between seizures and tumor progression. Our group has previously described a mouse model of diffusely infiltrating glioma and associated chronic epilepsy. G protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels are important regulators of neuronal excitability, but their development as a target of antiseizure medications has been hampered by cross-reactivity with GIRK channels in the heart. Recently GiGA1, a novel GIRK agonist that is highly selective for brain tissue, was developed and shown to have antiseizure properties in an acute chemoconvulsant model. Here, we test GiGA1 ex vivo in our established mouse model of tumor associated epilepsy, demonstrating that a highly selective, small-molecule GIRK agonist can reduce seizure-like activity in the peritumoral region, where neurons and glioma cells interact and from which focal seizures arise."

"Obesity and related health challenges remain significant concerns in Cyprus and Greece. Mindful eating (ME) has emerged as a behavioral approach to address these issues, yet its relationship with BMI, vitamin D levels, and sleep duration in Mediterranean populations is underexplored."
"Chloramphenicol (CAP) is a once widely used antibiotic, which is able to cause great harm to human health, is banned in some countries or organizations such as China, USA and the European Union for animal breeding. Because CAP in pig hair degraded slower and had amount of residues, pig hair could be used as the target to detect CAP residues. In this study, a competitive lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA), whose label was aggregation induced emission fluorescent nanobeads (AIEFN), was firstly developed for the detection of CAP in pig hair samples. It exhibited a low limit of detection (0.001 μg/kg) and a broad linear range (0.0025-0.32 μg/kg). The recovery rate and coefficient variation with spiked pig hair samples were 88.50%-106.17 % and 1.01%-7.37 %, which indicated good accuracy of this assay. The result of AIEFN-LFIA for the detection of CAP in pig hair was consistent with that of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. This assay was rapid with the total detection duration of about 20 min. AIEFN-LFIA was able to be used for rapid, sensitive, accurate and convenient detection of CAP residues in pig hair samples."
"Persistent debates exist regarding the superiority of neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) over adjuvant therapy (AT) for patients with T1c, node-negative, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (HER2+) breast cancer, and relevant guidelines for these patients are lacking."
"Cumin, a popular spice, is widely used to treat stomach ailments in Central Asia and Xinjiang, China. Cumin essential oil has been found to effectively treat gastric ulcers, but its pharmacodynamic basis remains unclear. In this study, cumin essential oil was directly separated using column chromatography, and its components were identified through multi-dimensional gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Finally, the cumin essential oil was fractionated into E1, E2, and E3. The effects of these fractions on gastric ulcers were studied using an anhydrous ethanol-induced rat model. The results indicated that the three fractions decreased ulcer index, gastric fluid pH, and pepsin activity to different extents. They lowered the levels of prostaglandin E2, gastrin, and epidermal growth factor in rat serum. According to an analysis of the above indices, E3 fraction had the best anti-ulcer effect. The detection results of the oxidative stress and inflammatory factors showed that all three fractions relieved the ethanol-induced oxidative stress and reduced the release of inflammatory factors to varying degrees. The E3 fraction played the most significant role. The E3 fraction was selected to explore the relevant mechanism, and the results showed that E3 fraction significantly prevented the cleaved caspase-3 and Bax protein levels that were ethanol-induced and resisted apoptosis induced by ethanol injury. The western blot results for detecting the NF-κB-related pathway protein showed that E3 fraction significantly inhibited the activation of p-p65, p-IKKβ, and p-IκBα. The study found that the E3 fraction of cumin essential oil had the most effective anti-ulcer effect by inhibiting NF-κB activation and apoptosis, thus reducing inflammation."

"Prior incidence estimates of psoriatic arthritis (PsA) vary considerably. We aimed to assess the annual incidence of clinically diagnosed PsA among adults in Sweden in 2014-2016, overall and stratified by age/sex/education/geography, and to investigate potential time trends in incidence in 2006-2018. Use of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) during the 2 years after diagnosis was also examined."
"Ischemic stroke is a prevalent clinical condition that poses a significant global challenge. Developing innovative strategies to address this issue is crucial. Annexin A1 (ANXA1), a key member of the annexin superfamily, performs various functions, such as inhibiting inflammatory factor release, promoting phagocytosis, and blocking leukocyte migration. Evidence indicates that ANXA1 plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke. The present article reviews involvement of ANXA1 in anti‑atherosclerosis, inflammatory processes, blood‑brain barrier protection, platelet aggregation and anti‑apoptotic mechanisms. The potential applications of ANXA1 in treating ischemic stroke are also explored."
"Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infectious disease is a phenomenon whereby host antibodies increase the severity of an infection. It is well established in viral infections but ADE also has an underappreciated role during bacterial, fungal and parasitic infections. ADE can occur during both primary infections and re-infections with the same or a related pathogen; therefore, understanding the underlying mechanisms of ADE is critical for understanding the pathogenesis and progression of many infectious diseases. Here, we review the four distinct mechanisms by which antibodies increase disease severity during an infection. We discuss the most established mechanistic explanation for ADE, where cross-reactive, disease-enhancing antibodies bound to pathogens interact with Fc receptors, thereby enhancing pathogen entry or replication, ultimately increasing the total pathogen load. Additionally, we explore how some pathogenic antibodies can shield bacteria from complement-dependent killing, thereby enhancing bacterial survival. We interrogate the molecular mechanisms by which antibodies can amplify inflammation to drive severe disease, even in the absence of increased pathogen replication. We also examine emerging roles for autoantibodies in enhancing the pathogenesis of infectious diseases. Finally, we discuss how we can leverage these insights to improve vaccine design and future treatments for infectious diseases."
"Primary healthcare has emerged as a powerful global concept, but little attention has been directed towards the pivotal role of the healthcare workforce and the diverse institutional setting in which they work.

"As the single link between leaves and the rest of the plant, petioles must develop conductive tissues according to the water influx and sugar outflow of the leaf lamina. A scaling relationship between leaf area and anatomical traits of xylem and phloem is expected to improve the efficiency of these tissues. However, the different constraints compromising the functionality of both tissues (e.g., risk of cavitation) must not be disregarded. Additionally, deciduous and evergreen plants may have different strategies to produce and package their petiole conduits to cope with environmental restrictions. We explored in 33 oak species the relationships between petiole anatomical traits, leaf area, stomatal conductance, and photosynthesis rate. Results showed allometric scaling between anatomical structure of xylem and phloem with leaf area. We also found correlations between photosynthesis rate, stomatal conductance, and anatomical traits in the petiole. The main novelty is how oaks present a different strategy depending on the leaf habit. Deciduous species tend to increase their diameters to achieve greater leaf-specific conductivity. By contrast, evergreen oaks develop larger xylem conductive areas for a given leaf area than deciduous ones. This trade-off between safety-efficiency in petioles has never been attributed to the leaf habit of the species."
"A colorimetric chemosensor array based on an indicator displacement assay has achieved not only visualization of differences in hormone structures but also quantitative detection of sex hormones in their mixtures. Furthermore, the chemosensor array has allowed the detection of a steroid hormone in diluted human saliva."
"The objective of this study was to compare the properties of core-shell nanoparticles with a PLGA core and shells composed of different types of polymers, focusing on their structural integrity. The core PLGA nanoparticles were prepared either through a high-pressure homogenization-solvent evaporation technique or nanoprecipitation, using poloxamer 188 (P188), a copolymer of divinyl ether with maleic anhydride (DIVEMA), and human serum albumin (HSA) as the shell-forming polymers. The shells were formed through adsorption, interfacial embedding, or conjugation. For dual fluorescent labeling, the core- and shell-forming polymers were conjugated with Cyanine5, Cyanine3, and rhodamine B. The nanoparticles had negative zeta potentials and sizes ranging from 100 to 250 nm (measured using DLS) depending on the shell structure and preparation technique. The core-shell structure was confirmed using TEM and fluorescence spectroscopy, with the appearance of FRET phenomena due to the donor-acceptor properties of the labels. All of the shells enhanced the cellular uptake of the nanoparticles in Gl261 murine glioma cells. The integrity of the core-shell structures upon their incubation with the cells was evidenced by intracellular colocalization of the fluorescent labels according to the Manders' colocalization coefficients. This comprehensive approach may be useful for the selection of the optimal preparation method even at the early stages of the core-shell nanoparticle development."
"Water deficits, exacerbated by climate change and unpredictable weather, have become a significant global challenge to agricultural productivity. In this context, exogenous melatonin treatment is well documented as a stress alleviator; however, its effects on various biological processes, particularly in less-explored genotypes, remain understudied. This study aimed to enhance water deficit resilience in sweet corn by applying foliar melatonin to four genotypes-Messenger, Dessert, Royalty, and Tyson under two levels of water deprivation induced by polyethylene glycol at 8% and 12% concentrations in a hydroponic, controlled environment."
"Phenanthrene is classified as a priority environmental pollutant because of its impact on the environment and on human health as a mutagenic and carcinogenic agent. The aim of this study was isolated and identified new bacteria with the capability to degrade phenanthrene from Reynosa, Mexico."
"The anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a are products of the complement cascade that play important and interrelated roles in health and disease. Both are potential targets for anti-inflammatory active immunotherapies in which a patient's own immune system is stimulated to produce therapeutic immune responses against problematic self-molecules. However, the complex and time-dependent interrelations between the two molecules make dual targeting challenging. To investigate a dual-target active immunotherapy against C3a and C5a and to systematically study the effect of varied degrees of responses against both targets, the study employed self-assembled peptide immunogens capable of displaying a broad range of epitope compositions and Design-of-Experiments (DoE) approaches. Peptide nanofibers contained B-cell epitopes of C3a and C5a in defined quantities, and intranasal immunization raised systemic and mucosal immunity against each target. In a lipopolysaccharide-induced model of sepsis, increasing anti-C5a responses are protective, whereas increasing anti-C3a responses are detrimental, and survival rates are negatively correlated with anti-C3a/anti-C5a IgG titer ratio. This work highlights the interplay between the two molecules by making use of a modular, defined, and easily adjusted biomaterial-based active immunotherapy platform."
"Seborrheic keratosis (SK) is a prevalent hyperkeratotic dermatological condition characterized by benign proliferation of epidermal keratinocytes, typically occurring in the middle to advanced stages of life. While the trunk is the primary site for lesions, they can also manifest on the extremities, face, and scalp. Although SK is typically benign, there can be morphological overlap with malignant skin lesions, necessitating meticulous differentiation for an accurate diagnosis. This case report describes a 63-year-old male presenting with scalp swelling that was, initially suspected to be malignant. However, histopathological examination revealed pigmented seborrheic keratosis, prompting the need for a comprehensive management approach. Surgical excision with a rotational flap cover was performed successfully, highlighting the importance of precise diagnosis and management in addressing cutaneous lesions. The exact etiology of SK remains elusive, with potential genetic associations implicated in its pathogenesis. Although treatment may not always be necessary, various modalities are available for lesion removal or symptom management, with surgical intervention reserved for cases exhibiting signs of malignancy. Clinicians should be aware of the atypical presentations of SK and, emphasize the need for a multidisciplinary approach involving dermatologists, pathologists, and surgeons for optimal outcomes."
"The present study aims to summarize the current biomarker landscape in gynecological cancers (GCs) and incorporate bioinformatics analysis to highlight specific biological processes. The literature was retrieved from PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Scopus, Ovid Medline, and Cochrane Library. The final search was conducted on December 7, 2022. Prospective registration was completed with the PROSPERO with registration number CRD42023477145. This systematic review covered proteomic research on biomarkers for cervical, endometrial, and ovarian cancers. The PANTHER classification system was used to classify the shortlisted candidate biomarkers (CBs), and the STRING database was utilized to visualize protein-protein interaction networks. A total of 23 articles were included in this systematic review. Consistently regulated CBs in the GCs include collagen alpha-2(I) chain, collagen alpha-1(III) chain, collagen alpha-2(V) chain, calreticulin, protein disulfide-isomerase A3, heat shock protein family A (Hsp70) member 5, prolyl 4-hydroxylase, beta polypeptide, fibrinogen alpha chain, fibrinogen gamma chain, apolipoprotein B-100, apolipoprotein C-IV, and apolipoprotein M. In conclusion, collagens, fibrinogens, chaperones, and apolipoproteins were revealed to be replicated in GCs and to be regulated consistently. These CBs contribute to GC etiology and physiology by participating in collagen fibril organization, blood coagulation, protein folding in endoplasmic reticulum, and lipid transporter activity."

"Evidence suggests that Extracorporeal Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (ECPR) can improve survival rates for nontraumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). However, when ECPR is indicated over 50% of potential candidates are unable to qualify in the current hospital-based system due to geographic limitations. This study employs a Geographic Information System (GIS) model to estimate the number of ECPR eligible patients within the United States in the current hospital-based system, a prehospital ECPR ground-based system, and a prehospital ECPR Helicopter Emergency Medical Services (HEMS)-based system."
"Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluate the efficacy of an intervention remain underutilized in community-based environmental health research. RCTs that use a pragmatic design emphasize the effectiveness of interventions in complex, real world settings. Pragmatic trials may be especially relevant when community-based interventions address social and environmental determinants that threaten health equity. The revised Pragmatic Explanatory Continuum Indicator Summary (PRECIS-2) is a validated tool developed in 2015 by trialists to ensure that clinical trials are designed to fit their intended purpose, with an assessment of applicability of the trial results to specific contexts. The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to ask Ecolectivos study investigators and external implementation scientists to evaluate the Ecolectivos study protocol using the PRECIS-2 tool prior to the launch of the trial. Ecolectivos is an implementation science study, using a village-level cluster randomized controlled trial design, to assess a behavioral intervention to reduce household plastic waste burning in rural Guatemala."
"Infertility has become one of the most serious diseases worldwide, and 50% of this disease can be attributed to male-related factors. Spermatogenesis, by definition, is a complex process by which spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) self-renew to maintain stem cell population within the testes and differentiate into mature spermatids. It is of great significance to uncover gene regulation and signaling pathways that are involved in the fate determinations of SSCs with aims to better understand molecular mechanisms underlying human spermatogenesis and identify novel targets for gene therapy of male infertility. Significant achievement has recently been made in demonstrating the signaling molecules and pathways mediating the fate decisions of mammalian SSCs. In this review, we address key gene regulation and crucial signaling transduction pathways in controlling the self-renewal, differentiation, and apoptosis of SSCs, and we illustrate the networks of genes and signaling pathways in SSC fate determinations. We also highlight perspectives and future directions in SSC regulation by genes and their signaling pathways. This review could provide novel insights into the genetic regulation of normal and abnormal spermatogenesis and offer molecular targets to develop new approaches for gene therapy of male infertility."
Asthma is a chronic non-communicable disease considered a serious health problem worldwide. The Chronic Care Model promotes the self-management of patients' chronic conditions. This process requires an active engagement of health professionals to provide education for patients to manage their disease better.
"Microtia is a common congenital craniofacial malformation, with concha-type microtia presenting unique challenges due to the relatively large residual auricle tissue and flexible surgical methods. The authors employed triangular flaps combined with full-thickness skin graft technique for treating concha-type microtia, achieving marked treatment effects."
"Domestic alarms are highly personal technological appendages that help us achieve an individual sense of safety and familial well-being-like baby monitors that help us care for children and alarm clocks that ensure a daily routine and help us get to work on time. Alarms can be understood as technologies that extend our eyes, ears, and memory to monitor our homes and ourselves in various ways beyond typical human capacity. The designs of domestic alarms tend to favour audible forms of alerting, and disabled users and inventors have hacked and redesigned alarms to fit their own families' needs. Alarm design can tell us what type of domestic futures designers and technologists have imagined, casting visions about who is fit for parenthood and who is a reliable worker, and what types of futures disabled users imagined for themselves. As the future of these technologies becomes subsumed into smartphones and other IoT devices, a look into their predigital material forms uncovers episodes of disability agencies that assert a right to disability futures of domestic bliss and safety. Through the archives of The Deaf American and other deaf community publications, this research reviews the postwar alarm designs of Emerson Romero, a Cuban-American deaf activist and engineer, to show how deaf-led alarm designs are forms of material rhetoric that assert a right to a domestic future for disabled parents and workers."
"In this issue of JEM, Sparano et al. (https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.20240930) present compelling evidence that salivary gland trNK cells originate from cNK cells and are developmentally distinct from ILC1 cells. Mechanistically, they demonstrate that continuous autocrine TGF-β signaling drives salivary gland tissue residency and works in synergy with IL-15 to enhance Hobit-dependent cytotoxicity."
"Immunoglobulin G4-related disease (IgG4-RD) and plasma cell-type idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease (PC-iMCD) have many overlapping features. Their differential diagnosis is challenging and crucial for clinical management due to their different prognoses and treatments. However, reports that compare these conditions are scarce, especially for patients with lung involvement. In this study, we attempted to clarify the clinical and radiologic differences in lung involvement between IgG4-RD and PC-iMCD."
"Radiologists' traditional role in the diagnostic process is to respond to specific clinical questions and reduce uncertainty enough to permit treatment decisions to be made. This charge is rapidly evolving due to forces such as artificial intelligence (AI), big data (opportunistic imaging, imaging prognostication), and advanced diagnostic technologies. A new modernistic paradigm is emerging whereby radiologists, in conjunction with computer algorithms, will be tasked with extracting as much information from imaging data as possible, often without a specific clinical question being posed and independent of any stated clinical need. In addition, AI algorithms are increasingly able to predict long-term outcomes using data from seemingly normal examinations, enabling AI-assisted prognostication. As these algorithms become a standard component of radiology practice, the sheer amount of information they demand will increase the need for streamlined workflows, communication, and data management techniques. In addition, the provision of such information raises reimbursement, liability, and access issues. Guidelines will be needed to ensure that all patients have access to the benefits of this new technology and guarantee that mined data do not inadvertently create harm. In this Review, we discuss the challenges and opportunities relevant to radiologists in this changing landscape, with an emphasis on ensuring that radiologists provide high-value care."

"Group B streptococcus (GBS) is a major global cause of neonatal, infant, and maternal infections. In Japan, national guidelines based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations mandate culture-based screening and intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) for GBS-positive pregnant women. Despite initial reductions in GBS infections, the incidence has plateaued, and there are notable limitations in current prevention methods. Approximately 15% of pregnant women are not screened for GBS, and intermittent colonization undermines screening accuracy, contributing to early-onset disease. IAP does not prevent late-onset disease, the incidence of which is increasing in Japan. This study reviewed maternal and neonatal GBS colonization using polymerase chain reaction, evaluated capsular type distributions, and explored late-onset disease infection routes. Among 525 mother-neonate pairs, the study found a higher detection rate of GBS via polymerase chain reaction compared to culture methods and identified significant discrepancies between antepartum and intrapartum colonization. GBS was detected in 3.5% of neonates from initially negative mothers at 4 days of age. Capsular types varied between mothers and neonates, indicating potential horizontal transmission. This study underscores the need for improved rapid diagnostic tests and highlights the potential of maternal GBS vaccination as a future prevention strategy."
"Coronary artery stenosis detection remains a challenging task due to the complex vascular structure, poor quality of imaging pictures, poor vessel contouring caused by breathing artifacts and stenotic lesions that often appear in a small region of the image. In order to improve the accuracy and efficiency of detection, a new deep-learning technique based on a coronary artery stenosis detection framework (DCA-YOLOv8) is proposed in this paper. The framework consists of a histogram equalization and canny edge detection preprocessing (HEC) enhancement module, a double coordinate attention (DCA) feature extraction module and an output module that combines a newly designed loss function, named adaptive inner-CIoU (AICI). This new framework is called DCA-YOLOv8. The experimental results show that the DCA-YOLOv8 framework performs better than existing object detection algorithms in coronary artery stenosis detection, with precision, recall, F1-score and mean average precision (mAP) at 96.62%, 95.06%, 95.83% and 97.6%, respectively. In addition, the framework performs better in the classification task, with accuracy at 93.2%, precision at 92.94%, recall at 93.5% and F1-score at 93.22%. Despite the limitations of data volume and labeled data, the proposed framework is valuable in applications for assisting the cardiac team in making decisions by using coronary angiography results."
"The central nervous system is affected by multiple sclerosis (MS), a chronic autoimmune illness characterized by axonal destruction, demyelination, and inflammation. This article summarizes the state of the field, highlighting its complexity and significant influence on people's quality of life. The research employs a network pharmacological approach, integrating systems biology, bioinformatics, and pharmacology to identify biomarkers associated with MS. Utilizing Nelumbo Nucifera (Lotus) seeds, the study involves toxicity assessments, biomolecule screening, and target prediction. Advanced computational methodologies are employed, including molecular docking and dynamic simulations, to assess potential therapeutic interactions. Biomolecule screening identifies eight active compounds from Lotus seeds, including Anonaine and Liriodenine. Target prediction reveals 264 common targets with MS-related genes. Protein-protein interaction analysis establishes a complex network, identifying central targets like SRC and AKT1. Bioinformatics enrichment analysis uncovers potential therapeutic candidates and pathways. A Biomolecule-Target-Pathway network diagram visualizes interactions, with Anonaine and Liriodenine exhibiting strong binding affinities in molecular docking studies. Molecular dynamics simulations provide insights into dynamic interactions. In conclusion, through advanced computational techniques, it unveils molecular interactions, potential therapies, and pathways, bridging predictions with practical applications. Anonaine and Liriodenine show promise in curbing MS biomarkers."
"WHAT IS KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT?: In the past 2 years, the COVID-19 pandemic had a robust negative impact on the mental health of healthcare providers, with increasing rates of depression, anxiety, acute stress and burnout. Healthcare workers experiencing poor mental health are reluctant to seek help and treatment because they are afraid of being stigmatized and excluded by their colleagues and employers. During the pandemic positive emotions, resilience and psychological well-being buffered distress and burnout in healthcare workers. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: This paper describes positive mental health, depression, anxiety and burnout in healthcare workers during the second wave of the pandemic. Forty-eight per cent of healthcare workers were flourishing (high levels of positive emotions and well-being), 10% languishing (absence of well-being and positivity). Flourishing individuals reported lower levels of depression, anxiety and burnout. These findings documented a relevant number of resilient healthcare workers, who restored/maintained their well-being also under stressful conditions. Vulnerable healthcare workers were less than 20%, and they reported severe anxiety, depression and burnout. No differences emerged between languishing and moderate mental health groups in their levels of anxiety, depression and burnout. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: The condition of flourishing is the only one that provides protection from depression and anxiety and burnout, while moderate mental health does not differ substantially from the languishing state. The study confirms the importance of maintaining and/or promoting the well-being of healthcare workers. Interventions for promoting positive mental health of vulnerable workers are needed. Mental health nurses can have the skills and expertise for evaluating early symptoms of psychological distress and for implementing interventions for promoting and restoring well-being. These interventions may include informational campaign (i.e. preparing and distributing pamphlets and guidelines) and emotional support programmes (psychoeducation and training, mental health support team, peer support and counselling) that can be delivered also via digital platforms."
Self-awareness is a multifaceted phenomenon that comprises two main concepts: general awareness and online awareness. The latter is an emerging concept that requires further consensus on its definition. The aim of this paper is to define the key components of online awareness and identify approaches for measuring this concept for adults with neurological conditions.
"The Pfam protein families database is a comprehensive collection of protein domains and families used for genome annotation and protein structure and function analysis (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/). This update describes major developments in Pfam since 2020, including decommissioning the Pfam website and integration with InterPro, harmonization with the ECOD structural classification, and expanded curation of metagenomic, microprotein and repeat-containing families. We highlight how AlphaFold structure predictions are being leveraged to refine domain boundaries and identify new domains. New families discovered through large-scale sequence similarity analysis of AlphaFold models are described. We also detail the development of Pfam-N, which uses deep learning to expand family coverage, achieving an 8.8% increase in UniProtKB coverage compared to standard Pfam. We discuss plans for more frequent Pfam releases integrated with InterPro and the potential for artificial intelligence to further assist curation. Despite recent advances, many protein families remain to be classified, and Pfam continues working toward comprehensive coverage of the protein universe."

"Despite significant advancements in HIV treatment, virological outcomes remain a critical issue. Ethiopia did not meet the 90:90:90 targets set for 2020, which aimed for 90% of people on antiretroviral therapy to achieve viral suppression. As the country shifts its focus toward the 95:95:95 targets for 2030-seeking to achieve 95% viral suppression among those on ART-it is crucial to deepen our understanding of viral suppression and the factors that influence it."
"Bioluminescence is a functional property used by many marine organisms for multilateral communications. In the Arabian Sea, the dinoflagellate Noctiluca scintillans (Macartney) Kofoid and Swezy, 1921, contributes gradually to the bioluminescent potential (BP) of the phytoplankton community. Experiments, field sampling, and remote sensing were employed, to estimate the seasonal variation of the BP and the abundance of cells in the northwestern Arabian Sea. An experimental setup for BP measurements integrated a ""Chelsea Instruments"" GlowTracka sensor, which required ~5 N. scintillans cells to obtain a statistically robust signal. Plankton were sampled with 200-μm mesh size nets, in the upper mixed layer. Also, N. scintillans cells were counted in Niskin bottle samples collected from the deep chlorophyll maximum. The remotely sensed chlorophyll-a concentration was analyzed, for the period from 2000 to 2022. A positive linear relationship between the abundance of N. scintillans cells in experiments and their BP was elucidated. Peaks of BP in experiments fit the Northeast and Southwest Monsoon periods and so did the N. scintillans abundance peaks in situ. These findings showed that BP may serve as an indicator of N. scintillans abundance and biomass in the northwestern Arabian Sea."
"Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is increasingly common but its pathogenesis is poorly understood. The ability to assess genetic and pharmacologic interventions is hampered by the lack of robust preclinical mouse models of HFpEF. We developed a novel ""two-hit"" model, which combines obesity and insulin resistance with chronic pressure overload to recapitulate clinical features of HFpEF. C57Bl6/NJ mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for > 10 weeks were administered an AAV8-driven vector resulting in constitutive overexpression of mouse Renin1d. HFD-Renin (aka ""HFpEF"") mice demonstrated obesity and insulin resistance, moderate left ventricular hypertrophy, preserved systolic function, and diastolic dysfunction indicated by echocardiographic measurements; increased left atrial mass; elevated natriuretic peptides; and exercise intolerance. Transcriptomic and metabolomic profiling of HFD-Renin myocardium demonstrated upregulation of pro-fibrotic pathways and downregulation of metabolic pathways, in particular branched chain amino acid catabolism, similar to human HFpEF. Treatment with empagliflozin, an effective but incompletely understood HFpEF therapy, improved multiple endpoints. The HFD-Renin mouse model recapitulates key features of human HFpEF and will enable studies dissecting the contribution of individual pathogenic drivers to this complex syndrome. Additional preclinical HFpEF models allow for orthogonal studies to increase validity in assessment of interventions."
"The increasing incidence of opioid use disorder (OUD) among pregnant women in the United States constitutes a significant public health concern, jeopardizing both maternal and fetal health. Proposed solutions include opioid maintenance therapy, telemedicine, and integrated prenatal care centers. These strategies seek to mitigate harm and enhance therapeutic accessibility, yet encounter obstacles, including stigma, technological access, and ethical problems. While opioid maintenance therapy stabilizes addiction, telemedicine expands access, and integrated centers streamline care, each strategy requires policy support, community acceptance, and further evaluation to optimize outcomes for pregnant women with OUD."

"Chronic pain is a critical public health issue that severely impacts quality of life and poses significant treatment challenges, particularly due to the risk of adverse effects associated with pharmacological therapies. The search for effective non-invasive treatment alternatives has become increasingly relevant. Low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) has been identified as an effective non-invasive strategy for pain management, although the underlying mechanism remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the analgesic effects and cellular mechanisms of LIFU-induced neuromodulation targeted on dorsal root ganglia (DRG) in both inflammatory and neuropathic pain models."
Preliminary examination of emotional awareness/expression relationships with pain in people with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and chronic pain (CP) and exploration of psychological factors as mediators or moderators of these relationships.
"Dysphagia is a common gastrointestinal complaint in the pediatric population and should raise concern for oropharyngeal as well as esophageal disorders. We describe a 7-year old patient who was admitted to the hospital for sudden onset dysphagia, abdominal pain, and decreased oral intake. Extensive evaluations including endoscopy eventually revealed herpes simplex esophagitis as well as eosinophilic esophagitis. Herpes simplex esophagitis is a rare condition in the immunocompetent population and is typically self-resolving. Eosinophilic esophagitis is a chronic, inflammatory condition characterized by esophageal eosinophilia and signs of esophageal dysfunction. The concurrent presentation of both conditions in the pediatric population has rarely been described."
"Extraforaminal lumbar disc herniation (ELDH) represents a unique clinical entity, presenting particular challenges in surgical management. Transforaminal lumbar endoscopic discectomy (TLED) represents a minimally invasive, full-endoscopic procedure that is increasingly selected for surgical treatment of lumbar disc herniation, being theoretically ideal in patients with ELDH. Performance of TLED for management of ELDH has been reported in specific studies in the recent literature. However, foraminal anatomy is significantly disrupted in cases of ELDH, a fact that may represent a true challenge for the operating surgeon, in terms of proper endoscopic visualization. Hence, the aim of this study was to investigate midterm clinical outcomes of a unique modification of the TLED technique in patients with ELDH, in an attempt to enhance endoscopic visualization of foraminal structures and to facilitate safe and effective decompression in these cases."
"By the end of 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting from the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), had diffused widely across the globe, with 770 million infected individuals and over 7 million deaths reported. In addition to its high infectivity and pathogenicity and its rapid mutation rate, the unique capacity of SARS-CoV-2 to circumvent the immune system has also contributed to the widespread nature of this pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 elicits the onset of innate immune system activation and initiates antiviral responses once it has infected the host. While battling the host's immune responses, SARS-CoV-2 has established many countermeasures to evade attack and clearance. As the exploration of SARS-CoV-2 continues, substantial evidence has revealed that the 29 proteins synthesized by the SARS-CoV-2 genome are integral to the viral infection process. They not only facilitate viral replication and transmission, but also assist SARS-CoV-2 in escaping the host's immune defenses, positioning them as promising therapeutic targets that have attracted considerable attention in recent studies. This review summarizes the manner in which SARS-CoV-2 interfaces with the innate immune system, with a particular focus on the continuous evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and the implications of mutations."
"The Spectrum of Involvement describes six levels of active patient involvement in healthcare education. Only at the highest levels are patients described as 'equal partners'. Although this framework was never intended to be hierarchical, healthcare educators continue to strive towards aspirations for involving patients as 'equal partners' in education. However, we do not know what these partnerships mean for all stakeholders and how they can be achieved in practice. This study explores key stakeholders' understandings and experiences of patient partnerships in healthcare education."
Anastomotic leakage (AL) is a serious complication that may occur following the double stapling technique (DST). The study aims to investigate the efficacy of anastomotic reinforcement using barbed sutures in preventing AL after laparoscopic low anterior resection (LAR) for rectal cancer.
"Ferroptosis is a unique form of iron-dependent cell death characterized by dramatic ultrastructural changes in mitochondria. Since mitochondria are intracellular energy factories and binding sites for producing reactive oxygen species, there is increasing evidence that mitochondria are closely related to ferroptosis and play a crucial role in the regulation and execution of ferroptosis. The pH of the mitochondrial microenvironment is an important parameter for cellular physiological activities. Its abnormal fluctuations are commonly thought to be associated with cancers and other diseases. Herein, a surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)-based pH nanosensor with high sensitivity and targeting function was utilized to quantify and monitor mitochondrial pH value. This nanosensor was constructed by gold nanorods (AuNRs) functionalized with pH-responsive molecules (4-mercaptopyridine, MPy) and mitochondrion-targeting peptides (AMMT) that can precisely deliver AuNRs to mitochondria. Super-resolution fluorescence imaging was employed to evidence the mitochondrial targeting feature of this nanosensor. Ferroptosis regulation induces intracellular accumulation of lipid peroxide (LPO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), which cause changes in the mitochondrial pH. This method reveals that ferroptosis leads to the gradual acidification of the mitochondrial internal environment. The conclusion deduced by this study will be helpful for the evaluation and diagnosis of diseases according to intracellular abnormal microenvironments."
"Several proton pump inhibitor (PPI) dosing regimens that vary by strength and frequency (once [Qday] or twice [BID] daily) are available to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). We performed an updated systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the impact of various PPI regimens on esophageal healing and GERD and heartburn symptoms. To identify relevant studies, we searched EMBASE and PubMed in January 2023, which yielded 1381 records. Eligible RCTs included those that enrolled adults diagnosed with GERD and compared different dosing regimens within the same PPI. The outcomes were esophageal healing and resolution of GERD and heartburn symptoms within 12 weeks (i.e. short-term) and > 12 weeks (i.e. long-term). Meta-analysis pooling of the odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were estimated using the random-effects inverse-variance model. Overall, a total of 38 RCTs across 20 countries (N = 15,540 patients, mean age 50 years, 55% male) were included. Most PPI trials compared half standard dose Qday versus standard dose Qday or standard dose Qday versus double standard dose Qday. In general, when considering daily dosing, higher PPI strength significantly improved esophageal healing and relief of GERD symptoms both in the short- and long-term. Fewer trials compared Qday versus BID dosing; the impact of BID dosing on outcomes was inconsistent across the different PPI strength comparisons. In conclusion, this meta-analysis revealed that increasing PPI Qday dosages led to improved GERD outcomes. However, few studies compared Qday to BID dosing; as twice daily PPI usage is common in clinical practice, further studies are warranted to determine whether such dosing improves clinical outcomes."
"Angioinvasive fungal sinusitis (AIFS) is a rapidly progressive, highly morbid infection. It can be challenging to obtain an early diagnosis, but intervention in the acute period is crucial for prognosis. Previous literature has identified numerous radiographic features with high sensitivity and specificity for AIFS, even in early disease. Bedside nasal endoscopy can substantiate the diagnosis but can also yield false negative results. Initially, these patients may present to the ophthalmologist. Thus, to avoid visual and potentially life-threatening complications, subtle clinical signs in conjunction with suspicious radiographic features must be promptly recognized by the ophthalmologist and escalated appropriately. We review, for the benefit of the ophthalmic community, the salient radiographic features of AIFS and integrate them into a decision-making algorithm for diagnostic workup and management."
"Structural, functional, and molecular-level changes in the aging heart are influenced by a dynamic interplay between immune signaling and cellular metabolism that is referred to as immunometabolism. This review explores the crosstalk between cellular metabolic pathways including glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, fatty acid metabolism, and the immune processes that govern cardiac aging. With a rapidly aging population that coincides with increased cardiovascular risk and cancer incidence rates, understanding the immunometabolic underpinnings of cardiac aging provides a foundation for identifying therapeutic targets to mitigate cardiac dysfunction. Aging alters the immune environment of the heart by concomitantly driving the changes in immune cell metabolism, mitochondrial dysfunction, and redox signaling. Shifts in these metabolic pathways exacerbate inflammation and impair tissue repair, creating a vicious cycle that accelerates cardiac functional decline. Treatment with cancer therapy further complicates this landscape, as aging-associated immunometabolic disruptions augment the susceptibility to cardiotoxicity. The current review highlights therapeutic strategies that target the immunometabolic axis to alleviate cardiac aging pathologies. Interventions include modulating metabolic intermediates, improving mitochondrial function, and leveraging immune signaling pathways to restore cardiac health. Advances in immunometabolism thus hold significant potential for translating preclinical findings into therapies that improve the quality of life for the aging population and underscore the need for approaches that address the immunometabolic mechanisms of cardiac aging, providing a framework for future research."

"Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 5 (PCSK5) is a member of the proprotein convertase (PC) family, which processes immature proteins into functional proteins and plays an important role in the process of cell migration and transformation. Andrographolide is a non-peptide compound with PC inhibition and antitumor activity. Our research aimed to investigate the functional role of PCSK5 downregulation combined with Andro on GBM progression. Results from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) and clinical samples revealed a significant upregulation of PCSK5 in GBM tissues than in non-tumor brain tissues. Higher expression of PCSK5 was correlated with advanced GBM stages and worse patient prognosis. PCSK5 knockdown attenuated the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like properties of GBM cells induced by IL-6. PCSK5 knockdown in combination with Andro treatment significantly inhibited the proliferation and invasion of GBM cells in vitro, as well as tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, PCSK5 downregulation reduced the expression of p-STAT3 and Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which could be rescued by the p-STAT3 agonist. STAT3 silencing downregulated the expression of MMPs without affecting PCSK5. Furthermore, Andro in combination with PCSK5 silencing significantly inhibited STAT3/MMPs axis. These observations provided evidence that PCSK5 functioned as a potential tumor promoter by regulating p-STAT3/MMPs and the combination of Andro with PCSK5 silencing might be a good strategy to prevent GBM progression."
"Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is one of the deadliest subtypes of breast cancer, whose high frequency of relapse is often due to resistance to chemotherapy. Here, we identify inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase 2 (IMPDH2) as a contributor to doxorubicin resistance, in multiple TNBC models. Analysis of publicly available datasets reveals elevated IMPDH2 expression to associate with worse overall TNBC prognosis in the clinic, including lower recurrence-free survival post adjuvant/neoadjuvant therapy. Importantly, both genetic depletion and pharmacological inhibition of IMPDH2 leads to reduction of pro-tumorigenic phenotypes in multiple doxorubicin-resistant TNBC models, both in vitro and in vivo. Overall, we propose IMPDH2 as a novel vulnerability that could be leveraged therapeutically to suppress and/or prevent the growth of chemo-resistant lesions."
"Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is a double-stranded DNA gamma herpesvirus. Like other herpesviruses, KSHV establishes a latent infection with limited gene expression, while KSHV occasionally undergoes the lytic replication phase, which produces KSHV progenies and infects neighboring cells. KSHV genome encodes 80+ open reading frames. One of the KSHV genes, K2, encodes viral interleukin 6 (vIL-6), a homolog of human IL-6 (hIL-6), mainly expressed in the lytic phase of the virus. vIL-6 plays a crucial role in regulating the expression of other viral genes and is also associated with inducing angiogenesis, cell survival, and immune evasion, which is suggested to promote the development of KSHV-associated diseases. This review summarizes the current knowledge on vIL-6. We focus on the vIL-6 regarding its protein structure, transcriptional regulation, cell signaling pathways, and contribution to the KSHV-associated diseases."
"Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy can cause hypertension in the future. Understanding how the blood pressure values of women with and without hypertensive disorders of pregnancy differ will facilitate follow-up blood pressure monitoring in clinical settings. This study investigated the association between hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and subsequent high blood pressure and hypertension. This study used Japanese data from the Tohoku Medical Megabank Project Birth and Three-Generation Cohort Study. Follow-up systolic and diastolic blood pressures in normotensive women during pregnancy and those with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy were estimated using analysis of covariance adjusted for women with low birthweight, history of gestational diabetes mellitus, age, body mass index, pulse rate, smoking and drinking at the follow-up assessment, paternal hypertension history, and maternal hypertension or hypertensive disorders of pregnancy history. Finally, we performed a multiple logistic regression analysis. In total, 7343 women were included in the analysis. Women with a history of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy had higher blood pressure approximately three years postpartum compared with normotensive women. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy in the most recent pregnancy in different subgroups, such as nulliparous women, multiparous women without a history of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and multiparous women with a history of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, were associated with an increased risk of subsequent hypertension. Women's birthweight was also weakly associated with hypertension. Even one experience of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy may contribute to elevated blood pressure and hypertension approximately three years postpartum. In addition, women's birthweights may have a weak relationship with increasing blood pressure."
"There is evidence that sarcopenia and functionality are closely related. However, the association between geriatric syndromes, such as dependence, on instrumental activities and sarcopenia could be affected by the presence of certain comorbidities, such as overweight, obesity, diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Therefore, the present study aimed to determine the association between instrumental activities of daily living and muscle mass in the elderly and evaluate the impact of certain comorbidities on this association."
"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) poses a serious threat to human health. Qingzhuan tea (QZT), especially aged QZT, was concerned to have a potential effect on the prevention of colitis. In this study, we aim to assess the feasibility of different aged QZT on the alleviation of colitis induced by DSS."
"While the target of growth of very preterm infants (VPIs) during Neonatal Intensive care unit (NICU) admission is still controversial, the most accepted objective is that they should follow their intrauterine trajectory in terms of growth and body composition (BC). BC is difficult to measure in clinical daily routine but proxies like body ratios and skinfolds have been used. Prenatal and postnatal factors can influence the growth and BC of VPIs in the NICU."
"Brucellosis is a zoonotic disease that causes high rates of morbidity and mortality due to difficulties in diagnosis and inadequate treatment. The purpose of this study was to assess the diagnostic significance of presepsin, trigger receptor expressed on soluble myeloid cells-1 (sTREM-1), and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) levels in patients with brucellosis. One hundred twenty-one brucellosis patients aged 18 or over and 39 healthy volunteers were included in this prospective study. The cases were classified as either acute, subacute or chronic according to the duration of symptoms. Serum was separated from blood samples taken from all groups and presepsin, sTREM-1, and IFN-gamma levels were determined before treatment. Serum presepsin, sTREM-1, and IFN-gamma levels were all significantly elevated in patients with Brucellosis compared to the control group (p< 0.05). Serum presepsin and sTREM-1 levels were also significantly higher in patients with acute brucellosis compared to the subacute and chronic groups (p< 0.05). The lowest serum IFN-gamma levels were observed in the chronic Brucellosis group. Significant moderately strong, positive correlations were determined between presepsin and sTREM-1 and IFN-gamma values (r= 0.695, r= 0.769, p< 0.001). Significant low-level positive correlations were observed between presepsin and AST, BUN and CRP (r= 0.215, r= 0.214, and r= 0.279, respectively p< 0.05). Higher serum presepsin levels were determined in patients with positive blood cultures than in those with no blood culture growth (p< 0.05). At a threshold value of 469.43 pg/mL, the presepsin test exhibited 95% sensitivity and 89% specificity in differentiating cases of Brucellosis from the healthy group. At a threshold value of 27.14 pg/mL, the sTREM-1 test exhibited 93% sensitivity and 84% specificity in differentiating Brucellosis cases from the healthy control group. Serum presepsin, sTREM-1 and IFN-gamma levels may be helpful in distinguishing patients with Brucellosis from healthy individuals and in differentiating between acute, subacute, and chronic Brucellosis."
"Congenital Hyperinsulinism (CHI) has not been previously studied in Ukraine. We therefore aimed to elucidate the genetics, clinical phenotype, histological subtype, treatment and long-term outcomes of Ukrainian patients with CHI."
"Interoception, the perception and response to internal bodily states, significantly influences physical and mental wellbeing. While ageing is associated with interoceptive decline, research has primarily examined selective dimensions of interoception. Understanding these changes is vital as the global population ages, addressing age-related health issues and sustaining psychological wellbeing. This systematic review synthesised findings from 22 studies on age-related interoceptive changes and their impact on psychophysiological processes. Results showed age-related declines (48.4 %), no age differences (32.3 %), an age-related increase (16.13 %), and an inverted U-shaped curvilinear relationship (3.23 %) in interoceptive sensitivity across age groups and interoceptive dimensions. Three patterns emerged regarding psychophysiological processes in older adults: altered mind-body connections with age were associated with reduced high-arousal and increased positive emotional experiences, cognitive protective effects, and improved body representation that correlated with better interoceptive sensitivity. These patterns indicate the complex relationships between interoceptive ageing and psychophysiological processes, showing both, aspects of decline and compensatory mechanisms. We propose future research avenues to elucidate the functional significance of different interoceptive dimensions across the lifespan for optimised psychological wellbeing and health behaviours in older adults."
"A significant association between immune cells and sepsis has been suggested by observational studies. However, the precise biological mechanisms underlying this association remain unclear. Therefore, we employed a Mendelian randomization (MR) approach to investigate the causal relationship between immune cells and genetic susceptibility to sepsis, and to explore the potential mediating role of blood metabolites."
"Over 15 000 species of fishes are found globally in the marine environment and DNA barcodes are used extensively to describe, catalogue, understand and manage this diversity. The dataset outlined here represents a DNA barcode reference library of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene (COI) from 9767 voucher specimens (representing at least 2220 species and 288 families) of marine fishes. This publicly available dataset in the Barcode of Life Data System (BOLD) represents 17 years (2005-2022) of barcoding of marine fishes identified from Australian territorial waters. Tissues targeted for sequencing with their matching physical specimens (and extracted DNA), obtained via a multi-agency sampling effort, are mostly maintained and curated by the CSIRO Australian National Fish Collection (ANFC) in Hobart, Australia. Species-level integrated taxonomy (assigned after combined morphological and genetic assessment) has been determined for 91% of the dataset. The library represents the most complete COI barcode reference dataset for marine fishes from Australian waters and is currently utilised for integrated taxonomy, (meta)barcoding and eDNA studies."
"Biological data visualization is challenged by the growing complexity of datasets. Traditional single-data plots or simple juxtapositions often fail to fully capture dataset intricacies and interrelations. To address this, we introduce ""cross-layout,"" a novel visualization paradigm that integrates multiple plot types in a cross-like structure, with a central main plot surrounded by secondary plots for enhanced contextualization and interrelation insights. We also introduce ""Marsilea,"" a Python-based implementation of cross-layout visualizations, available in both programmatic and web-based interfaces to support users of all experience levels. This paradigm and its implementation offer a customizable, intuitive approach to advance biological data visualization."
Care for people living with dementia predominantly takes place at home and is often characterized by multiple hospitalizations throughout the lengthy disease trajectory. Care transitions from the hospital often involve home health care. The purpose of this study was to explore communication challenges experienced by home health nurses to inform communication training needs for home-based dementia care.
"Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a fairly common generalized connective disorder characterized by low bone mass, bone deformities and impaired bone quality that predisposes affected individuals to musculoskeletal fragility. Periodontal ligament (PDL)-alveolar bone and PDL-cementum entheses' roles under OI conditions during physiological loading and orthodontic forces remain largely unknown. In addition, bisphosphonates (e.g., alendronate) are commonly used therapeutics for the treatment of OI. Our knowledge, in terms of the affects of alendronate treatment on the PDL entheses in OI is also far from complete. In this study, we identified craniofacial skeletal defects in an osteogenesis imperfecta (oim) murine model of OI. Relative to wild-type littermates, oim mice were found to have decreased skull length, cranial height/width/length, nose length, nasal length, and frontal length. Next, we discovered that oim mice exhibited defects in several dental structures, including short roots and decreased volumes of the alveolar bone, dentin, and cellular cementum. Further, we specifically investigated periodontal defects in the oim mice. Alveolar bone loss in oim mice was primarily associated with elevated bone resorption due to an increased osteoclast number, along with reduced bone formation related to increased sclerostin (SOST) expression. PDL fibers in oim mice were disrupted and discontinuous, while Sharpey's fibers at the PDL-bone entheses were reduced. Mechanism-based studies showed that catabolism of the PDL was elevated in oim mice, as revealed by an increase in MMP13 and CTSK expression. Meanwhile, the quality of the collagen fibers were impaired in oim mice due to a large accumulation of uncleaved collagen I fibers. With alendronate treatment, however, we could partially rescue these phenotypes. This study, for the first time, characterized periodontal defects in oim mice, detailed craniofacial defects and demonstrated the effectiveness of alendronate in partially restoring these defects."
Assess the impact of tracheostomy on postoperative morbidity and mortality and examine factors that predicted tracheostomy in head and neck flap patients.
"Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most prevalent kind of pathogenic bacteria infection, and the midstream urine culture is regarded as the gold standard in UTI diagnosis. Recently, even with modern media and techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), urinary cultures still create a considerable workload for hospital laboratories. Other UTI-detecting methods, such as flow cytometry and lateral flow immunoassay, suffer from various drawbacks like long time consumption and low sensitivity. Therefore, looking for reliable biomarkers in UTI is urgently needed. In this review, the current definitions of UTI can be basically divided into two main categories: uncomplicated UTI and complicated UTI. In light of anatomical sites, it can be classified as either lower UTI or upper UTI. We take the classification of UTI as a clue and review the reported extensive literature to classify the existing studied markers into the following three categories: Biomarkers used clinically; Promising biomarkers; and Controversial biomarkers. Particularly, the nucleic acid-associated, metabolomic, and lipidomic biomarkers are highlighted. At the end, we discuss the challenges and prospects of biomarkers in UTI, hoping to further inspire the diagnosis of UTI."
"Very low-calorie diets with hospitalization have demonstrated promise as a viable therapeutic option for severe obesity and its associated comorbidities. However, large studies providing a comprehensive longitudinal observation of patients undergoing this therapy are lacking. We evaluated the effectiveness of treating severe obesity in hospitalized patients, using very low-calorie diets and clinical support to develop lifestyle changes."
"In patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), co-occurring spondyloarthritis (SpA) leads to poorer outcomes and impaired quality of life, highlighting the importance of early detection and effective treatment. This is the first study to assess the prevalence and distribution of axial symptoms and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-detected involvement of the spine and sacroiliac joints (SIJs) in early IBD."
The impact of resection margin and lymph node status on survival in patients undergoing resection for perihilar cholangiocarcinoma (pCCA) is controversial. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of nodal and resection margin status on long-term survival after resection for pCCA.
"The introduction of quantum computing has transformed the setting of information technology, bringing both unprecedented opportunities and significant challenges. As quantum technologies continue to evolve, addressing their implications for software security has become an essential area of research. This paradigm change provides an unprecedented chance to strengthen software security from the start, presenting a plethora of novel alternatives. We use a multi-criteria decision-making methodology in this work to evaluate the efficacy of quantum computing approaches in improving software security. As the number of electronic applications grows, software developers strive to produce more sophisticated and user-friendly alternatives. However, in the pursuit of complexity, vulnerabilities may be introduced inadvertently, posing a substantial danger to software security. Our study addresses five major components of the quantum method to overcome these challenges: lattice-based cryptography, fully homomorphic algorithms, quantum key distribution, quantum hash functions, and blind quantum algorithms. The rapid development of quantum bits (qubits) regarded as basic quantum entities adds complexity and risk to the software security landscape. As a result, in the age of quantum computing, evaluating software security becomes not only necessary but also critical. To accomplish this objective, we propose the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (F-AHP), a soft computing method, as a reliable tool for accomplishing this goal. Our research aims to prioritise security variables using quantum security criteria, providing an innovative viewpoint on software security evaluation in the quantum computing era."
"Narcolepsy type 1 (NT1) is an autoimmune disease caused by the selective immune attack against orexin-producing neurons. However, the pathophysiology of narcolepsy type 2 (NT2) and idiopathic hypersomnia (IH) remains controversial. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is an easily calculated parameter from the white blood cell count, which has already been extensively used as an inflammatory marker in immunological disorders. In this study, we examined the white blood cell count of patients with NT1, NT2, and IH compared to healthy controls (HC) and evaluated the NLR to test the possibility of identifying an easy biofluid marker for detecting inflammation and distinguishing patients from HC."
"Good oral hygiene is essential for schoolchildren's well-being. However, lack of knowledge, negative attitudes, and poor oral hygiene practices may predispose to oral-related diseases.

"BRCA1 (Breast Cancer 1) is a tumor suppressor gene with a role in DNA repair by Homologous Recombination (HR), and maintenance of genomic stability that is frequently investigated in breast, prostate, and ovarian cancers. BRCA1 mutations or dysregulation in glioblastoma can lead to impaired DNA repair mechanisms, resulting in tumor progression and resistance to standard therapies. Several studies have shown that BRCA1 expression is altered, albeit rarely, in glioblastoma, leading to poor prognosis and increased tumor aggressiveness. In addition, the communication of BRCA1 with other molecular pathways such as p53 and PTEN further complicates its role in glioblastoma pathogenesis. Targeting BRCA1-related pathways in these cases has shown the potential to improve the efficacy of standard treatments, including radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The development of (Poly (ADP-ribose) Polymerase) PARP inhibitors that exploit the lack of HR also offers a therapeutic approach to glioblastoma patients with BRCA1 mutations. Despite these advances, the heterogeneity of glioblastoma and its complex tumor microenvironment make the translation of such approaches into clinical practice still challenging, and there is an ""unmet need"". This review discusses the current mechanisms of etiology and potential treatment of BRCA1-related glioblastoma."
"orthopedic device-associated infections (ODI) are considered surgical site infections (SSI). SSIs are generally attributed to contamination during surgery, but they require certain factors for their development. Therefore, the objective of this study was to analyze the risk factors for the development of SSIs in patients with closed fractures."
"Identifying representative sequences for groups of functionally similar proteins and enzymes poses significant computational challenges. In this study, we applied submodular optimization, a method effective in data summarization, to select representative sequences for thioesterase enzyme families. We introduced and validated two algorithms, Greedy and Bidirectional Greedy, using curated protein sequence data from the ThYme (Thioester-active enzYmes) database. Both algorithms generated sequence subsets that preserved completeness (inclusion of all known family sequences) and specificity (accurate family representation). The Greedy algorithm outperformed the Bidirectional Greedy algorithm and other methods, particularly in reducing redundancy. Our study offers an efficient approach for identifying representative protein sequences within families that have significant sequence similarity, likely to deliver results close to theoretical optima in polynomial time, with the potential to improve the selection and optimization of representative sequences in protein databases."
"Health services accessibility is a multidimensional concept. An early-life dental visit could improve child dental health. Through birth cohorts, it is possible to identify health conditions and pathways of exposure that occur earlier in life. The aim of this study is to propose a theorical model to explain the use of dental care for children with primary teeth, based on results from birth cohorts."
"Many countries, including Sri Lanka, are taking steps to integrate sex education into their educational systems to combat child abuse. However, this effort is often met with skepticism in Asian nations, including Sri Lanka. This study takes a unique approach by applying the criteria of the health belief model to predict the quality of reproductive health (SRH) education in Sri Lanka, offering a fresh perspective on this issue. A positive philosophical framework and a deductive approach have been employed to provide justification for the underlying assumptions. A structured questionnaire was used as the survey methodology, which included questions about external cues to action, self-efficacy, perceived barriers, perceived susceptibility, and perceived severity. Data was collected from a total of 384 Sri Lankan non-state undergraduate students to test their perception of these factors and how they affect the perceived benefits of quality SRH education. The level of self-efficacy, perceived susceptibility, and perceived severity yielded a coefficient estimate that was statistically significant, thus influencing the perceived benefits of quality SRH education. These results, obtained through a multivariate regression analysis, underscore the importance of one's role in implementing effective SRH education. Importantly, there is no evidence that external cues to action and perceived barriers predict the perceived benefits of quality SRH education. This underscores the gravity of the situation and the need for immediate action. The findings of this study have significant practical implications. They can be used to develop an effective SRH program that aims to prevent sexual abuse among adolescents. This study also demonstrates that the health belief model can serve as a useful conceptual framework for such intervention programs, providing tangible solutions to the issue of SRH education quality."
"The KAP survey evaluates health-related knowledge, attitudes, and practices through a structured questionnaire. By collecting qualitative and quantitative data, it measures the current situation, tests hypotheses, and provides insights for enhancing health behaviors and education. In 2019, the National Health Security Administration (NHSA) initiated DRG payment reforms. This study aims to improve the quality of health insurance and policy implementation by assessing physicians' knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding the DRG system."
"SARS-CoV-2 undergoes budding within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), and the progeny virions are delivered to the cell surface via vesicular transport. However, the molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Using three-dimensional electron microscopic analysis, such as array tomography and electron tomography, we found that virion-transporting vesicles possessed protein coats on their membrane and demonstrated that the protein coat was coatomer complex I (COPI). During the later stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we observed a notable alteration in the distribution of COPI and ERGIC throughout the cytoplasm, suggesting their potential involvement in virus replication. Depletion of COPB2, a key component of COPI, led to the confinement of SARS-CoV-2 progeny virions within the ERGIC at the perinuclear region. While the expression levels of viral proteins within cells were comparable, this depletion significantly reduced the efficiency of virion release, leading to the significant reduction of viral replication. Hence, our findings suggest COPI as a critical player in facilitating the transport of SARS-CoV-2 progeny virions from the ERGIC. Thus, COPI could be a promising target for the development of antivirals against SARS-CoV-2."
"Leafy plants are commonly consumed as vegetables in India due to their high nutrient and vitamin content. This study, conducted in Ambagarh Chowki (India), investigated the accumulation potential of 52 elements (including Al, As, Ba, Be, Bi, Ca, Cd, Ce, Co, Cr, Cu, Dy, Er, Eu, Fe, Ga, Gd, Ge, Ho, K, La, Li, Lu, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Nb, Nd, Ni, P, Pb, Pr, Rb, Sb, Sc, Se, Sm, Sn, Sr, Tb, Te, Th, Ti, Tl, Tm, U, V, W, Y, Yb, and Zn) in seven leafy vegetable species, namely Amaranthus tricolor L., Corchorus olitorius L., Cordia myxa L., Hibiscus sabdariffa L., Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam., Moringa oleifera Lam., and Spinacia oleracea L. Technique: Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was employed for analysis. The maximum concentrations of elements such as Al, Ba, Be, Bi, Cd, Co, Cr, Fe, Ga, Ge, Li, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sb, Th, Tl, U, V, W, and REEs were observed in S. oleracea leaves, indicating their highest accumulation potential. In contrast, the maximum concentrations of As were found in H. sabdariffa leaves; Ca and Si in M. oleifera leaves; Mg, Sr, and Mo in A. tricolor leaves; and P, K, Cu, and Zn in C. myxa leaves, respectively. Twenty-one elements (Cr, Cd, Pb, Ni, Co, V, Cu, Zn, Fe, Mn, Th, Sb, Ba, Be, Li, Sr, Tl, U, Se, Sn, and REEs) exceeded permissible limits set by the WHO. The elevated hazard index values indicated significant non-carcinogenic effects. The sources of these elements could be attributed to a combination of geological factors and agricultural practices. This study highlights the need for further investigation into the potential health implications of consuming these vegetables in the aforementioned region."
"The development of new medicines with unique methods of antimicrobial action is desperately needed due to the emerging multidrug-resistant bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Therefore, antimicrobial peptoids have emerged as potential new antimicrobials. Thirteen peptoid analogues have been designed and synthesized via solid phase synthesis. These peptoids have undergone a biological analysis to determine the structure-activity relationships that define their antibacterial activity. Each peptoid is composed of nine repeating N-substituted glycine monomers (9-mer). The monomer units were synthesized with three distinct alkyl side chain lengths: four-carbon butyl monomers, six-carbon hexyl monomers, and eight-carbon octyl monomers. Out of 12 different peptoids, only one peptoid called Tosyl-Octyl-Peptoid (TOP) demonstrated significant broad-spectrum bactericidal activity. TOP kills bacteria under non-dividing and dividing conditions. The Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations values of TOP for Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella were 20 µM, whereas Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus were 40 µM. The highest MIC values were observed for Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 80 µM. The selectivity ratio was calculated, by dividing the 10% haemolysis activity (5 mM) by the median of the MIC (50 µM) yielding a selective ratio for TOP as 100. This selective ratio is well above previously reported peptidomimetics selective ratio of around 20. TOP shows broad-spectrum bactericidal action in both dividing and non-dividing bacteria in co-culture systems and intracellular bacterial killing activity. These results add new information about the antimicrobial peptoids and aid in the future design of synthetic peptoids with increased therapeutic potential."
"Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is a pleiotropic genome instability syndrome resulting from the loss of the homeostatic protein kinase ATM. The complex phenotype of A-T includes progressive cerebellar degeneration, immunodeficiency, gonadal atrophy, interstitial lung disease, cancer predisposition, endocrine abnormalities, chromosomal instability, radiosensitivity, and segmental premature aging. Cultured skin fibroblasts from A-T patients exhibit premature senescence, highlighting the association between genome instability, cellular senescence, and aging. We found that lung fibroblasts derived from ATM-deficient mice provide a versatile experimental system to explore the mechanisms driving the premature senescence of primary fibroblasts lacking ATM."
"Transgenic expression of a double-stranded RNA in plants can induce silencing of homologous mRNAs in fungal pathogens. Although such host-induced gene silencing is well documented, the molecular mechanisms by which RNAs can move from the cytoplasm of plant cells across the plasma membrane of both the host cell and fungal cell are poorly understood. Indirect evidence suggests that this RNA transfer may occur at a very early stage of the infection process, prior to breach of the host cell wall, suggesting that silencing RNAs might be secreted onto leaf surfaces. To assess whether Arabidopsis plants possess a mechanism for secreting RNA onto leaf surfaces, we developed a protocol for isolating leaf surface RNA separately from intercellular (apoplastic) RNA. This protocol yielded abundant leaf surface RNA that displayed an RNA banding pattern distinct from apoplastic RNA, suggesting that it may be secreted directly onto the leaf surface rather than exuded through stomata or hydathodes. Notably, this RNA was not associated with either extracellular vesicles or protein complexes; however, RNA species longer than 100 nucleotides could be pelleted by ultracentrifugation. Furthermore, pelleting was inhibited by the divalent cation chelator EGTA, suggesting that these RNAs may form condensates on the leaf surface. These leaf surface RNAs are derived almost exclusively from Arabidopsis, but come from diverse genomic sources, including rRNA, tRNA, mRNA, intergenic RNA, microRNAs, and small interfering RNAs, with tRNAs especially enriched. We speculate that endogenous leaf surface RNA plays an important role in the assembly of distinct microbial communities on leaf surfaces."
"The diagnosis of rare uterine leiomyosarcoma (uLMS) remains a challenge given the high incidence rates of benign uterine tumors such as leiomyoma (LM). In the last decade, several clinical scores and blood serum markers have been proposed. The aim of this study is to validate and update the pLMS clinical scoring system, evaluating the accuracy of the scoring system by Zhang et al. and examining the discriminatory ability of blood markers such as serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR)."

"Despite numerous studies on the rise and fall of terrestrial megafauna in the late Quaternary, knowledge about marine megafauna from this period remains limited. In this study, we performed radiocarbon dating and partial mitochondrial DNA sequencing from the skeletal remains of three species of small odontocetes (Pacific white-sided dolphins, Dall's porpoises and harbour porpoises) excavated from prehistoric archaeological sites around the Japanese shore dating back to 8500-1000 years ago (ya). Pacific white-sided dolphins that habituated the eastern coast of Hokkaido around 2000 ya belonged to different maternal groups than those from over 5000 ya and today. Furthermore, the species composition excavated from eastern Hokkaido sites varies between 5000 and 2000 ya. These findings suggest two significant population turnovers of small odontocetes on the east coast of Hokkaido, a transitional zone between the coastal area of East Asia and the offshore North Pacific. Notably, the first turnover, occurring between 5000 and 2000 ya, represents the oldest evidence of local population turnovers of marine megafauna during the late Quaternary."

"Syndromic surveillance using primary health care (PHC) data is a valuable tool for early outbreak detection, as demonstrated by the potential to identify COVID-19 outbreaks. However, the potential of such an early warning system in the post-COVID-19 era remains largely unexplored. We analyzed PHC encounter counter of respiratory complaints registered in the database of the Brazilian Unified National Health System from October 2022 to July 2023. We applied EARS (variations C1/C2/C3) and EVI to estimate the weekly thresholds. An alarm was determined when the number of encounters exceeded the week-specific threshold. We used data on hospitalization due to respiratory disease to classify as anomalies the weeks in which the number of cases surpassed predetermined thresholds. We compared EARS and EVI efficacy in anticipating anomalies. A total of 119 anomalies were identified across 116 immediate regions during the study period. The EARS-C2 presented the highest early alarm rate, with 81/119 (68%) early alarms, and C1 the lowest, with 71 (60%) early alarms. The lowest true positivity was the EARS-C1 118/1,354 (8.7%) and the highest was EARS-C3 99/856 (11.6%). Routinely collected PHC data can be successfully used to detect respiratory disease outbreaks in Brazil. Syndromic surveillance enhances timeliness in surveillance strategies, albeit with lower specificity. A combined approach with other strategies is essential to strengthen accuracy, offering a proactive and effective public health response against future outbreaks."
"Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a major health problem and one of the leading causes of death in adults older than 40. Multiple prior studies have demonstrated survival disparities based on race/ethnicity, but most of these focus on a single racial/ethnic group. This study evaluated OHCA variables and outcomes among on 5 racial/ethnic groups."
"Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, wastewater surveillance has emerged as a public health tool that supplements traditional surveillance methods used to detect the prevalence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in communities. In May 2020, the Houston Health Department (HHD) partnered with a coalition of municipal and academic partners to develop a wastewater monitoring and reporting system for the city of Houston, Texas. The HHD subsequently launched a program to conduct targeted wastewater sampling at 52 school sites located in a large, urban school district in Houston. Data generated by this program are shared with school district officials and nurses from participating schools. Although initial feedback from these stakeholders indicated that they considered the wastewater data valuable, the emergency nature of the pandemic prevented a systematic evaluation of the program. To address this gap in knowledge, the HHD and Rice University conducted a study to determine how wastewater data are used to make decisions about COVID-19 prevention and mitigation practices in schools. Our findings indicate that maximizing the utility of wastewater data in the school context will require the development of communication strategies and education efforts tailored to the needs of specific audiences and improving collaboration between local health departments, school districts, and school nurses."
"To maintain and regenerate adult tissues after injury, division and differentiation of tissue-resident stem cells must be precisely regulated. It remains elusive which regulatory strategies prevent exhaustion or overgrowth of the stem cell pool, whether there is coordination between multiple mechanisms, and how to detect them from snapshots. In Drosophila testes, somatic stem cells transition to a state that licenses them to differentiate, but remain capable of returning to the niche and resuming cell division. Here, we build stochastic mathematical models for the somatic stem cell population to investigate how licensing contributes to homeostasis. We find that licensing, in combination with differentiation occurring in pairs, is sufficient to maintain homeostasis and prevent stem cell extinction from stochastic fluctuations. Experimental data have shown that stem cells are competing for niche access, and our mathematical models demonstrate that this contributes to the reduction in the variability of stem cell numbers but does not prevent extinction. Hence, a combination of both regulation strategies, licensing with pairwise differentiation and competition for niche access, may be needed to reduce variability and prevent extinction simultaneously."
"Humans exploit motor synergies for motor control; however, how they emerge during motor learning is not clearly understood. Few studies have dealt with the computational mechanism for generating synergies. Previously, optimal control generated synergistic motion for the upper limb; however, it has not yet been applied to the high-dimensional whole-body system. We investigated the emergence of synergies through deep reinforcement learning of whole-body locomotion tasks. We carried out a joint-space synergy analysis on whole-body control solutions for walking and running agents in simulated environments. Although a synergy constraint was never encoded into the reward function, the synergy emerged during the learning of walking and running tasks. To investigate the effect of gait symmetry on synergy emergence, we varied the weight level of symmetry loss. Interestingly, increasing the weight of symmetry loss resulted in increased energy efficiency and synergetic motion patterns concurrently. These results illustrate the correlation between motor synergy, energy efficiency, and gait symmetry in whole-body motor learning, reflecting that deep reinforcement learning can generate synergistic gait for highly redundant joint systems, similar to human motor control. This suggests that locomotor synergies can emerge through learning processes, complementing the understanding of synergy emergence mechanisms."
"According to the World Health Organization (WHO) manual, sperm concentration should be measured using an improved Neubauer hemocytometer, while sperm motility should be measured by manual assessment. However, in China, thousands of laboratories do not use the improved Neubauer hemocytometer or method; instead, the Makler counting chamber is one of the most widely used chambers. To study sources of error that could impact the measurement of the apparent concentration and motility of sperm using the Makler counting chamber and to verify its accuracy for clinical application, 67 semen samples from patients attending the Department of Andrology, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University (Chengdu, China) between 13 September 2023 and 27 September 2023, were included. Compared with applying the cover glass immediately, delaying the application of the cover glass for 5 s, 10 s, and 30 s resulted in average increases in the sperm concentration of 30.3%, 74.1%, and 107.5%, respectively (all P < 0.0001) and in the progressive motility (PR) of 17.7%, 30.8%, and 39.6%, respectively (all P < 0.0001). However, when the semen specimens were fixed with formaldehyde, a delay in the application of the cover glass for 5 s, 10 s, and 30 s resulted in an average increase in the sperm concentration of 6.7%, 10.8%, and 14.6%, respectively, compared with immediate application of the cover glass. The accumulation of motile sperm due to delays in the application of the cover glass is a significant source of error with the Makler counting chamber and should be avoided."

"Tor putitora is an endangered cyprinid fish constrained to cold water and is also considered an indicator of a healthy aquatic ecosystem. The present study aimed to examine the haplotypic diversity, genetic variation and population structure of T. putitora isolates using COI and Cyt b gene sequences submitted in GenBank. Bioinformatic analysis was carried out using 106 COI and 183 Cyt b gene sequences as well as 2 reference genome sequences. Analysis of COI and Cyt b gene reveals 18 and 85 haplotypes respectively. Mutation was observed at 44 different sites in COI and 173 in Cyt b gene sequences. Haplotype 4 and haplotype 37 were considered ancestral in COI and Cyt b respectively. Analysis of COI gene reveals moderate haplotype diversity (0.630) and low Nucleotide diversity (0.00662) whereas Cyt b has higher haplotype diversity (0.804) and low Nucleotide diversity (0.00582). Moreover, the neutrality test such as Tajima's D, and Fu's Fs showed negative values in both gene sequences, suggesting population expansion attributed to habitat destruction. So, comprehending the genetic variability within and among the T. putitora population is crucial for conserving and managing this species. Integration of genetic diversity into conservation planning can enhance the effectiveness of breeding programs and habitat restoration efforts."
"Previous abdominal surgery (PAS) increases risk of small bowel obstruction (SBO) due to adhesions, and appendectomy (appy) is an independent risk factor for abdominal adhesion-related complications. Peritoneal inflammation, e.g., acute appendicitis (AA), causes formation of reactive ascitic fluid (rA) that activates peritoneum surface mesothelial cells (MCs) to form adhesions. Pathologic adhesions may arise if restoration of MC-regulated fibrinolysis and secretion of glycocalyx (GCX) are disrupted. Proteins affecting these processes may originate from peritoneal rA. This is a prospective observational IRB-approved study at three Level 1 trauma centers where rA is collected prior to surgical intervention for non-perforated AA or adhesiolysis for SBO. Samples from 48 appy and 15 SBO patients were used to treat human MCs and subjected to quantification of 85 inflammatory mediators. Results were compared between patients with surgically naïve abdomens (naïve) and patients with >1 PAS. Select rA caused MCs to form clusters of fibroblastic cells, extracellular matrix fibers (FIB), and secretion of GCX. PAS and naïve patient rA fluids were clustered into ""fiber-GCX"" (FIB-GCX) groups: highFIB-highGCX, highFIB-lowGCX, noFIB-highGCX, noFIB-lowGCX, and noFIB-noGCX. Between groups, 26 analytes were differentially abundant including innate immune response, wound healing, and mucosal defense proteins. Factors that contributed to the differences between groups were rA-induced highFIB and history of PAS. Overall, PAS patient rA showed a muted immune response compared to rA from naïve patients. Our data suggest that abdominal surgery may negatively impact future immune responses in the abdomen. Further, quantifying immunomodulators in peritoneal rA may lead to the development a personalized approach to post-surgical adhesion treatment and prevention."
"Uncontrolled asthma is associated with an increased risk of adverse perinatal outcomes. Asthma biologics reduce exacerbation frequency, are steroid sparing, and improve quality of life in people with severe asthma. However, evidence for the use and safety of asthma biologics during pregnancy is scarce, largely because pregnant women were excluded from clinical trials. To help to support clinical teams, we conducted an international modified Delphi study. 141 panellists from 32 countries who were involved in the care of people with severe asthma completed two rounds of online surveys covering key areas surrounding the use of asthma biologics in pregnancy. The results from this international Delphi study emphasise risk versus benefit discussions and shared clinical decision making, with consensus among panellists that asthma biologics can be used during conception and throughout pregnancy, initiated during pregnancy in line with prescribing criteria for non-pregnant people, and initiated or continued during breastfeeding. Collating data through international registries remains essential to inform clinical guidelines."

"This study aimed to estimate the COVID-19 lethality in the Mexican Indigenous population from 2020 to 2022, considering clinical characteristics and social conditions. Data were retrieved from the Epidemiological Surveillance System of Respiratory Diseases, identifying the COVID-19-positive cases among the Indigenous population. Lethality was evaluated per clinical conditions and vulnerability due to social deprivation. The number of COVID-19-positive cases in the Indigenous population represented 0.7% of the total number of cases. The case fatality rate in the Indigenous population was 9.8% against 4.6% in the non-Indigenous population. Lethality was higher in men. However, the association with diabetes, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, obesity, and smoking was lower in the Indigenous population than in the non-Indigenous population. A greater vulnerability to social conditions was identified among the Indigenous population than the non-Indigenous population, mainly regarding income, education, and access to health services."

"Increased expression of branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) transaminase 1 (BCAT1) often correlates with tumor aggressiveness and drug resistance in cancer. We have recently reported that BCAT1 was overexpressed in a subgroup of T-cell acute lymphoblastic (T-ALL) samples, especially those with NOTCH1 activating mutations. Interestingly, BCAT1-depleted cells showed pronounced sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents such as etoposide; however, how BCAT1 regulates this sensitivity remains uncertain. Here, we provide further clues on its chemo-sensitizing effect. Indeed, BCAT1 protein regulates the non-homologous end joining (c-NHEJ) DNA repair pathway by physically associating with the KU70/KU80 heterodimer. BCAT1 inhibition during active repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) led to increased KU70/KU80 acetylation and impaired c-NHEJ repair, a dramatic increase in DSBs, and ultimately cell death. Our results suggest that, in T-ALL, BCAT1 possesses non-metabolic functions that confer a drug resistance mechanism and that targeting BCAT1 activity presents a novel strategy to improve chemotherapy response in T-ALL patients."

"How newly formed memories are preserved while brain plasticity is ongoing has been a source of debate. One idea is that synapses which experienced recent plasticity become resistant to further plasticity, a type of metaplasticity often referred to as saturation. Here, we probe the local dendritic mechanisms that limit plasticity at recently potentiated synapses. We show that recently potentiated individual synapses exhibit a synapse-specific refractory period for further potentiation. We further found that the refractory period is associated with reduced postsynaptic CaMKII signaling; however, stronger synaptic activation fully restored CaMKII signaling but only partially restored the ability for further plasticity. Importantly, the refractory period is released after one hour, a timing that coincides with the enrichment of several postsynaptic proteins to preplasticity levels. Notably, increasing the level of the postsynaptic scaffolding protein, PSD95, but not of PSD93, overcomes the refractory period. Our results support a model in which potentiation at a single synapse is sufficient to initiate a synapse-specific refractory period that persists until key postsynaptic proteins regain their steady-state synaptic levels."
"Nephrotoxicity remains a significant concern associated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as dasatinib (DASA). Previous studies have shown that DASA can induce renal tubular cell death, contributing to its nephrotoxic effects. In contrast, naringenin (NGN) is known for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. This study aimed to explore the nephroprotective potential of NGN against acute kidney injury induced by DASA in a mouse model. Mice were pre-treated with different doses of NGN (50, 100 mg/kg) for one week, followed by a single dose of DASA (25 mg/kg) on the 8th day. Results demonstrated that DASA significantly increased serum levels of blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, uric acid, and lactate dehydrogenase, which were effectively attenuated by NGN pretreatment. Furthermore, kidney tissues exposed to DASA exhibited elevated malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, which were significantly reduced by NGN. NGN also restored depleted levels of antioxidants (glutathione (GSH) and catalase (CAT)) in kidney tissues following DASA treatment. Additionally, NGN mitigated the upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, NF-κB, and IL-6) induced by DASA, indicating an anti-inflammatory effect. Notably, DASA treatment upregulated the gene expression of the pro-apoptotic gene BAX while downregulating the expression of BCL-2 and Caspase-3 in kidney tissues. These findings suggest that NGN exerts nephroprotective effects against DASA-induced nephrotoxicity through its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic properties. Further investigations are warranted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms involved."
"Measles, a highly contagious respiratory illness caused by the measles virus (MeV), poses significant global and national public health challenges despite advancements in vaccination efforts. Though measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000, recent years have seen a resurgence of cases, particularly in under-vaccinated communities. This resurgence is compounded by factors such as vaccine hesitancy, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on immunization rates, and international travel introducing new cases from endemic regions. This paper examines the epidemiology and recent measles outbreaks in the United States, focusing on the significant rise in cases from 2020 to 2024. The analysis highlights the importance of maintaining high vaccination coverage, particularly in vulnerable populations, and explores the challenges of managing outbreaks. The study also reviews the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of measles, emphasizing the role of prevention and control measures, including the MMR vaccine, public health interventions, and international cooperation in addressing this persistent threat."

"Though simple in its fundamental mechanism - a critical disruption of local blood supply - stroke is complicated by the intricate nature of the neural substrate, the neurovascular architecture, and their complex interactions in generating its clinical manifestations. This complexity is adequately described by high-resolution imaging with sensitivity not only to parenchymal macrostructure but also microstructure and functional tissue properties, in conjunction with detailed characterization of vascular topology and dynamics. Such descriptive richness mandates models of commensurate complexity only artificial intelligence could plausibly deliver, if we are to achieve the goal of individually precise, personalized care."

"Telemedicine (TM) has emerged as a valuable tool in managing pediatric type 1 diabetes (T1D), particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic when traditional in-person visits were limited. This narrative review examines the impact of TM on patient-provider relationships, glycemic control, and overall diabetes management in children and adolescents with T1D. Studies consistently demonstrate high levels of patient and provider satisfaction with TM, citing increased consultation frequency, reduced travel burdens, and lower associated costs. However, results regarding the effect of TM on glycemic control, as measured by HbA1c levels, are inconsistent. Some studies show significant reductions in HbA1c levels with TM use, while others report outcomes comparable to or less effective than traditional care. The effectiveness of TM also appears to be influenced by the concurrent use of advanced diabetes technologies, such as continuous glucose monitors and automated insulin delivery systems. Furthermore, TM's impact on quality of life and other clinical outcomes beyond glucose management remains underexplored. Methodological limitations, including inconsistent randomization strategies and lack of long-term follow-up, hinder definitive conclusions. Despite these uncertainties, TM offers several advantages, such as improved accessibility and patient engagement, which may justify its broader implementation. Future research should focus on optimizing TM approaches to enhance glycemic control and quality of life, identifying the most effective strategies for specific patient groups, and addressing technological and economic barriers. This review highlights the need for comprehensive, long-term studies to fully understand TM's potential in pediatric T1D management and its integration into standard care practices."
"Research demonstrates that siblings, especially older siblings, make unique contributions to adolescents' substance use above and beyond shared genetics and shared parenting. Older siblings' influences on younger adolescent siblings' alcohol use operate through both direct and indirect pathways.

"Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer in women worldwide. A common approach to cancer treatment in clinical practice is to use a combination of drugs to enhance the anticancer activity of drugs while reducing their side effects. In this regard, we evaluated the effectiveness of combined treatment with gemcitabine (GCB) and arsenic (ATO) and how they affect the cell death pathway in cancer cells. Cytotoxic activity of drugs individually or combined against MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 was performed by MTT method and isobolographic analysis was used to determine the interaction between these factors. The combination of ATO and GCB showed synergistic anti-cancer activity (CI < 1) in both cancer cell lines. The combination of ATO and GCB induced sub-G1 phase arrest, apoptosis and death rates in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. The apoptotic response induced by the combination of GCB and ATO was dependent on caspase 3/7. Combined treatment with mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) reduction and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production caused mitochondrial dysfunction. Co-treatment significantly reduced catalase (CAT) activity in both cancer cells compared to the control group and cells treated with each monotherapy. A significant decrease in cellular GSH was observed in cancer cells treated with ATO and GCB. In addition, migration and invasion were significantly reduced in breast cancer cells treated with the combination of ATO and GCB compared to cells treated with ATO and GCB. In conclusion, the combined treatment of ATO and GCB synergistically increased the anti-cancer activity, and these findings provide an effective approach for the treatment of breast cancer. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study showing promising results for combination therapy with ATO and GCB in breast cancer."
"Research has demonstrated that individuals with sarcopenia or sarcopenic obesity who experience fractures or undergo major surgical interventions exhibit a poorer prognosis compared to the general population. However, few studies have investigated the relationship between the skeletal muscle and adipose tissue indices, as measured at the 12th thoracic spine level, and adverse outcomes following orthopedic surgery. Therefore, this study aimed to prove whether skeletal muscle and adipose tissue index measured by computed tomography (CT) images based on a single layer are associated with one-year postoperative mortality in elderly hip fracture patients."

"In elderly patients, the onset of pneumonia is often subtle and typical respiratory symptoms are less common. Instead, non-specific presentations such as altered mental status and loss of appetite should be closely monitored. The sensitivity of chest X-rays and routine laboratory tests is often low, so a comprehensive assessment including risk factors is required. The presence of multiple comorbidities, including chronic respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes mellitus, is prevalent in this population and complicates early diagnosis. Polypharmacy further adds to the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Due to difficulties in specimen collection, high risks associated with invasive testing and atypical pathogen distributions, conventional microbiological detection methods often fail to meet clinical needs. Nucleic acid testing techniques, such as metagenome next-generation sequencing, offer a rapid and sensitive alternative for detecting a wide range of pathogens, including those not identified by conventional methods, as well as rare, multiple, or mixed infections. This approach also has the advantage of not being influenced by prior antibiotic use, making it a crucial role in diagnosing pneumonia in the elderly. However, it is imperative to select appropriate and high-quality specimen types and to interpret the results accurately, taking into account the clinical context and indications for testing. Timely and precise diagnosis is essential to improve the prognosis of pneumonia in elderly patients."

"Functional neurological disorder (FND) is continuing to gain increasing recognition globally as a valid and potentially treatable disorder. Iatrogenic harm towards patients with FND is significant, however, and has been around for centuries. Despite advances in our understanding around the aetiology, pathophysiology and treatment of FND, many aspects of such harm continue to persist. Avoidance of iatrogenic harm has been highlighted by clinicians as one of the most important therapeutic considerations in FND; however, the sources and range of potential harms, or indeed ways to mitigate them, have not previously been summarized. Using a combination of clinical and research experience and scoping review methodology, this review aims to describe the main sources of iatrogenic harm towards patients with FND, including harm from misdiagnosis, delayed diagnosis and treatment, direct harm from professional interactions, other stigma-related harms, harm related to diagnostic overshadowing and over-diagnosis of FND. We also describe some potential ways to address and prevent such harms, such as ways to reduce misdiagnosis with a focus on rule in signs, optimizing teaching and communication, ensuring parity of FND with other medical conditions and continued integration of patient and professional organizations."
"SERPINA3, a serine protease inhibitor, is strongly associated with neuroinflammation, a typical condition of AD. Its expression is linked to microglial and astrocytic markers, suggesting it plays a significant role in modulating neuroinflammatory responses. In this study, we examined the SERPINA3 expression levels, along with CHI3L1, in various brain regions of AD patients and non-demented healthy controls (NDHC). Nineteen microarray datasets were analyzed, with brain samples stratified by sex and age from areas including the prefrontal cortex, occipital lobe, and cerebellum. Results showed that SERPINA3 was significantly highly expressed in AD patients compared to NDHCs only in males. Sex-specific differences were observed only in NDHCs, where females had higher SERPINA3 levels than males. ROC analysis suggested that SERPINA3 could be a strong marker for distinguishing AD in males but not females. In NDHCs, SERPINA3 expression correlated more strongly with age than in AD patients. In brain regions, SERPINA3 expression in NDHC females was higher across multiple areas, while in AD patients, this difference was limited to the prefrontal cortex. The most significant differences between NDHC and AD patients were found in the occipital and prefrontal regions. Furthermore, we identified a potential nuclear localization for SERPINA3, supported by immunohistochemistry analysis from The Human Protein Atlas. Correlation with neuropathological traits, including Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) and Braak Neurofibrillary Tangle Score, showed positive significant associations between SERPINA3 and CDR in AD patients. Performing a docking analysis, we revealed an interaction region between SERPINA3 and CHI3L1 proteins, suggesting a potential role in AD. Tissue transcriptomic deconvolution analysis indicated a significant overlap between SERPINA3 expression and microglial/astrocytic signatures, suggesting that SERPINA3 plays a key role in modulating neuroinflammation in AD."
"The S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 Spike is crucial for ACE2 recognition and viral entry into human cells. It has been found in the blood of COVID-19 patients and vaccinated individuals. Using BioGRID, I identified 146 significant human proteins that interact with S1. I then created an interactome model that made it easier to study functional activities. Through a reverse engineering approach, 27 specific one-to-one interactions of S1 with the human proteome were selected. S1 interacts in this manner independently from the biological context in which it operates, be it infection or vaccination. Instead, when it works together with viral proteins, they carry out multiple attacks on single human proteins, showing a different functional engagement. The functional implications and tropism of the virus for human organs/tissues were studied using Cytoscape. The nervous system, liver, blood, and lungs are among the most affected. As a single protein, S1 operates in a complex metabolic landscape which includes 2557 Biological Processes (GO), much more than the 1430 terms controlled when operating in a group. A Data Merging approach shows that the total proteins involved by S1 in the cell are over 60,000 with an average involvement per single biological process of 26.19. However, many human proteins become entangled in over 100 different biological activities each. Clustering analysis showed significant activations of many molecular mechanisms, like those related to hepatitis B infections. This suggests a potential involvement in carcinogenesis, based on a viral strategy that uses the ubiquitin system to impair the tumor suppressor and antiviral functions of TP53, as well as the role of RPS27A in protein turnover and cellular stress responses."
"Mosaic analysis with double markers (MADM) is a powerful in vivo lineage tracing technique.

"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) stands as a formidable global health challenge, often advancing to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) with devastating morbidity and mortality. At the central of this progression lies podocyte injury, a critical determinant of glomerular dysfunction. Compound K (CK), a bioactive metabolite derived from ginsenoside, has emerged as a compelling candidate for nephroprotective therapy. Here, we unveil the profound therapeutic potential of CK in a folic acid (FA)-induced CKD mouse model, demonstrating its ability to restore renal function and mitigate podocyte injury. CK exerted its nephroprotective effects by reinforcing inter-podocyte junctions, suppressing aberrant podocyte motility, and preventing podocyte detachment and apoptosis, thereby safeguarding the glomerular filtration barrier. Mechanistically, we identified mitochondrial dysregulation as a key driver of excessive oxidative stress, which is commonly associated with podocyte damage. CK remarkably restored mitochondrial homeostasis by attenuating pathological mitochondrial fission and enhancing mitophagy, thereby rebalancing the delicate mitochondrial network. Intriguingly, CK may disrupt the formation of the Drp1-Bax dimer, a crucial mediator of mitochondrial apoptosis, further averting podocyte loss. Collectively, our findings highlight CK as a potent nephroprotective agent, offering a novel therapeutic avenue for CKD management and redefining possibilities in the battle against progressive renal disease."
"Pig farming is a major source of carbon emissions in China's livestock industry, and the promotion and application of carbon neutral technologies dedicated to carbon reduction and sequestration is a key measure to promote the realization of carbon neutrality in pig farming industry. In the absence of a system for carbon emission reduction in agriculture, it is important to explore whether large-scale pig farming can spontaneously promote the application of carbon neutral technologies by pig farmers. Combined with the technical background of carbon neutrality in pig farming industry and using the field survey data of 468 pig farmers in Shandong Province, this paper empirically analyzed the effect of large-scale pig farming on the carbon neutral behavior of pig farmers. The findings are threefold. Firstly, because of the effect of economies of scale in the application of carbon neutral technologies, large-scale pig farming can promote the carbon neutral behavior of pig farmers. However, the effect of economies of scale in the application of carbon neutral technologies has a boundary, and the annual output of pigs should be maintained at 3000 to 4999. Secondly, among the effects of pig breeding scale on the application and its degree of composting project, state of planting and breeding cycle has no regulating effect. Thirdly, among the effects of pig breeding scale on the application and its degree of biogas engineering, both state of planting and breeding cycle and subsidy for construction of biogas digester have negative regulating effects. In this paper, the pig farming industry is taken as a typical example to reveal the endogenous incentive mechanism of promoting agricultural carbon emission reduction, which provides theoretical reference and experience enlightenment for the formulation of effective policies to promote agricultural carbon neutrality, which are different from industrial industries."
"About 25% of patients with acute ischemic stroke have lacunar infarct on follow-up imaging.

"Evidence on the combined effect of time in the target range (TTR) for systolic blood pressure (SBP) and fasting blood glucose (FBG) in real-world settings was scarce. We aimed to evaluate the separate and combined effects of SBP TTR and FBG TTR on cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality risks among participants with comorbidity of hypertension and diabetes. The data was derived from the Kailuan study. The target ranges for SBP and FBG were set as 110-140 mmHg and 3.9-7.0 mmol/L, and linear interpolation to calculate TTR. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to estimate the separate and combined effects of SBP TTR and FBG TTR on CVD and all-cause mortality risks. We included 11,899 participants with hypertension and diabetes comorbidity whose mean age was 54.52 ± 10.36 years, and 9,873 (83.00%) were male. After a follow-up of 6.67 years, 1,381 cases of CVD and 2,148 cases of all-cause mortality were documented. In the fully adjusted model, compared with the participants with both SBP TTR and FBG TTR lower than 25%, participants with both greater SBP TTR and FBG TTR had the lowest risks of CVD (HR: 0.53; 95%CI: 0.57-0.78) and mortality (HR: 0.59; 95%CI: 0.47-0.74). Per 1 SD increase in SBP TTR was associated with a 14% reduction in CVD risk (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.80-0.92) and a 10% reduction in mortality risk (HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.85-0.95), all significant results were maintained in the FBG TTR analyses. Both higher SBP TTR and FBG TTR were associated with lower risks of CVD and all-cause mortality in participants with comorbidity of hypertension and diabetes. Simultaneous control of SBP and FBG within the target ranges is a beneficial strategy for CVD prevention."
"Undifferentiated carcinoma (UC) is a rare subtype of pancreatic cancer distinguished from UC with osteoclast-like giant cells (UC-OGC) in 2019, affecting interpretation of literature that does not distinguish these subtypes.

"A novel 3D-printed clamping interface was designed to address challenges associated with the tensile testing of soft biological tissues, particularly specimen slippage and failure at the grips. To improve specimen adherence, four contact patterns, based on retrograde teeth, serrated, atraumatic wavy teeth, and flower patterns, were added to the interface surface. A smooth transition was considered to diminish the likelihood of transverse cutting of specimens. The 3D-printed clamping interface was produced using additive manufacturing. We performed tensile tests on porcine skin specimens considering the original serrated jaw faces (reference condition), the jaw faces with sandpaper, and the 3D-printed clamping interface with and without contact patterns. The maximum force supported by the specimens (before slippage or failure), for each test condition, was compared using statistical analysis (statistical level of p < 0.05). Compared to the reference condition (148.50 ± 31.71 N), we observed significant improvements for the 3D-printed clamping interface with the retrograde teeth (247.41 ± 31.17 N, p ≤ 0.001) and flower (220.40 ± 19.86 N, p = 0.004) contact patterns. In the reference condition, failure mostly occurred at the grips. The use of the 3D-printed clamping interface reduced the spreading of the fibers, promoting failure within the gauge section. Additionally, we observed a reduction in tissue damage at the grips for the flower and atraumatic wavy teeth conditions. In conclusion, the proposed 3D-printed clamping interface significantly improved the adherence of the porcine skin specimens while promoting failure within the gauge section. This approach can be easily customized to the available grips, has a low-cost and fast production, and uses easily accessible technology."

"Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is increasing at an alarming rate worldwide, with limited effective therapeutic interventions in patients. Sudden cardiac death (SCD) and ventricular arrhythmias present substantial risks for the prognosis of these patients. Obesity is a risk factor for HFpEF and life-threatening arrhythmias. Obesity and its associated metabolic dysregulation, leading to metabolic syndrome, are an epidemic that poses a significant public health problem. More than one-third of the world population is overweight or obese, leading to an enhanced risk of incidence and mortality due to cardiovascular disease (CVD). Obesity predisposes patients to atrial fibrillation and ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias-conditions that are caused by dysfunction in the electrical activity of the heart. To date, current therapeutic options for the cardiomyopathy of obesity are limited, suggesting that there is considerable room for the development of therapeutic interventions with novel mechanisms of action that will help normalize sinus rhythms in obese patients. Emerging candidates for modulation by obesity are cardiac ion channels and Ca-handling proteins. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of the impact of obesity on these channels and Ca-handling proteins remain incompletely understood. Obesity is marked by the accumulation of adipose tissue, which is associated with a variety of adverse adaptations, including dyslipidemia (or abnormal systemic levels of free fatty acids), increased secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, fibrosis, hyperglycemia, and insulin resistance, which cause electrical remodeling and, thus, predispose patients to arrhythmias. Furthermore, adipose tissue is also associated with the accumulation of subcutaneous and visceral fat, which is marked by distinct signaling mechanisms. Thus, there may also be functional differences in the effects of the regional distribution of fat deposits on ion channel/Ca-handling protein expression. Evaluating alterations in their functional expression in obesity will lead to progress in the knowledge of the mechanisms responsible for obesity-related arrhythmias. These advances are likely to reveal new targets for pharmacological modulation. Understanding how obesity and related mechanisms lead to cardiac electrical remodeling is likely to have a significant medical and economic impact. Nevertheless, substantial knowledge gaps remain regarding HFpEF treatment, requiring further investigations to identify potential therapeutic targets. The objective of this study is to review cardiac ion channel/Ca-handling protein remodeling in the predisposition to metabolic HFpEF and arrhythmias. This review further highlights interleukin-6 (IL-6) as a potential target, cardiac bridging integrator 1 (cBIN1) as a promising gene therapy agent, and leukotriene B4 (LTB4) as an underappreciated pathway in future HFpEF management."
This study aimed to provide an overview of analytical methods in scientific literature for comparing uncontrolled medicine trials with external controls from individual patient data real-world data (IPD-RWD) and to compare these methods with recommendations made in guidelines from European regulatory and health technology assessment (HTA) organizations and with their evaluations described in assessment reports.
"Elevated cancer incidence has been reported among World Trade Center (WTC)-exposed responders, with some incidence rate ratios (IRRs) varying over time. This study describes the influence that different reference populations have on relative cancer incidence and temporal trends. Participants from the WTC Combined Rescue/Recovery Cohort (n = 65,691) were observed between 1/1/2002 and 12/31/2015 using data obtained from 13 state cancer registries. Poisson regression was used to estimate IRRs controlling for age, race/ethnicity, and calendar year. IRRs and change-points were estimated using three reference populations (New York City (NYC), New York State (NYS), and a US population). IRRs for each cancer site varied in magnitude. Prostate and thyroid cancer IRRs were significantly greater in WTC-exposed responders, while colon and lung cancer IRRs were significantly lower compared with NYC, NYS, and US population reference groups. The range of IRRs varied by reference population. Mixed findings were observed for other cancers, as results were dependent on the reference group used. A significant change-point was found only for prostate cancer, and only when compared to a US population. Our findings suggest that reference population selection will influence the IRR, timing, and statistical significance of change-point estimation, varying with follow-up length."
"Histopathologic evaluation of liver biopsy has played a longstanding role in the diagnosis and management of liver disease. However, the utility of liver biopsy has been questioned by some, given the improved imaging modalities, increased availability of noninvasive serologic tests, and development of artificial intelligence over the past several years. In this review, we discuss the current and future role of liver biopsy in both non-neoplastic and neoplastic liver diseases in the era of improved noninvasive laboratory, radiologic, and digital technologies."

"The Extended Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (E-FAST) is a diagnostic ultrasound technique used in hospital and pre-hospital settings for patients with torso trauma. While E-FAST is common in emergency departments, its pre-hospital use is less routine. This study aims to establish a set of variables for designing studies on pre-hospital E-FAST through a Delphi consensus process involving international experts."
"Soft conductive gels are essential for epidermal electronics but often face challenges when interfacing with uneven surfaces or areas with extensive hair, especially under mechanical stress. In this study, we employed the concept of liquid-to-solid transformation to enhance integration at biointerfaces and designed an in-situ biogel capable of rapidly transitioning between liquid and solid states within 3 min via a temperature switch. The biogel features a semi-interpenetrating polymer network design and dual conduction pathways, resulting in high tensile strength (~1-3 MPa), a skin-compatible modulus (~0.3-1.1 MPa), strong skin adhesive strength (~1 MPa), and superior signal-to-noise ratio (SNR, ~30-40 dB). The biogel demonstrates significant performance in mechanically demanding environments, showing potential for accurately capturing outdoor exercise data, monitoring muscle recovery from sports-induced fatigue, and in vivo monitoring of cardiac physiological signals. The liquid-to-solid transformation concept, coupled with the design strategy for highly integrated and stable soft conductive materials, provides a basis for advancing conductive interface designs for high-fidelity signal acquisition."
"Ticagrelor is a key antiplatelet agent used to prevent thrombotic events in patients with acute coronary syndrome. This open-label, 2-period, crossover Phase I study assessed the pharmacokinetics and bioequivalence of a generic ticagrelor 90-mg formulation compared to the innovator product under fasting conditions. Twenty-eight healthy White adults participated in the study. Each participant received a single dose of either the test or reference formulation, followed by a 7-day washout period before switching to the alternate formulation. Plasma concentrations of ticagrelor were measured using a validated high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method. Statistical analysis of primary pharmacokinetic parameters, including maximum concentration and area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to the last quantifiable concentration, showed bioequivalence with test/reference ratios of 110.9% and 107.1%, respectively, and 90% confidence intervals within the 80%-125% regulatory range. Treatment-emergent adverse events, such as headache, dysphagia, and dizziness, were moderate and transient and resolved promptly, with no significant difference in incidence between the formulations. These results confirm that the generic ticagrelor formulation is bioequivalent to the innovator product, supporting its use as an interchangeable option in clinical practice."
"Fabry disease is an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder that causes accumulation of glycosphingolipids in body tissues and fluids, leading to progressive organ damage and life-threatening complications. It can affect both males and females and can be classified into classic or later-onset phenotypes. The disease severity in females ranges from asymptomatic to the more severe, classic phenotype. Most females are hemizygous and the X-linked inheritance is associated with variable X-activation pattern and residual enzymatic activity. The heterogeneity of clinical presentation in females requires different approaches to diagnosis and management than males. A European group of 7 physicians, experienced in the management of Fabry disease, convened to discuss patient perspectives and published guidelines. The experts discussed the need to focus on psychological treatment in relation to individual coping styles when monitoring targets, and the lack of data supporting the use of plasma globotriaosylsphingosine over enzyme activity in the diagnosis of these patients. It was suggested that the high phenotypic variability in female patients may be related to the dynamic nature of the X-chromosome inactivation process and further understanding of this process could help predict the progression of Fabry disease in females and facilitate timely intervention. Due to the range of disease severity they exhibit, female patients with Fabry disease may require a more individualized treatment approach than males. Despite current recommendations, the experts agreed that early disease-specific treatment initiation in high-risk females could improve clinical outcome."
"Small Bowel Adenocarcinoma (SBA) is a rare gastrointestinal cancer with a limited understanding of the molecular pathology.

"The first combination inhaled corticosteroid and short-acting beta₂ agonist (ICS-SABA) was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2023 for as-needed treatment or prevention of bronchoconstriction and to reduce the risk of asthma exacerbations in patients 18 years of age and older. The recently approved product contains an ICS-albuterol combination. The 2024 Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines recommend as-needed ICS-formoterol as the preferred asthma reliever therapy; however, a GINA alternative recommendation is the use of ICS whenever an as-needed (SABA) is used. There is no difference in as-needed asthma treatment recommended by the GINA guidelines in older adults, and there has been minimal study in older adults. Because of limited guidance on the use of the ICS-SABA reliever inhaler in older adults, the purpose of this review is to evaluate the DENALI and MANDALA studies and the potential role of ICS-SABA in older adults. The mean ages in both studies were 50 years. The MANDALA primary outcome result was a statistically significant lower risk of severe exacerbations in the ICS-SABA reliever group compared with the as-needed albuterol (ALB) group at 24 weeks. In the MANDALA older adults subgroup analysis, there was not a statistically significant difference in the ICS-SABA reliever group compared with the as-needed ALB-alone group but the results favored ICS-SABA. The DENALI primary outcome results were a greater change from baseline in forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) area under the curve averaged over 12 weeks with albuterol/budesonide (ALB-BUD) 180/160 ug compared with budesonide alone and placebo and a greater change from baseline in trough FEV1 with ALB-BUD 180/160 ug and 180/80 ug than ALB-alone and placebo. Because of minimal adverse effects in both trials and the benefits in preventing asthma exacerbations reported in the MANDALA trial, it is important to assess and recommend that older adults with asthma receive inhaled corticosteroid with their reliever asthma inhaler."
"Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) are DNA sequences capable of editing a host genome sequence. CRISPR and its specific CRISPR-associated (Cas) protein complexes have been adapted for various applications. These include activating or inhibiting specific genetic sequences or acting as molecular scissors to cut and modify the host DNA precisely. CRISPR-Cas systems are also naturally present in many oral bacteria, where they aid in nutrition, biofilm formation, inter- and intraspecies communication (quorum sensing), horizontal gene transfer, virulence, inflammation modulation, coinfection, and immune response evasion. It even functions as an adaptive immune system, defending microbes against invading viruses and foreign genetic elements from other bacteria by targeting and degrading their DNA. Recently, CRISPR-Cas systems have been tested as molecular editing tools to manipulate specific genes linked with periodontal disease (such as periodontitis) and as novel methods of delivering antimicrobial agents to overcome antimicrobial resistance. With the rapidly increasing role of CRISPR in treating inflammatory diseases, its application in periodontal disease is also becoming popular. Therefore, this review aims to discuss the different types of CRISPR-Cas in oral microbes and their role in periodontal disease pathogenesis and precision periodontal therapy."
"This study aimed to develop a reliable and efficient genetic transformation method for the ornamental Indian Lotus (Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn.) using the sonication-assisted Rhizobium radiobacter-mediated transformation technique. To conduct the transformation, shoot apical meristem explants were infected with Rhizobium radiobacter (synonym Agrobacterium tumefaciens) strain LBA 4404 containing a binary vector pBI121 that harbours the GUS reporter gene (uidA) and kanamycin resistance gene nptII for plant selection. To improve the transformation efficiency, we optimized parameters such as bacterial cell density, sonication duration, infection time, co-cultivation duration, acetosyringone concentration, cefotaxime, and kanamycin concentrations. Sonication treatment at 42 kHz for 90 s recorded the highest transformation efficiency. The selection of regenerated plantlets was performed on a kanamycin-supplemented selection medium. The putative transformants showed GUS expression in the leaves and petioles. The presence of the GUS gene was also confirmed in the putative transformants through PCR, with the appearance of the expected amplicon size of 520 bp. The presence of nptII was confirmed by PCR in the putatively transformed plants with an amplicon size of 530 bp. The maximum regeneration frequency obtained was 72.66%, and the highest transformation efficiency achieved was 9.0% in the Indian Lotus."
"Brain AVMs are congenital anomalies of the cerebrovascular system, often discovered incidentally or through symptomatic presentations such as intracranial hemorrhage, seizure, headache, or neurologic deficits. Various treatment modalities exist for AVMs, including radiosurgery, a treatment technique that is noninvasive and efficient. Accurate imaging is crucial for risk assessment, treatment planning, and monitoring of these patients before and after radiosurgery."
"Globally, the transport sector is a major contributor to air pollution. Currently, in the UK, vehicle emissions contribute significant amounts of nitrogen oxide (NOx) and particulate matter (PM) pollution in urban areas. Low-emission-zone policies have been used as an intervention to tackle air pollution, and in this context, the UK launched the Low-Traffic Neighbourhood scheme. This study investigates the impacts of the Low-Traffic Neighbourhood in Kings Heath, Birmingham, UK, to evaluate its impact in reducing air pollution and local community perspectives about the scheme and perceived impacts on health and well-being. This study employs a mixed-method approach comprising an air-quality-monitoring assessment and a survey questionnaire involving 210 residents. The findings reveal an increase in active travel and a reduction in air pollution levels in the years after the implementation of the scheme, although the area is still non-compliant with the 2021 WHO air quality guidelines. Nonetheless, the scheme has a polarising effect and created a division within the local community about the overall scheme acceptance and spatial distribution of the scheme's benefits. This study underscores the importance of comprehensive baseline data, long-term community engagement, and integration with broader urban planning initiatives to enhance the success of future Low-Neighbourhood Traffic schemes."
"Stigma significantly impacts individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) and their caregivers, exacerbating social isolation, psychological distress, and reducing quality of life (QoL). Although considerable research has been conducted on PD's clinical aspects, the social and emotional challenges, like stigma, remain underexplored. Addressing stigma is crucial for enhancing well-being, fostering inclusivity and improving access to care and support. The review aims to fill this knowledge gap by synthesising existing literature on PD stigma, examining its effects on individuals and families affected, and identifying areas where interventions could reduce stigma's impact."
"The concept of pharmacokinetic (PK) boosting of calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) emerged after the FDA approval of cyclosporine-A. Several studies followed, and the proof of concept was well established by the late 1990s. This also continued for the next blockbuster immunosuppressant, tacrolimus. The driver for such research was an endeavor to save costs, as both drugs were expensive due to patent protection. Two CYP inhibitors, ketoconazole and diltiazem, have been extensively studied in this context and continue to be prescribed off-label along with the CNI. It has been observed that using ketoconazole reduces the dose requirement of tacrolimus by about 50% and 30% with diltiazem, which is in conformity with their pharmacological actions. Off-label co-prescription of these drugs with CNI is often encountered in low and middle-income countries. The foremost reason cited is economic. This article collates the evidence from the clinical studies that evaluate the PK-boosting effects of CNI and also reviews the gaps in the current evidence base. The current knowledge prevents the transplant community from making meaningful inferences about the risks and benefits of such strategies. Although the PK-boosting strategy can lead to serious adverse events, emerging evidence suggests that it may be advantageous for individuals with high CNI dose requirements. Hence, PK boosting may be an unmet need in the therapeutics of CNI. Nevertheless, there are several unanswered questions surrounding such use, and therefore, this merits testing in well-designed clinical studies. Moreover, drugs with better safer profiles and a history of successful PK boosting may be considered for evaluation with CNI."
"Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) and proteoglycan receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase σ (PTPσ) play a critical role in the pathology of spinal cord injury (SCI). CSPGs can be induced by autophagy inhibition in astrocyte. However, CSPG's impact on autophagy and its role in SCI is still unknown. We investigate intracellular sigma peptide (ISP) targeting PTPσ, its effects on autophagy, and synaptic reorganization in SCI. We found that ISP increased the level of autophagosome marker LC3B-II/I and decreased autophagosome degradation marker p62 in SCI, suggesting activated autophagy flux. ISP restored autophagosome-lysosome fusion-related protein syntaxin 17 (STX17) and lysosome-associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP2), indicating activated autophagosome-lysosome fusion. ISP increased pre-synaptic marker synaptophysin (SYN) and postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95) expression and improved excitatory synapse marker vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1) and SYN in SCI, suggesting improved synaptic reorganization. ISP promoted axon marker neurofilament and growth-related GAP-43 expression in SCI. ISP rescued a preserved number of motor neurons and improved neurobehavioral recovery after SCI. Our study extended the CSPG-PTPσ inhibition role in activating autophagy flux, axon and synaptic reorganization, and functional recovery in SCI."
"The excavation of the super-large cross-section tunnel portal section is prone to causing serious engineering distresses. The key factors to ensure the safe construction of portal section are to clarify the construction mechanic characteristics and select a reasonable construction scheme. In this paper, a bidirectional six-lane expressway tunnel in Southwest China was selected as an engineering case. Three excavation schemes, namely, the three-bench seven-step excavation method (TEM), the central diaphragm method (CDM), and the double side drift method (DSDM), were compared and analyzed. Findings revealed that due to the effect of the asymmetrically loaded and super-large cross-section, the surrounding rock deformation and supporting structure stress at the deep buried side were greater than those at the shallow buried side. The CDM and DSDM could reduce the tunnel span and provide temporary support in time, which could effectively control the surrounding rock deformation and improve the structural stress and the slope stability. According to the topographic condition, the excavation sequence of the DSDM was optimized. Excavating the shallow buried side drift first could alleviate the surrounding rock deformation and improve the slope stability in the early stage of construction. Finally, the optimal excavation scheme was successfully implemented."

"Medical and surgical treatments for cystic echinococcosis (CE) are challenged by various complications. This study evaluates in vitro protoscolicidal activity of piperine-loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticles (PIP-MSNs) against protoscoleces of Echinococcus granulosus. MSNs were prepared by adding tetraethyl orthosilicate to cetyltrimethylammonium bromide and NaOH, and then loaded with PIP. The mean particle size and hydrodynamic diameter of MSNs were determined at 68 ± 4.5 and 101.4 ± 50.4 nm using transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering, respectively. X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared analysis, and UV-spectrophotometry confirmed drug loading. Drug loading efficiency and drug loading capacity were calculated at 60% and 18%, respectively. The drug release profile confirmed a 75% PIP release plateau after about 24 h. The cytotoxicity assay showed cell viability > 90% in all concentrations used (≤ 512 µg/mL). E. granulosus protoscoleces were exposed to PIP-MSNs and their viability was assessed using the eosin exclusion test. In a dose-dependent manner (p < 0.001), exposure to 375 and 500 µg/mL of PIP-MSNs for 180 min killed 89.67 and 94.67% of protoscoleces, respectively. This study introduces PIP-MSNs as a potential protoscolicidal agent in the treatment of CE. Further studies are necessary to uncover safety aspects, biodistribution patterns, and potential combination therapies."

"Biliverdin reductase B (BLVRB) is a redox regulator that catalyzes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-dependent reductions of multiple substrates, including flavins and biliverdin-β. BLVRB has emerging roles in redox regulation and post-translational modifications, highlighting its importance in various physiological contexts. In this study, we explore the structural and functional differences between human BLVRB and its hyrax homologue, focusing on evolutionary adaptations at the active site and allosteric regions. Using NMR spectroscopy, we compared coenzyme binding, catalytic turnover, and dynamic behavior between the two homologues. Despite lacking the arginine ""clamp"" present in human BLVRB, hyrax BLVRB still undergoes conformational changes in response to the oxidative state of the coenzyme. Mutations at the allosteric site (position 164) show that threonine at this position enhances coenzyme discrimination and allosteric coupling in human BLVRB, while hyrax BLVRB does not display the same allosteric effects. Relaxation experiments revealed distinct dynamic behaviors in hyrax BLVRB, with increased flexibility in its holo form due to the absence of the clamp. Our findings suggest that the evolutionary loss of the active site clamp and modifications at position 164 in hyrax BLVRB alter the enzyme's conformational dynamics and coenzyme interactions. Identified similarities and differences underscore how key regions modulate catalytic efficiency and suggest that coenzyme isomerization may represent the rate-limiting step in both homologues."
"Inflammation serves as the foundation for numerous physiological and pathological processes, driving the onset and progression of various diseases. Histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3), an essential chromatin-modifying protein within the histone deacetylase superfamily, exerts its transcriptional inhibitory role through enzymatic histone modification to uphold normal physiological function, growth, and development of the body. With both enzymatic and non-enzymatic activities, HDAC3 plays a pivotal role in regulating diverse transcription factors associated with inflammatory responses and related diseases. This review examines the involvement of HDAC3 in inflammatory responses while exploring its therapeutic potential as a target for treating inflammatory diseases, thereby offering valuable insights for clinical applications."
"The Traditional Formula (TF), a combination of herbs prepared in accordance with traditional medicine principles, is increasingly garnering global attention as an alternative to modern medicine. Specifically, there is growing interest in exploring TF's therapeutic effects across various diseases. A significant portion of the state-of-the-art knowledge regarding the relationship between TF and disease is found in scientific publications, where manual knowledge extraction is impractical. Thus, Natural Language Processing (NLP) is being employed to efficiently and accurately search and extract crucial knowledge from unstructured literatures. However, the absence of a high-quality manually annotated corpus focusing on TF-disease relationships hampers the use of NLP in the fields of traditional medicine and modern biomedical science. This article introduces the Traditional Formula-Disease Relationship (TFDR) corpus, a manually annotated corpus designed to facilitate the automatic extraction of TF-disease relationships from biomedical literatures. The TFDR corpus includes information gleaned from 740 PubMed abstracts, encompassing a total of 6,211 TF mentions, 7,166 disease mentions, and 1,109 relationships between them encapsulated within 744 key-sentences."
"Temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis (TMJOA) is a severe form of temporomandibular joint disorders (TMD), and orofacial inflammatory allodynia is one of its common symptoms which lacks effective treatment. N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), particularly its subtypes GluN2A and GluN2B, along with gap junctions (GJs), are key players in the mediation of inflammatory pain. However, the precise regulatory mechanisms of GluN2A, GluN2B, and GJs in orofacial inflammatory allodynia during TMJ inflammation still remain unclear. Here, we established the TMJ inflammation model by injecting Complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) into the TMJ and used Cre/loxp site-specific recombination system to conditionally knock out (CKO) GluN2A and GluN2B in the trigeminal ganglion (TG). Von-frey test results indicated that CFA-induced mechanical allodynia in the TMJ region was relieved in GluN2A and GluN2B deficient mice. In vivo, CFA significantly up-regulated the expression of GluN2A and GluN2B, Gjb1, Gjb2, Gjc2 and Panx3 in the TG, and GluN2A and GluN2B CKO played different roles in mediating the expression of Gjb1, Gjb2, Gjc2 and Panx3. In vitro, NMDA up-regulated the expression of Gjb1, Gjb2, Gjc2 and Panx3 in satellite glial cells (SGCs) as well as promoted the intercellular communication between SGCs, and GluN2A and GluN2B knocking down (KD) altered the expression and function differently. NMDAR regulated Gjb1 and Panx3 through ERK1/2 pathway, and mediated Gjb2 and Gjc2 through MAPK, PKA, and PKC intracellular signaling pathways. These findings shed light on the distinct functions of GluN2A and GluN2B in mediating peripheral sensitization induced by TMJ inflammation in the TG, offering potential therapeutic targets for managing orofacial inflammatory allodynia."
"Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) derived from natural sources have garnered significant attention due to their unique properties and eco-friendly production methods.

"To assess and compare two techniques of low-level laser application-transgingival (TLLLT) and intrasulcular (ILLLT)-used in photobiomodulation as an adjunct to basic periodontal therapy (BPT) in patients with periodontitis. A randomized, split-mouth, double-blind clinical trial was conducted, selecting three diseased periodontal sites from different quadrants in each patient. These sites were assigned to one of three treatment groups: SRP (control), SRP + TLLLT (test 1), and SRP + ILLLT (test 2). Low-level laser therapy in the test groups was applied at 48 h, 7 days, and 14 days after full-mouth SRP. Clinical parameters such as probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), and bleeding on probing (BOP) were assessed at baseline (T0), 3 months (T1), and 6 months (T2). Standardized periapical radiographs were used to assess radiographic bone density (RBD) 6 months post-treatment. Statistical analyses included repeated measures ANOVA for continuous variables and chi-square tests for categorical variables, with significance set at p < 0.05 and a 95% confidence interval. Significant reductions in PD (p < 0.001) and CAL (p < 0.001) were observed across all groups at 3 and 6 months, with no significant differences between groups. There were also no significant changes in BOP and RBD between groups at the follow-up intervals. Adjunctive photobiomodulation did not provide additional clinical or radiographic benefits over SRP alone, regardless of the laser application technique employed."
"Dopamine (DA) release in striatal circuits, including the nucleus accumbens medial shell (mNAcSh), tracks separable features of reward like motivation and reinforcement. However, the cellular and circuit mechanisms by which DA receptors transform DA release into distinct constructs of reward remain unclear. Here we show that DA D3 receptor (D3R) signaling in the mNAcSh drives motivated behavior in mice by regulating local microcircuits. Furthermore, D3Rs coexpress with DA D1 receptors, which regulate reinforcement, but not motivation. Paralleling dissociable roles in reward function, we report nonoverlapping physiological actions of D3R and DA D1 receptor signaling in mNAcSh neurons. Our results establish a fundamental framework wherein DA signaling within the same nucleus accumbens cell type is physiologically compartmentalized via actions on distinct DA receptors. This structural and functional organization provides neurons in a limbic circuit with the unique ability to orchestrate dissociable aspects of reward-related behaviors relevant to the etiology of neuropsychiatric disorders."
Post-bariatric hypoglycemia (PBH) is a complication of bariatric surgery including Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). It remains unclear why only some individuals develop PBH.
"Retroperitoneal liposarcoma (RPLPS) is one of the most common histologic subtypes of soft tissue sarcoma (STS). Complete surgical resection remains the mainstay treatment, while the high rate of locoregional recurrence constitutes the predominant cause of mortality. Well-differentiated (WDLPS) and dedifferentiated (DDLPS) liposarcoma are the most frequent subtypes of RPLPS and present amplified MDM2 gene as a hallmark. However, there are few reports evaluating the role of alternatively spliced MDM2 transcripts in RPLPS. In this study, we assessed MDM2-ALT2 expression levels in a cohort of RPLPS patients and evaluated the biological functions of the MDM2-ALT2 isoform in vitro in DDLPS cell lines. Using BaseScope™ and qPCR, we demonstrated that MDM2-Full Length (MDM2-FL) and MDM2-ALT2 expression levels were upregulated in RPLPS patient-derived tissue samples compared to normal adjacent to tumor tissue (NAT). DDLPS cells overexpressing MDM2-FL or MDM2-ALT2 had higher proliferation rates and increased migration and invasion capacities, as well as increased protein levels of p-AKT, mTOR, p70S6K, MMP2, and cJun. Simultaneous overexpression of MDM2-ALT2 and AKT silencing showed that AKT inhibition impaired p-p70S6K and MMP2 protein increased levels and led to significantly decreased proliferation and migration rates compared to cells overexpressing MDM2-ALT2 only. Taken together, our data suggest that MDM2-ALT2 may promote RPLPS progression."
"A toddler presented to audiovestibular medicine with mild bilateral, sensorineural hearing loss identified via the Newborn Hearing Screening Programme. This report focuses on the early clinical assessment and aetiological investigation which prompted testing for metabolic disease and highlights the parents' perspective. Early investigation led to a relatively early diagnosis of mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) type IIIA: Sanfilippo disease which enabled the family to access a novel treatment option which otherwise would not have been possible.Infants with early signs and symptoms of MPS may present to a range of healthcare professionals. The detection of hearing loss via the newborn hearing screen presents an opportunity for healthcare professionals to initiate early investigation for a possible underlying metabolic disease before end-organ damage progresses. This is vital in allowing affected families to engage with clinical trials and genetic counselling."

"Desertification is a major ecological issue worldwide that results in the destruction of terrestrial ecosystems. Restoration of desertified ecosystems has been carried out in recent decades, but the role of soil microorganisms in this process is poorly understood. Thus, to deconstruct the effects of desertified system restoration on soil microbial communities, we examined the changes in soil characteristics as well as the variations in and drivers of soil microbial diversity and community composition of the Hulun Buir Sandy Land in Northeast China, where restoration activities have been performed for approximately 30 years. The results revealed that with desertified system restoration, plant species richness and aboveground biomass increased significantly. The soil properties, characterized by organic carbon, total nitrogen and available nitrogen content improved. Moreover, soil pH decreased significantly from 7.75 in mobile dunes to 7.17 in fixed dunes (P < 0.05). Compared to mobile dunes, the Chao1 and Shannon diversity indices of bacteria increased significantly in fixed dunes. In contrast, the fungal richness index (Chao1 index) decreased significantly during desertified system restoration. The fungal Shannon diversity index also showed a decreasing trend, although it was not significant (P > 0.05). Proteobacteria was the most prevalent bacterial phylum, with a relative abundance of over 40%. In fixed dunes, the relative abundances of Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, Gemmatimonadetes, and Chloroflexi significantly increased, whereas the relative abundance of Firmicutes significantly decreased. For fungi, Ascomycota was the dominant phylum, with a relative abundance of 97.6% in fixed dunes compared with 82.4% in mobile dunes. Plant species richness and soil pH were the major determinants of the soil microbial communities. This research provides important insights into the changes in soil microbial communities and their relationships with environmental factors during desertified system restoration, which can help guide sustainable land management practices and the restoration of desertified areas."

"Hypertension (HTN) is common and represents a major modifiable risk factor for ischemic heart disease in older adults. While home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) is important in HTN management, patterns of HBPM engagement in older adults undergoing mobile health cardiac rehabilitation (mHealth-CR) are unknown. We aimed to identify patterns of adherence to HBPM in a cohort of older adults undergoing mHealth-CR to optimize HBPM use in the future."
"Despite the robust correlation between metabolic disorders and heavy metals, there has been limited research on the associations between nickel levels and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) as well as liver fibrosis. This study aimed to examine the associations among urinary nickel, NAFLD, and liver fibrosis. The data utilized in this study were obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2017-2020. A comprehensive screening process was conducted, resulting in the inclusion of a total of 3169 American adults in the analysis. The measurement of urinary nickel was conducted through inductively coupled-plasma mass spectrometry. Vibration-controlled transient elastography was employed to assess the controlled attenuation parameter and liver stiffness measurement as indicators for NAFLD and liver fibrosis, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression models were employed to evaluate the associations among urinary nickel, NAFLD, and liver fibrosis. Restricted cubic splines were employed to explored the nonlinear associations. After adjusting for all covariates, the correlation between the highest quartile of urinary nickel and NAFLD was found to be significant (OR = 1.65; 95% CI, 1.19-2.27). Subgroup analysis revealed that the correlation was significant only in men. A significant association occurred between the second quartile of urinary nickel and liver fibrosis (OR 1.88; 95% CI, 1.22-2.90). Restricted cubic spline showed that the relationship was linear between urinary nickel and NAFLD and non-monotonic, inverse U-shaped between urinary nickel and liver fibrosis. This cross-sectional study indicated that the risk of NAFLD is associated with urinary nickel, and this correlation was only present among males."
"Anorexia nervosa (AN) is an eating disorder with the second highest mortality of all mental illnesses and high relapse rate, especially among adult females, yet with no accepted pharmacotherapy. A small number of studies have reported that adult females who struggled with severe and relapsing AN experienced sustained remission of the illness following ketamine infusions. Two other reports showed that 30 mg/kg IP ketamine can reduce vulnerability of adolescent mice to activity-based anorexia (ABA), an animal model of AN. However, no study has tested the efficacy of ketamine on adult ABA mice. This study aimed to fill this gap in knowledge."
"This study evaluated the survival probabilities of two lithia-based glass-ceramics after final crystallization in a microwave furnace using conventional crystallization as a reference. Disc-shaped samples of a lithium silicate (LS, Celtra Duo) and a lithium disilicate (LD, e.max CAD) were prepared and divided into two groups according to the crystallization method (n = 30): microwave (M) or conventional furnaces (C). The biaxial flexural strength test was used to determine the fatigue test profile and its parameters. Then, specimens were submitted to an accelerated life test (step stress) using three profile levels - mild, moderate, and aggressive - varying the load increments and the number of cycles until fracture (4 Hz). Survival data were used to calculate Weibull's beta (β) value and reliability of the assigned missions. Scanning electron microscopy was employed to analyze surface morphology, fracture characteristics, and failure patterns. Beta (β) values for the LS-C, LS-M, LD-C, and LD-M groups were 2.65, 0.25, 0.62, and 0.3, respectively. Similar reliability was observed in all groups after 50,000 cycles at 100 and 150 Mpa. At 200 Mpa, the crystallization method did not affect the reliability within LS or LD. However, LD showed greater reliability than LS when crystallized by microwave energy. Thus, microwave energy can be suggested as an alternative to the process of conventional lithia-based glass-ceramics crystallization without damaging their survival probabilities."
"Non-laboratory-based cardiovascular risk prediction tools are feasible alternatives to laboratory-based tools in low- and middle-income countries. However, their effectiveness compared to their laboratory-based counterparts has not been adequately tested."
"The Cardiometabolic Index (CMI) represents a novel anthropometric measurement, which combines characteristics of adiposity and lipids. Since obesity, lipid metabolism, and inflammation may collectively facilitate the occurrence of stroke, we hypothesize that a combination of elevated levels of the CMI and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) increases the risk of future stroke among middle-aged and older Chinese adults."
"A crisis in early pregnancy can be due to an unplanned pregnancy or a suspected abnormality. Pregnant people have the right to unbiased and comprehensive advice of all options from healthcare providers. Using story completion models (SCM), the aim of this qualitative study was to explore the attitudes of medical students and doctors in training towards crisis pregnancy, specifically two scenarios: early unplanned pregnancy and fatal fetal abnormality (anencephaly). Participants were invited from medical students attending University College Dublin (UCD) and trainees in Obstetrics and Gynaecology at the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland (RCPI) from July to December 2022. SCM involves giving the consenting participant an introduction to a hypothetical situation that acts as the beginning of a story and asking them to complete it. Stories were compiled and analysed using thematic analysis. Research Ethics Committee approval was given by both UCD and the RCPI. The standards for reporting qualitative research guidelines were followed. Eight doctors in training and six medical students consented to participate in the study; all but two medical students completed both stories to the required word count, giving 25 stories for analysis. For both situations, stories described a variety of approaches, all of which were based on the person's, or couple's, wishes, from continuing in pregnancy to deciding to end the pregnancy. SCM allowed detailed analysis of potentially sensitive subjects such as pregnancy options. This study showed that participating medical students and doctors in training recognise that pregnant people have the right to all choices in crisis pregnancy."
Faculty-to-faculty incivility is an ongoing issue in nursing education. Negative effects for faculty experiencing incivility include both physical and psychological distress. Research related to faculty-to-faculty incivility has focused on the incidence and effects of incivility. This study examined nursing program attributes that contribute to a culture of workplace civility.
Here we describe the first detected VIM-2-producing representative of Pseudomonasputida group - Pseudomonaskurunegalensis from the largest Bulgarian hospital - St George University Hospital in Plovdiv.
"Undergraduate students are often impacted by depression, anxiety, and stress. In this context, machine learning may support mental health assessment. Based on the following research question: ""How do machine learning models perform in the detection of depression, anxiety, and stress among undergraduate students?"", we aimed to evaluate the performance of these models. PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, and Web of Science databases were searched, aiming at studies meeting the following criteria: publication in English; targeting undergraduate university students; empirical studies; having been published in a scientific journal; and predicting anxiety, depression, or stress outcomes via machine learning. The certainty of evidence was analyzed using the GRADE. As of January 2024, 2,304 articles were found, and 48 studies met the inclusion criteria. Different types of data were identified, including behavioral, physiological, internet usage, neurocerebral, blood markers, mixed data, as well as demographic and mobility data. Among the 33 studies that provided accuracy assessment, 30 reported values that exceeded 70%. Accuracy in detecting stress ranged from 63% to 100%, anxiety from 53.69% to 97.9%, and depression from 73.5% to 99.1%. Although most models present adequate performance, it should be noted that 47 of them only performed internal validation, which may overstate the performance data. Moreover, the GRADE checklist suggested that the quality of the evidence was very low. These findings indicate that machine learning algorithms hold promise in Public Health; however, it is crucial to scrutinize their practical applicability. Further studies should invest mainly in external validation of the machine learning models."
"Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are often prescribed following the placement of dental implants, but the effects of these drugs on the osseointegration process are poorly understood. We designed a randomized, placebo-controlled pilot study to quantitatively assess the effect of NSAIDs during early implant osseointegration."
"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide, also in Chile, where the main risk factor is smoking. Early detection using low-dose computed tomography has been shown to reduce mortality from this cause, but there are still no formal screening recommendations in Chile."
"Lysine deacetylases (KDACs or HDACs) are metal-dependent enzymes that regulate lysine acetylation, a post-translational modification that is present on thousands of human proteins, essential for many cellular processes, and often misregulated in diseases. The selective inhibition of KDACs would allow for understanding of the biological roles of individual KDACs and therapeutic targeting of individual enzymes. Recent studies have suggested that purportedly specific KDAC inhibitors have significant off-target binding, but the biological consequences of off-target binding were not evaluated. We compared the effects of treatment with two of the reportedly most KDAC-selective inhibitors, Tubastatin A and PCI-34051, in HT1080 cells in which the endogenous KDAC6 or KDAC8 gene has been mutated to inactivate enzyme catalysis while retaining enzyme expression. Genetic inactivation results in much stronger deacetylation defects on known targets compared to inhibitor treatment. Gene expression analysis revealed that both inhibitors have extensive and extensively overlapping off-target effects in cells, even at low inhibitor doses. Furthermore, Tubastatin A treatment led to increased histone acetylation, while inactivation of KDAC6 or KDAC8 did not. Genetic inactivation of KDAC6, but not KDAC8, impaired tumor formation in a xenograft model system, in contrast to previous reports with KDAC inhibitors suggesting the reverse. We conclude that the majority of observed biological effects of treatment with KDAC inhibitors are due to off-target effects rather than the intended KDAC inhibition. Developing a truly specific KDAC6 inhibitor could be a promising therapeutic avenue, but it is imperative to develop new inhibitors that selectively mimic genetic inactivation of individual KDACs."
Sentiment analysis is one of the most widely used methods for mining and examining text. Social media researchers need guidance on choosing between manual and automated sentiment analysis methods.
"Cellular senescence, an irreversible state of cell cycle arrest characterized by phenotypic changes and a specific secretory profile, plays a dual role in liver health and disease. Under physiological conditions, senescence aids organ repair and regeneration, but its accumulation due to aging or pathological stress significantly contributes to chronic liver diseases, including alcoholic liver disease, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, liver fibrosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Senescence is identified by a range of cellular and molecular changes, such as morphological alterations, expression of cell cycle inhibitors, senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity, and nuclear membrane changes. The onset of senescence in organ cells can affect the entire organism, primarily through the senescence-associated secretory phenotype, which has autocrine, paracrine, and endocrine effects on tissue microenvironments. The objective of this review is to offer a contemporary overview of the pathophysiological events involving hepatic senescent cells and to elucidate their role in the onset and progression of liver diseases, particularly through mechanisms like telomere shortening, genomic and mitochondrial DNA damage, and inflammation. Additionally, this review discusses the emerging senolytic therapies aimed at targeting senescent cells to delay or mitigate liver disease progression. The therapeutic potential of these interventions, alongside their safety and effectiveness, highlights the need for further research to refine these approaches and address unresolved problems in the field of hepatic cellular senescence."
"Accurately identifying ligands plays a crucial role in the process of structure-guided drug design. Based on density maps from X-ray diffraction or cryogenic-sample electron microscopy (cryoEM), scientists verify whether small-molecule ligands bind to active sites of interest. However, the interpretation of density maps is challenging, and cognitive bias can sometimes mislead investigators into modeling fictitious compounds. Ligand identification can be aided by automatic methods, but existing approaches are available only for X-ray diffraction and are based on iterative fitting or feature-engineered machine learning rather than end-to-end deep learning."
"Alveolar bone defects have always been an urgent problem in the oral cavity. For some patients with periodontal disease or undergoing orthodontic treatment or implant restoration, alveolar bone defects can greatly inconvenience clinical diagnosis and treatment. Periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) are considered a promising source for stem cell therapy due to their high osteogenic differentiation capability. The osteogenic differentiation of PDLSCs is influenced by various cytokines mediating signaling pathways, as well as a range of biochemical, physical, and chemical factors. Different environments typically impact the Wnt signaling pathway and consequently affect the osteogenic differentiation of PDLSCs. Understanding the effects of the Wnt signaling pathway on the osteogenic differentiation of periodontal ligament stem cells in various environments contributes to addressing the diverse clinical scenarios encountered in the oral environment. This knowledge aids in influencing the pathway through bioengineering or the development of novel materials, thereby enhancing the osteogenic potential of stem cells and providing new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for clinical practice."
"Radioresistance is a major clinical challenge in cancer treatment, as it reduces the effectiveness of radiation therapy (RT). While advances in radiation delivery have enabled the clinical use of high-dose hypofractionated RT, its impact on radioresistant tumors remains unclear. This study aimed to compare the effects of single high-dose RT with conventional fractionated RT on radioresistant breast cancer cells and explore the underlying mechanisms."

"Periodontitis is an inflammatory disease triggered by microbial biofilms that promote immune dysfunction and tissue destruction of tooth-supporting tissues. The search for soluble mediators that amplify inflammatory responses and matrix degradation in periodontal tissues has implicated extracellular vimentin (ECV) as a signaling ligand and damage-associated molecular pattern in the pathogenesis of periodontitis. Intracellular vimentin filaments are essential for the structural integrity of cells and the preservation of matrix homeostasis. These are important determinants of health in the periodontium and many other organs. But in inflamed tissues, intracellular vimentin filaments are disassembled. Vimentin is subsequently released from cells into the extracellular space in a soluble form where it drives immune signaling and tissue destruction. We discuss the role of ECV as a signaling molecule in several tissues. We apply these data to understand how in inflammatory diseases like periodontitis, ECV amplifies immune responses that contribute to disease progression. Arising from these data, we consider novel therapeutic opportunities for limiting tissue destruction by targeting ECV for treatment of inflammatory disorders like periodontitis."
"Maximizing muscular performance to improve upper limb strength and power can be advantageous in preparing kickboxers for training and competition. The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of isometric and isotonic upper limb post-activation performance enhancement (PAPE) strategies on the maximal strength of young men kickboxers' upper limbs, assessed through handgrip strength (HG) and the chest medicine ball throw test (CMBT). Fifty-three amateur men kickboxers, aged between 16 and 23, participated voluntarily in this regional-level study. Over two weeks, participants were randomly exposed to three conditions: isometric, isotonic, and control (no warm-up) conditions. Each condition was repeated twice during this timeframe, resulting in six data collection sessions. After each condition, participants underwent assessments for HG strength and CMBT performance. Repeated measures ANOVA revealed significant differences between conditions in HG (p < 0.001; ES = 0.740). Post-hoc analysis revealed that the isometric condition showed significantly better scores compared to both the isotonic condition (p < 0.001) and the control condition (p < 0.001). Significant differences were found in CMBT (p < 0.001; ES = 0.355). Post-hoc analysis revealed that the isometric (p < 0.001) and isotonic conditions (p < 0.001) displayed significantly superior outcomes in contrast to control. In conclusion, isometric exercise significantly improved maximal HG strength and muscular power in the CMBT, showing a potential effective strategy for implementing PAPE for kickboxers."
"Nonspecific viral adsorption by polymer nanoparticles is more economical and superior in terms of operating cost and energy efficiency than viral adsorption using virus-specific antibodies and filtration techniques involving size exclusion in the order of tens of nanometres. In this study, we synthesised four types of polycyclic aromatic polymer (ArP) nanoparticles with different structures and evaluated their virus adsorption capability for infectious particles of the newly emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). ArP nanoparticles with a diameter of approximately 500 nm were prepared by one-pot precipitation polymerisation using structural isomers of bifunctional dihydroxynaphthalene (1,5-dihydroxynaphthalene and 2,6-dihydroxynaphthalene) as phenol monomers, as well as 3-hydroxybenzoic acid and 3-aminophenol as comonomers to introduce carboxylic acid and amino groups, respectively. This wide range of phenolic monomers offers a powerful molecular design capability, enabling the optimisation of surface properties for the adsorption of various infectious virus particles. The virus adsorption capacity of the ArP nanoparticles exceeded 20 000 plaque-forming units and was found to be correlated with the nitrogen (primary and secondary amines) and quinone contents on the ArP nanoparticle surface. Furthermore, a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane filter uniformly coated with the ArP nanoparticles could remove viruses by filtration in a flow system."
"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major contributor to dementia and the most common neurodegenerative disorder. In AD pathophysiology, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)-proteolytic enzymes, best known to be responsible for remodeling and degradation of the extracellular matrix-were suggested to play an important role. Due to the diverse nature of the published data and frequent inconsistent results presented in available papers, it was considered essential to analyze all aspects of MMP literature with respect to AD pathophysiology and attempt to outline a unifying concept for understanding their role in AD. Thus, the main contribution of this review article is to summarize the most recent research on the participation of MMP in AD pathophysiology obtained using the cell cultures to understand the molecular principles of their action. Furthermore, an updated comprehensive view regarding this topic based exclusively on papers from human studies is provided as well. It can be concluded that determining the exact role of any particular MMPs in the AD pathophysiology holds promise for establishing their role as potential biomarkers reflecting the severity or progression of this disease or for developing new therapeutic agents targeting the processes that lead to AD."
"The development of tannins adhesives with high performance and eco-friendly properties is crucial for addressing the dependence of traditional formaldehyde-based wood adhesives on petrochemical resources and the harm of formaldehyde emission. However, conventional methods for preparing tannins adhesives generally involve the use of tannins with high mean degree of polymerization (mDP) and formaldehyde, resulting in poor bonding properties and formaldehyde emission, hindering their industrial application. Herein, the larch tannins (LT) were degraded by photocatalytic degradation to obtain tannins with different mDP, and the tannins glyoxal (G) adhesives were synthesized with different mass ratios of G to LT, then used to prepare plywood with poplar veneer. The effect of different mDP and different mass ratios of G to LT on the properties of adhesives such as viscosity, curing time, shear strength, formaldehyde emission, water insoluble rate, humidity absorption rate and thermal properties were explored. The findings indicated that photocatalysis could lead to regular degradation of LT, and the different mDP of the LT could be obtained by adjusting the photocatalytic degradation time in a certain time range (1-6 h). When the mass ratio of G to LT6 (the LT with the maximum formaldehyde reactivity and mDP 3.71after 6 h of photocatalytic degradation) was 10 %, the LT6-10 %G adhesives imparted to the plywood with excellent bonding strength and water resistance under the hot-pressing temperature 140 °C. The dry shear strength, 3 h hot water shear strength (63 °C) and 3 h boiling water shear strength were as high as 1.83, 1.12, and 0.83 MPa. Its superior bonding performance exceeded the requirements of the Chinese national standard (GB/T9846-2015, ≥0.70 MPa). The formaldehyde emission was 0.12 mg/L, lower than poplar veneer (0.23 mg/L). LT6-10 %G adhesives sufficiently to be considered as a substitute for the formaldehyde-based wood adhesives currently in use."

"Cotton is a non-edible fiber crop with considerable potential for the remediation of copper-polluted soil. However, the Cu toxicity tolerance mechanism in cotton remains largely obscure. To address the issue, we first identified two cotton lines contrasting in response to Cu toxicity by examining 12 morphological and physiological attributes of 43 origin scattered cotton genotypes under Cu excess. Then both lines were subjected to a comprehensive comparative study, aiming to unravel the cotton Cu tolerance mechanism through integrated morphological, physio-biochemical, Cu uptake and distribution, and related molecular expression analyses."
"Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is one of the most common congenital valvular heart diseases occurring in 0.5-2% of the general population, in 2-6% of patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) and up to 20% of octo/nonagenarians undergoing surgery. In this regard, Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has emerged as a therapeutic alternative. At the present time, there is not enough evidence to determine which is the best therapeutic approach for AS in BAV. We report a severe acute recoil following TAVR with a self-expanding prosthesis in heavily calcified BAV. In addition, we provide an updated review of the clinical significance of prosthesis underexpansion in the medium-term."
"Adequate assessment of the contribution of the different phases of atrial mechanical activity to the value of ejection volume and pressure developed by the ventricle is a complex and important experimental and clinical problem. A new method and an effective algorithm for controlling the interaction of isolated rat right atrial and right ventricular strips during the cardiac cycle were developed and tested in a physiological experiment. The presented functional model is flexible and has the ability to change many parameters (temperature, pacing rate, excitation delay, pre- and afterload levels, transfer length, and force scaling coefficients) to simulate different types of cardiac pathologies. For the first time, the contribution of the duration of the excitation delay of the right ventricular strips to the amount of work performed by the muscles during the cardiac cycle was evaluated. Changes in the onset of atrial systole and the delay in activation of ventricular contraction may lead to a reduction in cardiac stroke volume, which should be considered in the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular disease and in resynchronization therapy."
"Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are widely applied in various industries and everyday life, particularly in fields such as virtual assistants, healthcare, and education. However, this paper highlights that existing research has often overlooked the philosophical and media aspects. To address this, we developed an interactive system called ""Human Nature Test"". In this context, ""human nature"" refers to emotion and consciousness, while ""test"" involves a critical analysis of AI technology and an exploration of the differences between humanity and technicality. Additionally, through experimental research and literature analysis, we found that the integration of electroencephalogram (EEG) data with AI systems is becoming a significant trend. The experiment involved 20 participants, with two conditions: C1 (using EEG data) and C2 (without EEG data). The results indicated a significant increase in immersion under the C1 condition, along with a more positive emotional experience. We summarized three design directions: enhancing immersion, creating emotional experiences, and expressing philosophical concepts. Based on these findings, there is potential for further developing EEG data as a medium to enrich interactive experiences, offering new insights into the fusion of technology and human emotion."
"As the demand for ""quick-fixes"" and instant gratification intensifies among consumers of the US health care delivery system, health care providers remain essential to ensuring patients receive safe, evidenced-based care. Erectile dysfunction is a common health condition affecting as many as 42% of US men. As such, it is unsurprising that American health care consumers affected by erectile dysfunction (ED) may be tempted by ""quick fixes"" to ameliorate their symptoms-particularly if such fixes are perceived to be less embarrassing, more accessible, and/or more affordable. Although multiple therapies for the treatment of ED are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, unregulated and/or counterfeit treatments are abundantly available to health care consumers on the Internet and US retail settings. These unregulated treatments may take the form of over-the-counter supplements or tainted prescription medications from illegal Internet pharmacies. This clinical brief is a call to action for health care professionals to advocate for patient safety, educate patients, and champion evidence-based therapies approved for the treatment of erectile dysfunction."
"Organ shortage remains a significant challenge in transplantology, prompting efforts to maximize the use of available organs and expand the donor pool, including through extended criteria donors (ECDs). However, ECD kidney recipients often face poorer outcomes, including a higher incidence of delayed graft function (DGF), which is linked to worse graft performance, reduced long-term survival, and an increased need for interventions like dialysis. This underscores the urgent need for strategies to improve early DGF risk assessment and optimize post-transplant management for high-risk patients. This study conducted multi-time point metabolomic and lipidomic analyses of donor kidney tissue and recipient plasma to identify compounds predicting DGF risk and assess the translational potential of solid-phase microextraction (SPME) for graft evaluation and early complication detection. The SPME-based chemical biopsy enabled a direct kidney analysis, while thin-film microextraction facilitated high-throughput plasma preparation. Following high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with a mass spectrometry analysis, the random forest algorithm was applied to identify compounds with predictive potential for assessing DGF risk before transplantation. Additionally, a comparison of metabolomic and lipidomic profiles of recipient plasma during the early post-operative days identified metabolites that distinguish between DGF and non-DGF patients. The selected compounds primarily included amino acids and their derivatives, nucleotides, organic acids, peptides, and lipids, particularly phospholipids and triacylglycerols. In conclusion, this study highlights the significant translational potential of chemical biopsies and plasma metabolite analyses for risk assessments and the non-invasive monitoring of DGF. The identified metabolites provide a foundation for developing a comprehensive DGF assessment and monitoring method, with potential integration into routine clinical practice."

Subperiosteal abscesses (SAs) are a complication of osteomyelitis that requires surgical intervention. This study aimed to characterize the occurrence of subsequent complications in pediatric patients with osteomyelitis and accompanying SA.
"The original description of cerebral palsy (CP) contained case histories suggesting that perinatal environmental stressors resulted in brain injury and neurodevelopmental disability. While there are clear associations between environmental impact on brain development and CP, recent studies indicate an 11% to 40% incidence of monogenic conditions in patients given a diagnosis of CP. A genetic diagnosis supports the delivery of personalized medicine. In this review, we describe how the Wnt pathway exemplifies our understanding of pathophysiology related to a gene variant (CTNNB1) found in some children diagnosed with CP. We cover studies undertaken to establish the baseline prevalence of monogenic conditions in populations attending CP clinics. We list factors indicating increased likelihood of a genomic diagnosis; and we highlight the need for a comprehensive, accurate, genotype-phenotype reference data set to aid variant interpretation in CP cohorts. We also consider the wider societal implications of genomic management of CP including significance of the diagnostic label, benefits and pitfalls of a genetic diagnosis, logistics, and cost."
"Autophagy is an important catabolic process to maintain cellular homeostasis and antagonize cellular stresses. The initiation and activation are two of the most important aspects of the autophagic process. This review focuses on mechanisms underlying autophagy initiation and activation and signaling pathways regulating the activation of autophagy found in recent years. These findings include autophagy initiation by liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), autophagy initiation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus, and the signaling pathways mediated by the ULK1 complex, the mTOR complex, the AMPK complex, and the PI3KC3 complex. Through the review, we attempt to present current research progress in autophagy regulation and forward our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms and signaling pathways of autophagy initiation and activation."

"Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects memory and cognitive abilities, affecting millions of people around the world. Current treatments focus on the management of symptoms, as no effective therapy has been approved to modify the underlying disease process. Gene therapy is a promising approach that can offer disease-modifying treatment for AD, targeting various aspects of the pathophysiology of the disease. This review presents a comprehensive overview of the current state of gene therapy research for AD, with a specific focus on clinical trials and preclinical studies that have used nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), apolipoprotein E2 (APOE2), and human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) as therapeutic gene therapy approaches. These gene targets have shown potential to alleviate the neuropathology of AD in animal studies and have demonstrated feasibility and safety in non-human primates. Despite the failure of the NGF gene therapy approach in clinical trials, we have reviewed and highlighted the reported findings and evaluations from the trials. Furthermore, the review included the conclusions of postmortem brain tissue analysis of AD patients who received NGF gene therapy. The goal is to learn from the failed trials and improve the approach in the future. Although gene therapy shows promise, it faces several challenges and limitations, including optimizing gene delivery methods, enhancing safety and efficacy profiles, and determining long-term results. This review contributes to the growing body of literature on innovative treatments for AD and highlights the need for more research and development to advance gene therapy as a viable treatment option for AD."
"The module was designed and developed at Heartfulness Institute, Kanha Shanti Vanam, Hyderabad. The Department of Medicine, MGM Medical College & Hospital, MGMIHS, Navi Mumbai, carried out the validation and subsequently pilot-tested on volunteers. Forty experts were selected to validate the contents of IAHFNM & YP which was designed after a thorough review of meditation and yoga literature. A total of 23 items were included, and each item was rated as essential or not essential by the experts, based on which the content validity ratio (CVR), Item-Level Content Validity Index (I-CVI), and Scale-Level Content Validity Index Average (S-CVI/Ave) were calculated. Reliability analysis and a pilot study for the feasibility of IAHFNM & YP for hypertensive patients were also done. All 23 practices exhibited significant CVR (≥ 0.29), I-CVI (> 0.79), and S-CVI/Ave (> 0.9); thus, the tool was found to have valid contents. Cronbach's alpha value for the tool was 0.95 which was highly reliable. Feasibility analysis in hypertensive participants showed that the tool is reliable and implementable. The IAHFNM & YP tool designed for hypertensive patients is valid, reliable, and feasible. The patients showed a willingness to continue with heartfulness meditation and yoga practices for participation in research for a longer duration. Further studies to confirm the tool's efficacy should be conducted with a large sample size."
"Spontaneous rupture of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) occurs in 0.3-0.6% of all RCC cases. A 57-yearold woman presented to the emergency department with a chief complaint of hematuria and lower back pein. Ruptures of a kidney tumor and a kidney capsular hematoma were detected using computed tomography. The patient underwent radical right nephrectomy 22 days post admission, and the pathological diagnosis was chromophobe RCC (ChRCC). To our knowledge, this is the third reported case of ChRCC. The previous two cases did not exhibit postoperative recurrence, and yielded good prognoses. However, in our case, liver metastasis occurred 1 month postoperatively, and the prognosis was poor."
"Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) may critically impair cardiovascular, metabolic, and gastrointestinal function. Previous research has demonstrated compromised drug absorption in this group of patients. This study aimed to examine the impact of SAH on gastrointestinal function and its subsequent effect on the absorption of enterally administered drugs, using esomeprazole as a probe drug."
"Mast cell activation is defined by activation of mast cells by varying stimuli with release of chemical mediators either through degranulation or release of de novo synthesized proteins or lipid mediators. Currently, tryptase measurement increase during symptomatic episodes is the most accepted biomarker measurement for mast cell activation. However, newer diagnostic tools including clinically available urinary mast cell mediators are noninvasive and can be more readily obtained compared to serum tryptase levels. This review will highlight biomarker measurement in the diagnosis of mast cell activation."
"This study aimed to evaluate the occurrence of partial bridging and synostosis in the distal tibiofibular joint after surgically treated ankle fractures and determine possible risk factors. In this retrospective study, patients admitted to our hospital with ankle trauma between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2020, who were operated on for an ankle fracture and had a follow-up period of at least 1 year, were included. Patients underwent anteroposterior, lateral, and mortise radiographs of the ankle and low-dose computed tomography postoperatively. The presence of partial bridging and synostosis in the distal tibiofibular joint was evaluated. The study included 75 patients (50 males, 25 females). There were 40 patients with the right fracture side and 35 patients with the left fracture side. The mean age of the patients included in the study was 43.96 ± 15.07 years. The total follow-up period was 40 ± 13 months. Nineteen patients had partial bridging (13 males, 6 females), and 9 had synostosis (7 males, 2 females). The incidence of partial bridging was 25.3%, and synostosis was 12%. We determined that high-energy trauma is a risk factor for synostosis, but we found that syndesmosis injury is not a risk factor for developing distal tibiofibular synostosis. Additionally, we found that distal tibiofibular synostosis and partial bridging do not affect ankle joint movements."
"This study investigated the risk factors for endometrial hyperplasia (EH) and endometrial carcinoma (EC) in premenopausal women. The goal was to establish a nomogram model to predict the risk of EH/EC and quantitative standards in clinical practice, which improved the clinical prognosis of EH/EC patients. Data were collected from premenopausal women with suspected EH/EC who underwent hysteroscopic endometrial biopsy. Patients (n = 1541) were divided into training and validation groups at a 3:1 ratio. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify risk factors for EH/EC and establish a predictive model. The model's discrimination was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), its calibration was assessed using calibration plots, and its clinical effectiveness was evaluated using decision curve analysis (DCA). The optimal score and probability cutoff values were determined to differentiate between low and high-risk populations, guiding clinical medical practice. BMI, age at menarche, intrauterine device (IUD), diabetes, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), endometrial thickness (ET), and uterine cavity fluid were identified as independent risk factors for EH/EC and were incorporated into the predictive nomogram model. The model demonstrated good discrimination with AUCs of 0.845 and 0.905 in the training and validation sets, respectively. The calibration plots and DCA showed excellent model calibration and clinical effectiveness. EH/EC is significantly associated with BMI, age at menarche, IUD use, diabetes, PCOS, ET, and uterine cavity fluid. The nomogram model can be used to predict the risk of EH/EC in premenopausal women and facilitate rapid screening."
"Dispersal can evolve as an adaptation to escape competition with conspecifics or kin. Locations with a low density of conspecifics, however, may also lead to reduced opportunities for mating, especially in sessile marine invertebrates with proximity-dependent mating success. Since there are few experimental investigations, we performed a series of field experiments using an experimentally tractable species (the bryozoan Bugula neritina) to test the hypothesis that the density, spatial arrangement, and genetic relatedness of neighbours differentially affect survival, growth, reproduction, paternity, and sperm dispersal. We manipulated the density and relatedness of neighbours and found that increased density reduced survival but not growth rate, and that there was no effect of relatedness on survival, growth, or fecundity, in contrast to previous studies. We also manipulated the distances to the nearest neighbour and used genetic markers to assign paternity within known mother-offspring groups to estimate how proximity affects mating success. Distance to the nearest neighbour did not affect the number of settlers produced, the paternity share, or the degree of multiple paternity. Overall, larger than expected sperm dispersal led to high multiple paternity, regardless of the distance to the nearest neighbour. Our results have important implications for understanding selection on dispersal distance: in this system, there are few disadvantages to the limited larval dispersal that does occur and limited advantages for larvae to disperse further than a few 10s of metres."
"The psychological and social challenges of an adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer diagnosis often transcend physical health, impacting one's social network during a time when peer connections may be most crucial for support. The current study examines adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer survivors' perspectives on how cancer impacts their thoughts and behaviors toward forming new peer relationships."
"Early-onset high myopia (eoHM) in children is a kind of high myopia that occurs in preschool children. While affecting the visual development process, eoHM can cause a series of complications such as retinal rupture and detachment, and posterior scleral staphyloma, which not only damage the visual function, but also delay the overall development of children. Therefore, early prevention, early diagnosis, timely treatment, and long-term management are crucial. This article discusses the necessity and key points of the management of blinding complications caused by eoHM in children, in order to attract doctors' attention and provide guidance for clinical work."
The objective of this study is to assess associations between pregnancy complications and pregnancy-associated maternal mortality (PAM) within 1 year after childbirth.
"The participation rate for screening is regarded as a useful indicator for preventing cancer and cardio-metabolic disease. However, the validity of self-reported screening participation has not yet been thoroughly evaluated in Japan. We aimed to examine its validity using the municipal screening records among the Japanese population."
"The objective of this web-based study is to analyze the attributes of bariatric surgery cases ensuing health implications. Additionally, the study seeks to delve into the factors influencing post-bariatric psychological evaluations and the impact of various bariatric surgeries on weight loss and psycho-social assessment scores for patients who had undergone bariatric surgeries within a specific bariatric surgery center in Egypt between January 2017 and January 2024."
Targeted temperature management (TTM) is considered a beneficial treatment for improving outcomes in patients with OHCA due to acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The comparative benefits of hypothermic TTM (32-34°C) versus normothermic TTM (35-36°C) are unclear. This study compares these TTM strategies in improving neurological outcomes and survival rates in OHCA patients with ACS.
"In response to increased focus on the issue of Assisted Dying (AD) in the UK due to the presentation of The Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill 2024-25 [1] and bills before parliaments in the Isle of Man, Guernsey and Scotland, the British Geriatric Society (BGS) recently developed a position statement opposing legalisation of AD in the UK [2]. We set out our key reasoning behind this position, namely the current adverse health and social care context and significant concern about whether effective safeguards can be created to protect older people with complex needs from undue harms. The BGS asks for improved, personalised, multidisciplinary care for older people at the end of their lives, including high-quality palliative and end-of-life care. It urges caution about legalisation and offers its expertise in any potential future shaping and implementation of AD legislation. This should include a conscience clause for professionals objecting to direct involvement. The main outcomes from a survey of member's opinions are also outlined [2]. The majority were against legalisation of AD; however, a significant minority were in favour, with some undecided. This diversity of opinion highlights a need for the Society to maintain balance and nuance on this difficult and emotive issue, warranting future BGS reviews if the relevant legislation changes."
"To investigate the relationship between the novel acromial angle and rotator cuff tears through imaging studies. We retrospectively selected 148 patients who underwent complete imaging examinations including scapular outlet X-rays and shoulder MRIs from January 2023 to September 2024 at our hospital. Based on whether the subjects had rotator cuff tears, they were divided into an injury group and a normal group, and the differences in the novel acromial angle between the two groups were compared. The novel acromial angle in the normal group was (149.1 ± 5.957)°, while in the injury group, it was (142.3 ± 6.558)°, showing a statistically significant difference between the two groups (P < 0.001). The probability of rotator cuff injury was 79.07% for individuals with a novel acromial angle smaller than the average in the injury group. The novel acromial angle in the injury group was generally smaller than that in the normal group. A novel acromial angle smaller than the average was associated with a higher probability of rotator cuff injury, and smaller angles were more likely to lead to more severe rotator cuff tears. Therefore, the novel acromial angle may serve as a simple and objective method to predict the probability of rotator cuff tears."
"Melanoma has emerged as a significant threat to human life and health. Microneedle (MN)-mediated transdermal drug delivery (TDD) has garnered attention in melanoma treatment for bypassing the first-pass effect. However, the propensity of melanoma to metastasize presents substantial challenges for MN mediated local treatment. Developing systemic therapies, such as immunotherapy in combination with TDD, is crucial for achieving effective melanoma treatment. Herein, a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) MN-mediated multifunctional TDD system, designated MN@PDA@1-MT/CUR/DOX@HA (MN@PMCDH), was developed for synergetic chemotherapy/photothermal/immunotherapy of melanoma. PMCDH nanomedicines penetrate deep skin layers through MNs, accumulate at tumor sites guided by hyaluronic acid (HA), and selectively release drugs in response to the acidic tumor microenvironment and near-infrared (NIR) stimulation. Released curcumin (CUR) significantly enhances the efficacy of photothermal therapy (PTT) and chemotherapy, as well as improves the induction of immunogenic cell death (ICD) by increasing melanoma sensitivity to polydopamine (PDA)-mediated photothermal effects and doxorubicin (DOX). Moreover, the incorporation of 1-methyltryptophan (1-MT) to reverse the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment can further enhance the effects of immunotherapy. In vitro studies revealed that the MN@PMCDH system can effectively induce ICD and inhibit tumor cell growth. Additionally, remarkable deep tumor cell inhibition effects are also achieved in 3D tumor models."
"The aim of study was to analyze the extent to which treatment for vaginismus affect self-esteem, defense mechanisms, sexual satisfaction and coping with stress. Was conducted as aquasi-experimental, cross-sectional study. The population of the study consisted of womenwho were followed up with the diagnosis of vaginismus in obstetrics clinic. As data collection tools, ""Personal Information Form"", ""Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory"", ""Sexual Satisfaction Scale"", ""Coping Response Inventory"" and ""Defense Style Questionnaire"" wereused. When people who were diagnosed with vaginismus and accepted treatment were asked about the reasons for demanding treatment, 11.4% of them responded that they experienced pain during sexual intercourse, 4.7% stated that they wanted to able to continue their marriage, and 2.8% of them stated that they wanted to gain self-confidence. When asked for whom they wanted the treatment of the disease, 61 of the participants responded, and 14 of them answered for ""Me and my spouse"" while 29 for ""My spouse"" and 18 for ""Myself"". It was revealed that self-esteem, defense mechanisms, sexual satisfaction and coping with stress are important factors in initiation, maintenance and completion of treatment in patients and that these factors should be especially emphasized during the treatment process."
Fractures around the hip are known to be an indicator for fragility and are associated with high mortality and various complications. A special type of fractures around the hip are periprosthetic femur fractures (PPF) after Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA). The aim of this study was to investigate the mortality rate associated with PPF after THA and to identify risk factors that may increase it.
Impaired executive function is common in older adults. This study examined the causal relationship between the use of information and communication technology (ICT) and executive function in older adults over time.
Pressure on carotid artery by hyoid bone may influence plaque formation. We studied CTA-based hyoid-carotid anatomical interaction and its relationship with carotid stenosis degree and stenosis-related stroke.
"A 64-year-old highly myopic woman with macular hole retinal detachment (MHRD) in her left eye underwent vitrectomy, internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling, and epiretinal implantation of a 4-mm diameter human amniotic membrane (hAM) patch. One month later, she developed a bullous superior RD in her right eye, associated with a huge MH and multiple posterior breaks. Vitrectomy and ILM peeling were combined with a 15-mm epiretinal hAM patch implantation. One year later, both eyes showed successful MH closure, but the right eye developed an eccentric hAM patch contraction starting 6 months postoperatively, causing a localized stable superonasal RD."
"Both belimumab and telitacicept are recognised blockers for B lymphocyte activation, both of which have been approved as add-on therapies for SLE in China. The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of rituximab (RTX) followed by belimumab or telitacicept in a real-world cohort."
"The US healthcare system is complex and includes a number of entities and systems that provide services to patients and to pay for them. While improving health and well-being are accepted goals of healthcare, the 3 stakeholder groups relevant to healthcare-patients, providers, and payers-often have different perspectives on how care should be utilized, performed, and paid for. These differing perspectives are discussed as they relate to clinical laboratory testing."
"Even if in the past years new effective, safe, and orally administrable drugs are available to create shorter regimens, drug-resistant (DR) tuberculosis (TB) treatment remains a critical issue and a major challenge faced by clinicians worldwide. We present the first case of transborder pulmonary pre-extensively drug-resistant (pre-XDR)-TB treated in Italy with the bedaquiline-pretomanid-linezolid regimen. Diagnosis and treatment were started in Ukraine, and, after a month of treatment, due to the Russo-Ukrainian war, the patient moved to Italy, where the diagnosis was confirmed both by genotypic and phenotypic drug susceptibility tests, and treatment continued. In this short report, we highlight challenges and future opportunities to improve the clinical management of patient with DR-TB."
"The increasing contamination of agricultural soils with cadmium (Cd) poses a significant threat to human health and global food security. Plants initiate a series of mechanisms to reduce Cd toxicity. However, the response of maize to Cd toxicity remains poorly understood. In this study, we identified that ZmHMT3, which encodes a homocysteine S-methyltransferases family protein, acted as a regulator of Cd tolerance in maize. Subcellular localization and in situ PCR exhibited that ZmHMT3 was localized in the cytoplasm and predominantly expressed in the phloem. Overexpression of ZmHMT3 enhanced Cd tolerance and reduced Cd concentration in both shoots and roots. In contrast, ZmHMT3 mutants attenuated Cd tolerance but did not change shoot Cd concentration. Heterologous overexpression of ZmHMT3 in rice enhanced Cd tolerance and reduced grain Cd concentration. Transcriptome analysis revealed that ZmHMT3 upregulated the expression of stress-responsive genes, especially glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) and transcription factors, including MYBs, NACs and WRKYs, and modulates the expression of different ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, thereby enhancing Cd tolerance. Collectively, these findings highlight the pivotal role of ZmHMT3 in Cd tolerance and as a candidate gene for improving Cd tolerance in elite maize varieties."
"Ocular hemorrhage has been recorded in congenital factor deficiencies like hemophilia A, but it has never been documented in prothrombin deficiency. Here, we describe an unusual case of sudden vision loss in the right eye caused by subretinal hemorrhage following a coughing episode in a 67-year-old woman. Notably, the patient underwent left eye enucleation 12 years previously under similar circumstances due to subretinal hemorrhage. During the interview, it was discovered that the patient had a history of prothrombin deficiency, which was subsequently confirmed through laboratory testing. Aside from recurrent ocular bleeding and 1 instance of bleeding following dental extraction in childhood, there is no other history of bleeding. Subsequent molecular studies revealed a homozygous missense mutation at G1499A (Arg500Gln), a variant previously identified as R457Q. Although the likelihood of prothrombin deficiency initiating subretinal hemorrhage is low, it is likely to worsen retinal hemorrhage and contribute to difficulty in controlling bleeding. A comprehensive coagulation workup is essential in patients with ocular hemorrhage. Determining factor II activity should be included in individuals exhibiting variably prolonged prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time with correction in mixing studies. Additional investigations, such as genetic sequencing and family studies, are advised for those with isolated low prothrombin levels."
"Brain calcifications, found in various conditions, may be incidental or crucial for diagnosis. They occur in physiological changes, infections, genetic diseases, neurodegenerative conditions, vascular syndromes, metabolic disorders, endocrine disorders, and primary tumors like oligodendroglioma. While often incidental, their presence can be vital for accurate diagnosis. Brain metastases are the most common neoplastic lesions in adults, with their incidence increasing due to improved diagnostic tools and overall oncologic patient survival. Calcifications within brain metastases are uncommon, mostly seen in patients treated with radiation therapy (RT). Although cases of calcified brain metastasis (CBM) are reported, large recent studies are scarce and the real incidence remains unclear. This lack of data raises the risk of underestimating CBM in the differential diagnosis of brain calcifications, potentially leading to misdiagnosis and delayed treatment, particularly when calcifications are observed without prior RT."
"Phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) is the main antagonist of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mTOR signalling pathway and mutated in 10%-20% of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) exhibiting macrocephaly. Hyperactive mTOR signalling is responsible for some aspects during PTEN-ASD progression, e.g. neuronal hypertrophy and -excitability, but PI3K/mTOR-independent processes have additionally been described. There is emerging evidence that PTEN regulates gene transcription, spliceosome formation and pre-mRNA splicing independently of PI3K/mTOR. Altered splicing is a hallmark of brains from individuals with idiopathic and PTEN-ASD, however, molecular mechanisms are yet to be identified. We performed RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq), followed by analysis of altered transcript splicing in Pten-deficient primary cortical mouse neurons, which we compared with published data from PTEN-deficient human neuronal stem cells. This analysis identified that transcripts were globally mis-spliced in a developmentally regulated fashion and cluster in synaptic and gene expression regulatory processes. Strikingly, splicing defects following Pten-deficiency represent a significant number of other known ASD-susceptibility genes. Furthermore, we show that exons with strong 3' splice sites are more frequently mis-spliced under Pten-deficient conditions. Our study indicates that PTEN-ASD is a multifactorial condition involving the dysregulation of other known ASD-susceptibility genes."
"Improved medication adherence, represented as an increase in the proportion of days covered (PDC), to chronic medications is associated with better patient outcomes, yet effective strategies to improve adherence are often resource intensive."
"Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) is a severe congenital heart disease associated with microcephaly and poor neurodevelopmental outcomes. Here we show that the Ohia HLHS mouse model, with mutations in Sap130, a chromatin modifier, and Pcdha9, a cell adhesion protein, also exhibits microcephaly associated with mitotic block and increased apoptosis leading to impaired cortical neurogenesis. Transcriptome profiling, DNA methylation, and Sap130 ChIPseq analyses all demonstrate dysregulation of genes associated with autism and cognitive impairment. This includes perturbation of REST transcriptional regulation of neurogenesis, disruption of CREB signaling regulating synaptic plasticity, and defects in neurovascular coupling mediating cerebral blood flow. Adult mice harboring either the Pcdha9 mutation, which show normal brain anatomy, or forebrain-specific Sap130 deletion via Emx1-Cre, which show microcephaly, both demonstrate learning and memory deficits and autism-like behavior. These findings provide mechanistic insights indicating the adverse neurodevelopment in HLHS may involve cell autonomous/nonautonomous defects and epigenetic dysregulation."
"The nuclear envelope (NE), a protective membrane bordering the nucleus, is composed of highly specialized proteins that are indispensable for normal cellular activity. Lamina-associated polypeptide 1 (LAP1) is a NE protein whose functions are just beginning to be unveiled. The fact that mutations causing LAP1 deficiency are extremely rare and pathogenic is indicative of its paramount importance to preserving human health, anticipating that LAP1 might have a multifaceted role in the cell. Mapping the LAP1 protein interactome is, thus, imperative to achieve an integrated view of its potential biological properties. To this end, we employed in silico- and mass spectrometry-based approaches to identify candidate LAP1-interacting proteins, whose functional attributes were subsequently characterized using bioinformatics tools. Our results reveal the complex and multifunctional network of protein-protein interactions associated to LAP1, evidencing a strong interconnection between LAP1 and cellular processes as diverse as chromatin and cytoskeleton organization, DNA repair, RNA processing and translation, as well as protein biogenesis and turnover, among others. Novel interactions between LAP1 and DNA repair proteins were additionally validated, strengthening the previously proposed involvement of LAP1 in the maintenance of genomic stability. Overall, this study reaffirms the biological relevance of LAP1 and the need to deepen our knowledge about this NE protein, providing new insights about its potential functional partners that will help guiding future research towards a mechanistic understanding of LAP1's functioning."
"Ocular microtremor (OMT) is a fixational eye movement that cannot be seen with the naked eye but is always present, even when the eye appears motionless/still. The link between OMT and brain function provides a strong rationale for investigation as there lies potential for its use as a biomarker in populations with neurological impairments. OMT frequency is typically 70-80Hz in healthy adults and research suggests that this will be reduced in those with neurological disease such as Parkinson's Disease (PD). This study aims to examine OMT in people with PD compared to healthy older adults. This is an exploratory, observational study that will use a novel handheld device-The iTremor ONE, which has been developed to rapidly, non-invasively assess and evaluate OMT frequency. This device uses incident laser technology directed at the sclera. People with PD who meet the inclusion criteria will participate in a home-based assessment involving cognitive, motor (using the UPDRS-III) and OMT measures. With OMT as the primary outcome, assessment with the iTremor is quick, taking just three seconds to obtain a reading. People with PD will be invited into the laboratory to perform extensive cognitive assessments along with an assessment of balance, gait, and turning using wearable sensors. People with PD will be assessed both off, and on, their anti-parkinsonian medication following a 12 hour washout period. We will recruit 30 People with PD, 30 people with suspected PD and 30 age-matched healthy control participants for assessment of OMT. 20 People with PD will complete a test-retest reliability assessment at the same approximate time, exactly one week after their initial visit under the same conditions to explore consistency. This will be the first study of its kind to non-invasively investigate OMT frequency as a marker/monitor for PD with advanced technology that could be used within the clinic, laboratory, or home. Identifying OMT as a PD biomarker could better support clinical assessment, enabling improved provision of care to patients with advanced disease monitoring. Clinical trial registration: This trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT06051877; September 2023)."
"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) exert critical functions in colorectal cancer development. In this work, we wanted to elucidate the functional role and regulatory mechanism of circ_0007351 in colorectal cancer. For quantification of circ_0007351, microRNA (miR)-5195-3p and G Protein-coupled receptor class C group 5 member A (GPRC5A), a qRT-PCR, immunoblotting or immunohistochemistry assay was performed. Effects of circ_0007351/miR-5195-3p/GPRC5A cascade were evaluated by determining cell viability, proliferation, colony formation, motility, and invasion. Relationships among variables were assessed by dual-luciferase reporter assay. Animal studies were performed to evaluate circ_0007351's function in the growth of xenograft tumors. Circ_0007351 was markedly up-regulated in colorectal cancer tissues and cells. Down-regulation of circ_0007351 hindered cell growth, migration and invasiveness. Also, circ_0007351 depletion exerted a suppressive function in colorectal cell xenograft growth in vivo. Mechanistically, circ_0007351 sponged miR-5195-3p to sequester miR-5195-3p. Reduction of available miR-5195-3p neutralized the effects of circ_0007351 down-regulation on cell phenotypes. MiR-5195-3p directly targeted and inhibited GPRC5A. Circ_0007351 regulated GPRC5A expression by sponging miR-5195-3p. Moreover, the effects of circ_0007351 down-regulation on cell functional phenotypes were due to in part the reduction of GPRC5A expression. Our findings show that circ_0007351 down-regulation impedes proliferation, motility, and invasiveness in colorectal cancer cells at least in part via the regulation of the miR-5195-3p/GPRC5A cascade, highlighting that circ_0007351 inhibition may have a potential therapeutic value for colorectal cancer."
"SURFINs protein family expressed on surface of both infected red blood cell and merozoite surface making them as interesting vaccine candidate for erythrocytic stage of malaria infection. In this study, we analyze genetic variation of Pfsurf4.1 gene, copy number variation, and frequency of SURFIN4.1 variants of P. falciparum in clinical isolates. In addition, secondary structure prediction and immunoinformatic were employed to identify immunogenic epitopes in humoral response as proposed vaccine candidates. Overall, our data demonstrate extensive polymorphism of SURFIN4.1 in both genetic and protein level. The surf4.1 gene showed extensive genetic variation with total of 447 polymorphic sites with maximum of three variants as well as singlet/triplet bases indels and mini/microsatellites in the coding sequence. The exon1 encoding extracellular region exhibited higher variation compared to exon2 which coding for intracellular domain. Interestingly, selective pressure was detected on both extracellular region (Var1 and Var2) as well as intracellular region (WRD2 and WRD3). Importantly, extensive full gene analysis suggests adenosine insertion at three key points nucleotide bases (nt 2409/2410, 3809/3810, and 4439/4440) of exon2 could lead to frameshift mutation resulted in four different SURFIN4.1 variants (TMs, WD1, WD2 and WD3). The SURFIN4.1 variant TMs was the most observed type with 67% frequency (51/76). Along with more than one copy number of surf4.1 gene was observed with frequency of 13% (9/70). Despite substantial polymorphism, analysis of relatedness within P. falciparum population using full coding sequence was able to group SURFIN4.1 protein into five distinct clades and reduced into four clades when using only exon1 coding sequence. Also, predicted secondary structure revealed conserved structure of five helix domains of extracellular region which similar among four SURFIN4.1 variant types. In addition, in silico design eight immunopeptides derived from SURFIN4.1, four of which are highly conserved and four of dimorphic epitopes, as potential vaccine candidates."
"Vaccines are one of the most important discoveries of humanity, being an effective intervention to protect the population against infectious diseases. When the Covid-19 vaccination campaign, the feat of Doctor Francisco Javier de Balmis y Berenguer in the Royal Philanthropic Vaccine Expedition is remembered due to the importance that vaccination has had over the years and mentioning that The National Vaccination Campaign against COVID-19 in Mexico began at the Dr. Eduardo Liceaga General Hospital of Mexico."
"Recent research indicates that individuals with Internet gaming disorder (IGD) exhibit impaired social reward processing, evidenced by reduced neural sensitivity to real-life social reward. The aim of the present study is to further investigate the impaired processing of social reward anticipation and reward consumption in individuals with IGD, and explore the relationship between these two components. Using a social incentive delay task with game-related and real-life versions, combined with event-related potential (ERP) technology, we examined 25 individuals with IGD and 25 matched healthy game players. The results showed that, at the behavioral level, individuals with IGD showed significantly slower reaction times to real-life target stimuli compared with game-related target stimuli, which is not observed in healthy controls. At the neural level, the Cue-P3 elicited by real-life incentive cues in individuals with IGD was significantly smaller than that elicited by game-related incentive cues. However, these effects were no longer significant after adding depression and anxiety scores as covariates. There was no significant difference in reward positivity (RewP) elicited between the two types of reward consumption. Furthermore, individuals with IGD showed a positive correlation between Cue-P3 elicited by game-related social incentive cue and RewP elicited by game-related social reward. However, this effect was not observed in the healthy controls. In conclusion, the present study suggests that the blunted allocation of motivated neural attention resources to real-life social incentive cues in individuals with IGD may be the key mechanism underlying their impaired social reward processing. This impairment may be influenced by the higher levels of depression and anxiety symptoms commonly observed in individuals with IGD."
"The transsulfuration (TSS) pathway is an alternative source of cysteine for glutathione synthesis. Little of the TSS pathway in antioxidant capacity in sickle cell disease (SCD) is known. Here, we evaluate the effects of TSS pathway activation through cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) to attenuate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and ferroptosis stresses in SCD. A vital contribution of the TSS pathway in sustaining cysteine levels is detected only under hemin exposure or physiological but not supraphysiological cystine supplement. Mechanistic studies show that hemin suppresses CBS expression to inhibit the TSS pathway and de novo cysteine biosynthesis. By contrast, the expression of CBS is inducible by dimethyl fumarate (DMF) through nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) activation and CpG islands DNA hydroxymethylation. DMF induces the expression of L-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase (L2HGDH) to downregulate L-2-hydroxyglutarate (L2HG) and increase global and locus-specific DNA hydroxymethylation levels. This DMF-upregulated DNA hydroxymethylation affects CBS locus chromatin structure modifications and upregulates gene expression. Our results suggest that CBS of the TSS pathway plays an important role in maintaining cysteine levels under restricted cystine availability or excess hemin exposure, and CBS upregulation by DMF increases the cellular glutathione levels to protect against ROS and ferroptosis stress in SCD."
"Soil is the largest carbon (C) reservoir in terrestrial ecosystems and plays a crucial role in regulating the global C cycle and climate change. Increasing nitrogen (N) deposition has been widely considered as a critical factor affecting soil organic carbon (SOC) storage, but its effect on SOC components with different stability remains unclear. Here, we analyzed extensive empirical data from 304 sites worldwide to investigate how SOC and its components respond to N addition. Our analysis showed that N addition led to a significant increase in bulk SOC (6.7%), with greater increases in croplands (10.6%) and forests (6.0%) compared to grasslands (2.1%). Regarding SOC components, N addition promoted the accumulation of plant-derived C (9.7%-28.5%) over microbial-derived C (0.2%), as well as labile (5.7%) over recalcitrant components (-1.2%), resulting in a shift towards increased accumulation of plant-derived labile C. Consistently, N addition led to a greater increase in particulate organic C (11.9%) than mineral-associated organic C (3.6%), suggesting that N addition promotes C accumulation across all pools, with more increase in unstable than stable pools. The responses of SOC and its components were best predicted by the N addition rate and net primary productivity. Overall, our findings suggest that N enrichment could promote the accumulation of plant-derived and non-mineral associated C and a subsequent decrease in the overall stability of soil C pool, which underscores the importance of considering the effects of N enrichment on SOC components for a better understanding of C dynamics in soils."
This study aimed to evaluate the predictive performance of published amisulpride population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) models in schizophrenia patients with an external data set and establish remedial dosing regimens for nonadherent amisulpride-treated patients.
"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can lead to persistent symptoms, sequelae, and other medical complications that may last for weeks or months after recovery. The aim of the study is to assess the prevalence and risk factors of long COVID-19 persisting for 2 years in Hainan Province, China, to aid in its recognition, prevention, and treatment. Between July and August 2022, 960 individuals with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in Hainan, China, were recruited. An epidemiological questionnaire was conducted via phone interviews to assess participants' recovery status after 2 years. Among the participants, 120 patients (12.5%) experienced at least one long COVID-19 complication. The most common symptoms were cough (33.3%, 40/120), followed by fatigue (25.9%, 31/120), hair loss (23.3%, 28/120), and dizziness (20.8%, 25/120). Independent risk factors included age over 65, moderate to severe infection, chronic diseases, irregular diet, late sleeping, anxiety, and fewer than 2 vaccinations (p < 0.05). While most individuals infected with COVID-19 fully recover, approximately 12.5% experience intermediate or long-term effects. This study is the first to identify the incidence and associated risk factors of long COVID-19 with the longest follow-up time, providing valuable insights for the timely restoration of pre-COVID-19 health."
"Despite the widespread application of electrochemical systems in bioproduction, their detailed effects on photosynthetic organisms remain to be explored. In this study, a three-chamber electrochemical ion membrane system (EIMs) was optimized for minimizing carbon resource interference in the cathode chamber, thereby elucidating the role of EIMs in the light reactions of photosynthesis. By applying intermittent electrical stimulation, the photosynthetic activity of microalgae was enhanced, manifesting as the promoted accumulation of intracellular ATP and NADPH, while allowing the collection of hydrogen and oxygen as by-products. These findings suggest that EIMs not only facilitate photosynthesis by enhancing both light and dark reactions but also provide new avenues for improving the efficiency of photosynthetic production and advancing sustainable biotechnological processes."
"The role of biomarkers in risk-based early detection of lung cancer may enable screening to become cost effective and widely accessible. EarlyCDT-Lung is an example of such a blood-based autoantibody biomarker which may improve accessibility to Low dose Computed Tomography (LDCT) screening for those at highest risk. We randomized 12 208 individuals aged 50-75 at high risk of developing lung cancer to either the test or to standard clinical care. Outcomes were ascertained from Register of Deaths and Cancer Registry. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the hazard ratio of the rate of deaths from all causes and lung cancer. Additional analyses were performed for cases of lung cancer diagnosed within two years of the initial test. After 5 years 326 lung cancers were detected (2.7% of those enrolled). The total number of deaths reported from all causes in the intervention group was 344 compared to 388 in the control group. There were 73 lung cancer deaths in the intervention arm and 90 in the controls (Adjusted HR 0.789 (0.636, 0.978). An analysis of cases of lung cancer detected within 2 years of randomization in the intervention group showed that there were 34 deaths from all causes and 29 from lung cancer. In the control group there were 56 deaths with 49 from lung cancer. In those diagnosed with lung cancer within 2 years of randomization the hazard ratio for all cause mortality was 0.615 (0.401,0.942) and for lung cancer 0.598 (0.378, 0.946). Further large-scale studies of the role of biomarkers to target lung cancer screening, in addition to LDCT, are likely to provide additional value."
"This study examines the relationships among Foreign Language Learning Enjoyment (FLLE), L2 grit, academic burnout, and motivated behavior in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners, using a mixed-methods approach. A total of 534 Chinese undergraduate EFL learners participated in the quantitative phase, which used a cross-sectional survey, followed by narrative inquiry with 15 participants in the qualitative phase. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) analysis revealed that FLLE positively influenced motivated behavior while reducing academic burnout. L2 grit mediated the relationships between FLLE, burnout, and motivation, indicating that enjoyment promotes perseverance and resilience. Burnout was found to negatively impact motivation, underscoring the role of emotional well-being in maintaining engagement. The qualitative findings further supported these results, offering insights into learners' experiences of joy, perseverance, and recovery from burnout. Participants described how moments of enjoyment reignited their long-term motivation, while grit helped them persevere through challenges. Burnout was linked to emotional exhaustion, but positive experiences often helped restore motivation. These findings offer a deeper understanding of the emotional and psychological factors influencing language learning success. The study provides important implications for educators, highlighting the need to create positive learning environments, promote resilience, and address burnout to support students' sustained commitment to language learning."
"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a significant pathogen affecting swine, causing severe economic losses worldwide. This study explores the regulatory role of miRNA-328-3p to ZO-1 expression and its impact on PEDV proliferation via the PLC-β1-PKC pathway in IPEC-J2 cells. We found that miRNA-328-3p can target ZO-1, influencing its expression and subsequently affecting the integrity of tight junctions in the cells. Overexpression of PLC-β1, combined with miRNA-328-3p silencing, enhanced ZO-1 expression, while PLC-β1 knockdown combined with miRNA-328-3p overexpression inhibited ZO-1 expression. Furthermore, PLC-β1 overexpression increased both viral genome expression and PEDV titers, whereas its silencing had the opposite effect. Notably, our data indicated a negative correlation between PLC-β1 and PKC expression, and PKC silencing attenuated the upregulatory effect of PLC-β1 on ZO-1. These findings suggest that PLC-β1 modulates ZO-1 expression through the PKC pathway, providing new insights into the molecular mechanisms of PEDV infection and potential therapeutic targets."
"Cancer immunotherapy, leveraging antibodies, excels in targeting efficacy but faces hurdles in tissue penetration, oral delivery, and prolonged half-life, with costly production and risk of adverse immunogenic effects. In contrast, small molecule immuno-oncology agents provide favorable pharmacokinetic properties and benign toxicity profiles. These agents are well-positioned to address the limitations of antibody-based immunotherapies, augment existing treatment modalities, and achieve synergistic effects when combined with antibodies. This review, for the first time, summarizes the recent advances (2020-2024) in small molecule inhibitors targeting PD-1/PD-L1, CTLA4, VISTA, TIM-3, and LAG3, highlighting rational design, benefits, and potential limitations. It also outlines the prospects for small-molecule immunotherapy."
"This study evaluated the application of thyme essential oil (TEO) encapsulated in chia mucilage in meat sausages as a partial or total substitute for sodium nitrate and nitrite. We assessed three capsules produced with different concentrations of TEO (3.5 %, 7.5 %, and 10 %) in terms of encapsulation efficiency, antioxidant activity, thermal properties, morphology, and antimicrobial activity. Compared to the other concentrations, the 10 % TEO capsules demonstrated higher encapsulation efficiency (98.25 %), antioxidant activity (25.53 %), minimum inhibitory concentrations (0.028 for Escherichia coli and 0.34 for Staphylococcus aureus), thermal stability, and efficacy in inhibiting S. aureus. The oil concentration did not influence capsule yield. We evaluated the physicochemical and microbiological characteristics of different fresh pork sausage formulations: preservatives only (FC), half the concentration of preservatives with the addition of TEO (F1), TEO only (F2), and no preservatives or TEO (F3). The F2 formulation exhibited reduced acidity, peroxide index, and p-anisidine content compared to formulations F1 and F3. Formulations F1 and F2 showed an increased a* parameter (redness) during storage. The F2 formulation exerted microbiological control over coagulase-positive Staphylococcus, E. coli, mesophilic aerobic bacteria, and Salmonella. We concluded that chia mucilage-encapsulated thyme essential oil represents a promising substitute for nitrates and nitrites in meat products."
"Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is the most frequently performed bariatric procedure. To study the safety of LSG done with Nissen Fundoplication (NF) in patients affected by obesity and GERD and assess the complication rate. A retrospective cohort study using the Nationwide Readmissions Database from 2016 to 2019. A total of 236111 patients underwent LSG with and without NF. A matched cohort of 1096 without NF and 548 with NF was obtained. The median age of patients was 47 years old. Median length of hospital stay was higher in the LSG with NF group. Median total charge was higher in the LSG with NF group. There was no statistically significant difference in 30-day readmission rates in patients with obesity and GERD who received LSG with NF compared to those who received LSG alone. Complications after both procedures were low, which highlights the safety of both procedures."
"Agitation is a common complication of Alzheimer's dementia (Agit-AD) associated with substantial morbidity, high healthcare service utilization, and adverse emotional and physical impact on care partners. There are currently no FDA-approved pharmacological treatments for Agit-AD. We present the study design and baseline data for an ongoing multisite, three-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial of dronabinol (synthetic tetrahydrocannabinol [THC]), titrated to a dose of 10 mg daily, in 80 participants to examine the safety and efficacy of dronabinol as an adjunctive treatment for Agit-AD. Preliminary findings for 44 participants enrolled thus far show a predominately female, white sample with advanced cognitive impairment (Mini Mental Status Examination mean 7.8) and agitation (Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Clinician Agitation subscale mean 14.1). Adjustments to study design in light of the COVID-19 pandemic are described. Findings from this study will provide guidance for the clinical utility of dronabinol for Agit-AD. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02792257."

"The objective of this evaluation was to determine the impact of a pop-up Teaching Kitchen (TK) at a national cardiovascular conference. The 60-minute session was hosted in a hotel conference room and led by two registered dietitians. Participants prepared 12 recipes, enjoyed a family-style meal, and explored nutrition behaviour change strategies for patients. Using Likert-scaled and open-ended questions, pre-/post-online surveys assessed change in perceived nutrition counselling skills, attitudes, and confidence; post-survey also assessed effectiveness of session components and further training needs. Pre-survey response was 72% (18/25). Twenty-one participants attended the event (14 pre-registrants, six from waitlist, and five drop-ins); 81% completed the post-survey. Positive shifts were reported in nutrition competence, particularly attitudes towards using recipes in nutrition counselling, and increased skills and confidence discussing eating on a budget and SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound) goal setting with patients. Components of the TK session that enhanced nutrition competence were key patient messages and the shared meal. Preparing and eating together in a hands-on format was most enjoyable. Promoting healthy eating behaviours requires understanding the complexity of individual and societal food literacy. With high physician interest, dietitians are well positioned to deliver culinary medicine interventions and support physicians' confidence in health promotion and chronic disease prevention and management."
"The current study had aimed to assess the long-term dietary supplementation with Melaleucae aetheroleum, tea tree essential oil (TTO). The impact on growth performance, biochemical indices, immune function, oxidant/antioxidant activity, gene expression, histopathology, and resistance against Aeromonas sobria in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) was investigated. Four groups (with five replicates; G1 (control group, G2, G3, and G4) of Nile tilapia received diets enriched with TTO (doses of 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mL/kg diet) for 60 days, then fish were challenged by A. sobria. Outcomes indicated an extensive elevation in growth metrics (final body weight, weight gain, SGR, feed intake and fish body protein). Similarly, the total blood protein, albumin, total globulin levels, Serum complement-3 levels, lysozyme activity, immunoglobulin M (IgM), nitric oxide, and phagocytic activity were significantly enhanced in all treatments, notably in the 2.0 mL TTO/kg fed groups compared to the control. Lower levels of urea, creatinine, AST, ALP, ALT, cortisol, glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol and body crude lipids were observed in the fish that were fed a 2.0 mL TTO/kg diet. Supplementing TTO at 2.0-mL /kg diet revealed the best results for elevating CAT, SOD, and GSH activities plus declining MDA value in hepatic homogenate. Additionally, dietary 2.0-mL TTO/kg showed the best outcomes for the intestinal morphometry plus maintaining the histological picture in spleen and liver. Concurrently, fish that were fed a 2.0 mL TTO/kg diet exhibited a substantial upregulation of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-10, TFG-β, IFN-γ and BCL-2 genes in the liver, while, caspase-3, and BAX were downregulated. Furthermore, TTO-enriched diets enhanced the relative percentage survival post-A. sobria challenge plus enhanced the clinical picture in a dose-dependent manner. Taken together, the findings revealed that long-term exposure to dietary TTO fortified the physiological performance, oxidant/anti-oxidant stability, immune function, gene expression, histological picture, and resistance of Nile tilapia against A. sobria."
"Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is frequently difficult to diagnose due to the absence of specific symptoms, yet early detection and surgical intervention are essential for preventing sequela such as irreversible dementia. This study explores the specific magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features of the brainstem and mesencephalic aqueduct in patients with iNPH. Head MRI data of 50 iNPH patients and 30 healthy matched controls were compared for mesencephalic aqueduct length, diameter, and angle, structural features of the brainstem at the sagittal plane, brainstem component volume ratios, angle between the brainstem and spinal cord, and the area and morphology of the pontine cisterns. Compared to healthy individuals, iNPH patients exhibited significant dilation of the mesencephalic aqueduct diameter, a reduced aqueduct angle, and a decrease in the sagittal plane area of the brainstem, with the most pronounced reduction in the midbrain region. Notably, the CSF spaces surrounding the brainstem were dilated, resulting in the prepontine cistern presenting a ""hammer-like"" shape on the sagittal plane. The prevalence of this hammer shape was positively correlated with prepontine cistern area in patients with iNPH. These unique imaging characteristics may facilitate the clinical recognition of iNPH for early diagnosis and treatment."
"Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a treatable pediatric condition, but children with racial-ethnic minority backgrounds often do not receive timely or consistent treatment. Understanding how systemic racism impacts care and learning from families of color about their experiences can provide critical insights for improving clinical practice and engaging patients equitably in ADHD care. We interweave a mother's experience navigating ADHD care for her son with commentary from an interprofessional team about what clinicians can do for families to reduce the impact of systemic racism on care."

"Self-reliance, emotional control, and honor ideology may prevent help-seeking when suicidal ideation emerges. Furthermore, these factors are associated with an increased likelihood of firearm ownership and unsecure storage, which could facilitate suicide attempts. The rurality of residence may impact these associations, as rural regions report increased independence, honor culture, and firearm prevalence. Therefore, this study examined how emotional control, self-reliance, and honor ideology relate to firearm storage and help-seeking for suicidal ideation, with rurality moderating these associations."
"Pulmonary hamartomas are common. However, extrapulmonary hamartomas on the Visceral Pleura are very rare. We treated a patient with a pulmonary nodule at the left lower lobe by uniportal video-assisted thoracoscopic wedge resection, which showed a yellow nodule located on the visceral pleura. Pathology showed that the nodule contained a small amount of cartilage tissue and was diagnosed as hamartoma. Fat-coated extrapulmonary hamartomas located on the visceral pleura have not been previously documented in the literature. This article presents a case of such an extrapulmonary hamartoma."
"The rice leaf folder, Cnaphalocrocis medinalis (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), is a major migratory pest in rice agriculture. This pest is characterised by its larvae's ability to fold rice leaves using silk, a behaviour that culminates in the formation of a silken cocoon during the pupal stage. The fibroin light chain (CmFib-L) gene is crucial for silk production, yet its specific function in C. medinalis has reminded elusive. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the CmFib-L gene, revealing its complete open reading frame (ORF) and expression patterns. Notably, the gene is highly expressed in the fifth-instar larvae and the silk gland, which are critical stages for silk production. Our experiments demonstrate that silencing the CmFib-L gene leads to a reduction in pupal weight, an extension of the pupal stage and a disorganised silk cocoon. Furthermore, the larval behaviour of leaf folding and spinning is significantly impaired when the expression of CmFib-L is downregulated. These findings not only show the importance of fibroin light chain in silk production but also reveal a new target gene to regulate and control the behaviour and development of C. medinalis."
Peanut allergy (PA) is one of the most prevalent food allergies with a lack of favorable safety/efficacy treatment. A cucumber mosaic virus-like particle expressing peanut allergen component Ara h 2 (VLP Peanut) has been developed as a novel therapeutic approach for PA.
"The diagnosis and early identification of intratracheal tumors relies on the experience of the operators and the specialists. Operations by physicians with insufficient experience may lead to misdiagnosis or misjudgment of tumors. To address this issue, a datasets for intratracheal tumor detection has been constructed to simulate the diagnostic level of experienced specialists, and a Knowledge Distillation-based Memory Feature Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (KD-MFAD) model was proposed to learn from this simulated experience. The unsupervised training approach could effectively deal with the irregular features of the tumorous appearance. The Downward Deformable Convolution Module (DDC) allowed the encoding phase to provide more detailed internal airway environment features. The Memory Matrix based on Convolutional Block focusing (CB-Mem) helped the student model store more meaningful normal sample features during training and disrupted the reconstruction of ""tumor"" images. Our model achieved an AUC-ROC of 97.60%, Acc of 93.33%, and F1-score of 94.94% on our self-built intratracheal endoscopy datasets, improving baseline performance by 5 to 10%. Our model also demonstrated superior performance over existing models in the public datasets in the same field."
"For men with prostate cancer, there is substantial variation in the use of conservative management, such as active surveillance. Commercial prices, which vary across urology practices, may afford incentives that foster physician behaviors associated with utilization. Such behaviors may ""spillover"" to the Medicare population and affect quality. This study evaluated the effects of practice-level commercial prices on health care utilization and quality in men with prostate cancer insured by traditional Medicare."

"Lysozyme is a model system for crystallographers. In this issue of Structure, Ramos et al. report atomic resolution neutron structures of lysozyme, which unambiguously show the protonation states and hydrogen-bonding networks of the active site. This resolves mechanistic questions that have been debated for decades and provides a unique view to a protein at atomic detail."
"The incidence rate of cervical cancer (CC) is three times greater in Southeast Asia (SEA), where screening tests are less common than in Northern America, underlining a need for convenient self-diagnostic methods. The expression pattern of microRNAs (miRNAs) has been considered a molecular tool for non-invasive cancer diagnosis and prognosis. This study aimed at the development of the first miRNA biomarker panel for early detection of CC in Thai women. Genome-wide miRNA expression profiling was performed on cervical tissue and discharge samples from high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) and adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) subjects. Machine learning was used for handling imbalanced data and feature selection before differential expression analysis to identify significantly dysregulated miRNA panels. Pathway analysis was conducted to provide the cellular functions involved in CC progression. The study identified a shared 18-miRNA panel for both tissue and discharge, with which the prediction model distinguished HSIL and AIS from normal samples with an accuracy of 90.9%. Three dysregulated miRNAs comprised of miR-125b-1-3p, miR-487b-3p, and miR-1180-3p in CC were first described. Most of the miRNAs in the panel were down-regulated, whereas merely miR-142-3p was significantly up-regulated in HSIL and AIS, suggesting a convenient biomarker for detecting precancerous conditions. Moreover, our miRNA panel highlighted important roles played by the cell-cell interaction pathways in CC. Together, our miRNA panel hold promise as a biomarker for the early detection of cervical cancer with cervical discharge, offering the possibility for developing non-invasive diagnostic tools."
"In this Review, we examine the concurrent outbreaks of mpox in Africa, focusing on clade 1a, the newly emerged clade 1b, and clade 2b lineage A, and how they differ from the 2022 global outbreak caused by clade 2b lineage B.1. Historically, clades 1a and 2a have caused sporadic, small outbreaks in central and west Africa, respectively, primarily through zoonotic transmission. Clade 2b first caused an outbreak in Nigeria in 2017, and later spread globally via sexual contact in 2022. In August, 2024, WHO declared a global health emergency due to the newly identified clade 1b outbreak in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. This outbreak has now expanded to several other countries and is spreading through direct and sexual contact in urban centres and refugee camps. Clades, route of exposure, infectious dose, and host immune response are the main factors influencing clinical presentation of mpox. For clades 1a and 2a, zoonotic transmission plays an important role, whereas for clades 1b and 2b, the spread occurs through sustained human-to-human transmission without zoonotic exposure. For both clades 1a and 2a, lesions have a generalised centrifugal distribution, whereas for clade 2b they are mainly localised to the anogenital area. For clade 1b, data are still emerging, but current cases show a mix of localised lesions and centrifugal distribution. The severity of the disease is higher for clade 1a (case fatality rate up to 12%) compared with other clades (case fatality rates 0-3·6%). Diagnostic challenges include false negative results for clade 1b with existing PCR assays and poor testing access in remote areas. Tecovirimat, the primary antiviral during the 2022 outbreak, has shown reduced effectiveness against clade 1a in preliminary study results, whereas its efficacy against other clades is still under investigation. The modified vaccinia Ankara-Bavarian Nordic vaccine has been shown to be up to 90% effective against clade 2b after two doses and is safe for children, although its effectiveness drops to 20% when used as post-exposure prophylaxis. Given the evolving nature of the monkeypox virus, ongoing research and strong public health responses are key to managing potential future outbreaks."
"Urea is hypothesized to be an important source of nitrogen and chemical energy to microorganisms in the deep sea; however, direct evidence for urea use below the epipelagic ocean is lacking. Here, we explore urea utilization from 50 to 4000 meters depth in the northeastern Pacific Ocean using metagenomics, nitrification rates, and single-cell stable-isotope-uptake measurements with nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry. We find that on average 25% of deep-sea cells assimilated urea-derived N (60% of detectably active cells), and that cell-specific nitrogen-incorporation rates from urea were higher than that from ammonium. Both urea concentrations and assimilation rates relative to ammonium generally increased below the euphotic zone. We detected ammonia- and urea-based nitrification at all depths at one of two sites analyzed, demonstrating their potential to support chemoautotrophy in the mesopelagic and bathypelagic regions. Using newly generated metagenomes we find that the ureC gene, encoding the catalytic subunit of urease, is found within 39% of deep-sea cells in this region, including the Nitrososphaeria (syn., Thaumarchaeota; likely for nitrification) as well as members of thirteen other phyla such as Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Plantomycetota, Nitrospinota, and Chloroflexota (likely for assimilation). Analysis of public metagenomes estimated ureC within 10-46% of deep-sea cells around the world, with higher prevalence below the photic zone, suggesting urea is widely available to the deep-sea microbiome globally. Our results demonstrate that urea is a nitrogen source to abundant and diverse microorganisms in the dark ocean, as well as a significant contributor to deep-sea nitrification and therefore fuel for chemoautotrophy."
The management of refractory pituitary adenomas (RPAs) presents significant challenges. This study aimed to evaluate the long-term treatment outcomes of patients with RPA managed with temozolomide (TMZ) and to identify potential biomarkers for predicting TMZ treatment response.
"Preeclampsia (PE) is an unusual multisystem condition that occurs during pregnancy and is characterized by maternal endothelial dysfunction and damage to various organs. The catabolism of L-tryptophan (Trp) is involved in various biological activities, including healthy pregnancy. Our previous work revealed that PE significantly elevated the concentration of indole-3-lactic acid (ILA), a Trp derivative, during the third trimester of pregnancy. However, the effects of ILA on the occurrence of PE and its influence on fetoplacental vascular functionality remain unknown."
"As the central organ of metabolism, the liver plays a pivotal role in the regulation of the synthesis and metabolism of various nutrients within the body. Ferroptosis, as a newly discovered type of programmed cell death caused by the accumulation of iron-dependent lipid peroxides, is involved in the physiological and pathological processes of a variety of acute and chronic liver diseases. Ferroptosis can accelerate the pathogenetic process of acute liver injury, metabolic associated fatty liver disease, alcoholic liver disease, viral hepatitis, and autoimmune hepatitis; while it can slower disease progression in advanced liver fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. This suggests that targeted regulation of ferroptosis may impact the occurrence and development of various liver diseases. This article reviews the latest research progress of ferroptosis in various liver diseases, including acute liver injury, metabolic associated fatty liver disease, alcoholic liver disease, viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, liver fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. It aims to provide insights for the prevention and treatment of acute and chronic liver diseases through targeting ferroptosis."
"Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) offers high-resolution images of the eye's fundus. This enables thorough analysis of retinal health by doctors, providing a solid basis for diagnosis and treatment. With the development of deep learning, deep learning-based methods are becoming more popular for fundus OCT image segmentation. Yet, these methods still encounter two primary challenges. Firstly, deep learning methods are sensitive to weak edges. Secondly, the high cost of annotating medical image data results in a lack of labeled data, leading to overfitting during model training. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the Multi-Task Attention Mechanism Network with Pruning (MTAMNP), consisting of a segmentation branch and a boundary regression branch. The boundary regression branch utilizes an adaptive weighted loss function derived from the Truncated Signed Distance Function(TSDF), improving the model's capacity to preserve weak edge details. The Spatial Attention Based Dual-Branch Information Fusion Block links these branches, enabling mutual benefit. Furthermore, we present a structured pruning method grounded in channel attention to decrease parameter count, mitigate overfitting, and uphold segmentation accuracy. Our method surpasses other cutting-edge segmentation networks on two widely accessible datasets, achieving Dice scores of 84.09% and 93.84% on the HCMS and Duke datasets."
"Oxidative stress plays a crucial role in organ aging and related diseases, yet the endogenous regulators involved remain largely unknown. This work highlights the importance of metabolic homeostasis in protecting against oxidative stress in the large intestine. By developing a low-input and user-friendly pipeline for the simultaneous profiling of five distinct cysteine (Cys) states, including free SH, total Cys oxidation (Sto), sulfenic acid (SOH), S-nitrosylation (SNO), and S-glutathionylation (SSG), we shed light on Cys redox modification stoichiometries and signaling with regional resolution in the aging gut of monkeys. Notably, the proteins modified by SOH and SSG were associated primarily with cell adhesion. In contrast, SNO-modified proteins were involved in immunity. Interestingly, we observed that the Sto levels ranged from 0.97% to 99.88%, exhibiting two distinct peaks and increasing with age. Crosstalk analysis revealed numerous age-related metabolites potentially involved in modulating oxidative stress and Cys modifications. Notably, we elucidated the role of fumarate in alleviating intestinal oxidative stress in a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis mouse model. Our findings showed that fumarate treatment promotes the recovery of several cell types, signaling pathways, and genes involved in oxidative stress regulation. Calorie restriction (CR) is a known strategy for alleviating oxidative stress. Two-month CR intervention led to the recovery of many antioxidative metabolites and reshaped the Cys redoxome. This work decodes the complexities of redoxomics during the gut aging of non-human primates and identifies key metabolic regulators of oxidative stress and redox signaling."
"The risk of lymph node metastasis after endoscopic resection of high-risk T1 colorectal cancer prompts additional resection.

"In this work, we implement a data-driven approach using an aggregation of several analytical methods to study the characteristics of COVID-19 daily infection and death time series and identify correlations and characteristic trends that can be corroborated to the time evolution of this disease. The datasets cover twelve distinct countries across six continents, from January 22, 2020 till March 1, 2022. This time span is partitioned into three windows: (1) pre-vaccine, (2) post-vaccine and pre-omicron (BA.1 variant), and (3) post-vaccine including post-omicron variant. This study enables deriving insights into intriguing questions related to the science of system dynamics pertaining to COVID-19 evolution."

"Integrating nanotechnologies in diagnostic imaging presents a promising step forward compared to traditional methods, which carry certain limitations. Conventional imaging routes, such as X-ray/computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, derive significant advantages from nanoparticles (NPs), which allow researchers and clinicians to overcome some of the limitations of traditional imaging agents. In this literature review, we explore recent advancements in nanomaterials being applied in conventional diagnostic imaging techniques by exploring relevant reviews and original research papers (e.g. experimental models and theoretical model studies) in the literature. Collectively, there are numerous nanomaterials currently being examined for use in conventional imaging modalities, and each imaging technique has unique NPs with properties that can be manipulated to answer an array of clinical questions specific to that imaging modality. There are still challenges to consider, including getting regulatory approval for clinical research and routine use about long-term biocompatibility, which collectively emphasize the need for continued research to facilitate the integration of nanotechnology into routine clinical practice. Most importantly, there is a continued need for strong, collaborative efforts between researchers, biomedical engineers, clinicians, and industry stakeholders, which are necessary to bridge the persistent gap between translational ideas and implementation in clinical settings."
"To establish a method for preserving viral nucleic acids in plasma using a blood collection card based on the dry spot method, to predict the duration of nucleic acid preservation by establishing the Arrhenius equation, and to demonstrate the feasibility of this preservation method for the re-testing of nucleic acids in blood samples retained by blood banks."
"Here, we report the discovery of a new beny-like virus in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) plants collected in the Brittany and Burgundy regions of France in spring 2022, using a high-throughput sequencing approach. A complete genome sequence, comprising two genomic RNAs of 6734 nt (RNA1) and 4856 nt (RNA2) was obtained. This genome shows a typical benyvirus organization, with the RNA1 encoding a large replication-associated protein and the RNA2 encoding, from 5' to 3', the coat protein and its readthrough domain and a triple gene block. Pairwise sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analysis showed that the new virus is a member of the family Benyviridae and that its closest relatives are the recently described beny-like virus wheat stripe mosaic virus and, somewhat more distantly, other recognized benyviruses. Creation of a new species to accommodate the new virus, with the proposed common name ""wheat beny-like virus 1"" (WBLV1), is suggested, either in the genus Benyvirus or in another genus to be created within the family Benyviridae. Given that WBLV1 was identified in plants that were coinfected by other viruses, no conclusions can be drawn at this stage on its potential pathogenicity."
"Disseminated nocardiosis is a rare and potentially fatal disease, with a higher incidence in immunocompromised patients, such as those living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hematological malignancies, including lymphoma. Information on Nocardia spp. infection in Venezuela is limited."
"System-level decisions around the commissioning and provision of healthcare services in England have contributed to barriers in accessing the National Health Service. In this article, we ask how to better regulate resource allocation to ensure greater equity in access to healthcare services. First, we focus on the Health and Care Act 2022, which, drawing on principles of deliberative regulation to address health inequalities, initiates a shift away from previous regulatory approaches towards a collaborative decision-making model. We then shed light on the systemic factors creating and maintaining access barriers by considering shortcomings in previous regulatory approaches. With these in mind, we consider whether deliberative regulation-providing communities with resources to create normative solutions to intrinsic issues-could help address these systemic challenges. To assess the potential of laws or policies to achieve greater equity in healthcare, we also introduce an evaluative framework based on deliberative principles. We apply this framework to a case study of an Integrated Care System to gauge the extent to which the Health and Care Act 2022 has indeed been effectively adopting a deliberative approach by intentionally engaging marginalized communities in decision-making and devising accountability mechanisms for the allocation of healthcare resources."
"To test for rates of inpatient palliative care (IPC) in metastatic testicular cancer patients receiving critical care therapy (CCT). Within the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database (2008-2019), we tabulated IPC rates in metastatic testicular cancer patients receiving CCT, namely invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube (PEG), dialysis for acute kidney failure (AKF), total parenteral nutrition (TPN) or tracheostomy. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models addressing IPC were fitted. Of 420 metastatic testicular cancer patients undergoing CCT, 70 (17%) received IPC. Between 2008 and 2019, the rates of IPC among metastatic testicular cancer patients undergoing CCT increased from 5 to 19%, with the highest rate of 30% in 2018 (EAPC: + 9.5%; 95% CI + 4.7 to + 15.2%; p = 0.005). IPC patients were older (35 vs. 31 years, p = 0.01), more frequently had do not resuscitate (DNR) status (34 vs. 4%, p < 0.001), more frequently exhibited brain metastases (29 vs. 17%, p = 0.03), were more frequently treated with IMV (76 vs. 53%, p < 0.001) and exhibited higher rate of inpatient mortality (74 vs. 29%, p < 0.001). In multivariable analyses, DNR status (OR 10.23, p < 0.001) and African American race/ethnicity (OR 4.69, p = 0.003) were identified as independent predictors of higher IPC use. We observed a significant increase in rates of IPC use in metastatic testicular cancer patients receiving CCT, rising from 5 to 19% between 2008 and 2019. However, this rates remain lower compared to metastatic lung cancer patients, indicating the need for further awareness among clinicians treating metastatic testicular cancer. The increase in IPC rates for metastatic testicular cancer patients receiving CCT indicates a need for ongoing education and awareness among healthcare providers. This could enhance the integration of IPC in the treatment of advanced cancer, potentially improving quality of life and care outcomes for survivors."
"Stress occurs as a reaction to mental and emotional pressure, anxiety, or scarring. Chronic stress is defined as constant submission to these moments. It can affect several body systems, increase blood pressure, and weaken immunity, thereby interfering with physiological health processes. Thus, this study aims to evaluate the effects of chronic stress on the redox status and histomorphological parameters of salivary glands. Thirty-two albino Wistar male rats were randomly divided into two groups: chronic stress and control. Chronically stressed animals were subjected to a restraint protocol by introducing them into a polyvinyl tube for 4 hours daily for 28 days, allowing immobilization of their movements. Subsequently, the animals were euthanized for further collection of the parotid and submandibular salivary glands. The redox state of the glands was evaluated using the antioxidant capacity against peroxyl radicals (ACAP) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) assays. Histological analysis was performed through morphometry of the tissues stained with hematoxylin and eosin and histochemical through picrosirius red staining. Both the parotid and submandibular glands of stressed rats exhibited oxidative stress due to a decrease in ACAP and an increase in TBARS levels. However, the parotid glands are more susceptible to harmful changes in the tissue, such as an increase in the stromal area and in the collagen area fraction, decrease in the acinar area, and smaller size of the acinus and ducts. Our results suggest that chronic stress may cause harmful modulation of the redox state of the salivary glands, with different histological repercussions."
"The MAPT gene encodes Tau protein, a member of the large family of microtubule-associated proteins. Tau forms large insoluble aggregates that are toxic to neurons in several neurological disorders, and neurofibrillary Tau tangles represent a key pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies. Lowering Tau expression levels constitutes a potential treatment for AD but the mechanisms that regulate Tau expression at the transcriptional or translational level are not well understood. Natural antisense transcripts (NATs) are a particular class of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that can regulate expression of their overlapping protein-coding genes at the epigenetic, transcriptional, or translational level. We and others identified a long non-coding RNA associated with the MAPT gene, named MAPT antisense 1 (MAPT-AS1). We confirmed that MAPT-AS1 is expressed in neurons in human post mortem brain tissue. To study the role of MAPT-AS1 on MAPT expression regulation, we modulated the expression of this lncRNA in human neuroblastoma cell lines and in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived neurons. In contrast to previous reports, we observed no changes on MAPT mRNA or Tau protein levels upon modulation of MAPT-AS1 levels in these cellular models. Our data suggest that MAPT-AS1 does not regulate Tau expression levels in human neurons in vitro. Thus, MAPT-AS1 does not represent a valuable therapeutic target to lower Tau expression in patients affected by tauopathies including AD."
"Maternal obesity is associated with significant racial disparities. People who identify as non-Hispanic Black and Latinx are at the highest risk related adverse short- and long-term health outcomes (eg, hypertension in pregnancy and postpartum weight retention). Remote lifestyle interventions delivered during and after pregnancy hold promise for supporting healthy weight outcomes; however, few are tested in groups of people who self-identify as non-Hispanic Black and Latinx or address the neighborhood-level and psychosocial factors driving maternal health disparities. Implementing remote lifestyle interventions within community-based programs that serve birthing people may optimize trust and engagement, promote scalability and sustainability, and have the broadest public health impact."
"In this article, we discuss a recently published study by Gopee et al., who have unveiled a surprising role for macrophages in human prenatal skin development, extending far beyond their traditional immune function. By constructing a comprehensive multi-omics single-cell atlas of human prenatal skin, they demonstrate that innate immune cells play a key role in hair follicle formation, scarless wound healing and neurovascular development."
"Postbiotics, bioactive compounds from the fermentation process by probiotics, are gaining attention for their potential health benefits as safer alternatives to live probiotic microbes."
"The knowledge of comparative and developmental immunobiology has grown over the years and has been strengthened by the contributions of multi-omics research. High-performance microscopy, flow cytometry, scRNA sequencing, and the increased capacity to handle complex data introduced by machine learning have allowed the uncovering of aspects of great complexity and diversity in invertebrate immunocytes, i.e., immune-related circulating cells, which until a few years ago could only be described in terms of morphology and basic cellular functions, such as phagocytosis or enzymatic activity. Today, invertebrate immunocytes are recognized as sophisticated biological entities, involved in host defense, stress response, wound healing, organ regeneration, but also in numerous functional aspects of organismal life not directly related to host defense, such as embryonic development, metamorphosis, and tissue homeostasis. The multiple functions of immunocytes do not always fit the description of invertebrate organisms as simplified biological systems compared to those represented by vertebrates. However, precisely the increasing complexity revealed by immunocytes makes invertebrate organisms increasingly suitable models for addressing biologically significant and specific questions, while continuing to present the undeniable advantages associated with their ethical and economic sustainability."
Progressive collapsing foot deformity (PCFD) and hallux valgus (HV) are complex 3-dimensional deformities of the foot. This study aimed to investigate structural and alignment differences between PCFD with and without HV using weightbearing computed tomography.
"In clinical practice, heart rate variability (HRV) has not been considered an indicator for the preventive assessment of cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN). The paper studies HRV in a large, randomly selected group. A cross-sectional study included a representative sample of 5707 Kazakhs aged 20 years and older from a total population of 25,454 attached to an urban clinic in the capital of Kazakhstan. The sample was drawn from individuals who visited the clinic for a preventive examination. CAN diagnosis was confirmed using data from questionnaires, electronic medical records, HRV, and heart rate measurements. Mean values of the standard deviation of normal sinus RR intervals (SDNN) and the root mean square of successive RR interval differences (RMSSDs) from a 24 h electrocardiogram recording were assessed. CAN was identified in 17.19% of the study participants, with a ratio of the subclinical to clinical phase of 1:0.24. Diabetes mellitus was present in 30.99% of patients with CAN. The prevalence of CAN varied by sex and age, aligning with the prevalence trajectory of diabetes. It was concluded that the SDNN and RMSSD parameters in electrocardiographic studies can be used for preventive measures in the context of limited healthcare resources."
"Bacillus cereus biovar anthracis (Bcbva) causes anthrax-like disease in animals, particularly in the non-human primates and great apes of West and Central Africa. Genomic analyses revealed Bcbva as a member of the B. cereus species that carries two plasmids, pBCXO1 and pBCXO2, which have high sequence homology to the B. anthracis toxin and polyglutamate capsule encoding plasmids pXO1 and pXO2, respectively. To date, only a few studies have investigated the effect of variations in Bcbva sporulation, toxin, and capsule synthesis on animal and macrophage pathogenicity compared to B. anthracis, therefore more research is needed to gain a better understanding of the pathogenesis of this emerging infection. Here, we report that Bcbva can multiply and vegetatively survive on nutrient-rich media for a minimum of six days while generating spores. Sporulation of Bcbva occurred faster and more extensively than B. anthracis Ames. Bcbva tended to secrete less protective antigen (PA) than B. anthracis Ames when cultured in growth medium. We found Bcbva produced a substantially higher amount of attached poly-ƴ-D-glutamic acid (PDGA) capsule than B. anthracis Ames when grown in medium supplemented with human serum and CO2. In a phagocytosis assay, Bcbva spores showed reduced internalization by mouse macrophages compared to B. anthracis Ames. Our research demonstrated that Bcbva is more virulent than B. anthracis Ames using two in vivo models, Galleria mellonella larvae and guinea pigs. Following that, the efficacy of the veterinary vaccine Sterne strain 34F2 against anthrax-like disease was assessed in guinea pigs. Sterne vaccinated guinea pigs had significantly increased anti-PA titers compared to the unvaccinated control group. Toxin neutralizing antibody titers in vaccinated guinea pigs correlated with anti-PA titers. This indicates the Sterne vaccine provides adequate protection against Bcbva infection in laboratory animals."
This study aimed to assess the effect of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) on the arteriolar-to-venular ratio (AVR) in patients with diabetic retinopathy (DR) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).
"This literature review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current understanding, indications, techniques, outcomes, and complications of Müller muscle-conjunctival resection (MMCR) surgery. It also addresses areas of debate with MMCR such as predictability concerning Phenylephrine response as well as the amount of muscle resection required."
"This research study aims to advance the staging of Parkinson's disease (PD) by incorporating machine learning to assess and include a broader multifunctional spectrum of neurocognitive symptoms in the staging schemes beyond motor-centric assessments. Specifically, we provide a novel framework to modernize and personalize PD staging more objectively by proposing a hybrid feature scoring approach."
Neonatal screening has been implemented internationally with different protocols and has become the routine method in the preclinical stage. Late diagnosis is associated with more severe symptoms with decreased survival and higher treatment costs.
"Here we explore the interplay between physical and chemical perturbants to unravel links among native folding, amorphous and ordered aggregation scenarios in IFABP (rat intestinal fatty acid binding protein). This small beta-barrel protein undergoes amyloid-like aggregation above 15 % v/v trifluoroethanol. Our aim was to address the influence of sub-aggregating TFE concentrations on the unfolding transitions of IFABP. The urea-induced unfolding process can bona fide be considered a two-state transition where no aggregation takes place. On the other hand, with GdmCl, the appearance of amyloid-like aggregation becomes evident upon TFE challenge. Temperature-induced denaturation profiles show that both additives, TFE and GdmCl decrease protein stability. Whereas amorphous aggregation occurs upon heating in the presence of TFE, no aggregation takes place with GdmCl. Conversely, when both additives are present, amyloid-like aggregation prevails. The explanation for the choice of amorphous or amyloid-like pathways must reconcile the effects of perturbants on both the protein and solvent structures. Key points include the TFE-promoted desolvation of the polypeptide, a process further enhanced by heat. Although GdmCl might prevent amorphous thermal aggregation by solubilizing non-native states, this effect could also favor amyloid aggregation. In addition, the electrolyte-induced segregation of TFE at high enough GdmCl concentration might contribute to the development and/or stabilization of TFE clusters that could act as nucleation-inducing interfaces, thus leading to the observed amyloid aggregation outcome."
"Predicting premature ventricular contraction (PVC) origin pre-ablation is a fundamental step, as right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) PVC often leads to higher success rates."
"Unraveling the causal variants from genome wide association studies (GWASs) is pivotal for understanding genetic underpinnings of complex traits and diseases. Despite continuous efforts, tools to refine and prioritize GWAS signals need enhancement to address the direct causal implications of genetic variations. To overcome challenges related to statistical fine-mapping in identifying causal variants, CAUSALdb has been updated with novel features and comprehensive datasets, morphing into CAUSALdb2. This expanded repository integrates 15 057 updated GWAS summary statistics across 10 839 unique traits and implements both LD-based and LD-free fine-mapping approaches, including innovative applications of approximate Bayes Factor and SuSiE. Additionally, by incorporating larger LD reference panels such as TOPMED and UK Biobank, and integrating functional annotations via PolyFun, CAUSALdb2 enhances the accuracy and context of fine-mapping results. The database now supports interrogation of additional causal signals and offers sophisticated visualizations to aid researchers in deciphering complex genetic architectures. By facilitating a deeper and more precise characterisation of causal variants, CAUSALdb2 serves as a crucial tool for advancing the genetic analysis of complex diseases. Available freely, CAUSALdb2 continues to set benchmarks in the post-GWAS era, fostering the development of targeted diagnostics and therapeutics derived from responsible genetic research. Explore these advancements at http://mulinlab.org/causaldb."
"Acute lung injury is a crucial pathological state, particularly in some severe infectious respiratory illnesses, distinguished by acute inflammation, pulmonary edema, hypoxia, and neutrophil recruitment. Cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant (CINC) and macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2) play a vital role in neutrophil recruitment."
"This article explores disabled experience and the future of technologies relating to augmentative and alternative communication (AAC). This field includes people's use of AAC devices, typically in combination with other modes of communication, including vocalising, revoicing and body language. Such devices have speech technology and digital voices built into them and we will consider who could be said to have ownership of these technologies. We will also explore the role that people who use AAC have in making their AAC-and how this also contributes to shaping its future. The meanings of 'voice', 'making' and 'ownership' in the context of AAC are many. Yet too often the relationship between these is presented as if it is singular and straightforward. This paper will start by considering the most prevalent, obvious interpretations and build alternative and more complex directions from there. One of the authors uses AAC and is constantly personalising his software, editing and remaking it to reflect his needs and current thinking, representing his voice in ways that he feels ownership of; another is a life partner and can also be thought of as being part of his AAC. Two authors are researchers in an art school, where the act of making things in studios and workshops is inseparable from creative authorship and ownership. Together, all four authors are exploring the meaning and making of speech technology, experimenting with and appropriating it in ways not anticipated by its developers. This paper is a hybrid of voices: disabled and non-disabled; academic and non-academic coresearchers; designers and codesigners. Its unconventional format is intended to reflect the unconventional relationship between the researchers and to represent the conversation between these different voices."
"Accurate assessment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is essential to prevent further complications, yet current methods have limitations. Perception threshold tracking (PTT) offers promise as a novel approach for rapid evaluation of both large and small fiber dysfunction. To enhance efficiency, this study explores the Psi method compared to the Method of Limits (MoL) in estimating perception thresholds. The aim is to assess agreement, uncertainty, and the number of stimuli required for adequate estimation by each method."
"Malaria has been a leading cause of death in human populations for centuries and remains a major public health challenge in African countries, especially affecting children. Among the five Plasmodium species infecting humans, Plasmodium falciparum is the most lethal. Ancient DNA research has provided key insights into the origins, evolution, and virulence of pathogens that affect humans. However, extensive screening of ancient skeletal remains for Plasmodium DNA has shown that such genomic material is rare, with no studies so far addressing potential intra-individual variability. Consequently, the pool of ancient mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or genomic sequences for P. falciparum is extremely limited, with fewer than 20 ancient sequences available for genetic analysis, and no complete P. falciparum mtDNA from Classical antiquity published to date. To investigate intra-individual diversity and genetic origins of P. falciparum from the Roman period, we generated 39 sequencing libraries from multiple teeth and two from the femur of a Roman malaria-infected individual. The results revealed considerable variability in P. falciparum recovery across different dental samples within the individual, while the femur samples showed no preservation of Plasmodium DNA. The reconstructed 43-fold P. falciparum mtDNA genome supports the hypothesis of an Indian origin for European P. falciparum and suggests mtDNA continuity in Europe over the past 2000 years."
"Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the most common manifestation of oral cancer. It has been proposed that periodontal pathogens contribute to OSCC progression, mainly by their virulence factors. However, the main periodontal pathogen and its mechanism to modulate OSCC cells remains not fully understood. In this study we investigate the main host-pathogen pathways in OSCC by computational proteomics and the mechanism behind cancer progression by the oral microbiome. The main host-pathogen pathways were analyzed in the secretome of biopsies from patients with OSCC and healthy controls by mass spectrometry. Then, functional assays were performed to evaluate the host-pathogen pathways highlighted in oral cancer. Host proteins associated with LPS response, cell migration/adhesion, and metabolism of amino acids were significantly upregulated in the human cancer proteome, whereas the complement cascade was downregulated in malignant samples. Then, the microbiome analysis revealed large number and variety of peptides from Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum) in OSCC samples, from which several enzymes from the L-glutamate degradation pathway were found, indicating that L-glutamate from cancer cells is used as an energy source, and catabolized into butyrate by the bacteria. In fact, we observed that F. nucleatum modulates the cystine/glutamate antiporter in an OSCC cell line by increasing SLC7A11 expression, promoting L-glutamate efflux and favoring bacterial infection. Finally, our results showed that F. nucleatum and its metabolic derivates promote tumor spheroids growth, spheroids-derived cell detachment, epithelial-mesenchymal transition and Galectin-9 upregulation. Altogether, F. nucleatum promotes pro-tumoral mechanism in oral cancer."
"Street medicine is a health delivery model designed to provide direct patient care to people experiencing unsheltered homelessness where they are physically located, whether that be on the streets or in encampments. The model has developed in response to the barriers people experiencing homelessness (PEH) encounter when accessing care through traditional points of access such as primary care clinics. Street medicine programs are rapidly emerging across the United States (U.S.) in response to the health needs and challenges associated with care access and coordination for unsheltered homeless individuals. Although street medicine is a rapidly growing field, existing street medicine programs have rarely been studied collectively, limiting our understanding of the nature, scope, and range of street medicine programs in the U.S. This study examined 13 programs from across the U.S. to develop a broad characterization of street medicine programs. Results from interviews with representatives from each of the 13 programs show that there is a high degree of variability among the structure, operations, and scope of care of street medicine programs. However, consistent among street medicine programs is the adoption of a patient-centered approach to care and the use of harm-reduction principles. Street medicine programs are also highly engaged with community partners and affiliate organizations that work in their local and regional areas. Because street medicine programs often serve as a bridge between formal healthcare entities and PEH, street medicine offers a strategy for reconnecting individuals to vital healthcare services."
"Cancer is a complex disease with profound societal and economic impacts, especially in metastatic cases where treatment challenges arise due to the absence of reliable biomarkers and effective therapies. While P21-activated kinases (PAKs) play a key role in cancer progression, their potential as predictive markers for metastasis and therapeutic targets has not been fully explored. We hypothesized that genetic alterations in PAK isoforms could be linked to reduced overall patient survival. To investigate this, we used data from the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics, analyzing several randomized, multicentered phase-3 clinical trial datasets. The analysis revealed significant genetic alterations in PAK genes, particularly in cancers such as breast, prostate, pancreatic, and lung. Notably, elevated PAK expression was associated with poorer survival outcomes in prostate and breast cancer patients. In pancreatic and lung cancers, although a trend of poorer survival with PAK alterations was observed, it was not statistically significant. Our findings underscore the importance of PAK isoforms as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets, particularly in metastatic cancers. Further research could lead to improved patient outcomes through targeted interventions aimed at PAK-related pathways, with PAK serving as a reliable biomarker for the precise diagnosis, monitoring, and personalization of treatment strategies."
"Elotuzumab-based regimens are sometimes selected for multiple myeloma treatment after daratumumab-based regimens. However, there has been insufficient discussion on the efficacy of elotuzumab after daratumumab. We used Kansai Myeloma Forum registration data in a multicenter retrospective evaluation of the efficacy of elotuzumab after daratumumab. Overall survival (OS) rate and time to next treatment (TTNT) were significantly worse in the cohort given elotuzumab after daratumumab (Dara cohort, n = 47) than in the cohort with no history of daratumumab administration before elotuzumab (No-Dara cohort, n = 80, OS: P = 0.03; TTNT: P = 0.02; best response: P < 0.01). In the Dara cohort, OS and TTNT rates were worse with sequential elotuzumab use after daratumumab than with non-sequential (OS: P = 0.02; TTNT: P = 0.03). In patients given elotuzumab < 180 days after daratumumab, OS (P = 0.08) and best response (P = 0.21) tended to be worse, and TTNT was significantly worse (P = 0.01), than in those given elotuzumab after ≥ 180 days. These findings were confirmed by subgroup analyses and multivariate analyses. Monoclonal-antibody-free treatment might be preferable after daratumumab-based regimens. If possible, elotuzumab-based regimens should be considered only ≥ 180 days after daratumumab use."
"Patients undergoing dialysis are at risk of osteoporosis and sarcopenia because of mineral and bone disorders or malnutrition. Additionally, maintaining muscle mass is important to prevent osteoporosis. The psoas muscle mass index (PMI) was recently used to evaluate muscle mass. However, few studies have evaluated the association between the PMI and bone mineral density (BMD); therefore, we examined the association between PMI and BMD in the femoral neck (FN) of 80 patients (45 males, age, 71 (60-76) years; dialysis duration, 74 (36-140) months) undergoing hemodialysis. FN-BMD was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and PMI was evaluated using psoas muscle areas on computed tomography. FN-BMD and PMI were significantly higher in males than in females. In a correlation analysis, sex, BMI, serum creatinine levels, HbA1c levels, and PMI were positively correlated with FN-BMD, whereas age, history of bone fracture, difficulty in walking and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase level were negatively correlated. In the multivariate regression analysis using clinical factors significantly correlated to FN-BMD, including PMI, both sex (standardized coefficient: 0.249, p = 0.028) and PMI (standardized coefficient: 0.249, p = 0.038) were extracted. Multivariable linear regression analysis using PMI and traditional osteoporosis factors revealed that PMI was significantly and independently associated with FN-BMD (standardized coefficient: 0.308, p = 0.010). In conclusion, PMI was positively associated with FN-BMD. Attention should be paid to the possibility of decreased BMD with decreased muscle mass."
We aimed to explore the possible effects of Kashin-Beck disease (KBD) on the risk of sarcopenia and its possible interaction in the association between the risk of sarcopenia and element concentration.
"Atypical femur fractures (AFFs) are rare adverse events associated with bisphosphonate use, having unclear pathophysiology. AFFs also cluster in families and have occurred in patients with monogenetic bone diseases sometimes without bisphosphonate use, suggesting an underlying genetic susceptibility. Our aim was to identify a genetic cause for AFF in a Caucasian family with 7 members affected by osteoporosis, including 3 siblings with bisphosphonate-associated AFFs. Using whole-exome sequencing, we identified a rare pathogenic variant c.G1063A (p.Gly355Ser) in lysyl oxidase like 4 (LOXL4) among 64 heterozygous rare, protein-altering variants shared by the 3 siblings with AFFs. The same variant was also found in a fourth sibling with a low-trauma femur fracture above the knee, not fulfilling all the ASBMR criteria of AFF and in 1 of 73 unrelated European AFF patients. LOXL4 is involved in collagen cross-linking and may be relevant for microcrack formation and bone repair mechanisms. Preliminary functional analysis showed that skin fibroblast-derived osteoblasts from the unrelated patient with the LOXL4 variant expressed less collagen type I and elastin, while osteogenic differentiation and mineralization were enhanced compared with 2 controls. In conclusion, this LOXL4 variant may underlie AFF susceptibility possibly due to abnormal collagen metabolism, leading to increased formation of microdamage or compromised healing of microcracks in the femur."
"Restoration and artificial reefs can assist the recovery of degraded reefs but are limited in scalability and climate resilience. The Mineral Accretion Technique (MAT) subjects metal artificial reefs to a low-voltage electrical current, thereby creating a calcium-carbonate coating. It has been suggested that corals on MAT structures experience enhanced health and growth. However, prior studies report conflicting results potentially due to different conditions, species and approaches used. We investigated how MAT influences the bleaching resilience, condition and growth of four coral species and natural coral recruitment in Kenya. Coral fragments were outplanted on charged iron tables using commonly-applied settings (6 V; 0.84 A m-2). After one month, when all tables had acquired a calcium-carbonate coating, half of the tables were taken off electricity to serve as controls. Both treatments (MAT and Control) were monitored on coral brightness, condition (live tissue cover), growth and natural recruitment for one year, during which a marine heatwave occurred. Coral bleaching was significantly more severe on MAT for all studied species. For three species, coral condition dropped sharply during the heatwave and this decline was faster and more severe on MAT. Coral growth was reduced during the heatwave for all corals and remained low for one species on MAT. After one year, the Control harboured 34 coral recruits, whereas none were found on MAT. Thus, while MAT can be useful to prevent corrosion of metal artificial reefs, we do not recommend MAT as reported here to improve coral growth, condition, heat resilience or recruitment."
"Exposure to tamoxifen can exert effects on the human liver, and esterases process prodrugs such as antibiotics and convert them to less toxic metabolites. In this study, the porcine liver esterase (PLE)-inhibitory activity of tamoxifen has been investigated. PLE showed inhibition of a PLE isoenzyme (PLE5). In addition, avenanthramides, which have a similar structure to that of tamoxifen, have been used to determine the PLE-inhibitory effect. Among the avenanthramide derivatives, avenanthramide B has been shown to inhibit PLE. Avenanthramide B interacts with Lys284 of PLE, whereas avenanthramide A and C counteract with Lys284. Avenanthramide B has shown a similar inhibitory effect to that of tamoxifen. Given that avenanthramide B can modulate the action of PLE, it can be used in pharmaceutical and industrial applications for modulating the effects of PLE. Based on superimposed structures between PLE and human liver esterase, the impact of tamoxifen use in humans is discussed. In addition, this study can serve as a fundamental basis for future investigations regarding the potential risk of tamoxifen and other drugs. Thus, this study presents an insight into the comparison of structurally similar tamoxifen and avenanthramides on liver esterases, which can have implications for the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries."
"Zinc is a vital trace element, yet its deficiency is common in various populations. This study addresses the gap in understanding zinc intake and its relationship with key nutritional parameters in a Colombian population. We analyzed data from 12,987 individuals, focusing on the daily intake of zinc, phytate, protein, and calcium, and used the phytate/zinc molar ratio as an input parameter in the Miller et al. (2013) model. This model was employed to estimate the total absorbed zinc (TAZ) and the fractional absorption of zinc (FAZ). Our findings highlight a general trend towards insufficient intake compared to the standards of the Institute of Medicine (IOM) and Colombia, with a significant percentage of the population falling below the estimated average requirement (EAR) and recommended daily allowance (RDA) for zinc, underscoring the need for targeted nutritional strategies. Our study contributes to a broader understanding of zinc nutrition and public health implications in Colombia, providing a basis for future dietary guidelines and health interventions."
"Leaf rust, caused by Puccinia triticina (Pt), is a serious constraint to wheat production. Developing resistant varieties is the best approach to managing this disease. Wheat leaf rust resistance (Lr) genes have been classified into either all-stage resistance (ASR) or adult-plant resistance (APR). The objectives of this study were to identify sources of leaf rust resistance in contemporary US hard winter wheat (HWW) and to dissect the genetic basis underlying leaf rust resistance in HWW. A panel of 732 elite HWW genotypes was evaluated for response to US Pt races at the seedling stage and at the adult plant stage in leaf rust nurseries in Oklahoma, Texas, and Kansas. Further, the panel was genotyped using multiplex restriction amplicon sequencing (MRA-Seq) and DNA markers linked to the known ASR genes Lr18, Lr19, Lr21, Lr24, Lr37, and Lr42 and APR genes Lr34, Lr46, Lr67, Lr68, Lr77, and Lr78. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers derived from MRA-Seq, DNA markers linked to the known Lr genes, and the phenotypic data were used for genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify markers associated with leaf rust response. Gene postulation based on leaf rust reactions, DNA markers, and GWAS suggested the presence of Lr1, Lr2a, Lr10, Lr14a, Lr16, Lr18, Lr19, Lr21, Lr24, Lr26, Lr34, Lr37, Lr39, Lr42, Lr46, Lr68, Lr77, and Lr78 in the HWW panel. The GWAS identified 59 SNPs significantly associated with leaf rust response, of which 20 were likely associated with novel resistance loci and can be used to enhance wheat leaf rust resistance."
Proteinuria commonly accompanies acute ischaemic stroke (AIS) patients undergoing reperfusion therapies such as intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) and endovascular thrombectomy (EVT). Understanding its influence on outcomes is crucial for prognosis and optimising management strategies. This study aims to elucidate proteinuria's role in mediating outcomes among reperfusion-treated patients.
Gilles de la Tourette syndrome (TS) is a neuropsychiatric disorder associated with abnormal activation of the cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical circuits and dopaminergic system. We sought to examine changes in neurotransmission relating to cortical excitation/inhibition of TS by measuring TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs) of selected networks.
"The study aimed to distinguish between the role played by the structural properties of MFG from its chemical composition in modulating its interaction with pathogenic and commensal bacteria. MFG from mammary gland epithelial cells (MEC) or raw milk was tested. Small MFG from both sources promoted growth of B.subtilis while large MFG triggered biofilm formation. Metabolomic profiles supported these findings for MEC-derived MFG. In contrast, pathogenic bacteria like E. coli weren't affected by MFG size from both sources. Using lipid mixture formulated to mimic the chemical composition of small MFG did not induce growth of the bacteria. Results validate that (i) milk components secreted by MEC share some structural-functional properties with raw MFG and (ii) the structure of the MFG plays a pivotal role in modulating the interaction between milk fat and bacteria. Taken together, MFG size variations may provide a competitive advantage to commensal bacteria as a protective mechanism."
Understanding the connection between parental wellbeing and its impact on childhood depression is crucial in order to develop targeted interventions and support systems that can mitigate potential long-term effects on mental health. This study focuses on examining the properties of an Arabic translation of a questionnaire called Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire Parent Version (SMFQ-P) as a preliminary step toward validating a culturally relevant screening tool for childhood depression in Lebanon.
"The small leucine-rich proteoglycan decorin (DCN) is recognized for its diverse roles in tissue homeostasis and malignant progression. Nevertheless, the regulatory effects of DCN on bladder cancer stem cells (BCSCs) and the underlying mechanisms in muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) remain to be elucidated."
"We report the outcomes of patients with haematological malignancies admitted to ICUs and define pre-ICU prognostic factors for in-hospital mortality. In a retrospective, single-center study, we included all patients with haematologic malignancies admitted to ICUs between 2009 and 2019. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. One hundred and forty-four patients with hematologic malignancies were admitted to ICUs during the study period. Fifteen (10.4%) were in remission, 36 (25.0%) were in remission after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Acute Leukemias and aggressive lymphomas were the most common diagnoses, occurring in 34.7%. The in-hospital mortality was 49%. The main predictors for in-hospital mortality were age >65 years, post allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, non-remission, respiratory rate >22 bpm, bilirubin >2 mg/dl, PH< 7.35, and time from hospital admission to ICU transfer ≥3 days. In-hospital mortality of patients with hematologic malignancies admitted to ICU was 49%. We identified pre-ICU parameters that predict in-hospital mortality."
"Cervical cancer is one of the deadliest cancers that pose a significant threat to women's health. Early detection and treatment are commonly used methods to prevent cervical cancer. The use of pathological image analysis techniques for the automatic interpretation of cervical cells in pathological slides is a prominent area of research in the field of digital medicine. According to The Bethesda System, cervical cytology necessitates further classification of precancerous lesions based on positive interpretations. However, clinical definitions among different categories of lesion are complex and often characterized by fuzzy boundaries. In addition, pathologists can deduce different criteria for judgment based on The Bethesda System, leading to potential confusion during data labeling. Noisy labels due to this reason are a great challenge for supervised learning. To address the problem caused by noisy labels, we propose a method based on label credibility correction for cervical cell images classification network. Firstly, a contrastive learning network is used to extract discriminative features from cell images to obtain more similar intra-class sample features. Subsequently, these features are fed into an unsupervised method for clustering, resulting in unsupervised class labels. Then unsupervised labels are corresponded to the true labels to separate confusable and typical samples. Through a similarity comparison between the cluster samples and the statistical feature centers of each class, the label credibility analysis is carried out to group labels. Finally, a cervical cell images multi-class network is trained using synergistic grouping method. In order to enhance the stability of the classification model, momentum is incorporated into the synergistic grouping loss. Experimental validation is conducted on a dataset comprising approximately 60,000 cells from multiple hospitals, showcasing the effectiveness of our proposed approach. The method achieves 2-class task accuracy of 0.9241 and 5-class task accuracy of 0.8598. Our proposed method achieves better performance than existing classification networks on cervical cancer."
"Aesthetic education is an important part of the overall development of students. This study analyzes the number of rural schools and enrollment, number of classes, and number of full-time teachers in those schools from 2013 to 2022, and clarifies the current challenges in aesthetic education in rural elementary schools and the path of quality improvement. It then constructs a curriculum cluster model that shares resources, teachers, management, instructional design, and practical activities, etc. The results find that (1) the number of rural primary schools in 2013-2022 shows a decreasing trend, and in 2022 there was a 45.77% decrease relative to 2013. The number of rural elementary schools in 2022 shows a decreasing trend, and the relative decrease in 2022 compared with 2013 is 45.77%. From 2013 to 2022, the number of elementary schools in rural areas was more than 50% of the total number of elementary schools. Rural elementary schools in China are scattered, the distribution rate of aesthetic education resources is low, and it is difficult to popularize high-quality aesthetic education resources. (2) The number of classes in China's rural elementary schools decreased 30.28% from 1.139 million in 2013 to 788,000 in 2022. The small size of rural schools, small number of teaching classes, and small number of students lead to less investment in resources for schools to offer aesthetic education, and the integration of collective public art courses cannot be realized. (3) Using the model of a ""two-dimensional aesthetic education curriculum cluster,"" we can improve the high-quality development of aesthetic education in rural schools. (4) The design path of the aesthetic education curriculum clusters focuses on the implementation and implantation of teaching objectives, teaching design and teaching process by grade, and links interest activities, nature and social observation activities, etc. Organically with aesthetic education. This study can thereby an effective path for the improvement of the quality of aesthetic education in rural elementary schools and the high-quality development of aesthetic education in rural schools."
Connecting an infusion line to a closed stopcock results in pressurization of fluid within the syringe infusion pump assembly leading to flow irregularities when opening the stopcock and activating the pump.
"The self-matching task (SMT) is widely used to investigate the cognitive mechanisms underlying the self-prioritization effect (SPE), wherein performance is enhanced for self-associated stimuli compared to other-associated ones. Although the SMT robustly elicits the SPE, there is a lack of data quantifying the reliability of this paradigm. This is problematic, given the prevalence of the reliability paradox in cognitive tasks: many well-established cognitive tasks demonstrate relatively low reliability when used to evaluate individual differences, despite exhibiting replicable effects at the group level. To fill this gap, this preregistered study investigated the reliability of SPE derived from the SMT using a multiverse approach, combining all possible indicators and baselines reported in the literature. We first examined the robustness of 24 SPE measures across 42 datasets (N = 2250) using a meta-analytical approach. We then calculated the split-half reliability (r) and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC2) for each SPE measure. Our findings revealed a robust group-level SPE across datasets. However, when evaluating individual differences, SPE indices derived from reaction time (RT) and efficiency exhibited relatively higher, compared to other SPE indices, but still unsatisfied split-half reliability (approximately 0.5). The reliability across multiple time points, as assessed by ICC2, RT, and efficiency, demonstrated moderate levels of test-retest reliability (close to 0.5). These findings revealed the presence of a reliability paradox in the context of SMT-based SPE assessment. We discussed the implications of how to enhance individual-level reliability using this paradigm for future study design."
"While recent studies have indicated a potential link between incense burning and respiratory diseases, there is a lack of data specifically focused on diabetic patients. To explore the relationship between indoor incense burning and impaired lung function among Chinese individuals with diabetes, a comprehensive cross-sectional study was undertaken, enrolling 431 adults diagnosed with diabetes. Information on incense burning and characteristics was collected using a structured questionnaire. The outcome of the study, impaired lung function, was assessed using spirometry. Multivariable logistic regression models were employed. In the fully adjusted model, participants exposed to indoor incense burning exhibited 130% higher odds of impaired lung function compared to those not exposed, as indicated by an odds ratio (OR) of 2.3 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.97, 5.16; P = 0.05). Notably, this association was statistically significant only in men (OR = 3.39; 95%CI: 1.07, 9.82; P = 0.03). Our study has elucidated an association between exposure to indoor incense burning and impaired lung function in individuals with diabetes, independently of demographic factors. These findings underscore the importance of considering indoor environmental factors, such as incense burning, in the comprehensive management and care of diabetic individuals."
"Accurate diagnosis and monitoring of neurodegenerative diseases require reliable biomarkers. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteins are promising candidates for reflecting brain pathology; however, their diagnostic utility may be compromised by natural variability between individuals, weakening their association with disease. Here, we measured the levels of 69 pre-selected proteins in cerebrospinal fluid using antibody-based suspension bead array technology in a multi-disease cohort of 499 individuals with neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD), behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia, primary progressive aphasias, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), corticobasal syndrome, primary supranuclear palsy, along with healthy controls. We identify significant inter-individual variability in overall CSF levels of brain-derived proteins, which could not be attributed to specific disease associations. Using linear modelling, we show that adjusting for median CSF levels of brain-derived proteins increases the diagnostic accuracy of proteins previously identified as altered in CSF in the context of neurodegenerative disorders. We further demonstrate a simplified approach for the adjustment using pairs of correlated proteins with opposite alteration in the diseases. With this approach, the proteins adjust for each other and further increase the biomarker performance through additive effect. When comparing the diseases, two proteins-neurofilament medium and myelin basic protein-showed increased levels in ALS compared to other diseases, and neurogranin showed a specific increase in AD. Several other proteins showed similar trends across the studied diseases, indicating that these proteins likely reflect shared processes related to neurodegeneration. Overall, our findings suggest that accounting for inter-individual variability is crucial in future studies to improve the identification and performance of relevant biomarkers. Importantly, we highlight the need for multi-disease studies to identify disease-specific biomarkers."
"In this study, the endophytic fungus Coniothyrium chaingmaiense-KUMBMDBT-25 was isolated from the healthy stem of Euphorbia tirucalli, mass cultivated by submerged fermentation, and extracted using ethyl acetate as a solvent. The extract was subjected to GC-MS analysis. The synthesized Con-AgNPs were characterized through various bioanalytical methods. The synthesis was confirmed by Bio- spectrophotometry, which showed an absorption peak at 404 nm. FTIR analysis verified the reduction and capping of Con-AgNPs, displaying peaks corresponding to various functional groups. SEM-EDAX and HR-TEM examinations revealed that the Con-AgNPs were spherical, and EDAX analysis confirmed the presence of silver atoms at 3 keV. XRD studies revealed the crystalline structure of Con-AgNPs. DLS and Zeta potential tests determined the size and stability of the synthesized Con-AgNPs, which were 65.81 nm. The Con-AgNPs demonstrated strong antibacterial activity against P. aeruginosa (14.06 ± 0.11 mm, 10 mg/mL) and effective antifungal activity against A. flavus (13.03 ± 0.05 mm, 10 mg/mL). Con-AgNPs exhibited notable biological attributes, including a cytotoxic effect of up to 38.82% and 19.15% at 200 µg/mL in an MTT assay measuring cell viability. Additionally, the nanoparticles demonstrated significant anti-inflammatory effects in both in vitro and in vivo studies, validating the biological and pharmacological potential of Con-AgNPs."
"MicroRNAs can be found intracellularly incorporated into extracellular vesicles (EV-miRNAs) or extracellularly as cell-free miRNAs (cf-miRNAs). This study aimed to compare the diagnostic and prognostic potential of four miRNAs with recognized roles in prostate cancer as cf-miRNAs and EV-miRNAs, obtained from liquid biopsies (LB). Total RNA was isolated from whole plasma and plasma EVs from 15 controls (CTR) and 30 patients (20 with localized prostate cancer (PCa), 10 with metastatic prostate cancer (mPCa)). The miRNAs were quantified by RT-qPCR and the relative expression of these miRNAs was compared between the three groups, and their associations with clinicopathological parameters were assessed. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were performed to evaluate the diagnostic potential of the miRNAs in discriminating different groups. Overall, EV-miRNAs showed higher expression compared to cf-miRNAs. All EV-miRNAs analyzed showed diagnostic potential with an area under the curve (AUC) above 0.744. EV-miR-21-5p, EV-miR-375-3p, and EV-miR-1290-3p were overexpressed in PCa and mPCa compared to CTR, while EV-miR-200c-3p was overexpressed only in mPCa in comparison to CTR. Remarkably, EV-miR-375-3p and EV-miR-1290-3p could differentiate mPCa with ISUP ≥ 3, demonstrating their prognostic potential. In addition, EV-miR-1290-3p and EV-4-miR-panel detected patients with PSA > 10 ng/mL. Cf-miRNAs performed lower than EV-miRNAs, which can be explained by the greater stability and specificity of EV-miRNAs, making them superior to cf-miRNA. The results show that LB, a non-invasive strategy, is clinically feasible to identify EV-miRNAs as biomarkers for PCa and may provide additional information for assessing PCa risk stratification."

"Although there is clear evidence that therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) has beneficial effects for patients treated with tricyclic antidepressants, it is generally not recommended for second-generation antidepressants (SGA). However, it has been suggested that methodological shortcomings might influence the results in TDM studies with SGA."
"The flat-headed loach (Oreonectes platycephalus) is a small fish inhabiting headwaters of hillstreams of southern China. Its local populations are characterized by low genetic diversity and exceptionally high differentiation, making it an ideal model for studying small population isolates' persistence and adaptive potential. However, the lack of Oreonectes reference genomes limits endeavours toward these ambitions. We assembled the first haplotype-resolved chromosome-level genome of the genus Oreonectes using PacBio HiFi and Hi-C technologies. This genome consists of two haplotypes (24 pseudo-chromosomes in each), with sizes of 565.68 Mb (haplotype A) and 521.13 Mb (haplotype B) and scaffold N50 lengths of 22.80 Mb and 21.91 Mb, respectively. Chr01 was identified as the likely sex chromosome pair. After masking repetitive elements which accounted for 34.43% to 36.44% of the genome, there are 27,127 protein-coding genes in haplotype A and 25,576 in haplotype B. The availability of this haplotype-resolved chromosome-level reference genome will facilitate the study of population and conservation genetics of the flat-headed loach and other Oreonectes species."
We previously demonstrated positive effects on quality of life and mental health following breast cancer when comparing a nurse-led follow-up program without scheduled visits (MyHealth) to regular follow-up. This study aims to examine whether MyHealth also positively impacts self-reported work ability.
Chronic subdural hematoma (cSDH) is a prevalent neurosurgical condition with an increasing incidence due to the rising life expectancy and the widespread use of anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapies. Insights into the inflammatory origins of cSDH led to the exploration of Middle Meningeal Artery (MMA) embolization as a therapeutic strategy. In recent years the endovascular treatment of MMA has gained momentum. Herein we present the initial experience of a dual trained neurovascular unit implementing this therapeutic technique.
"Rice is susceptible to cold temperatures, especially during the seedling stage. Despite extensive research into the cold tolerance mechanisms of rice, the number of cloned genes remains limited. Plant subtilisin-like proteases (SUBs or SBTs) are protein-hydrolyzing enzymes which play important roles in various aspects of plant growth as well as the plant response to biotic and abiotic stress. The rice SUB gene family consists of 62 members, but it is unknown whether they are involved in the response to cold stress. In this study, we observed that a loss-of-function SUB4 mutant exhibited enhanced cold tolerance at the seedling stage. The sub4 mutant seedlings exhibited improved survival rates and related physiological parameters, including relative electrolyte conductivity, chlorophyll content, malondialdehyde content, and antioxidant enzyme activity. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that differentially expressed genes responsive to cold stress in the sub4 mutants were primarily associated with metabolism and signal transduction. Notably, the majority of cold-responsive genes were associated with cell wall functions, including those related to cell wall organization, chitin catabolic processes, and oxidoreductases. Our findings suggest that SUB4 negatively regulates the cold response in rice seedlings, possibly by modifying the properties of the cell wall."
"ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) synthesizes acetyl-CoA for de novo lipogenesis (DNL), which is elevated in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease. Hepatic ACLY is inhibited by the LDL-cholesterol-lowering drug bempedoic acid (BPA), which also improves steatosis in mice. While BPA potently suppresses hepatic DNL and increases fat catabolism, it is unclear if ACLY is its primary molecular target in reducing liver triglyceride. We show that on a Western diet, loss of hepatic ACLY alone or together with the acetyl-CoA synthetase ACSS2 unexpectedly exacerbates steatosis, linked to reduced PPARα target gene expression and fatty acid oxidation. Importantly, BPA treatment ameliorates Western diet-mediated triacylglyceride accumulation in both WT and liver ACLY knockout mice, indicating that its primary effects on hepatic steatosis are ACLY independent. Together, these data indicate that hepatic ACLY plays an unexpected role in restraining diet-dependent lipid accumulation and that BPA exerts substantial effects on hepatic lipid metabolism independently of ACLY."
The purpose of this study is to compare the reconstructed corneal power (RCP) by working backwards from the post-implantation spectacle refraction and toric intraocular lens power and to develop the models for mapping preoperative keratometry and total corneal power to RCP.
"Community-based dental education (CBDE) is essential for equipping dental students with the practical skills required for independent practice while simultaneously addressing the oral health needs of the community through real-world experiential learning. The success of CBDE initiatives rely on effective collaboration across stakeholders, including educational institutions, community organisations, and students, to address both faculty educational goals and community oral health needs. This paper introduces a practical toolbox to support CBDE program implementation. Developed from an extensive literature review, analysis of relevant case studies, and insights from the authors' experiences, the toolbox provides structured, evidence-based guidance on planning, administration, and ongoing evaluation for CBDE programs. Key components include strategies for fostering robust partnerships with community organisations, designing program components that maximise student engagement, and implementing continuous quality improvement practices. The toolbox emphasises creating an adaptable framework that ensures CBDE programs remain responsive to the evolving needs of both students and the communities they serve and sustain long-term collaborations."
"Chronic dacryocystitis (CD) can result in severe complications and vision impairment due to ongoing microbial infections and persistent tearing. Tear fluid, which contains essential components vital for maintaining ocular surface health, has been investigated for its potential in the noninvasive identification of ocular biomarkers through metabolomics analysis. In this study, we employed UHPLC-MS/MS to analyze the tear metabolome of CD patients. UHPLC-MS/MS analysis of tear samples from CD patients revealed significant metabolic alterations. Compared with the control group, 298 metabolites were elevated, while 142 were decreased. KEGG pathway analysis suggested that these changes primarily affected arginine and proline metabolism, biosynthesis of amino acids, and phenylalanine biosynthesis in CD. Notably, 3-dehydroquinic acid, anthranilic acid, citric acid, and l-isoleucine emerged as potential biomarker candidates of CD with high diagnostic accuracy (AUC = 0.94). These findings suggest that tear fluid metabolism, particularly amino acid biosynthesis, plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of CD. Uncovering these metabolic products and pathways provides valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying CD and paves the way for the development of diagnostic tools and targeted therapies."
"Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, with incidence and mortality significantly affected by population ageing and changes in the prevalence of risk factors. Lung nodules, which are often detected incidentally on imaging studies, pose a significant diagnostic challenge as they may indicate both benign and malignant processes. Correct diagnosis and management of these nodules is therefore essential to optimize clinical outcomes."
"The regulation of non-climacteric fruit ripening by the transcription factor NON-RIPENING (NOR) is poorly understood. Here, we identified that the NOR homolog in the non-climacteric fruit watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) was located within the selective sweep and sweetness quantitative trait locus that was selected during domestication from landraces to cultivars. ClNOR knockout substantially delayed fruit ripening, and the fruits of the knockout plants had lower abscisic acid (ABA) levels, lighter colored flesh, and were less sweet compared to wild type. Transcriptome analysis and DNA affinity purification sequencing revealed that ClNOR targeted the Basic Leucine Zipper gene ClbZIP1, which links ClNOR to genes that do not have a ClNOR-binding motif in their promoters, such as the ABA biosynthesis gene, 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase ClNCED1 and the chromoplast phosphate transporter gene ClPHT4;2. The double mutant Clnor Clbzip1 exhibited delayed fruit ripening, lower ABA level, and lighter colored flesh. Its delayed ripening phenotype was stronger than that of the Clbzip1 single mutant. Additionally, the ClNORT,T haplotype in cultivated watermelon resulted in higher ClbZIP1 expression, but ClNORC,T from landraces and ClNORC,G from ancestral watermelon did not. Heterologous ClNORT,T expression rescued the delayed ripening phenotype of the Slnor knockout in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). This natural variant (564T/C) of ClNOR promoted fruit ripening by enhancing target genes transcription. Overall, these findings will help elucidate the evolutionary mechanisms of nonclimacteric fruit ripening."
The utility of thrombolysis and/or thrombectomy in patients with mild stroke and large vessel occlusion (LVO) remains inconclusive. This retrospective study compared short-term and long-term outcomes in patients treated with best medical therapy (BMT group) versus with intravenous thrombolytics and/or endovascular thrombectomy (intervention group).
"This research was conducted to investigate the relationship between women's attitudes toward sexuality during pregnancy and their body image and to determine the predictors of pregnant women's sexual attitudes. The research was conducted with 515 pregnant women in Turkey. Study data were collected using a sociodemographic data form, the Attitude Scale toward Sexuality during Pregnancy, and the Body Image in Pregnancy Scale. As women's positive attitudes toward sexuality increased, their dissatisfaction with their body image decreased. It was determined that women with a positive body image during pregnancy had a less anxious attitude toward sexual intercourse, developed positive beliefs and values toward sexuality, and approved of sexuality during pregnancy. The factors that explained 15.8% of pregnant women's attitudes towards sexuality were body image, age, gestational week, satisfaction with sexuality during pregnancy, and knowledge of sexuality during pregnancy. It is recommended that body image, age, gestational week, satisfaction with sexuality in pregnancy and knowledge of sexuality in pregnancy should be taken into consideration in order to accurately determine the sexual attitudes of pregnant women in obstetric clinics."
"Various analgesic techniques have been applied, the pain after video assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) is still challenging for anesthesiologists. Paracetamol provide analgesic efficacy in many surgeries. However, clinical evidence in the lung surgery with regional block remain limited. This monocentric double-blind randomized controlled trial investigates the efficacy of paracetamol after VATS with regional block."

This study aims to investigate the clinical application value of the central venous-arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure difference (Pv-aCO2) in postoperative cognitive dysfunction(POCD) in patients with acute aortic dissection.
"The lateral septum (LS) demonstrates activation in response to pup exposure in mothers, and its lesions eliminate maternal behaviors suggesting it is part of the maternal brain circuitry. This study shows that the density of pup-activated neurons in the ventral subdivision of the LS (LSv) is nearly equivalent to that in the medial preoptic area (MPOA), the major regulatory site of maternal behavior in rat dams. However, when somatosensory inputs including suckling were not allowed, pup-activation was markedly reduced in the LSv. Retrograde tract tracing identified various brain regions potentially influencing LSv neuronal activation through their projections. Among all, anterograde tract tracing confirmed that the posterior intralaminar thalamic nucleus (PIL), implicated in processing touch-related stimuli, targets the pup-activated region of the LSv. Moreover, nerve terminals containing the maternally induced PIL neuropeptide parathyroid hormone 2 (PTH2), were found to form synaptic connections with c-Fos activated LSv neurons using electron microscopy. Confirmation of PTH2 + PIL fibers projecting to LSv was achieved by retrograde tract tracing methods. Furthermore, double retrograde injections revealed that neurons within the PIL can project to both LSv and MPOA, suggesting their simultaneous regulation by PIL input. We also established that septal neurons activated by the pups in the mother are GABAergic and send inhibitory projections to the MPOA and other components of the maternal brain circuitry. This implies that the LSv and MPOA form an interconnected subcircuit in the maternal brain network, which is primarily driven by somatosensory input from the pups via the PIL PTH2 + neurons."
"Ensuring effective access to vaccinations for people experiencing homelessness is crucial to protecting the health of a vulnerable, yet often overlooked population. Reaching this goal takes more than a one size fits all approach. This study evaluates how a dedicated health team collaborated with multiple agencies to register and deliver the COVID-19 vaccine to people experiencing homelessness."
"Natural flavonoids have been shown to have many pharmacological activities. Efficient and continuous enrichment of total flavonoids with high content and low mobile phase usage from complex natural products is greatly needed at the moment. In this study, a new continuous chromatography system (CCS) with 6 zones and the 18-column dynamic tandem connection technique was developed and used to enrich total flavonoids from Epimedium koreanum Nakai (EKN). The 18 columns were divided into 6 zones, and the principle of a dynamic series of three columns was adopted for each zone to achieve continuous automatic separation and enrichment of total flavonoids under the control of a logic control valve. The CCS separation conditions were established based on single-column chromatography and a theoretical calculation model of the CCS. By means of the self-designed device and method, 485.11±3.16 g of total flavonoids were isolated from 16.2 kg of EKN. It is worth noting that the total content of 18 types of flavonoids in the samples enriched by the CCS was increased from 2.84±0.07% to 88.29±0.22%, the total recovery rate was 92.20±0.38%, and the RSD of each flavonoid was less than 5.0%. Furthermore, compared with single-column chromatography filled with the same volume of chromatography filler, the entire process saved about 2/3 of the mobile phase usage. In summary, the developed device and method could efficiently and continuously enrich total flavonoids from EKN with high-content and low mobile phase usage and would have a wide application prospect in the separation and enrichment of natural products."
"Gaussian process regression (GPR) is a nonparametric probabilistic model capable of computing not only the predicted mean but also the predicted standard deviation, which represents the confidence level of predictions. It offers great flexibility as it can be non-linearized by designing the kernel function, made robust against outliers by altering the likelihood function, and extended to classification models. Recently, models combining deep learning with GPR, such as Deep Kernel Learning GPR, have been proposed and reported to achieve higher accuracy than GPR. However, due to its nonparametric nature, GPR is challenging to interpret. While Explainable AI (XAI) methods like LIME or kernel SHAP can interpret the predicted mean, interpreting the predicted standard deviation remains difficult. In this study, we propose a novel method to interpret the prediction of GPR by evaluating the importance of explanatory variables. We have incorporated the GPR model with the Integrated Gradients (IG) method to assess the contribution of each feature to the prediction. By evaluating the standard deviation of the posterior distribution, we show that the IG approach provides a detailed decomposition of the predictive uncertainty, attributing it to the uncertainty in individual feature contributions. This methodology not only highlights the variables that are most influential in the prediction but also provides insights into the reliability of the model by quantifying the uncertainty associated with each feature. Through this, we can obtain a deeper understanding of the model's behavior and foster trust in its predictions, especially in domains where interpretability is as crucial as accuracy."
"We aim to evaluate the feasibility of Raman spectroscopy for parathyroid gland (PG) identification during thyroidectomy. Using a novel side-viewing handheld Raman probe, a total of 324 Raman spectra of four tissue types (i.e., thyroid, lymph node, PG, and lipid) commonly encountered during thyroidectomy were rapidly (< 3 s) acquired from 80 tissue sites (thyroid [n = 10], lymph node [n = 10], PG [n = 40], lipid [n = 20]) of 10 euthanized Wistar rats. Two partial least-squares (PLS)-discriminant analysis (DA) detection models were developed, differentiating the lipid and nonlipid (i.e., thyroid, lymph node, and PG) tissues with an accuracy of 100%, and PG, lymph node, and thyroid could be detected with an accuracy of 98.4%, 93.9%, and 95.4% respectively. This work demonstrates the feasibility of Raman spectroscopy technique for PG identification and protection during thyroidectomy at the molecular level."
"The transition to menopause is associated with disappearance of menstrual cycle symptoms and emergence of vasomotor symptoms. Although menopausal women report a variety of additional symptoms, it remains unclear which emerge prior to menopause, which occur in predictable clusters, how clusters change across the menopausal transition, or if distinct phenotypes are present within each life stage. We present an analysis of symptoms in premenopausal to menopausal women using the MenoLife app, which includes 4789 individuals (23% premenopausal, 29% perimenopausal, 48% menopausal) and 147,501 symptom logs (19% premenopausal, 39% perimenopausal, 42% menopausal). Clusters generated from logs of 45 different symptoms were assessed for similarities across methods: hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA), K-Means clustering of principal components of symptom reports, and binomial network analysis. Participants were further evaluated based on menstrual cycle regularity or natural versus medically induced menopause. Menstrual cycle-associated symptoms (e.g., cramps, breast swelling), digestive, mood, and integumentary symptoms were characteristic of premenopause. Vasomotor symptoms, pain, mood, and cognitive symptoms were characteristic of menopause. Perimenopausal women exhibited both menstrual cycle-associated and vasomotor symptoms. Subpopulations across life stages presented with additional correlated mood and cognitive, integumentary, digestive, nervous, or sexual complaints. Symptoms also differed among women depending on the reported regularity of their menstrual cycles or the way in which they entered menopause. Notably, we identified a set of symptoms that were very common across life stages: fatigue, headache, anxiety, and brain fog. Finally, we identified a lack of predictive power of hot flashes for any symptom except night sweats. Together, premenopausal women exhibit menstrual cycle-associated symptoms and menopausal women reported vasomotor symptoms, while perimenopausal women report both. All report high rates of fatigue, headache, anxiety, and brain fog. Limiting focus of menopausal treatment to vasomotor symptoms, or to premenstrual syndrome in premenopausal women, neglects a large proportion of overall symptom burden. Future interventions targeting mood and cognition, digestion, and the integumentary system are needed across stages of female reproductive life."
"Surgical resection of magnetoencephalography (MEG) dipole clusters, reconstructed from interictal epileptiform discharges, is associated with favorable seizure outcomes. However, the relation of MEG cluster resection to the surgical resection volume is not known nor is it clear whether this association is direct and causal, or it may be mediated by the resection volume or other predictive factors. This study aims to clarify these open questions and assess the diagnostic accuracy of MEG in our center."
"Although leisure time physical activity (LTPA) is a beneficial factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality, relationships between occupational physical activity (OPA) and CVD mortality are inconclusive. We aimed to examine prospective associations of OPA with CVD mortality using a large representative sample of adult workers in the United States (US), and explore how socioeconomic status (SES) may influence these associations."
"Both term and preterm infants are susceptible to pathological jaundice, a frequent condition that can cause long-lasting neurological damage. A novel treatment for indirect pathological hyperbilirubinemia is bilisphere phototherapy, which lowers total serum bilirubin just as well as exchange transfusions. A quasi-experimental research design was utilized in the current study. This study was conducted in Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at Benha Specialized Pediatric Hospital. A convenient sample of all available nurses (60) working in the previously mentioned setting. A purposive sample of neonates (90) with pathological jaundice which would be divided into control and study groups. Three tools were used: Tool I: A structured interview questionnaire sheet, Tool II: observational checklist for caring neonates with pathological jaundice, and Tool III: neonatal outcomes assessment sheet. There was a positive correlation between nurses' total performance regarding pathological jaundice and bilisphere phototherapy at pre-/post-education program implementation. Additionally, there were a positive correlation between neonates' outcomes in the study group and nurses' total performance post-program implementation.Conclusion the education program regarding pathological jaundice was effective in improving nurses' performance and neonates' bilirubin-induced neurological dysfunction post compared to pre-education program implementation. What is Known: • Pathological jaundice had directly effect on neurological status in neonates as aresults of accumulated bilirubin in basal gangelia in brain and bilirubin induced neurological dysfunction score considered important tool to indicate acute bilirubin encephalopathy.

So, improve nurses performance lead to improve neonate outcomes. • Bilisphere phototherapy is an important device which had positive outcomes in pediatrics which improve neonates' health status, but its effect depends on provided effective nursing practice during therapy. • Pathological jaundice management with bilisphere phototherapy and bilirubin induced neurological dysfunction score working together to provide optimal care for neonates, which bilisphere phototherapy decrease bilirubin level and BIND score assess neurological status and detect any abnormalites during therapy."
"Raising cigarette prices, increasing graphic health warning label (HWL) coverage and requiring plain packaging could reduce cigarette smoking in Vietnam. This discrete choice experiment estimates the potential impact of these policies on smoking behaviour."
"The pyroptosis of renal tubular epithelial cells leads to tubular loss and inflammation and then promotes renal fibrosis. The transcription factor Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) can bidirectionally regulate the transcription of target genes. Our previous study revealed that sustained elevation of KLF4 is responsible for the transition of acute kidney injury (AKI) into chronic kidney disease (CKD) and renal fibrosis. In this study, we explored the upstream mechanisms of renal tubular epithelial cell pyroptosis from the perspective of posttranslational regulation and focused on the transcription factor KLF4. Mice were subjected to unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) surgery and euthanized on D7 or D14 for renal tissue harvesting. We showed that the pyroptosis of renal tubular epithelial cells mediated by both the Caspase-1/GSDMD and Caspase-3/GSDME pathways was time-dependently increased in UUO mouse kidneys. Furthermore, we found that the expression of the transcription factor KLF4 was also upregulated in a time-dependent manner in UUO mouse kidneys. Tubular epithelial cell-specific Klf4 knockout alleviated UUO-induced pyroptosis and renal fibrosis. In Ang II-treated mouse renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (MTECs), we demonstrated that KLF4 bound to the promoter regions of Caspase-3 and Caspase-1 and directly increased their transcription. In addition, we found that ubiquitin-specific protease 11 (USP11) was increased in UUO mouse kidneys. USP11 deubiquitinated KLF4. Knockout of Usp11 or pretreatment with the USP11 inhibitor mitoxantrone (3 mg/kg, i.p., twice a week for two weeks before UUO surgery) significantly alleviated the increases in KLF4 expression, pyroptosis and renal fibrosis. These results demonstrated that the increased expression of USP11 in renal tubular cells prevents the ubiquitin degradation of KLF4 and that elevated KLF4 promotes inflammation and renal fibrosis by initiating tubular cell pyroptosis."
"Billions of dollars have been spent implementing regulations to reduce traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) from exhaust pipe emissions. However, few health studies have evaluated the change in TRAP emissions and associations with infant health outcomes. We hypothesize that the magnitude of association between vehicle exposure measures and adverse birth outcomes has decreased over time, parallelling regulatory improvements in exhaust pipe emissions."
"One of the guiding principles of the sustainable use of herbicides is their targeted action exclusively against weeds, consisting of blocking photosynthesis and synthesis of amino acids and growth regulators. Herbicides are major elements of plant production, indispensable to the functioning of modern agriculture. Nevertheless, their influence on all elements of the natural environment needs to be continuously controlled. This review article summarizes research addressing the effects of herbicides on the natural environment and the changes they trigger therein. Herbicides, applied to protect crops against weed infestation, are usually mixtures of various active substances; hence, it is generally difficult to analyze their impact on the environment and organisms. Nonetheless, an attempt was made in this review to discuss the effects of selected herbicides on individual elements of the natural environment (water, soil, and air) and organisms (humans, animals, plants, and microorganisms). In addition, the article presents examples of the biodegradation of selected herbicides and mechanisms of their degradation by bacteria and fungi. Based on this information, it can be concluded that the uncontrolled use of herbicides has led to adverse effects on non-target organisms, as documented in the scientific literature. However, further research on the environmental effects of these chemicals is needed address the missing knowledge on this subject."
"This comment seeks to extend the authors' argument by considering how perceived fitness interdependence is generated in different settings. Based primarily on research from political science, it argues that strategic agents may seek to design myths that emphasize not only the longevity of their coalitions, but also internal features such as material and status equality and institutional impartiality."
"Variants of SARS-CoV-2 have continued to emerge across the world and cause hundreds of deaths each week. Due to the limited efficacy of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and resistance to current therapies, additional anti-viral therapeutics with pan-coronavirus activity are of high interest. Here, we screen 2.8 billion compounds from a DNA-encoded chemical library and identify small molecules that are non-covalent inhibitors targeting the conserved 3CL protease of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses. We perform structure-based optimization, leading to the creation of a series of potent, non-covalent SARS-CoV-2 3CL protease inhibitors, for coronavirus infections. To characterize their binding mechanism to the 3CL protease, we determine 16 co-crystal structures and find that optimized inhibitors specifically interact with both protomers of the native homodimer of 3CL protease. Since 3CL protease is catalytically competent only in the dimeric state, these data provide insight into the design of drug-like inhibitors targeting the native homodimer state. With a binding mode different from the covalent 3CL inhibitor nirmatrelvir, the protease inhibitor in the COVID drug Paxlovid, these compounds may overcome resistance reported for nirmatrelvir and complement its clinical utility."
"Glucocorticoids (GCs) are widely used as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), leading to high cumulative doses in long-term treated patients. The impact of a high cumulative GC dose on the systemic inflammatory response in RA remains poorly understood."
"Son of sevenless homolog 1 (SOS1) is an essential guanine nucleotide exchange factor for RAS that also plays a critical role in the activation of the small GTPase RAC mediated by BCR-ABL in leukemogenesis. Despite this, small-molecule inhibitors targeting SOS1 have shown limited efficacy in clinical trials for KRAS-mutant cancers, and their potential as a therapeutic approach for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) remains largely unexplored. In this study, we developed a potent SOS1 proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) SIAIS562055, which was designed by connecting a CRBN ligand to an analog of the SOS1 inhibitor BI-3406. SIAIS562055 exhibited sustained degradation of SOS1 and inhibition of downstream ERK pathways, resulting in superior antiproliferative activity compared with small-molecule inhibitors. SIAIS562055 also potentiated the activity of both KRAS inhibitors in KRAS-mutant cancers and ABL inhibitors in BCR-ABL-positive CML. In KRAS-mutant xenografts, SIAIS562055 displayed promising antitumor potency as a monotherapy and enhanced ERK inhibition and tumor regression when combined with KRAS inhibitors, overcoming acquired resistance. In CML cells, SIAIS562055 promoted the active uptake of BCR-ABL inhibitors by upregulating the carnitine/organic cation transporter SLC22A4. SIAIS562055 and BCR-ABL inhibitors synergistically enhanced inhibition of ABL phosphorylation and downstream signaling, demonstrating robust antitumor activities in both mouse xenografts and primary samples from patients with CML. In summary, this study suggests that PROTAC-mediated SOS1 degradation represents an effective therapeutic strategy for treating not only KRAS-mutant cancers but also BCR-ABL-harboring leukemia. Significance: The PROTAC SIAIS562055 sustainably degrades SOS1 and inhibits downstream ERK signaling, showing strong antiproliferative activity and synergistic effects with KRAS inhibitors in KRAS-mutant cancers and BCR-ABL inhibitors in chronic myeloid leukemia."

"Genomic, epigenomic and transcriptomic alterations are hallmarks of cancer cells, and are closely connected. Especially, epigenetic regulation plays a critical role in tumorigenesis and progression. The growing single-cell epigenome data in cancer research provide new opportunities for data mining from a more comprehensive perspective. However, there is still a lack of databases designed for interactively exploring the single-cell multi-omics data of human pan-cancer, especially for the single-cell epigenome data. To fill in the gap, we developed scCancerExplorer, a comprehensive and user-friendly database to facilitate the exploration of the single-cell genome, epigenome (chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation), and transcriptome data of 50 cancer types. Five major modules were provided to explore those data interactively, including 'Integrated multi-omics analysis', 'Single-cell transcriptome', 'Single-cell epigenome', 'Single-cell genome' and 'TCGA analysis'. By simple clicking, users can easily investigate gene expression features, chromatin accessibility patterns, transcription factor activities, DNA methylation states, copy number variations and TCGA survival analysis results. Taken together, scCancerExplorer is distinguished from previous databases with rich and interactive functions for exploring the single-cell multi-omics data of human pan-cancer. It bridges the gap between single-cell multi-omics data and the end-users, and will facilitate progress in the field of cancer research. scCancerExplorer is freely accessible via https://bianlab.cn/scCancerExplorer."

"Invasive breast cancer diagnosis and treatment planning require an accurate assessment of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression levels. While immunohistochemical techniques (IHC) are the gold standard for HER2 evaluation, their implementation can be resource-intensive and costly. To reduce these obstacles and expedite the procedure, we present an efficient deep-learning model that generates high-quality IHC-stained images directly from Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained images. We propose a new IHC-GAN that enhances the Pix2PixHD model into a dual generator module, improving its performance and simplifying its structure. Furthermore, to strengthen feature extraction for HE-stained image classification, we integrate MobileNetV3 as the backbone network. The extracted features are then merged with those generated by the generator to improve overall performance. Moreover, the decoder's performance is enhanced by providing the related features from the classified labels by incorporating the adaptive instance normalization technique. The proposed IHC-GAN was trained and validated on a comprehensive dataset comprising 4,870 registered image pairs, encompassing a spectrum of HER2 expression levels. Our findings demonstrate promising results in translating H&E images to IHC-equivalent representations, offering a potential solution to reduce the costs associated with traditional HER2 assessment methods. We extensively validate our model and the current dataset. We compare it with state-of-the-art techniques, achieving high performance using different evaluation metrics, showing 0.0927 FID, 22.87 PSNR, and 0.3735 SSIM. The proposed approach exhibits significant enhancements over current GAN models, including an 88% reduction in Frechet Inception Distance (FID), a 4% enhancement in Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS), a 10% increase in Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), and a 45% reduction in Mean Squared Error (MSE). This advancement holds significant potential for enhancing efficiency, reducing manpower requirements, and facilitating timely treatment decisions in breast cancer care."
"Developing a pragmatic pattern for timely learning crop growth information is significant in promoting high-quality agricultural production. Herein, an electrochemical sensing mode is designed for in-situ monitoring plant hormone (indole acetic acid as a typical example). To simplify the available electrochemical procedure with separate division of sensing interface decoration and liquid electrolyte addition, a bi-functional electrolyte, with superior quality of electron conduction and ion mass transfer, is built by exploiting the excellent conductivity of carbon-based nanostructures and the dynamic redox cycle between phenols and metal ions, endowed with the integration between conductive medium and semi-solid electrolyte. Since the one-step decoration of gel electrolyte, the sensing interface greatly simplifies the testing procedure without adding liquid electrolytes. With fascinating merits of integrative carbon-based gel electrolyte, electrochemical sensing toward in-situ tracing indole acetic acid with attractive simplicity and practicability, fulfilling the goal of acquiring information on plant growth status in timely manner."
"Earth's rotation around its axis has pressured its inhabitants to adapt to 24 h cycles of day and night. Humans adapted their own circadian rhythms to the Earth's rhythms with a light-aligned awake-sleep cycle. As a consequence, metabolism undergoes drastic changes throughout the circadian cycle and needs plasticity to cope with opposing conditions in the day (when there is an increase in energy demands and food availability), and during the night (when prolonged fasting couples with cyclic changes in the energy demands across the sleep stages). In the last century, human behavior changed dramatically with a disregard for the natural circadian cycles. This misalignment in sleep and eating schedules strongly modulates the metabolism and energy homeostasis, favoring the development of obesity, metabolic syndrome, and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). This review summarizes the effects of circadian disruption, with a particular focus on the feeding and sleep cycles in the development of MASLD and hepatocellular carcinoma."
"Childhood adversities and traumata (CAT) increase the risk for various mental disorders, including the clinical high-risk of psychosis (CHR-P) state and its main comorbidities, i.e., depression, and social phobia.

"Although lifestyle factors have been linked to chronic diseases among adults, their association with diagnosed individual and comorbid cardiometabolic (CMD) and pulmonary disease (PD) is not fully known. This study aimed to examine the associations between lifestyle factors and individual and comorbid CMD and PD among U.S. adults."
"In data-based modeling, correlations between explanatory variables often lead to the formation of distinct gene blocks. This study focuses on identifying influential gene blocks and key variables within these blocks, with a particular application in mind: genotype-phenotype mapping in Saccharomyces. To overcome the challenges of a limited sample size, we use partial least squares (PLS). These gene blocks, which consist of combinations of genes, play a critical role in explaining phenotypic variations. Using partial least squares with multiple blocks, we propose a novel approach, weighted block importance on projection in partial least squares (BwIP-mbPLS), to identify influential gene blocks. Variable importance on projection is used to select significant genes within these blocks. Our study models copper chloride at 0.375mM and melibiose at 2% efficiency and rate in Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast. Analysis based on silhouette index and total distance within clusters using k-means shows the classification of 5629 genes into 18 gene blocks. Remarkably, BwIP-mbPLS identifies 4 gene blocks on average and significantly improves the prediction of efficiency-based phenotypes. In contrast, traditional block importance in partial least squares projection identifies 6 gene blocks on average and shows comparable or better performance than BIP-mbPLS for rate-based phenotypes. Remarkably, most gene blocks contain fewer than 10 influential genes. Both proposed variants consistently outperform conventional approaches such as partial least squares and multi-block partial least squares in predicting phenotypes. These results highlight the potential of our methods for advancing data-based modeling and genotype-phenotype mapping."
The purpose of the study is to ascertain endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) suitability in relation to stent-graft-specific instructions for use (IFU) in patients with a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (RAAA).
"Creating assistive technology for older adults requires a deep understanding of their needs, values and preferences. Human-centred approaches can be used to engage older adults in technology research to help ensure that end solutions are ethically aligned, relevant and responsive to their priorities. However, the value of cocreation is not universally acknowledged. Older adults continue to receive negative stereotyping and are limited from engaging in research. With the growing demand for assistive technologies that effectively meet end-user needs, it is important that we deepen our knowledge about engagement and promote inclusion of older adults in technology research. To learn more, we asked members of a research advisory group for assistive technologies, specifically social robots, to tell us about their experiences of engagement and the impact it has on their lives, to speculate whether participation in research may promote human flourishing. Our findings reveal that engagement is more than knowledge exchange: it is a multifaceted, dynamic process that creates rich and meaningful experiences for older adults. Experiences of engagement dovetail with interpretations of flourishing and improved well-being, which include outcomes related to empowerment, autonomy and connectedness to self and others. Older adults also report finding purpose and satisfaction in knowing that their contributions to research may be used to develop technologies that can benefit others. This work amplifies the voice of lived experiences to deepen our understanding of the impacts of participation and prompts us to reimagine how older adults may be meaningfully engaged in technology research."
"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder marked by the degeneration of motor neurons and progressive muscle weakness. Heredity plays an important part in the pathogenesis of ALS. Recently, with the emergence of the oligogenic pathogenic mechanism in ALS and the ongoing discovery of new mutated genes and genomic variants, there is an emerging need for larger-scale and more comprehensive genetic screenings in higher resolution. In this study, we performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) on 34 familial ALS probands lacking the most common disease-causing mutations to explore the genetic landscape of Chinese ALS patients further. Among them, we identified a novel ARPP21 c.1231G > A (p.Glu411Lys) variant and two copy number variations (CNVs) affecting the PFN1 and RBCK1 genes in a patient with ALS-frontotemporal dementia (FTD). This marks the first report of an ARPP21 variant in Chinese ALS-FTD patients, providing fresh evidence for the association between ARPP21 and ALS. Our findings also underscore the potential role of CNVs in ALS-FTD, suggesting that the cumulative effect of multiple rare variants may contribute to disease onset. Furthermore, compared to the averages in our cohort and the reported Chinese ALS population, this patient displayed a shorter survival time and more rapid disease progression, suggesting the possibility of an oligogenic mechanism in disease pathogenesis. Further research will contribute to a deeper understanding of the rare mutations and their interactions, thus advancing our understanding of the genetic mechanisms underlying ALS and ALS-FTD."
"In 2022, a community-academic collaborative team published 5 key recommendations for developing a national action plan to advance the sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) of women living with HIV in Canada. In 2023, a national gathering was convened to strategize implementation of the recommendations across policy, practice, and research settings. Discussions highlighted that meaningful engagement of women living with HIV (recommendation 1) is foundational to implementing the other recommendations. Meaningful engagement requires SRHR stakeholders to: actively dismantle power differentials; commit to engagement as an ongoing process; learn about regionally specific epidemiology and sociostructural forces that create and sustain vulnerability for HIV among women; invest in creating supportive infrastructure; and integrate Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion principles to call diverse groups into the conversation. This Canadian initiative demonstrates how global guidelines can be transformed into nationally tailored action plans to advance the SRHR of women living with HIV, grounded in meaningful engagement."
"Active surveillance in men with less aggressive prostate cancer is inconsistently used despite clinical guidelines. Renumeration generally favors treatment over conservative management and may contribute to the variable adoption of active surveillance, which suggests that value-based payment incentives may promote guideline-concordant care."
"Peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) is a novel technique within the field of third space endoscopy. The overarching principal is creation of a mucosal incision, careful dissection of the submucosal space using an electrosurgical knife to reach the muscularis (ie, tunneling), performing a controlled myotomy, and finally, closure of the mucosal incision. POEM was first developed for the management of achalasia, and now a decade of evidence shows the procedure is safe, effective, and highly reproducible. Since then, the indications for POEM have expanded to a range of benign upper gastrointestinal (GI) pathologies including cricopharyngeal bar (C-POEM), Zenker's diverticulum (Z-POEM), esophageal diverticula (D-POEM), and gastroparesis (G-POEM). POEM offers the benefit of a minimally invasive alternative to surgical intervention with high clinical success and low rate of adverse events. As the field expands, there is need for more high-quality prospective evidence for the use of POEM within the upper GI tract akin to the ground-breaking work that has been achieved in achalasia. Within this review, we discuss the 5 main indications for POEM, the technical aspects of each corresponding procedure, and analyze the current evidence supporting their use in clinical practice."
Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) have increased insulin resistance (IR). The triglyceride glucose (TyG) index is a marker of IR and is associated with the prognosis of patients on maintenance hemodialysis (MHD). The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between the TyG index and the risk of death in patients on MHD.
"In developed countries age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and glaucoma are the most common diseases of old age that cause irreversible blindness. Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent cause of dementia among older adults, is often associated with AMD and glaucoma. Features of AD include extracellular accumulation of β-amyloid (Aβ) and intracellular deposits of hyperphosphorylated forms of tau-protein. In addition, neuroinflammation and impaired iron metabolism in the brain are involved in the pathogenesis of AD, which ultimately leads to progressive neuronal death and dementia. It was found that the retina of patients with AMD also accumulates Aβ and iron, as well as Aβ and p-tau in retinal ganglion cells affected by glaucoma, and concomitant inflammation aggravates the pathological process. Patients with AD experience a marked decline in visual function which is thought to develop before the decline in cognitive function. Some are caused by degeneration of the visual cortex, others by retinal ganglion cell loss or retinal degeneration associated with AMD."

"Predicting incident duration and understanding incident types are essential in traffic management for resource optimization and disruption minimization. Precise predictions enable the efficient deployment of response teams and strategic traffic rerouting, leading to reduced congestion and enhanced safety. Furthermore, an in-depth understanding of incident types helps in implementing preventive measures and formulating strategies to alleviate their influence on road networks. In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework for accurately predicting incident duration, with a particular emphasis on the critical role of street conditions and locations as major incident triggers. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, we performed an in-depth case study using a dataset from San Francisco. We introduce a novel feature called ""Risk"" derived from the Risk Priority Number (RPN) concept, highlighting the significance of the incident location in both incident occurrence and prediction. Additionally, we propose a refined incident categorization through fuzzy clustering methods, delineating a unique policy for identifying boundary clusters that necessitate further modeling and testing under varying scenarios. Each cluster undergoes a Multiple Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) process to gain deeper insights into their distinctions and provide valuable managerial insights. Finally, we employ both traditional Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models to perform classification and regression tasks. Specifically, incidents residing in boundary clusters are predicted utilizing the scenarios outlined in this study. Through a rigorous analysis of feature importance using top-performing predictive models, we identify the ""Risk"" factor as a critical determinant of incident duration. Moreover, variables such as distance, humidity, and hour demonstrate significant influence, further enhancing the predictive power of the proposed model."
"Accurate segmentation of gliomas is crucial for diagnosis, treatment planning, and evaluating therapeutic efficacy. Physicians typically analyze and delineate tumor regions in brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images based on personal experience, which is often time-consuming and subject to individual interpretation. Despite advancements in deep learning technology for image segmentation, current techniques still face challenges in clearly defining tumor boundary contours and enhancing segmentation accuracy."

"The rapid aging of the population has led to an increase in the number of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) cases among the older population. However, the characteristics of these cases remain unclear. In this study, we aimed to identify the problem by analyzing the clinical characteristics of patients with cSCC aged 90 years and over. In this retrospective study, we analyzed the characteristics of patients aged >90 years with regard to gender, risk factors for cSCC, and disease course, using data from 316 patients with cSCC who underwent surgery at the Kagoshima Medical Centre between October 2014 and September 2022. Patients were separated into two groups based on age: those aged ≥90 years (104 patients) and those aged <90 years (212 patients). Regarding the National Comprehensive Cancer Network risk classification, there was no difference between groups. Univariate, multivariate, and Cox analyses of relapse-free survival of patients in both groups indicated that the recurrence risk was significantly high among those aged ≥90 years. Patients aged ≥90 years were at higher risk for recurrence, suggesting a need for closer follow-up than that for patients aged <90 years."
"Hemoptysis, the expectoration of blood from the lower respiratory tract, varies in severity and necessitates effective management to mitigate morbidity. Traditional treatments include bronchial artery embolization and pharmacological approaches. Tranexamic acid (TXA), an antifibrinolytic agent known for its efficacy in reducing bleeding during surgery and trauma, is being explored for its efficacy in treating Hemoptysis via both intravenous and inhalational routes. Inhalational administration has garnered interest because of its targeted action and minimal systemic effects. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of inhalational TXA in nonmassive hemoptysis."

This study aims to bridge this gap by comparing reimbursement and retail data for primary care to understand variations and assess the accuracy of current surveillance methods."
"Pyrogens cause shock symptoms when released into the bloodstream. They are classified into two main categories: endotoxins (lipopolysaccharides [LPS]) and non-endotoxin pyrogens. The monocyte activation test (MAT) is an in vitro assay to detect pyrogens in human monocytes. Cells were incubated in the culture medium, and the cellular response, specifically the production of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 in the culture supernatant, was analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Technical improvements, such as cell acquisition and culture media selection, will be beneficial for the popularization of MAT. The cell freshness was strictly controlled to achieve high MAT sensitivity. However, it is necessary to investigate the usability of older and stored blood samples in the MAT. This study evaluated the effect of cell freshness on MAT using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from 2- and 5-d-old donated whole blood samples. To mitigate the influence of serum in the culture medium, a serum-free MAT was developed using the LPS-binding protein (LBP) as an enhancer for LPS detection. PBMCs were incubated with a two-fold dilution series of LPS at 0.001-4.096 endotoxin units/mL (EU/mL). Interleukin-6 levels in the culture supernatant were quantified by ELISA in the presence and absence of LBP. In the presence of LBP, the limit of detection (LOD) for LPS was 0.001-0.008 EU/mL. However, in the absence of LBP, the LOD was 0.512 EU/mL. Peripheral PBMCs were 38.6 times more sensitive in the presence of LBP than in its absence. When utilizing the developed serum-free MAT with LBP, 5-d-old PBMCs showed LODs of 0.016-0.064 EU/mL, indicating a 3.1-fold increase in sensitivity compared with 5- to 2-d-old PBMCs. These results suggest that the sensitivity of PBMCs decreased gradually rather than sharply. The study concluded that 2-d-old PBMCs were sufficiently fresh and could be used as serum-free MAT."
"Examination of the host-associated microbiome in wildlife can provide critical insights into the eco-evolutionary factors driving species diversification and response to disease. This is particularly relevant for isolated populations lacking genomic variation, a phenomenon that is increasingly common as human activities create habitat 'islands' for wildlife. Here, we characterised the gut and otic microbial communities of one such species: Channel Island foxes (Urocyon littoralis). The gut microbiome provided evidence of phylosymbiosis by reflecting the host phylogeny, geographic proximity, history of island colonisation and contemporary ecological differences, whereas the otic microbiome primarily reflected geography and disease. Santa Catalina Island foxes are uniquely predisposed to ceruminous gland tumours following infection with Otodectes cynotis ear mites, while San Clemente and San Nicolas Island foxes exhibit ear mite infections without evidence of tumours. Comparative analyses of otic microbiomes revealed that mite-infected Santa Catalina and San Clemente Island foxes exhibited reduced bacterial diversity, skewed abundance towards the opportunistic pathogen Staphylococcus pseudintermedius and disrupted microbial community networks. However, Santa Catalina Island foxes uniquely harboured Fusobacterium and Prevotella bacteria as potential keystone taxa. These bacteria have previously been associated with colorectal cancer and may predispose Santa Catalina Island foxes to an elevated cancer risk. In contrast, mite-infected San Nicolas Island foxes maintained high bacterial diversity and robust microbial community networks, suggesting that they harbour more resilient microbiomes. Considered together, our results highlight the diverse eco-evolutionary factors influencing commensal microbial communities and their hosts and underscore how the microbiome can contribute to disease outcomes."
"Genome editing using CRISPR-Cas systems is a promising avenue for the treatment of genetic diseases. However, cellular and humoral immunogenicity of genome editing tools, which originate from bacteria, complicates their clinical use. Here we report reduced immunogenicity (Red)(i)-variants of two clinically relevant nucleases, SaCas9 and AsCas12a. Through MHC-associated peptide proteomics (MAPPs) analysis, we identify putative immunogenic epitopes on each nuclease. Using computational modeling, we rationally design these proteins to evade the immune response. SaCas9 and AsCas12a Redi variants are substantially less recognized by adaptive immune components, including reduced binding affinity to MHC molecules and attenuated generation of cytotoxic T cell responses, yet maintain wild-type levels of activity and specificity. In vivo editing of PCSK9 with SaCas9.Redi.1 is comparable in efficiency to wild-type SaCas9, but significantly reduces undesired immune responses. This demonstrates the utility of this approach in engineering proteins to evade immune detection."
"Abnormally expressed circular RNAs (circRNAs) are associated with many diseases and have important biological effects on the regulation of gene expression. However, the circRNA expression profile in incomplete radiofrequency ablation (RFA)-treated liver cancer (LC) patients has not been characterized. This study investigated the potential biological effects of differentially expressed (DE) circRNAs in an incomplete RFA-treated transplantation tumor model of human LC."
"Dementia is a public health concern in the aging population with an estimated 55 million people impacted globally. Public health initiatives that focus on minimizing dementia risk factors may support efforts to reduce the incidence of dementia in at-risk populations. Exposomics considers both modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors for disease, including genetic changes with age and lifetime exposures to environmental, social, and behavioral risk factors. Dementia precursors may remain undetected for up to 20 years. An understanding and application of the dementia exposome may promote healthy brain interventions, screening, and risk mitigation. The proposed dementia public health exposome (DPHE) provides a framework for understanding and addressing the complex interactions between genetics, health behavior, and environment (natural, built, and social) linked to modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors for dementia. The DPHE may be used to inform public health strategies and advancements in healthy brain initiatives."

"Over several years, the evaluation of polytomous attributes in small-sample settings has posed a challenge to the application of cognitive diagnosis models. To enhance classification precision, the support vector machine (SVM) was introduced for estimating polytomous attribution, given its proven feasibility for dichotomous cases. Two simulation studies and an empirical study assessed the impact of various factors on SVM classification performance, including training sample size, attribute structures, guessing/slipping levels, number of attributes, number of attribute levels, and number of items. The results indicated that SVM outperformed the pG-DINA model in classification accuracy under dependent attribute structures and small sample sizes. SVM performance improved with an increased number of items but declined with higher guessing/slipping levels, more attributes, and more attribute levels. Empirical data further validated the application and advantages of SVMs."
"Given the importance of GP care to the public's health, it is important that we understand how patterns of service use change as levels of investment change.

"An individual-based stochastic model was developed to simulate the spread of an infectious disease in an SEIR-type system on all possible contact-networks of size between six and nine nodes. We assessed systematically the impact of the change in the population contact structure on four important epidemiological quantities: i) the epidemic duration, ii) the maximum number of infected individuals at a time point during the epidemic, iii) the time at which the maximum number of infected individuals is reached, and iv) the total number of individuals that have been infected during the epidemic. We considered the potential relationship of these quantities as the network changes and identified the networks that maximise and minimise each of these in the case of an epidemic outbreak. Chain-like networks minimise the peak and final epidemic size, but the disease spread is slow on such contact structures which leads to the maximisation of the epidemic duration. Star-like networks maximise the time to the peak whereas highly connected networks lead to faster disease transmission, and higher peak and final epidemic size. While the pairwise relationship of most of the quantities becomes almost linear, or inverse linear, as the network connectivity increases and approaches the complete network, the relationships are non-linear towards networks of low connectivity. In particular, the pairwise relationship between the final epidemic size and other quantities is changed in a 'bow-shaped' manner. There is a strong inverse linear relationship between epidemic duration and peak epidemic size with increasing network connectivity. The (inverse) linear relationships between quantities are more pronounced in cases of high disease transmissibility. All the values of the quantities change in a non-linear way with the increase of network connectivity and are characterised by high variability between networks of the same degree. The variability decreases as network connectivity increases."

"The abscisic acid (ABA) signaling pathway is essential for plant response to abiotic stresses and can be modulated positively or negatively by MAPKKK proteins. This study focuses on the functional characterization of CaMEKK17, a MAPKKK previously recognized for its rapid induction under drought stress. Functional analyses demonstrated that CaMEKK17 is an active serine/threonine kinase with a conserved catalytic domain that is crucial for its kinase activity. CaMEKK17 silencing in pepper plants resulted in reduced drought tolerance, characterized by increased transpirational water loss and impaired ABA-mediated stomatal closure. Conversely, CaMEKK17 overexpression in Arabidopsis increased kinase activity, enhancing ABA sensitivity and drought tolerance. Further investigation revealed that CaMEKK17 interacts with pepper group A type 2C protein phosphatases (PP2Cs), particularly CaAITP1 and CaAIPP1, which inhibit its kinase activity. Protein-protein interactions mediated inhibition by CaAITP1, whereas CaAIPP1 relied on its phosphatase activity. Double gene silencing of CaMEKK17 and CaAITP1 demonstrated that CaMEKK17 functions downstream of CaAITP1 in ABA-mediated drought tolerance. Taken together, our findings suggest that CaMEKK17 positively modulates drought tolerance in pepper plants but may be inhibited by PP2Cs."
"The age estimation of skeletal remains still represents a central issue not only for the reconstruction of the so-called ""biological profile,"" but mostly for the palaeodemographic investigation. This research aims at verifying the feasibility of the adult age estimation method developed on living people by Pinchi et al. (2015 and 2018), for estimating the age at the death of 37 subjects from ancient populations found in two different Italian necropolis of archaeological interest (Mont'e Prama and Florence, X-IX century B.C and V-VI century A.D respectively). The method is conservative and based on a geometrical approximation of dental volumes of the upper central left incisors on CBCT scans. The statistical distribution of the age and errors followed the Bayesian approach proposed by Sironi et el. (2018) applying the ""a priori"" values according to the estimates/classification obtained with anthropological methods (morphological). Results show higher accuracy for Mont'e Prama remains than for the Florentine sample due to the different characteristics of the two ancient populations (estimates varying from 18.4 up to 28.7 years with a maximum error of 6,14 years for Mont'e Prama, and from 15.88 up to 43.37 years with a minimum error of 1 year up to a maximum error of 7,85 years for Florence). The method proposed and validated on modern living people can represent a reliable tool for estimating the age of ancient human remains with a significant palaeodemographic value for archaeologists/anthropologists. Mont'e Prama sample could be defined as a homogenous group of males aged around 20-30 years, probably warriors, soldiers, or athletes; Florentine sample as an inhomogeneous group of males and females from different families buried all together in a small area out of the city due to the probable occurrence of a special healthy emergency in the city."
"Autoimmune rheumatic diseases (ARDs), such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and systemic sclerosis, involve dysregulated immune responses causing chronic inflammation and tissue damage. Despite advancements in clinical management, many patients do not respond to current treatments, which often show limited efficacy due to the persistence of autoreactive B cells. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy, which has shown success in oncology for B cell malignancies, targets specific antigens and involves the adoptive transfer of genetically engineered T cells. CD19 CAR-T cells, in particular, have shown promise in depleting circulating B cells and achieving clinical remission. This review discusses the potential of CD19 CAR-T cells in ARDs, highlighting clinical achievements and addressing key considerations such as optimal target cell populations, CAR construct design, acceptable toxicities, and the potential for lasting immune reset, crucial for the safe and effective adoption of CAR-T cell therapy in autoimmune treatments."
"Venous thoracic outlet syndrome (VTOS), a compression syndrome of the subclavian vein at the costoclavicular junction, is commonly treated with first rib resection. This invasive procedure carries a risk of serious complications. The purpose of this single-center cross-sectional study was to evaluate the long-term outcome of non-bony decompression by resection of the subclavius muscle and tendon and to provide a detailed description of the procedure."
"Muscle atrophy and skeletal muscle fibrosis are significant pathological manifestations of primary sarcopenia. The regulation of C2C12 myoblast and skeletal muscle fibroblast apoptosis is associated with these pathological changes. Previous studies have indicated that irisin, the cleaved form of fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 (FNDC5), can alleviate primary sarcopenia. However, the mechanisms of the effect of irisin in age-related apoptosis remain unknown. Our present research aimed to explore the effect of irisin and the underlying mechanism of D-galactose (D-gal)-induced apoptosis in skeletal muscle fibroblasts and C2C12 myoblasts. We found the opposite effects of D-gal on C2C12 myoblasts and fibroblasts. We also found that irisin suppressed C2C12 cell apoptosis and promoted fibroblast apoptosis. Mechanistically, irisin altered D-gal-induced apoptosis by increasing caveolin-1 expression. Taken together, these findings further demonstrated that irisin is a potential agent that can treat aged-relative muscle atrophy and fibrosis."
The MOVIE phase I/II trial (NCT03518606) evaluated the safety and antitumor activity of durvalumab and tremelimumab combined with metronomic oral vinorelbine in patients with advanced tumors. We present the results of the recurrent advanced cervical cancer cohort.
"We aimed to explore the role of circular RNA 0043256 (circ_0043256) in gastric cancer (GC) and its underlying mechanisms. The impact of circ_0043256 silencing on the proliferation, migration, apoptosis, and aerobic glycolysis of MKN-45 and AGS cells induced by CoCl2 was assessed through the utilization of CCK-8, wound healing assay, flow cytometry, and metabolic analysis. The interaction between circ_0043256 and miR-593-5p, as well as the involvement of the miR-593-5p/RRM2 axis in gastric cancer, were confirmed via luciferase assay, Western blot, and bioinformatics analysis. We found that circ_0043256 was up-regulated in GC tissues and CoCl2-treated MKN-45 and AGS cells. Silencing of circ_0043256 reversed CoCl2-induced proliferation, migration, and aerobic glycolysis in MKN-45 and AGS cells. Additionally, circ_0043256 silencing enhanced cell apoptosis and G2/M phase cell cycle arrest in response to CoCl2 treatment. Furthermore, the miR-593-5p/RRM2 axis was identified as a regulatory mechanism for circ_0043256 function in GC. Silencing of circ_0043256 and miR-593-5p mimic co-transfection significantly inhibited CoCl2-induced cellular responses in MKN-45 and AGS cells. A glycolysis inhibitor 2-DG further enhanced the inhibitory effect of circ_0043256 silencing on aerobic glycolysis of CoCl2-induced MKN-45 and AGS cells. Additionally, the inhibition of circ_0043256 resulted in a reduction in tumor volume and the expression of proliferation marker proteins in nude mice. Moreover, the suppression of circ_0043256 led to an increase in miR-593-5p expression and a decrease in RRM2 expression, ultimately causing a decrease in glycolytic-related proteins associated with the glycolytic pathway. Targeting this axis may offer a novel therapeutic approach for treating GC."
"Fermented Chinese Artichoke, a traditional Chinese fermented vegetable, has a distinctive flavor profile shaped by its fermentation process. This study applied flavoromics, metagenomics, and untargeted metabolomics to comprehensively analyze flavor compounds, microbial communities, and metabolic transformations during fermentation. We identified 43 volatile organic compounds (VOCs), with Terpineol, 1-Hexanol, and Linalool as the predominant components. Metagenomic analysis highlighted Lactiplantibacillus plantarum, Priestia megaterium, and Pediococcus pentosaceus as the dominant species, while Lactiplantibacillus, Pediococcus, and Bacillus were key in flavor development. Untargeted metabolomics further revealed increases in organic acids, amino acids, and umami compounds, contributing to flavor enhancement. These findings offer valuable insights into flavor formation mechanisms in Fermented Chinese Artichoke and provide guidance for improving its industrial fermentation quality."
"Psychological reactions in response to disasters have been associated with increased mental health (MH) symptomatology, decreased quality of life (QOL), and post-traumatic stress (PTSD). This study provides a rare opportunity to examine post disaster MH longitudinally in a sample of adolescents."
"Gun-related violence is becoming increasingly more common in the United States, and ballistic injuries pose a challenge to the orthopaedic surgeon on trauma call. The guiding principles of trauma care are almost exclusively based on blunt trauma, and the management principles do not always translate. Ballistic long bone fractures, particularly of the lower extremity, can often be managed with similar principles, although the injury pattern can make restoration of anatomic alignment a challenge. Some data suggest that patients with ballistic arthrotomies can be safely treated with medical management and antibiotic therapy alone; however, gross contamination can be encountered, and this decision is at the surgeon's discretion. Retained ballistic fragments may result in intra-articular changes and elevated lead levels over time, warranting consideration for surgical excision. Ballistic injuries to the hand and wrist are often present with concomitant soft-tissue injury, including nerve and tendon injuries. Providing stable bony fixation while also facilitating early motion for rehabilitation is a difficult balance to reach. In addition, the management of ballistic nerve injuries is controversial, as many injuries are not simply neurapraxic, and either early exploration or evaluation with ultrasonographic imaging may help detect injuries for which repair or grafting can be considered. Last, ballistic trauma can have mental health implications for patients and families and even contribute to the burnout epidemic demonstrated in health care professionals."
"Fast and accurate identification of pathogenic microbes in patient samples is crucial for the timely treatment of acute infectious diseases such as sepsis. The fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique allows the rapid detection and identification of microbes based on their variation in genomic sequence without time-consuming culturing or sequencing. However, the recent explosion of microbial genomic data has made it challenging to design an appropriate set of probes for microbial mixtures. We developed a novel set of peptide nucleic acid (PNA)-based FISH probes with optimal target specificity by analyzing the variations in 16S ribosomal RNA sequence across all bacterial species. Owing to their superior penetration into bacteria and higher mismatch sensitivity, the PNA probes distinguished seven bacterial species commonly observed in bacteremia with 96-99.9% accuracy using our optimized FISH procedure. Detection based on Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between pairs of adjacent binding PNA probes eliminated crosstalk between species. Rapid sequential species identification was implemented, using chemically cleavable fluorophores, without compromising detection accuracy. Owing to their outstanding accuracy and enhanced speed, this set of techniques shows great potential for clinical use."
"The authors examined baseline physical functional (PF) impairment among cancer outpatients in the National Cancer Institute Cancer Moonshot study Northwestern University Improving the Management of Symptoms During and Following Cancer Treatment (NU IMPACT). They hypothesized that PF impairment, measured with the Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System-Physical Function (PROMIS-PF) survey, would (1) be common and more prevalent for patients receiving treatment compared with no treatment and (2) differ across tumor types, independent of cancer continuum phase."
"Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) are precursors to pancreatic cancer, but not all IPMNs progress to cancer. The objective of this study was to identify the germline genetic variants associated with IPMN clinical progression by conducting the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) and computing a polygenic hazard score (PHS) in 338 patients with IPMN."
"Sport-related ankle sprains (SASs) are prevalent in adolescents (ages 10-19), increasing the risk of developing posttraumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA). Although early ankle osteoarthritis (OA) is not well defined, OA eventually includes alterations in bone mineral density (BMD), structural changes, and soft tissue pathology. This study examined the impact of SAS sustained in adolescent sport on bone and soft tissue structural outcomes 3-15 years postinjury."
Air medical transport services play a significant role in emergency situations by providing timely transfers of critically ill patients to medical facilities. This study aimed to investigate the mission characteristics of helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS) and the associated time intervals in a geographically remote region of eastern Iran. We also compared the prehospital times of HEMS and ground transportation to determine whether dispatching a helicopter is time-efficient.
"Polymers play a critical role in the biomedical and sustainable materials fields, serving as key resources for both research and product development. While synthetic and natural polymers are both widely used, synthetic polymers have traditionally dominated due to their ability to meet the specific material requirements of most fiber fabrication methods. However, synthetic polymers are derived from non-renewable resources, and their production raises environmental and health concerns. Natural polymers, on the other hand, are derived from renewable biological sources and include a subset known as biopolymers, such as proteins and polysaccharides, which are produced by living organisms. These biopolymers are naturally abundant and offer benefits such as biodegradability and non-toxicity, making them especially suitable for biomedical and green applications. Recently, air jet spinning has emerged as a promising method for fabricating biopolymer fibers, valued for its simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and safety-advantages that stand out compared to the more conventional electrospinning process. This review examines the methods and mechanisms of air jet spinning, drawing on empirical studies and practical insights to highlight its advantages over traditional fiber production techniques. By assembling natural biopolymers into micro- and nanofibers, this novel fabrication method demonstrates strong potential for targeted applications, including tissue engineering, drug delivery, air filtration, food packaging, and biosensing, utilizing various protein and polysaccharide sources."
"The Annals of Surgical Oncology (ASO) launched a Social Media Committee in 2022 to strategically promote surgical science, boost journal impact, and raise awareness of cutting-edge research. This study investigated the impact of the ASO Social Media Committee on journal visibility, publication engagement, and article-level metrics."
"Various mature tissue-resident cells exhibit progenitor characteristics following injury. However, the existence of endogenous stem cells with multiple lineage potentials in the adult spinal cord remains a compelling area of research. In this study, we present a cross-species investigation that extends from development to injury. We used single-nucleus transcriptomic sequencing and genetic lineage tracing to characterize neural cells in the spinal cord. Our findings show that ciliated ependymal cells lose neural progenitor gene signatures and proliferation ability following the differentiation of NPCs within the ventricular zone. By combining single-nucleus transcriptome datasets from the rhesus macaque spinal cord injury (SCI) model with developmental human spinal cord datasets, we revealed that ciliated ependymal cells respond minimally to injury and cannot revert to a developmental progenitor state. Intriguingly, we observed astrocytes transdifferentiating into mature oligodendrocytes postinjury through lineage tracing experiments. Further analysis identifies an intermediate-state glial cell population expressing both astrocyte and oligodendrocyte feature genes in adult spinal cords. The transition ratio from astrocytes into oligodendrocytes increased after remodeling injury microenvironment by functional scaffolds. Overall, our results highlight the remarkable multilineage potential of astrocytes in the adult spinal cord."
"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder with various contributing factors. Shear wave elastography (SWE) is a contemporary noninvasive imaging technique that reports on the elasticity of tissues. This study aimed to evaluate ovarian stiffness in patients with PCOS using transvaginal SWE, and investigate the potential biological mechanisms underlying increased ovarian stiffness. Patients with PCOS and healthy controls underwent transvaginal 2D ultrasound and SWE to measure the number of follicles, ovarian volume, and ovarian elasticity. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify risk factors for PCOS. A rat model of PCOS was established to further investigate the biological basis of increased ovarian stiffness. Histological analysis, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, western blotting, transcriptomics, and proteomics were performed to assess alterations in fibrosis and basement membrane (BM) gene expression. The results demonstrated that patients with PCOS (n = 59) showed an increased number of follicles, ovarian volume, and SWE (mean and max) compared with controls (n = 56; P < 0.001). The number of follicles, ovarian volume, and SWE_mean were identified as independent risk factors for PCOS (P < 0.05). SWE_mean ≥ 12.5 kPa demonstrated an area under the curve of 0.816 for PCOS diagnosis and was positively correlated with AMH levels (r = 0.6776, P < 0.0001). In the rat model, increased ovarian stiffness was associated with significant fibrosis and altered expression of fibrosis-related markers. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses revealed that BM gene alterations were correlated with ovarian stiffness, which was further validated using PCOS patient data from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. In conclusion, SWE is a valuable technique for diagnosing PCOS by detecting increased ovarian stiffness, which may be associated with alterations in the expression of BMs, thereby mediating ovarian fibrosis."
The GOLD trial demonstrated that continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) managed with multiple daily insulin injections (MDI) improved not only glucose control but also overall well-being and treatment satisfaction. This analysis investigated which factors contributed to improved well-being and treatment satisfaction with CGM.
"Advance care planning can help to align the care provided with the values, goals and preferences of patients at the end of life. Therefore, readiness for advanced care planning is considered a prerequisite and predictor of the patient's willingness to participate in the end of life conversation. The present study was conducted with the aim of investigating the factors affecting patients' readiness for advance care planning (RACP)."
"For the planning of surgical procedures involving the bony reconstruction of the mandible, the autologous iliac crest graft, along with the fibula graft, has become established as a preferred donor region. While computer-assisted planning methods are increasingly gaining importance, the necessary preparation of geometric data based on CT imaging remains largely a manual process. The aim of this work was to develop and test a method for the automated segmentation of the iliac crest for subsequent reconstruction planning."
"Although numerous studies have shown that grazing gives rise to community succession from the communities or even species perspective, there is a lack of discussion about how grazing drives community assembly based on plant functional traits in a long-term experiment. We find different grazing intensities lead to temporal effects on trait-mediated multidimensional community assembly processes, including community-weighted trait mean (CWM), trait filtering, and trait distribution (divergence/convergence). CWM, trait filtering, and trait distribution of different traits transformed over the 16-year grazing experiment. Major findings include the following: (1) CWM changed rapidly under higher grazing intensity, and the removal of unsuitable traits from communities over time was accelerated with higher grazing intensity, such as higher specific leaf area (SLA), rich epidermal appendages (PAP), deep root system (RD), and growth form (shrub and subshrub) and dispersal mode (DM, e.g., insect spread) with higher scores. (2) Patterns of trait filtering strongly depended on grazing intensity and trait types, most traits, such as SLA, DM, PAP, RD, and onset of flowering (OFL), were filtered at high grazing intensity area, and effects of trait filtering in the community assembly process strengthened with grazing time. (3) Traits related to the cycling of biological matter, such as leaf area (LA), SLA, reproductive height (RH), photosynthetic (PHO), and GF more frequently diverged after long-term grazing, especially in higher grazing areas. Community assembly in intensely grazed ecosystems takes over a decade to support fundamental functions, highlighting the need for grazing intensity thresholds for sustainable grassland use."
Our study aimed to assess the effects of anticancer 4-thiazolidinone-based free water-insoluble therapeutics Les-3288 and Les-3833 and their waterborne complexes with branched PEG-containing polymeric carriers (A24-PEG550 and A24-PEG750) on immune response.
"Many animal species are known to show individuality in their acoustic communication. This variation in individual male signatures can be decisive for female choice. Within the damselfishes, Dascyllus species are known for prolific sound production during the realization of movements associated with courtship (i.e., the signal jump) and spawning (mating sounds). However, the ability to distinguish the individuality of male Dascyllus sound signatures is unknown. We investigated the variability in the courtship and mating sounds of 17 males of Dascyllus albisella at Johnston Atoll, Central Pacific Ocean, to determine whether it was possible to distinguish them from one another and thus have information on their ability to convey individual information. Acoustic analyses confirmed that courtship sounds differed from mating sounds. Comparative analyses suggest that acoustic signals cannot serve as distinctive traits unless the individuals are of different sizes. Males of D. albisella do not use individual signatures in a reproductive behavioral context. However, it cannot be ruled out that variations in the sound production rate may serve as a discriminative feature."
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a very common condition worldwide. Treatment options for severe IBS are few. Sacral neuromodulation (SNM) for patients with IBS has been shown to reduce symptoms and improve quality of life in the medium term. This study aimed to evaluate the long-term effectiveness and safety of SNM in diarrhoea-predominant and mixed IBS.
"Metastasectomy is a useful adjunct in the management of metastatic cancer. Widespread adoption of novel targeted and immunotherapies has improved the survival profiles of multiple malignancies, which has potentially altered the role of metastasectomy. This study aimed to characterize trends in metastasectomy across five primary cancers eligible for these therapies."
"A 12 yr old female spayed American Staffordshire terrier was referred for stranguria, pollakiuria, and concern for a mass in the trigone of the urinary bladder. A urinalysis and abdominal ultrasound were performed to further investigate the bladder mass. Nematode larvae were identified in the urine, termed microfilaruria, while a caudal abdominal mass was found on ultrasound impinging on the urethra. Fine-needle aspirate of the abdominal mass revealed malignant neoplasia. A SNAP 4Dx of the peripheral blood was positive for Dirofilaria immitis antigen and a modified Knott's test confirmed D immitis larvae. The patient was euthanized owing to poor prognosis, and multiple masses were found within the abdominal cavity that, based on histopathology and immunohistochemistry, were diagnosed as poorly differentiated sarcoma. Hemorrhage, secondary to the abdominal mass, was considered the primary cause of microfilaruria."
"Cytochrome P450s of the CYP79 family catalyze two N-hydroxylation reactions, converting a selected number of amino acids into the corresponding oximes. The sorghum genome (Sorghum bicolor) harbours nine CYP79A encoding genes, and here sequence comparisons of the CYP79As along with their substrate recognition sites (SRSs) are provided. The substrate specificity of previously uncharacterized CYP79As was investigated by transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana and subsequent transformation of the oximes formed into the corresponding stable oxime glucosides catalyzed by endogenous UDPG-glucosyltransferases (UGTs). CYP79A61 uses phenylalanine as a substrate, whereas CYP79A91, CYP79A93, and CYP79A95 use valine and isoleucine as substrates, with CYP79A93 showing the ability also to use phenylalanine. CYP79A94 uses isoleucine as a substrate. Analysis of 249 sorghum transcriptomes from two different sorghum cultivars showed the expression levels and tissue-specific expression of the CYP79As. CYP79A1 is the committed gene in dhurrin formation and was the highest expressed gene in most tissues/organs. CYP79A61 was primarily expressed in fully developed leaf blades and leaf sheaths. CYP79A91 and CYP79A92 were expressed mainly in roots >200 cm below ground, while CYP79A93 and CYP79A94 were most highly expressed in the leaf collar and leaf sheath, respectively. The possible signalling effects of the oximes and their metabolites produced in different sorghum tissues are discussed."

"Photo-thermo-sensitive genic male sterility (PTGMS), which exhibits varying fertility levels under different environmental conditions, is a crucial method for heterosis utilization in wheat. However, the mechanisms underlying fertility conversion remain unclear. In the study, three BS type PTGMS lines were analyzed to study fertility conversion characteristics. The results indicated that the fertility conversion occurred during meiosis and was accompanied by an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) under a sterile environment. TaFAR9 encoding a novel fatty acyl CoA reductase was identified using transcriptome sequencing. Expression analysis suggested that TaFAR9 was localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), with high expression levels in anthers. Furthermore, the down-regulation of TaFAR9 expression displayed characteristics of male sterility, accompanied by the accumulation of ROS. Cytological analysis revealed abnormal development in the anther and pollen walls of TaFAR9-silenced lines. Additionally, TaFAR9 and TaFAR10 were confirmed to physically interact using molecular docking simulation, yeast two-hybrid, luciferase complementation, and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays. The reduced expression of TaFAR10 also exhibited male sterility and ROS burst. Moreover, the co-silencing of TaFAR9 and TaFAR10 produced sterility phenotypes that were similar to those observed when silencing TaFAR9 or TaFAR10 individually. Transcriptome analysis suggested that the ROS burst in BSMV: TaFAR9/10 anthers can result in cellular metabolic disorders. These findings indicate that TaFAR9 and TaFAR10 may form heterodimers that synergistically regulate fertility conversion in PTGMS lines by modulating ROS metabolism. And this study offers a fresh insight into the regulatory processes involved in fertility conversion in PTGMS lines."
"Mosaic Analysis with Double Markers (MADM) represents a mouse genetic approach coupling differential fluorescent labeling to genetic manipulations in dividing cells and their lineages. MADM uniquely enables the generation and visualization of individual control or homozygous mutant cells in a heterozygous genetic environment. Among its diverse applications, MADM has been used to dissect cell-autonomous gene functions important for cortical development and neural development in general. The high cellular resolution offered by MADM also permits the analysis of transcriptomic changes of individual cells upon genetic manipulations. In this chapter, we describe an experimental protocol combining the generation and isolation of MADM-labeled cells with downstream single-cell RNA-sequencing technologies to probe cell-type specific phenotypes due to genetic mutations at single-cell resolution."
"A vestibular implant can partially restore vestibular function by providing motion information through implanted electrodes. During vestibular implantation, various obstructions of the semicircular canals, such as protein deposits, fibrosis, and ossification, can be encountered. The objective was to explore the relationship between preoperative imaging and intraoperative findings of semicircular canal obstruction and to develop surgical strategies for dealing with obstructions of the semicircular canal(s) in patients eligible for vestibular implantation."
"Protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 22 (PTPN22) lies downstream of the T cell receptor (TCR) and attenuates T cell signaling by dephosphorylating key effector proteins such as LCK, Zap70, and the intracellular region of the TCR. Recent evidence implicates PTPN22 as an exciting target for enabling immunotherapeutic efficacy against cancer. We carried out structural optimization of a benzofuran salicylic acid-based orthosteric PTPN22 inhibitor 8b, using a combination of crystal structure analysis, synthesis, matched molecular pairs analysis, and biochemical and cell-based assays. Herein, we report structure-activity relationship studies, lead optimization based on the 8b-PTPN22 co-crystal structure, and cellular evaluation of the top analog. Notably, our efforts yielded compound 8b-19, an essentially equipotent scaffold with superior isozyme selectivity, improved aqueous solubility, and significantly enhanced cellular efficacy compared to the parent 8b. This compound may serve as a lead for further optimization of PTPN22-targeting immunotherapies or as a chemical probe for interrogation for additional links between PTPN22 and immunomodulation in cells."
"Atmospheric ozone is a common air pollutant with known impacts on maternal and fetal health. However, the relationship between gestational ozone exposure and susceptibility to respirovirus infection remains unclear.

"Herein, authors report on an ASD child with comorbid ADHD, ID, metabolic syndrome and nocturnal enuresis that failed multiple trials of psychotropic agents for behavioural dyscontrol. Viloxazine adjuventia brought about remarkable improvement spanning different domains. Purported pharmacodynamic mechanisms are briefly discussed. This case represents one of the earliest reports of viloxazine use in ASD."
"Sex is associated with the clinical presentation, outcomes, and response to treatment in patients with heart failure (HF). However, little is known about the safety and efficacy of treatment with finerenone according to sex."
This study aims to compare the differences between unattended and conventional blood pressure measurements in hospitalized hypertensive patients.
"Petroclival lesions represent a surgical challenge during the endonasal endoscopic approach, as they may involve maneuvers with severe comorbidity. To avoid the morbidity caused by these maneuvers, a contralateral transmaxillary approach (CTA) has been proposed to complement the endoscopic endonasal approach. The aim of our study is to review the safety and efficacy of this approach. We included three patients with lesions affecting the petroclival region, one cholesterol granuloma and two macroadenomas, who were surgically treated with a combined ipsilateral transpterygoid approach and a CTA. The latter was performed by wide osteotomy on the anterior wall of the maxillary sinus through a gingivolabial incision. Complete resection was achieved in the patient with a cholesterol granuloma and subtotal resection in the two patients diagnosed with macroadenoma. One patient presented ecchymosis of the malar area as the only complication. The contralateral transmaxillary approach may improve exposure and dissection of the petroclival area compared to the homolateral endoscopic endonasal approach allowing reaching the most lateral and posterior region of this territory without the need to manipulate the internal carotid artery."
"Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic immune-mediated disease of the esophagus. It is diagnosed in the setting of symptoms of esophageal dysfunction and an eosinophilic predominant infiltrate in the esophagus. The condition is rapidly increasing in incidence and prevalence and is commonly encountered in gastroenterology and allergy practices, emergency departments, and primary care settings. Over the past decade, there have been paradigm shifts in disease diagnosis and management, increases in knowledge about EoE risk factors, natural history, and pathogenesis, and development of validated outcome metrics. This updated American College of Gastroenterology Clinical Guideline uses Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology to make recommendations across domains of diagnosis, treatment, monitoring and assessment of response, and pediatric-specific considerations. Proton pump inhibitors, topical steroids, empiric diet elimination, a biologic, and esophageal dilation are all recommended treatments; feeding therapy is used adjunctively in children with food aversion or feeding dysfunction. Monitoring with clinical, endoscopic, and histologic assessments is recommended to assess for treatment response and follow patients over time with maintenance therapy. When evaluating and following patients with EoE, consideration should be given to assessing and controlling both the inflammatory and fibrostenotic aspects of disease."
"While the majority of proteins with available structures are able to fold independently and mediate interactions only after acquiring their folded state, a subset of the known protein complexes contains protein chains that are intrinsically disordered in isolation. The Mutual Folding Induced by Binding (MFIB) database collects and classifies protein complexes, wherein all constituent protein chains would be unstable/disordered in isolation but fold into a well-defined 3D complex structure upon binding. This phenomenon is often termed as cooperative folding and binding or mutual synergistic folding (MSF). Here we present a major update to the database: we collected and annotated hundreds of new protein complexes fulfilling the criteria of MSF, leading to an almost six-fold increase in the size of the database. Many novel features have also been introduced, such as clustering of the complexes based on structural similarity and domain types, assigning different evidence levels to each entry and adding the evidence coverage label that allowed us to include complexes of multi(sub)domain monomers with partial MSF. The MFIB 2.0 database is available at https://mfib.pbrg.hu."
"The sucrose yield in sugarcane largely depends on stem morphology, including length, diameter and sugar content, making sugarcane stem a key trait in breeding. The ""Bainianzhe"" variety from Songxi County, Fujian Province, possesses both aerial stems and rhizomes, providing a unique model for studying stem development. We performed a spatiotemporal transcriptomic analysis of the base, middle and apical sections of both aerial stems and rhizomes. The analysis categorized transcriptomes by developmental stage-base, middle and apical-rather than environmental differences. Apical segments were enriched with genes related to cell proliferation, while base segments were linked to senescence and fibrosis. Gene regulatory networks revealed key TFs involved in stem development. Orphan genes may be involved in rhizome development through coexpression networks. Plant hormones, especially genes involved in ABA and GAs synthesis, were highly expressed in rhizomes. Thiamine-related genes were also more prevalent in rhizomes. Furthermore, the apical segments of rhizomes enriched in photosynthesis-related genes suggest adaptations to light exposure. Low average temperatures in Songxi have led to unique cold acclimation in Bainianzhe, with rhizomes showing higher expression of genes linked to unsaturated fatty acid synthesis and cold-responsive calcium signalling. This indicates that rhizomes may have enhanced cold tolerance, aiding in the plant's overwintering success."
"In this policy brief, we explore several potential drivers of heterogeneity in policy outcomes that can be examined in tobacco control policy evaluations, expanding the evidence base to contribute to continued, equitable progress in reducing tobacco-related health outcomes. We discuss these factors in the context of a hypothetical evaluation of the impact of smoke-free laws on current smoking and quit attempts in the Tobacco Nation. Despite a similar policy environment within the Tobacco Nation, there is variation in the strength of smoke-free law coverage across states. This commentary considers how policy design and other contextual factors, including co-occurring policies, and differential impacts across subgroups, may influence policy-attributable outcomes across time and space."
"Chicory, recognized as a functional food, is increasingly becoming the focus of research. This study aimed to investigate the in vitro impact of gastrointestinal digestion on the composition and bioactive properties of chicory decoction. Chicory flour, derived from the roots, was transformed into an aqueous decoction and was subjected to simulated in vitro human gastrointestinal digestion (SGID). For the first time, the influence of the digestive process on specific classes of bioactive molecules was tracked across different digestive compartments (oral, gastric, and intestinal) using a metabolomic approach. Concurrently, the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and intestinal hormone regulation effects were assessed before and after SGID. The findings revealed that specific transformations of chlorogenic acid (CGA) and sesquiterpene lactones (STL) during SGID enhanced antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties post-digestion. Quantitative results demonstrated a significant increase in ROS scavenging capacity and metabolite activity."
"Microglia/macrophages participate in the development of and recovery from experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), and the macrophage M1 (pro-inflammatory)/M2 (anti-inflammatory) phase transition is involved in EAE disease progression. We evaluated the efficacy of crisdesalazine (a novel microsomal prostaglandin E2 synthase-1 inhibitor) in an EAE model, including its immune-regulating potency in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophages, and its neuroprotective effects in a macrophage-neuronal co-culture system. Crisdesalazine significantly alleviated clinical symptoms, inhibited inflammatory cell infiltration and demyelination in the spinal cord, and altered the phase of microglial/macrophage and regulatory T cells. Crisdesalazine promoted the M1 to M2 phase transition in macrophages (immunomodulation) and reduced neuronal necrosis (neuroprotection) in vitro. This is the first study to directly demonstrate the therapeutic effects of a microsomal prostaglandin E2 synthase-1 inhibitor in an EAE model and its ability to alter macrophage polarization, suggesting that it may be a new therapeutic option for the treatment of patients affected by multiple sclerosis and other autoimmune diseases."
This study aimed to investigate the integrative effects and mechanisms of transcutaneous electrical acustimulation (TEA) on postprocedural recovery from endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP).
"We evaluated the effect of two workshops on learning about critical thinking amongst first- year university students. 66 Chilean pedagogy students participated, all female, with ages ranging between 18 and 37 years. Two experimental groups were organized, one with direct teaching (n = 22) and another one with semi-directed teaching (n = 19), plus a control group (n = 25). Pre- and post-tests were applied with an abbreviated Pencrisal critical thinking questionnaire. The results showed statistically significant differences in both experimental groups between the pre- and post-test, with a greater difference in experimental group 1, while the control showed no significant differences. The covariables evaluated were age and academic performance upon entering university, observing that even after controlling for the aforementioned variables, there are differences between the experimental groups and the control. We discuss the possible positive effect of direct teaching in critical thinking as a more effective strategy."
"The absence or dysplasia of the iliac artery(IA) is an exceedingly rare condition, with limited cases documented in the literature. In this report, we present a case of hypoplasia of the right external iliac artery (EIA) in a 69-year-old male patient. The patient presented with right lower abdominal pain attributed to an aneurysm of the right internal iliac artery (IIA), yet notably, there was no evidence of lower limb ischemia at the time of consultation. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the aorta revealed a slender and occluded right EIA. Additionally, aneurysms were identified in the abdominal aorta (AA), the common iliac artery (CIA), and the right IIA, with collateral circulation involving the deep femoral artery and internal pathways. We performed aortoiliac aneurysm repair with a bifurcated synthetic graft on the patient's AA and iliac artery (IA), successfully excising the abdominal aorta aneurysms (AAA) and the CIA aneurysm. Postoperatively, thrombosis of the internal iliac aneurysm was observed, and the patient experienced a resolution of pain symptoms in the right lower abdomen. This paper delineates the vascular variations and treatment strategies employed and provides a review of the existing literature on IA malformations."
"Introduction. The Internet and social media have revolutionized access to information on health and parenting issues. Virtual consultations are spreading worldwide, are increasing, and represent a challenge for professional practice. Objective. To characterize the use of the Internet and social media by mothers and fathers as a source of information on the health and parenting of their children. Population and methods. A descriptive, cross-sectional study in an outpatient pediatric center in the City of Buenos Aires to determine the online consultation habits of caregivers of healthy children or children with health problems. Results. Two hundred-one surveys were analyzed, and the answers were predominantly from mothers of healthy children; 70.6% search online for health and parenting topics; 80% consult more than once a month. Although 36% of the families use the information to complement the medical consultation, 95% would not replace the pediatric consultation with the online search. The participants are not in the habit of following official pages, nor do they tend to verify the veracity of the contents. The search topics are related to the child's age, and satisfaction with the information results are modified according to whether the child is healthy or has a health problem. Only 4.7% responded that the search always answers their questions. Conclusions. Caregivers frequently seek online parenting and health information, but the sources are not always reliable. Although consultation with pediatricians is not displaced, we need to know the impact of online information on health decision-making. Pediatricians can intervene and guide caregivers to safe sources."
"Flow, a psychological state of intense engagement in and enjoyment of an activity, can arise during both solitary and socially interactive experiences. In the literature, whereas people high in extraversion have difficulty achieving flow in solitude, those with an autotelic personality-a combination of traits that make people prone to flow-readily experience flow in both solitary and interactive conditions. In this pre-registered experiment, we investigated whether autotelic personality mitigates the negative association between solitary flow and extraversion."
"Direct analysis in real time mass spectrometry (DART-MS) is a novel method for the authentication of food and feed that represents a serious alternative to established methods. This study aims to analyze hazelnuts from different origins and identify potential marker metabolites using a high-resolution DART-MS platform and a non-targeted metabolomics approach. To investigate the suitability of DART-MS for authenticating the origin of foods with a high fat content, 172 hazelnut samples from 5 countries were analyzed. Data evaluation using principal component analysis (PCA) and Random Forest-based classification led to an accuracy of 93.2 %, demonstrating the high valence of the DART-MS approach for verifying the origin of hazelnuts. In addition, 16 marker metabolites were identified and revealed the importance of di- and triacylglycerols for the authentication of hazelnuts. These results demonstrate the high suitability of DART-MS based analysis as a rapid, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly approach for food authentication."
"Targeting the influencing factors in tumor growth and expansion in the tumor microenvironment is one of the key approaches to cancer immunotherapy. Various factors in the tumor microenvironment can in cooperation stimulate tumor growth, suppress anti-tumor immune responses, promote drug resistance, and ultimately enhance tumor recurrence. Therefore, due to the dependence and close cooperation of these axes, their combined targeting can have a greater effect compared to their individual targeting. Among the important factors affecting tumor growth in the tumor region, CD73 and EGFR play an important role in tumor growth by stimulating each other's expression and function. Therefore, we intended to use the nanocarriers that we had previously produced and characterized to deliver anti-CD73 and EGFR siRNAs to murine breast cancer 4T1 cells. Silencing CD73 and EGFR could significantly induce cell death in cancer cells. Downregulation of the CD73/EGFR axis also suppressed the migratory and proliferative potential of cancer cells. This therapeutic strategy also inhibited tumor growth in in ovo model. These findings imply that simultaneous targeting of CD73 and EGFR in breast cancer can be considered a novel immunotherapeutic approach that needs further investigation in future studies."
"Obesity could compromise people's health and elevate the risk of numerous severe chronic conditions and premature mortality. Young adults are at high risk of adopting unhealthy lifestyles related to overweight and obesity, as they are at a phase marked by several significant life milestones that have been linked to weight gain. They gain weight rapidly and excess adiposity mostly accrues, compared with middle-aged and older adults when weight stabilizes or even decreases. Virtual reality exergames have the potential to increase physical activity in people's daily lives. However, the factors that influence young adults' preference for using virtual reality exergames for weight control remain unclear."
"Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) is a rare, potentially lifethreatening condition characterised by obstruction of the hepatic venous outflow tract due to thrombosis. Treatment typically involves lifelong anticoagulation and relieving the obstruction. This case report introduces hepatic venous thromboaspiration as an additional endovascular technique to achieve recanalisation."
"Ninety-eight percent of neonatal deaths worldwide occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), yet there is little bereavement care guidance available for these settings."
Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel is the standard treatment for acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Cilostazol has emerged as a safe alternative with pleiotropic effects that prevent stroke without increasing the risk of bleeding and has been shown to reduce neurological deterioration (ND) in the acute phase. Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb 761) has also been reported to improve neurological impairment following AIS. This trial aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination of cilostazol and EGb 761 in reducing early stroke recurrence and ND in patients with non-cardioembolic AIS.
"Many biological markers of normal and disease states can be detected in saliva. The benefits of saliva collection for research include being non-invasive, ease of frequent sample collection, saving time, and being cost-effective. A small volume (≈1 mL) of saliva is enough for these analyses that can be collected in just a few minutes. For ""dry"" saliva paper matrices, additional drying times (about 30 min) may be needed, but this can be performed at room temperature without the need for freezers and specialized equipment. Together, these make saliva an ideal choice of body fluid for many clinical studies from diagnosis to monitoring measurable biological substances in hospital settings, remote, and other general locations including disaster areas. For these reasons, we have been using saliva (dry as well as wet) from astronauts participating in short- and long-duration space missions for over two decades to conduct viral, stress, and immunological studies. We have also extended the use of saliva to space analogs including bed rest, Antarctica, and closed-chamber studies. Saliva is a biomarker-rich and easily accessible body fluid that could enable larger and faster public health screenings, earlier disease detection, and improved patient outcomes. This review summarizes our lessons learned from utilizing saliva in spaceflight research and highlights the advantages and disadvantages of saliva in clinical diagnostics."
This case report describes a rare case of Coats disease in adult female patient with preserved vision after intravitreal Aflibercept injection and laser photocoagulation.
"The application of microbial inoculants holds promise for the sustainable restoration of abandoned mine sites by affecting soil nutrients and microbial communities. However, the responses of plant microbial communities to microbial inoculants in mine restoration remain largely unknown. To bridge this knowledge gap, we conducted a 4-year field experiment at an abandoned carbonate mine site to assess the impacts of microbial inoculants on the soil-plant microbiome. Our findings revealed that microbial inoculants significantly changed roots, fine root bacterial and fungal communities. Further, no significant correlations were observed between the soil-plant nutrient content (Z-score) and microbial alpha diversity. However, a significantly positive correlation was found between the relative abundance of the keystone ecological cluster (Module #1) and soil-plant nutrient content. The application of microbial inoculants also increased complexity, albeit decreased stability of plant microbiome networks, alongside a reduction in stochastic assembly. Conversely, they decreased the complexity but increased the stability of soil microbiome networks, accompanied by an increase in stochastic assembly. Notably, the number of specifically enriched microbiome functional traits of roots and root nodules under the microbial inoculant treatments surpassed that of the control. In summary, our findings underscored the potential of microbial inoculants to enhance soil-plant functionality at abandoned mine restoration sites."
"Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RSTS) is an autosomal dominant genetic disease characterized by growth retardation, psychomotor retardation, and distinctive facial features. It is primarily caused by mutations in CREBBP or EP300. In this study, we aimed to describe the clinical manifestations and genetic analyses of two cases with RSTS. Clinical analysis was performed on two cases with RSTS. Molecular diagnoses were made via whole exome sequencing, and potential pathogenic variants were filtered and selected. PCR followed by Sanger sequencing was used to verify candidate variants in the family members. Case 1 involved a 7-year-old boy (patient 1) who exhibited delayed language development, growth retardation, and intellectual disability. We did not find any other characteristics of RSTS, such as thumb or hallux abnormalities. Case 2 involved a fetus who had severe congenital heart disease, low conus medullaris, and a large gallbladder. Whole exome and Sanger sequencing results revealed that a missense mutation c.5120G>A (p. Cys1707Tyr) was present in patient 1 and that the fetus carried a heterozygous nonsense mutation c.1984C>T (p. Gln662Ter). In conclusion, whole exome sequencing combined with Sanger sequencing revealed that c.5120G>A (p. Cys1707Tyr) and c.1984C>T (p. Gln662Ter) are two new mutation sites that cause RSTS. This study expands the clinical phenotypes and is helpful in identifying gene-phenotype correlations in RSTS."
"Hyaluronic acid hydrogels are promising materials for diverse applications, yet their potential is hampered by limitations such as low self-healing efficiency and insufficient mechanical strength. Inspired by the heterogeneous structures of spider silk, we introduce a novel dual dynamically crosslinked network hydrogel. This hydrogel comprises an acylhydrazone-crosslinked network, utilizing aldehyde hyaluronic acid (AHA) and 3,3'-dithiobis (propionohydrazide) (DTP) as a first network, and a secondary network formed by hydrogen bonds-crosslinked network between tannic acid (TA) and silk fibroin (SF) with β-sheet formation. The hydrogel exhibits exceptional self-healing ability due to the dynamic and reversible nature of Schiff base bonds, disulfide bonds, and hydrogen bonds, achieving complete healing within 5 minutes. Additionally, the spider silk-inspired heterogeneous structures enhance mechanical properties. Furthermore, the incorporation of TA provides enhances adhesion, as well as remarkable antibacterial and antioxidant properties. This innovative hyaluronic acid-based hydrogel, inspired by spider silk, offers a promising avenue to fortify both the mechanical strength and self-healing capabilities of hydrogels, thus expanding opportunities for applications in tissue engineering and biomedicine."
"Transition of the United States Medical Licensing Examination Step 1 to a pass/fail structure has focused attention on medical student research in residency application. Previous studies have explored how various factors affect the neurosurgery match success, but none have focused on applicants from schools without a neurosurgery residency program."
"A didelphic uterus represents a unique and infrequent congenital condition in which a woman possesses two distinct uteri, each with its own cervix. This anomaly arises due to partial or incomplete merging of the Müllerian ducts during the developmental stages in the womb. Accounting for uterine malformations, a didelphic uterus is a relatively rare condition, affecting approximately 0.5-2% of the population and is considered one of the more uncommon types of uterine abnormalities."
"The complexity of serum constituents and the lack of knowledge on biomarkers bring obstacles for reliable cancer screening with the limited information obtained by surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) on a single substrate. We report here an extremely high-accurate approach for cancer screening by biomarker-free serum-SERS technique which employs three principal SERS substrates that are of specially designed surface properties. With three substrates rich information on serum can be obtained from SERS spectra, of which quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) yields excellent classifications of serum samples independently. Diagnosis with an accuracy of ∼100% can be achieved based on the three independent QDA classifications, by the unanimity principle. In this study, a screening accuracy of 100% was achieved by this approach for 122 diagnosed out of the 194 serum samples. The mechanism for the extremely high accuracy of this approach was also theoretically investigated. The three-principal-substrate approach opens up a path towards highly accurate biomarker-free cancer screening by serum-SERS technique."
"The present study investigated the involvement of hippocampal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in the anti-allodynic effect of ketamine/morphine on neuropathic pain in adult male Wistar rats. Morphine or ketamine administration decreased the percentage of maximum possible effect (MPE%), indicating an analgesic effect. The most significant decrease occurred with a 5 mg/kg dose of morphine (average MPE% = 98), while a 0.5 mg/kg dose of ketamine resulted in a high response (average MPE% = 91), using decision trees as a machine learning tool. Combining morphine and ketamine improved neuropathic pain (average MPE% = 91). Intra-CA1 microinjection of mecamylamine (2 μg/rat) with morphine (3 mg/kg) reduced neuropathic pain (average MPE% = 94). Co-administration of lower doses of ketamine (0.1 mg/kg, i.p.) and mecamylamine (0.5 or 1 μg/rat) with morphine (3 mg/kg) led to a considerable reduction in pain (average MPE% = 91). Utilizing the generalized least squares (GLS) model enabled the establishment of a continuous relation between drug dose and MPE% as the outcome of interest. There was a 19.60 higher average MPE% for each mg/kg increase in morphine dose. In contrast, there was a 17.05 higher average MPE% for every 0.1 mg/kg increase in ketamine dose. Each 0.1 mg/kg increase in ketamine dose, when combined with morphine (3 mg/kg), led to a 30.85 higher average MPE%. A tenfold impact of increasing mecamylamine dosage on MPE% was observed when paired with morphine. Thus, hippocampal nAChRs play a significant role in mediating the anti-allodynic effect of ketamine and morphine in neuropathic pain."
"Although sublobar resection (wedge resection [Wed] or segmentectomy [Seg]) has become a standard operative procedure for clinical stages IA1 and IA2 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in Japan, the impact of this procedure on the prognosis and postoperative complications in real-world clinical practice is unknown."
"Management of acute and chronic pain following surgery remains a critical patient management challenge, with poor pain management associated with negative patient satisfaction, increased opioid consumption and a high incidence of adverse events. Chest surgery specifically carries a high incidence of significant early and chronic post operative pain. The high incidence, prolonged duration of pain, and adverse effects associated with chronic opioid analgesia, has given rise to the need for non-opioid pain management strategies. Cryoneurolysis, also known as cryoanalgesia, has emerged as a promising option for both acute and chronic pain management. While cryoneurolysis was first developed over fifty years ago, its utilization was limited by technical implementation challenges and limitations in identifying target structures percutaneously. Advances both in cryoneurolysis delivery devices as well as ultrasound have reinvigorated interest in the technique, with recent studies highlighting the advantages of cryoneurolysis, including its favorable side effect profile, long duration of efficacy and relative technical simplicity. The purpose of this review is to examine techniques for cryoneurolysis, and explore recent evidence for safety and efficacy of the technique following different surgical procedures."
"Soil salinization threatens global crop production. Here, we report that a receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase, CALMODULIN-BINDING RECEPTOR-LIKE CYTOPLASMIC KINASE 3 (CRCK3), plays an essential role in plant salt tolerance via CATALASE 2 (CAT2), a hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-scavenging enzyme in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). CRCK3 was induced by salt stress, and its knockout mutant displayed a salt-sensitive phenotype compared with wild-type plants. CRCK3 was activated by salt stress in a calcium-dependent manner, and its kinase activity was required for plant salt tolerance. CRCK3 physically interacted with CAT2, and CRCK3-mediated salt tolerance depended on CAT2. Salt treatment significantly induced CAT2 phosphorylation via the action of CRCK3, and this phosphorylation was required for CAT2-mediated H2O2 scavenging to reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) content and oxidative damage in plants under saline conditions. CRCK3 phosphorylated CAT2 at the Thr209 residue, resulting in elevated catalase activity to reduce ROS accumulation under saline conditions. Therefore, the CRCK3-CAT2 module mediates plant salt tolerance by maintaining redox homeostasis. This study expands our knowledge of how plants respond to salt stress."

This study explored structural and functional alterations in the whole brain of stroke patients with hemiplegia.
"Moral distress occurs when professionals are constrained from taking what they believe to be ethically appropriate actions or are forced to take actions they believe are ethically inappropriate, challenging their professional identities and representing systems-level issues within organizations. Moral distress has been recognized in a variety of health care-related fields; however, the phenomenon is still comparatively unexplored among clinical research professionals (CRPs). In this qualitative study, we interviewed ten CRPs to unearth root causes of moral distress in this ethically unique profession. Four themes emerged from the data as contributors to moral distress: commodification of research; concern for research participants; compromised science; and structures of hierarchy. The experience of racism as a source of moral distress is also explored. The findings of this study indicate that the existence of moral distress in clinical research is troubling not only for the welfare of CRPs but also for the greater clinical research enterprise."
"Pattern-reversal visual evoked potentials are used to assess the visual pathways. The main waveform of interest is the P100, which is best recorded with electrodes over the mid-occipital region. Most often, the P100 waveform has negative-positive-negative components. Occasionally, it is ""W-shaped,"" with positive-negative-positive components. Although most often a W-shaped P100 waveform indicates an abnormality in the visual pathway, occasionally, it can be normal. A case is presented in which a W-shaped P100 waveform is seen after monocular full-field stimulation of both eyes with 30' checks. To resolve this finding, the pattern-reversal visual evoked potentials is repeated with 60' and 15' checks. With 15' checks a single typical single-peak P100 waveform is seen with normal latency. Evaluation of a W-shaped P100 waveform should involve analysis of various montages, stimulation with different check sizes, and hemifield stimulation to confirm whether the W-shaped waveform is normal or abnormal."

"In this study, thermophilic pectinase-producing strains were isolated. Among all the isolates, strain No. 4 was identified as Aspergillus fumigatus BT-4 based on its morphology and 18 S rDNA analysis. This strain was employed to screen various fermentation media to enhance pectinase production. Pectinases are crucial enzymes with significant industrial applications, particularly in the food and textile industries. Identifying efficient pectinase producers and optimizing their production processes are essential for improving industrial applications."
"A disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 1 (ADAMTS1) plays crucial roles in various biological processes, including myogenesis, by modulating the neurogenic locus notch homolog protein 1 (NOTCH1) signaling pathway. However, the mechanisms through which ADAMTS1 regulates myogenesis remain unclear. In this study, we generated recombinant ADAMTS1 mutants and determined their effects on muscle cell differentiation, focusing on the regulation of NOTCH1 signaling. Treatment of C2C12 cells with recombinant ADAMTS1 protein enhanced muscle cell differentiation. Meanwhile, ADAM10 treatment inhibited muscle differentiation through the activation of NOTCH1 cleavage. Recombinant ADAMTS1 reversed ADAM10-induced muscle cell atrophy by suppressing NOTCH1 activation and downregulating its target gene. Recombinant ADAMTS1 also alleviated dexamethasoneinduced muscle atrophy in a mouse model. In summary, our findings suggest that recombinant ADAMTS1 promotes muscle regeneration by suppressing NOTCH1 and highlight the potential of recombinant ADAMTS1 proteins in the treatment of muscle wasting disease.

"A two-year study has been conducted to optimize saffron cormlet production in a soilless cultivation system. Variations in the concentration of phosphate, boron, and irrigation events were assessed in the first year. Subsequently, after optimizing the substrate composition, the effects of nutrient solution volume and the concentration of nitrate, iron, and boron were investigated on the yield and weight of cormlets and leaves, photosynthetic activities, and productivity of nutrient solutions in the second year. Irrigation events in the first year significantly influenced cormlet growth, while phosphate and boron had no substantial effects. Moisture characteristics indicated an optimal substrate composition of 15% cocopeat, 15% cocochips, and 70% perlite. In the second year, increasing nutrient solution volume (225 ml/pot/week) and nitrate concentration up to 9800 µM significantly increased the weight of the leaf, total photosynthesis rate, and large-sized cormlets (> 8 g) to nearly 50% of total cormlets. Conversely, increasing iron concentration notably decreased the weight of total and large-sized cormlets. Boron concentration again showed no significant effect on the parameters. The highest nutrient solution productivity was achieved with a 150 (ml/pot/week) nutrient solution containing 9800 µM nitrogen and 25 µM iron. These findings underscore the importance of effective irrigation and nutrition management in enhancing the quantity and quality of cormlet production, potentially boosting perennial saffron yield in the following years."
"Lateral condyle fractures are the second most common pediatric elbow fracture after supracondylar humeral fractures. Early complications are frequent which can lead to development of long-term problems. Current literature has evaluated short-term outcomes, but few studies have investigated long-term outcomes into adulthood. Our hypothesis is that the majority of pediatric patients with a lateral condyle fracture will have minimal complications and few surgeries as they age."
Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is one of the most common complications during pregnancy. There is inconsistency between previous studies regarding the blood and inflammatory parameters levels among pregnant women and its association with GDM. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between blood parameters in relation to GDM.
"The aim of this study was to explore the potential of weak supervision in a deep learning-based label prediction model. The goal was to use this model to extract labels from German free-text thoracic radiology reports on chest X-ray images and for training chest X-ray classification models.The proposed label extraction model for German thoracic radiology reports uses a German BERT encoder as a backbone and classifies a report based on the CheXpert labels. For investigating the efficient use of manually annotated data, the model was trained using manual annotations, weak rule-based labels, and both. Rule-based labels were extracted from 66071 retrospectively collected radiology reports from 2017-2021 (DS 0), and 1091 reports from 2020-2021 (DS 1) were manually labeled according to the CheXpert classes. Label extraction performance was evaluated with respect to mention extraction, negation detection, and uncertainty detection by measuring F1 scores. The influence of the label extraction method on chest X-ray classification was evaluated on a pneumothorax data set (DS 2) containing 6434 chest radiographs with associated reports and expert diagnoses of pneumothorax. For this, DenseNet-121 models trained on manual annotations, rule-based and deep learning-based label predictions, and publicly available data were compared.The proposed deep learning-based labeler (DL) performed on average considerably stronger than the rule-based labeler (RB) for all three tasks on DS 1 with F1 scores of 0.938 vs. 0.844 for mention extraction, 0.891 vs. 0.821 for negation detection, and 0.624 vs. 0.518 for uncertainty detection. Pre-training on DS 0 and fine-tuning on DS 1 performed better than only training on either DS 0 or DS 1. Chest X-ray pneumothorax classification results (DS 2) were highest when trained with DL labels with an area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.939 compared to RB labels with an AUC of 0.858. Training with manual labels performed slightly worse than training with DL labels with an AUC of 0.934. In contrast, training with a public data set resulted in an AUC of 0.720.Our results show that leveraging a rule-based report labeler for weak supervision leads to improved labeling performance. The pneumothorax classification results demonstrate that our proposed deep learning-based labeler can serve as a substitute for manual labeling requiring only 1000 manually annotated reports for training. · The proposed deep learning-based label extraction model for German thoracic radiology reports performs better than the rule-based model.. · Training with limited supervision outperformed training with a small manually labeled data set.. · Using predicted labels for pneumothorax classification from chest radiographs performed equally to using manual annotations..

"Compounds containing the 1,2,4-triazole moiety in their structure exhibit broad biological activities. Many of these compounds demonstrate anti-inflammatory activity in vitro through various mechanisms, such as inhibiting COX-1/COX-2 and LOX, modulating pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, or having effects on other specific enzymes. Some also display activities in vivo. In many publications, the activities of new 1,2,4-triazole-based compounds exceed those of the reference drugs, suggesting their promising potential as new therapeutic agents. This review of active 1,2,4-triazole derivatives with anti-inflammatory activity is based on literature published from 2015-2024."
"Rational modification of natural products plays a key role in drug discovery. Herein, a series of steroidal indole derivatives containing various substituents and steroidal skeletons were designed and synthesized with classical Fischer indole synthesis as a key step in an efficient synthetic route for the first time. The in vitro antibacterial activity of all the synthesized derivatives was evaluated against four Gram-positive strains including three Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Compound 11e displayed the most potent antibacterial activity (MIC = 1-2 μg/mL) with low cytotoxicity and hemolytic activity. Derivative 11e displayed more rapid bactericidal kinetic than vancomycin in the time-kill study and was less likely to induce bacterial resistance. Moreover, the preliminary antibacterial mechanism explorations indicated that compound 11e could effectively inhibit biofilm formation, promote the accumulation of reactive oxygen species, decrease bacterial metabolism, and destroy bacterial cell membranes to exert its antibacterial effects. The study of in vivo antibacterial activity suggested that compound 11e could significantly reduce the bacteria counts in a mouse subcutaneous infection model. These findings provided a bright hope for steroidal indole derivatives as promising antibacterial candidates to settle drug resistance."
"This study explores the relationship between physical education teachers' support and middle school students' participation in sports. It also clarifies this relationship's mediating roles of perceived competence and exercise persistence. A questionnaire survey involved 879 Chinese middle school students, consisting of 434 males and 445 females. The results indicate a significant positive correlation between teachers' competence support and students' participation in sports (p < 0.01). Perceived competence and exercise persistence as important mediators between teachers' competence support and students' involvement in sports, with the mediation effect comprising independent mediation by perceived competence and exercise persistence and a chain mediation effect involving both. The effect value was 0.156, with contributions of 60.4%, 43.6%, and 73.1% to the total mediating effect, respectively. In physical education courses, teachers should enhance their competence to support students, increase students' interest in learning, and promote the development of sports participation. By understanding the predictive roles of teacher support, perceived competence, and exercise persistence on sports participation, strategies can be developed to better enhance students' levels of participation in physical activities, thereby improving their beliefs about physical health and their confidence in exercising."
"Duplication of methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2) gene causes MECP2 duplication syndrome (MDS). To normalize the duplicated MECP2 in MDS, we developed a high-fidelity Cas13Y (hfCas13Y) system capable of targeting the MECP2 (hfCas13Y-gMECP2) messenger RNA for degradation and reducing protein levels in the brain of humanized MECP2 transgenic mice. Moreover, the intracerebroventricular adeno-associated virus (AAV) delivery of hfCas13Y-gMECP2 in newborn or adult MDS mice restored dysregulated gene expression and improved behavior deficits. Notably, treatment with AAV9-hfCas13Y-gMECP2 extended the median survival of MECP2 transgenic mice from 156.5 to 226 d. Furthermore, studies with monkeys showed a single injection of AAV9-hfCas13Y-gMECP2 was sufficient to drive robust expression of hfCas13Y in widespread brain regions, with MECP2 knockdown efficiency reaching 52.19 ± 0.03% and significantly decreased expression of biomarker gene GDF11. Our results demonstrate that the RNA-targeting hfCas13Y-gMECP2 system is an effective intervention for MDS, providing a potential strategy for treating other dosage-sensitive diseases."
"Acne vulgaris (acne) is one of the most common skin diseases with complex pathogenesis. Numerous studies have shown that the microecosystem of sebaceous glands and Cutibacterium acnes play key roles in its pathogenesis. Antibiotics targeting C. acnes have been widely used in acne treatment, but the growing prevalence of antibiotic resistance has become alarming. Further research into the microecosystem of sebaceous glands and the role of specific C. acnes phylotypes in acne pathogenesis has led to a paradigm shift in acne treatment. Currently, non-antibiotic therapies such as light therapy and laser therapy are becoming increasingly popular, opening up new opportunities in acne management."
"For the vast majority of genes in sequenced genomes, there is limited understanding of how they are regulated. Without such knowledge, it is not possible to perform a quantitative theory-experiment dialogue on how such genes give rise to physiological and evolutionary adaptation. One category of high-throughput experiments used to understand the sequence-phenotype relationship of the transcriptome is massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs). However, to improve the versatility and scalability of MPRAs, we need a ""theory of the experiment"" to help us better understand the impact of various biological and experimental parameters on the interpretation of experimental data. These parameters include binding site copy number, where a large number of specific binding sites may titrate away transcription factors, as well as the presence of overlapping binding sites, which may affect analysis of the degree of mutual dependence between mutations in the regulatory region and expression levels. To that end, in this paper we create tens of thousands of synthetic gene expression outputs for bacterial promoters using both equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium models. These models make it possible to imitate the summary statistics (information footprints and expression shift matrices) used to characterize the output of MPRAs and thus to infer the underlying regulatory architecture. Specifically, we use a more refined implementation of the so-called thermodynamic models in which the binding energies of each sequence variant are derived from energy matrices. Our simulations reveal important effects of the parameters on MPRA data and we demonstrate our ability to optimize MPRA experimental designs with the goal of generating thermodynamic models of the transcriptome with base-pair specificity. Further, this approach makes it possible to carefully examine the mapping between mutations in binding sites and their corresponding expression profiles, a tool useful not only for developing a theory of transcription, but also for exploring regulatory evolution."
"Pathological significance of interaction of Synphilin-1 with mutated alpha-synuclein is well known to have serious consequences in causing the formation of inclusion bodies that are linked to Parkinson's disease (PD). Information extracted so far pointed out that specific mutations, A53T, A30P, and E46K, in alpha-synuclein promote such interactions. However, a detailed structural study of this interaction is pending due to the unavailability of the complete structures of the large protein Synphilin-1 of chain length 919 residues and the mutated alpha-synuclein having all the reported specific mutations so far. In this study, a semi-automatic pipeline-based meta-predictor, AlphaLarge, is created to predict high-fidelity structures of large proteins like Synphilin-1 given the limitations of the existing protocols. AlphaLarge recruits a novel augmented AlphaFold model that uses a divide and conquer based strategy on the foundation of a self-sourced template dataset to choose the best structure model through their standard validations. The structure models were re-validated by a Protein Mediated Interaction Analysis (PMIA) formalism that uses the existing structurally relevant information of these proteins. For the training dataset, the new method, AlphaLarge, performed reasonably better than AlphaFold. Also, the new residue- and domain-based structural details of interactions of resultant best structure models of Synphilin-1 and both wild and mutated alpha-synuclein are extracted using PMIA. This result paves the way for better screening of target specific drugs to control the progression of PD, in particular, and research on any kind of pathophysiology involving large proteins of unknown structures, in general."
"The 6-min walk test (6MWT) has established itself as a classical field-test for assessing exercise capacity across diverse populations, including older adults. Despite its widespread use, the specific contribution of cardiopulmonary factors to the 6-min walk distance (6MWD) remains relatively unexplored."
"Numerous scientific advances and discoveries have arisen from research on the hippocampal formation. This special issue provides first-person historical descriptions of these advances and discoveries in hippocampal research, written by those directly involved in the research. This is the first section of a special issue that will also include future articles on this topic. Here, we discuss some of the factors that motivated this special issue, and the major themes of hippocampal research that are addressed."
"The plaques associated with Alzheimer's disease are formed as a result of the aggregation of Aβ peptides, which vary in length from 38 to 43 amino acids. The 1-40 peptide is the most abundant, while the 1-42 peptide appears to be the most destructive to neurons and/or glial cells in a variety of assays. We have demonstrated that aggregated Aβ, a state prior to plaque formation, will activate the plasma bradykinin-forming pathway when tested in vitro. Aggregation is zinc-dependent, optimal at 25-50 µM, and the rate of aggregation is paralleled by the rate of activation of the bradykinin-forming pathway as assessed by plasma kallikrein formation. The aggregation of Aβ 1-38, 1-40, and 1-42 is optimal after incubation for 3 days, 3 h, and under 1 min, respectively. The cascade is initiated by the autoactivation of factor XII upon binding to aggregated Aβ; then, prekallikrein is converted to kallikrein, which cleaves high-molecular-weight kininogen (HK) to release bradykinin. Studies by a variety of other researchers have demonstrated the presence of each ""activation-step"" in either the plasma or spinal fluid of patients with Alzheimer's disease, including activated factor XII, kallikrein, and bradykinin itself. There is also evidence that activation is more prominent as dementia worsens. We now have medications that can block each step of the bradykinin-forming pathway as currently employed for the therapy of hereditary angioedema. Given the current state of therapy for Alzheimer's disease, which includes monoclonal antibodies that retard the rate of progression by 30% at most and have significant side effects, it seems imperative to explore prophylaxis using one of the long-acting agents that target plasma kallikrein or factor XIIa. There is a long-acting bradykinin antagonist in development, and techniques to target kallikrein mRNA to lower levels or knock out the prekallikrein gene are being developed."
"ADAM17 is a member of the disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM) family of transmembrane proteases with immunoregulatory activity in multiple signaling pathways. The functional ADAM17 is involved in the shedding of the ectodomain characterizing many substrates belonging to growth factors, cytokines, receptors, and adhesion molecules. The ADAM17-dependent pathways are known to be crucial in tumor development and progression and in the modulation of many pathological and physiological processes. In the last decade, ADAM17 was considered the driver of several autoimmune pathologies, and numerous substrate-mediated signal transduction pathways were identified. However, the discoveries made to date have led researchers to try to clarify the multiple mechanisms in which ADAM17 is involved and to identify any molecular gaps between the different transductional cascades. In this review, we summarize the most recent updates on the multiple regulatory activities of ADAM17, focusing on reported data in the field of autoimmunity."
Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare and highly heterogeneous histiocytosis. There are currently few studies examining the correlation between molecular profiling and clinical phenotype or outcomes in adult patients with LCH. The objective of this study was to characterize the genomic landscape of adult LCH and correlate molecular findings with clinical features and patient outcomes.
"The number of clinical studies in the Western world has been declining the last decade. Clinical studies offer valuable opportunities for cancer patients to access new treatments and serve as arenas for learning and competence development for health care workers. In addition to this, clinical studies can significantly contribute to financial savings for the health care system through the provision of drugs. The extent of these savings have not been evaluated before."
"Creatine, a naturally occurring compound in mammals, is crucial in energy metabolism, particularly within muscle and brain tissues. While creatine metabolism in cancer has been studied for several decades, emerging studies are beginning to clarify the sometimes-contradictory role creatine has in either the promotion or inhibition of cancer. On one hand, creatine can directly enhance anti-tumor CD8+ T-cell activity and induce tumor apoptosis, contributing to antitumor immunity. Conversely, other studies have shown that creatine can facilitate cancer cell growth and migration by providing an energy source and activating several signaling pathways. This review will examine what is known about creatine in cancer biology, with a focus on understanding its roles across different cellular compartments. Lastly, we discuss the emerging roles of creatine metabolism, providing exciting new insights into this often-overlooked pathway. This review highlights the complex role of creatine in cancer development and treatment, offering insights into its potential as both a therapeutic target and a risk factor in oncogenesis."
"Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is a frequent additional finding on lung cancer screening (LCS) low-dose computed tomography (LDCT). Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major cause of death in LCS participants. We aimed to describe prevalence of incidental CAC detected on LDCT in LCS participants without prior history of coronary artery disease (CAD), evaluate their CVD risk and describe subsequent investigation and management."
"The four members of the p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) family are serine/threonine protein kinases, which are phosphorylated and activated by ERK1/2. RSK1/2/3 are further phosphorylated by PDK1. Receiving inputs from two major signaling pathways places RSK as a key signaling node in numerous pathologies. A plethora of RSK1/2 substrates have been identified, and in the majority of cases the causative roles these RSK substrates play in the pathology are unknown."
"With the expansion of professional autonomy and prescriptive authority of advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs), interactions with industry are under greater scrutiny.

"Pregnancy is a transformative period marked by profound physical and emotional changes, with far-reaching consequences for both mother and child. Emerging research has illustrated the pivotal role of a mother's diet during pregnancy in influencing the prenatal gut microbiome and subsequently shaping the neurodevelopment of her offspring. The intricate interplay between maternal gut health, nutrition, and neurodevelopmental outcomes has emerged as a captivating field of investigation within developmental science. Acting as a dynamic bridge between mother and fetus, the maternal gut microbiome, directly and indirectly, impacts the offspring's neurodevelopment through diverse pathways. This comprehensive review delves into a spectrum of studies, clarifying putative mechanisms through which maternal nutrition, by modulating the gut microbiota, orchestrates the early stages of brain development. Drawing insights from animal models and human cohorts, this work underscores the profound implications of maternal gut health for neurodevelopmental trajectories and offers a glimpse into the formulation of targeted interventions able to optimize the health of both mother and offspring. The prospect of tailored dietary recommendations for expectant mothers emerges as a promising and accessible intervention to foster the growth of beneficial gut bacteria, potentially leading to enhanced cognitive outcomes and reduced risks of neurodevelopmental disorders."
"Global warming and declining rainfall in recent years have led to increased water and soil salinity in Iran agricultural lands. To address these challenges, greenhouse cultivation, particularly soilless culture, emerges as a critical solution for mitigating the effect of soil salinity and water scarcity on vegetable plant production in Iran. The aim of this experiment was to compare the growth and physiological responses of cucumber plants cultivated in both soil and soilless systems, using three distinct nutrient solutions. With this purpose, a factorial experiment carried out with two factors of cultivation system (Soil cultivation and soilless cultivation) and nutrient solution (Hoagland, Papadopoulos, and Commercial) in a completely randomized design with three replications in greenhouse conditions. Cucumber seeds of the Nagene 792 F1 variety were sown in cultivation trays filled with a mixture of perlite and cocopeat (in a 1:1 ratio) to produce seedlings, which were then placed in the growbag with the same substrate in greenhouse environment. Additionally, in soil-based cultivation, the seeds were first sown in cultivation trays and then transferred to 10-L pots containing soil medium. The results of this study showed that the soilless culture system increased vegetative and reproductive characteristics such as plant height (13%), number of nodes (9.4%), internode distance, number of leaves, leaf area (31.45%), fresh and dry mass of shoots, fresh (21%) and dry (33%) mass of roots, number of flowers (9.4%), number of fruits (10.12%), and fruit diameter (19.5%) in cucumber plants. Soilless cultivation increased the yield per plant and cultivation area (52%). The photosynthetic pigments (27.5% and 49.18% for Chl a and b, respectively), and fruit quality traits including fruit appearance color (the components a (16.42%), b (19.44%), and L (1.87%), hue angle (32.74%), and chroma (15.13%)), total soluble solids (TSS) (7%) and vitamin C (31.85%) increased compared to soil-grown plants. The results showed that the percentage of flower fall in soil-grown plants was higher than the plants in soilless medium. Hoagland nutrient solution had a more significant effect on increasing these parameters than other nutrient solutions. Although, the highest flowering rate was observed in nutrient solution of Hochmat and Papadopoulos. Overall, soilless cultivation using the Hoagland nutrient solution significantly enhanced growth and yield characteristics, as well as both the quantitative and qualitative traits of the fruit and physiological characteristics, compared to the other treatment methods."
"Knowledge about trends and epidemiology of pediatric burns is useful to identify patterns, to advance medical research, and to design prevention programs and resource allocation. The aim of this study is to describe the epidemiology and trends of pediatric burns between 2009 and 2022 in the three Dutch burn centers. A secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on the pattern of pediatric burns. A register-based cohort study was conducted based on data from the Dutch Burn Repository R3. Patients between 0 and 17 years at the time of the burn injury admitted between 2009 and 2022 to one of the three burn centers were included. Descriptive statistics were used to investigate the incidence and patient, burn, and treatment characteristics. The COVID-19 pandemic years (2020-2021) were compared with the pooled results from pre-COVID-19 years (2017-2019). A total of 4017 patients were included in this study, of which 3085 (77%) were overnight admissions. The incidence and absolute number of pediatric burn admissions gradually increased over the years, with a small temporary decrease in 2020-2021. Patient and burn characteristics remained relatively consistent over the years. Three quarters of all patients were between 0 and 3 years old, and the majority were boys (59%). A decreasing ratio of length of stay per % total burned surface area and an increase in day admissions was observed since 2016 onwards, which intensified during the COVID-19 pandemic."
"Environmental chemical exposure has been rising over the past few decades but its impact on fertility remains uncertain. We assessed exposures to 23 common chemicals across a range of sociodemographic characteristics and their relationship with self-reported infertility. The analytic sample was non-pregnant women aged 18-49 years without a history of hysterectomy or oophorectomy (n = 2579) from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2013-2016). Environmental chemical exposure was assessed with biospecimens and dichotomized as high and low levels of exposure based on the median. Logistic regression models estimated the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between high levels of exposure and infertility, adjusted for age, race, education level, family income, and smoking status. We observed associations between infertility and cadmium [aOR: 1.88; 95% CI: 1.02-3.47] and arsenic [aOR: 1.88 (1.05-3.36)]. Two pesticides hexachlorobenzene [OR: 2.04 (1.05-3.98)] and oxychlordane [OR: 2.04 (1.12-3.69)] were also associated with infertility in unadjusted analyses. There were negative associations with two Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances with n-perfluorooctanoic acid [aOR: 0.51: (0.30-0.86)] and n-perfluorooctane sulfonic acid [aOR: 0.51: (0.26-0.97). Specific chemicals may contribute to infertility risk, highlighting the need for targeted public health strategies to mitigate exposure."
"Preeclampsia (PE) is a complex pregnancy syndrome characterized by hypertension with or without proteinuria, affecting 2-6% of pregnancies globally. PE is characterized by excessive release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) into the maternal circulation. This DAMP-rich milieu acts on innate immune cells, inducing a proinflammatory state characterized by elevated cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18. This proinflammatory state in the mother and placenta results in the endothelial dysfunction strongly associated with cardiovascular disorders. While the immediate maternal and fetal risks of PE are well-documented, accumulating evidence indicates that PE also confers long-term cardiovascular risks to the mother, including hypertension, coronary heart disease, stroke, and heart failure. The underlying mechanisms connecting PE to these chronic cardiovascular conditions remain unclear. This article explores the potential role of trained innate immunity (TRIM) as a mechanistic link between PE and increased long-term cardiovascular risk. We propose that the persistent exposure to DAMPs during PE may epigenetically reprogram maternal innate immune cells and their progenitors, leading to TRIM. This reprogramming enhances the inflammatory response to subsequent stimuli, potentially contributing to endothelial dysfunction and chronic inflammation that predispose women to cardiovascular diseases later in life. Understanding the role of TRIM in PE could provide novel insights into the pathophysiology of PE-related cardiovascular complications and identify potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Further research is warranted to investigate the epigenetic and metabolic alterations in innate immune cells induced by PE and to determine how these changes may influence long-term maternal cardiovascular health."
"In this study, a method for determining the optimal location and orientation of an implantable piezoelectric accelerometer on the short process of the incus is presented. The accelerometer is intended to be used as a replacement for an external microphone to enable totally implantable auditory prostheses. The optimal orientation of the sensor and the best attachment point are determined based on two criteria-maximum pressure sensitivity sum and minimum loudness level sum. The best location is determined to be near the incudomalleolar joint. We find that the angular orientation of the sensor is critical and provide guidelines on that orientation. The method described in this paper can be used to further optimize the design and performance of the accelerometer."
"The critical role played by vascular dysfunction and ineffective angiogenesis in the pathophysiology of systemic sclerosis (SSc) suggests that circulating biomarkers reflecting these alterations may be useful in the clinical evaluation of this patient group. We sought to address this issue by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies investigating a such candidate biomarker, endostatin, an endogenous glycoprotein exerting anti-angiogenic effects, in SSc patients and healthy controls."
"A novel dual-parameter optical fiber biosensor based on surface plasmon resonance (SPR) for simultaneous measurement of urea and uric acid concentrations is proposed in this paper. Based on the principle of positive and negative electric combination, ZnO nanoparticles is selected as the matrix for immobilizing urease and uricase with selective recognition ability, which can also be used as a sensitizing material to increase the refractive index detection sensitivity of SPR by 22%. Then, Nafion ion exchange membrane was introduced to wrap the urea sensing area to avoid crosstalk caused by the overlap of adjacent sensing areas. The difference in the number of enzymes loaded on ZnO nanoparticles was used to meet the refractive index gap for forming dual SPR detection channels. Experiments indicate that the sensitivity of urea detection is 1.6 nm/mM in the range of 1-9 mM urea concentration. The detection sensitivity of uric acid is 36 nm/mM in the concentration range of 50-500 μM. The detection ability of the sensor to actual biological samples was verified by serum samples, which proved that the sensor has practical application potential and reliable selectivity. It can provide a new idea for the research and development of multi-parameter optical fiber biosensors."
"In evolutionary game theory, a relative comparison of the cost and benefit associated with obtaining a resource, called payoff, is used as an indicator of fitness of an organism. Payoffs of different strategies, quantitatively represented as payoff matrices, are used to understand complex inter-species and intra-species interactions like cooperation, mutualism, and altruism. Payoff matrices, however, are usually treated as invariant with time-largely due to the absence of any empirical data quantifying their evolution. In this paper, we present empirical evidence of three types of resource-dependent changes in the payoff matrices of evolving Saccharomyces cerevisiae populations. We show that depending on the carbon source and participating genotypes, N-player games could collapse, be born, or be maintained. Our results highlight the need to consider the dynamic nature of payoff matrices while making even short-term predictions about population interactions and dynamics."
This guideline establishes clinical practice recommendations for treatment of restless legs syndrome (RLS) and periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD) in adults and pediatric patients.
"Perturbation-based training improves reactive stepping responses to prevent falling following a loss-of-balance. As there is currently no safe and feasible method for home-based practice, this randomized study investigated whether action observation with motor simulation (AOMS) of balance recovery improves reactive stepping in older adults with a history of falls. Additionally, we evaluated whether effects differ between AOMS of a human actor in the same experimental context or of an avatar in a virtual world."
"Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) is an inherited disease caused by a deficiency of the enzyme arylsulfatase A (ARSA). Lentivirus-modified autologous hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy (HSCGT) has recently been approved for clinical use in pre and early symptomatic children with MLD to increase ARSA activity. Unfortunately, this advanced therapy is not available for most patients with MLD who have progressed to more advanced symptomatic stages at diagnosis. Patients with late-onset juvenile MLD typically present with a slower neurological progression of symptoms and represent a significant burden to the economy and healthcare system, whereas those with early onset infantile MLD die within a few years of symptom onset. We conducted a pilot study to determine the safety and benefit of HSCGT in patients with postsymptomatic juvenile MLD and report preliminary results. The safety profile of HSCGT was favorable in this long-term follow-up over 9 years. The most common adverse events (AEs) within 2 months of HSCGT were related to busulfan conditioning, and all AEs resolved. No HSCGT-related AEs and no evidence of distorted hematopoietic differentiation during long-term follow-up for up to 9.6 years. Importantly, to date, patients have maintained remarkably improved ARSA activity with a stable disease state, including increased Functional Independence Measure (FIM) score and decreased magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lesion score. This long-term follow-up pilot study suggests that HSCGT is safe and provides clinical benefit to patients with postsymptomatic juvenile MLD."
"In phylogenetic studies, both partitioned models and mixture models are used to account for heterogeneity in molecular evolution among the sites of DNA sequence alignments. Partitioned models require the user to specify the grouping of sites into subsets, and then assume that each subset of sites can be modeled by a single common process. Mixture models do not require users to prespecify subsets of sites, and instead calculate the likelihood of every site under every model, while co-estimating the model weights and parameters. While much research has gone into the optimization of partitioned models by merging user-specified subsets, there has been less attention paid to the optimization of mixture models for DNA sequence alignments. In this study, we first ask whether a key assumption of partitioned models-that each user-specified subset can be modeled by a single common process-is supported by the data. Having shown that this is not the case, we then design, implement, test, and apply an algorithm, MixtureFinder, to select the optimum number of classes for a mixture model of Q-matrices for the standard models of DNA sequence evolution. We show this algorithm performs well on simulated and empirical datasets and suggest that it may be useful for future empirical studies. MixtureFinder is available in IQ-TREE2, and a tutorial for using MixtureFinder can be found here: http://www.iqtree.org/doc/Complex-Models#mixture-models."
"Certain patients must undergo frequent postoperative digital subtraction angiography (DSA) after flow diversion (FD) therapy. No imaging modality with an efficacy comparable to that of DSA has been established. This study was conducted to determine the efficacy of contrast-enhanced delay alternating with nutation for tailored excitation (DANTE) T1-sampling perfection with application-optimized contrasts by using different flip angle evolution (SPACE), a high-resolution vessel wall magnetic resonance imaging technique for evaluating the occlusion status of intracranial aneurysms after FD treatment, with DSA serving as the reference standard."
Effective patient-centered care requires an adequate understanding of patient preferences for different therapeutic options. We modelled patient preference for blood pressure (BP) management by pharmaceutical or interventional treatments such as renal denervation in patients with different profiles of uncontrolled hypertension.
"The use of neuromodulators for cosmetic purposes has a remarkable safety record; nevertheless, unwanted effects can and do sometimes occur when neurotoxins are used for facial rejuvenation, such as neutralizing antibodies and eyelid ptosis. The primary objective of the following roundtable discussion was to review the most commonly reported complications from neurotoxins and summarize considerations for reducing the risk of complications. A roundtable discussion was held by 5 notable experts in their field during a special addition of the Thriving in Diversity webinar series on Thursday, February 15, 2024. Three presenters were provided with an opportunity to share their knowledge. Common complications associated with the use of neuromodulators include lack of response due to neutralizing antibody formation and eyelid ptosis. Common complications, such as neutralizing antibodies, can often be prevented by avoiding known risk factors. The use of topical alpha adrenergic agonists can often improve the appearance of eyelid ptosis. The cosmetic use of neuromodulators remains extremely safe, and serious adverse events rarely occur.

"The triglyceride glucose (TyG) index-related obesity indices have been proposed as reliable indicators of insulin resistance. This study aims to investigate the association between TyG index-related obesity indices and sarcopenia as well as their potential as a tool for screening sarcopenic patients. A cross-sectional study was conducted involving 7,161 participants aged 18 and above from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. TyG index and TyG index-related obesity indices, including triglyceride glucose-body mass index (TyG-BMI), triglyceride glucose-waist circumference (TyG-WC), and triglyceride glucose-waist-to-height ratio (TyG-WHtR) were determined using standard formulas. The ratio of appendicular skeletal muscle mass to BMI were used to assess sarcopenia. The relationship between the TyG index as well as TyG index-related obesity indices and sarcopenia was investigated using restricted cubic spline analysis and multivariate logistic regression analysis. The diagnostic value of the TyG index and TyG index -related obesity indices for sarcopenia was compared using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. In the fully adjusted regression model, a positive correlation was observed between the TyG-WHtR index and sarcopenia (for each one-unit increase in TyG-WHtR index: OR = 3.57, 95% CI: 2.71-4.71, P < 0.001). Additionally, regression analyses demonstrated TyG-WHtR as a significant predictor of sarcopenia with the highest odds ratio, reaching 12.50 (95% CI: 6.13-25.70, P < 0.001) for the upper fourth quartile (Q4) compared to the first quartile, followed by followed by TyG-BMI (Q4: 3.34; 95% CI: 1.92-5.80, P < 0.001) and TyG-WC (Q4: 1.95; 95% CI: 1.04-3.68, P < 0.001). The RCS curve fitting analysis indicated a U-shaped relationship between TyG-WHtR and the diagnosis of sarcopenia, with an inflection point at 4.02. Furthermore, in the ROC analysis, the AUC for the diagnosis of sarcopenia was largest for TyG-WHtR (0.79, P < 0.001). The TyG ndex-related obesity indices, especially TyG-WHtR, have been shown to be more effective in identifying sarcopenia patients than TyG alone."
"Face recognition is an important aspect of human non-verbal communication. Event-related potentials or magnetic fields, such as the N170/M170 component, are considered essential neural markers of face processing. Compared to upright human faces, inverted human faces and upright but not inverted animal faces cause longer latencies and larger amplitudes of these components. However, the mechanisms underlying this factor remain unclear. To elucidate the spatiotemporal dynamics of the processing of inverted human and animal faces, we recorded face-selective responses (M170) to upright and inverted human and monkey faces using a 306-channel whole-head magnetoencephalography. Sensor analysis showed an increased M170 latency and amplitude for inverted human and upright animal faces. However, in the source analysis, the observed modulations of the estimated spatiotemporal dynamics were different from the sensor results: irrespective of species, upright faces activated wider areas in the ventral and dorsal visual regions compared with inverted faces. Additionally, face orientation differentially modulated the anterior region of the fusiform gyrus (FG) in both face categories. These results suggest that spatiotemporal dynamics differ in face orientation regardless of category and that the FG contributes little or nothing to the M170 modulation recorded in the scalp sensor. Furthermore, we demonstrated that inverted human and animal faces are processed via different mechanisms."
"This study aims to evaluate cognitive impairments in patients with acute cerebellar infarction using event-related potentials (ERP) and electrophysiological source imaging (ESI). Thirty patients with acute cerebellar infarction and 32 healthy volunteers were selected. Cognitive potentials were recorded and measured using a visual Oddball paradigm. Source analysis of the N170 component was performed using standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) to compare the standardized current density distribution between the two groups under different stimuli. For inverted and upright face stimuli, the amplitudes of N170, VPP, and N300 in the patient group were significantly lower than those in the control group (p < 0.05). For upright house stimuli, the VPP amplitude in the patient group was also lower than that in the control group (p < 0.05). Source analysis revealed that the brain regions with significant differences between the acute cerebellar infarction group and the control group included the temporal and parietal lobes. Specifically, activation in the precuneus was reduced during inverted face stimuli; activation in the middle temporal gyrus was reduced during upright face stimuli; and activation in the middle temporal gyrus and fusiform gyrus was increased during both inverted and upright house stimuli. Patients with acute cerebellar infarction exhibit abnormal P100, N170/VPP, and N300 amplitudes. Source analysis of the N170 component revealed altered activation in the middle and inferior temporal gyri, fusiform gyrus, middle occipital gyrus, and precuneus, which play a role in selective cognitive impairments following cerebellar infarction."
"Social encounters are inherently multisensory events, yet how and where social cues of distinct sensory modalities merge and interact in the brain is poorly understood. When their pups wander away from the nest, mother mice use a combination of vocal and olfactory signals emitted by the pups to locate and retrieve them. Previous work revealed the emergence of multisensory interactions in the auditory cortex (AC) of both dams and virgins who cohabitate with pups (""surrogates""). Here, we identify a neural pathway that relays information about odors to the AC to be integrated with responses to sound. We found that a scattered population of glutamatergic neurons in the basal amygdala (BA) projects to the AC and responds to odors, including the smell of pups. These neurons exhibit increased activity when the female is searching for pups that terminates upon contact. Finally, we show that selective optogenetic activation of BA-AC neurons modulates responses to pup calls, and that this modulation switches from predominantly suppressive to predominantly excitatory after maternal experience. This supports an underappreciated role for the amygdala in directly shaping sensory representations in an experience-dependent manner. We propose that the BA-AC pathway supports integration of olfaction and audition to facilitate maternal care and speculate that it may carry valence information to the AC."
"Data-independent acquisition has become a widely used strategy for peptide and protein quantification in liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry-based proteomics studies. The integration of ion mobility separation into data-independent acquisition analysis, such as the diaPASEF technology available on Bruker's timsTOF platform, further improves the quantification accuracy and protein depth achievable using data-independent acquisition. We introduce diaTracer, a spectrum-centric computational tool optimized for diaPASEF data. diaTracer performs three-dimensional (mass to charge ratio, retention time, ion mobility) peak tracing and feature detection to generate precursor-resolved ""pseudo-tandem mass spectra"", facilitating direct (""spectral-library free"") peptide identification and quantification from diaPASEF data. diaTracer is available as a stand-alone tool and is fully integrated into the widely used FragPipe computational platform. We demonstrate the performance of diaTracer and FragPipe using diaPASEF data from triple-negative breast cancer, cerebrospinal fluid, and plasma samples, data from phosphoproteomics and human leukocyte antigens immunopeptidomics experiments, and low-input data from a spatial proteomics study. We also show that diaTracer enables unrestricted identification of post-translational modifications from diaPASEF data using open/mass-offset searches."
"Veterans are disproportionately affected by chronic pain and are more likely to be prescribed opioids. As a means of risk mitigation, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Department of Defense recommend naloxone for patients on opioids with risk factors, including use of ≥50 morphine milligram equivalents daily, concurrent benzodiazepine/sedative use, and pulmonary or liver disease. An interprofessional quality improvement team consisting of 6 residents, a pharmacist, a nurse educator, and a faculty mentor was formed to increase naloxone coprescriptions at a regional VA medical center Continuity of Care Clinic. Primary intervention identified eligible patients via the VA Primary Care Almanac's Opioid Therapy Risk Report and alerted providers by email and secure messaging. Naloxone coprescription rates increased from 42% initially in June 2022 to 82% by June 2023 (29/69 to 41/50 patients, P < 0.0001). This project demonstrates that notifying providers of high-risk patients can significantly increase naloxone coprescriptions."
"Metarrestin (ML246) is a first-in-class pyrrole-pyrimidine-derived small molecule that selectively targets the perinucleolar compartment (PNC). PNC is a distinct subnuclear structure predominantly found in solid tumor cells. The occurrence of PNC demonstrates a positive correlation with malignancy, serving as an indicator of tumor aggressiveness, progression, and metastasis. Various promising preclinical results have led to the clinical translation of metarrestin into a first-in-human trial. This review aims to summarize (i) the current understanding of the structure and function of PNC and its role in cancer progression and metastasis, (ii) key findings from studies examining the effect of metarrestin on various cancers across the translational spectrum, including in vitro, in vivo, and human clinical trial studies, and (iii) the pharmaceutical relevance of metarrestin as a promising anticancer candidate. Furthermore, our molecular docking and MD simulation studies show that metarrestin binds to eEF1A1 and eEF1A2 with a strong and stable affinity and inhibits eEF1A2 more efficiently compared to eEF1A1. The promising results from preclinical studies suggest that metarrestin has the potential to revolutionize the treatment of cancer, heralding a paradigm shift in its therapeutic management."
"Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common type of kidney cancer arising from renal tubular epithelial cells and is characterized by a high aggressive behavior and invasiveness that lead to poor prognosis and high mortality rate. Diagnosis of RCC is generally incidental and occurs when the stage is advanced and the disease is already metastatic. The management of RCC is further complicated by an intrinsic resistance of this malignancy to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, which aggravates the prognosis. For these reasons, there is intense research focused on identifying novel biomarkers which may be useful for a better prognostic assessment, as well as molecular markers which could be utilized for targeted therapy. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a transcriptional factor that has been identified as a key modulator of oxidative stress response, and its overexpression is considered a negative prognostic feature in several types of cancers including RCC, since it is involved in various key cancer-promoting functions such as proliferation, anabolic metabolism and resistance to chemotherapy. Given the key role of Nrf2 in promoting tumor progression, this enzyme could be a promising biomarker for a more accurate prediction of RCC course and it can also represent a valuable therapeutic target. In this review, we provide a comprehensive literature analysis of studies that have explored the role of Nrf2 in RCC, underlining the possible implications for targeted therapy."
"Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, plays a pivotal role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by eliminating damaged or surplus cells. Dysregulation of signaling pathways, such as JAK/STAT, is implicated in various diseases, rendering them attractive therapeutic targets for potential new anticancer drugs. Concurrently, it is imperative to preserve essential proteins like TNF-α and p53 to maintain normal cellular life/death balance. In light of these considerations, this study employs an innovative in silico hybrid and hierarchical virtual screening approach aimed at identifying JAK/STAT multi-target inhibitors as potential anticancer agents for several tumoral diseases. Initially, the Biotarget Predictor Tool is utilized in a combined ON/OFF-target/Multitarget mode using the extensive National Cancer Institute (NCI) database, previously filtered by ADME evaluation tools. Subsequently, Molecular Docking studies are conducted on JAK2, JAK3, and STAT3, facilitating the identification of the most promising compound, 755435. Finally, Molecular Dynamics Simulations validate the high stability of the potential multitarget inhibitor 755435 in complex with JAK2, JAK3, and STAT3."
"Environmental issues have resulted in the forming of sustainable materials, including natural fiber-reinforced PLA composites; nonetheless, this composite has low water resistance, resulting in poor composite performance. This research aims to investigate the impact of adding a small amount of graphene nanoplatelets (GNP) on the water absorption (WA) characteristic of bamboo/kenaf-reinforced PLA hybrid composites. The physical behavior and water resistance of the composites, as well as the mechanical performance and surface after 14 days of immersion, were comprehensively investigated. The study discovered that adding a small amount of GNP to composites increased their density, with the highest density of 1.6326 g/cm3 (1GBK), and altered the chemical composition's transmittance. Also, the inclusion of GNP increases the composite's crystallinity. Furthermore, the addition of GNP resulted in a decline in WA, with the lowest absorption being 4.95 % (1GBK), which is supported by the composites' increased contact angle. After 14 days of immersion, the GNP-filled composites were superior to the BK sample in terms of mechanical properties. When fibers absorb water, their surface degrades because the fibers are swelling, but GNP functions as a water barrier, preventing surface degradation due to inhibition of fiber swelling. This study highlights the potential for a straightforward and economical method to address the limited water resistance of bamboo/kenaf-reinforced PLA hybrid composites, a limitation that hinders their widespread use."
"Despite youth's shift from Facebook to Instagram, the literature on how to use Instagram to recruit youth for clinical trials is scant. This paper reports procedures and comparative metrics on the use of Facebook and Instagram to recruit a nationwide sample (N = 1216) of LGBQ youth, aged 15 and 16 years, for an online drug abuse prevention trial."
"Heart failure (HF) and renal dysfunction often coexist and interact in many complex and bidirectional pathways, leading to detrimental effects on patient outcomes. The treatment of HF patients with renal dysfunction presents a significant clinical challenge. Interestingly, sacubitril/valsartan, an angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI), may have beneficial effects on cardiac and renal outcomes in patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction, particularly by slowing the rate of decrease in the estimated glomerular filtration rate compared to a single angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Recently, more reports have emphasized the renal protection of sacubitril/valsartan in patients with HF. In HF patients with renal dysfunction, however, there is no strong evidence supporting the use of sacubitril/valsartan to reduce the absolute risk of hyperkalemia and worsening renal function; therefore, the administration of ARNI requires a careful balance between the benefits and risks. Furthermore, the lack of evidence-based management highlights the importance of an individualized approach based on published experience and multidisciplinary collaborations, as well as underlines the need for in-depth studies investigating the underlying mechanisms in cardiorenal interactions with a focus on treatments."

"Objective To assess the value of the MRI-based ovarian-adnexal reporting and data system (O-RADS MRI) for the diagnosis of adnexal masses. Methods A total of 407 patients who underwent dynamic contrast enhancement (DCE)-MRI and pathological examination (gold standard) at the Department of Radiology,Central Hospital of Wuhan between May 2017 and December 2022 were enrolled in this study.Two radiologists performed the O-RADS MRI scoring of adnexal masses according to MRI features and calculated the malignancy rate of adnexal masses by O-RADS MRI score,enhancement type,and mass type.Moreover,receiver operating characteristic curves were established to further evaluate the diagnostic values of O-RADS MRI score,enhancement type,and mass type for adnexal masses. Results A total of 502 adnexal masses were identified in the 407 patients enrolled in this study,including 364 benign masses and 138 malignant masses (including junctional masses).Radiologist 1 reported the malignancy rates of 0,0,5.4%,80.0%,and 89.7% and radiologist 2 reported the malignancy rates of 0,0,5.8%,86.2%,and 83.0% for the adnexal masses with the O-RADS MRI scores of 1-5,respectively.With O-RADS MRI ≥4 indicating malignant masses,the sensitivity,specificity,accuracy,positive predictive value,negative predictive value,false negative rate,and false positive rate were 94.2%,93.6%,93.8%,84.9%,97.7%,2.3%,and 15.1% for radiologist 1 and 93.4%,93.6%,93.6%,85.4%,97.4%,3.6%,and 14.6% for radiologist 2,respectively.The malignancy rates of the adnexal masses presenting no enhancement,cystic wall enhancement,type Ⅰ curve,type Ⅱ curve,and type Ⅲ curve were 0,1.3%,5.7%,81.2%,and 89.0% as reported by radiologist 1 and 0,1.2%,11.3%,87.6%,and 80.0% as reported by radiologist 2,respectively.The malignancy rates of the adnexal masses that were cystic lesions,cystic segregated lesions,solid lesions,cystic solid lesions,and cystic solid segregated lesions were 0,7.1%,38.7%,79.1%,and 89.8% as reported by radiologist 1 and 0,8.1%,37.8%,72.4%,and 89.6% as reported by radiologist 2,respectively.With type Ⅱ and type Ⅲ curves as the criteria for malignancy,the sensitivity of radiologists 1 and 2 was lower for cystic segregated lesions,both at 50.0%.For the masses containing solid components,radiologists 1 and 2 demonstrated low specificity,which was 57.7% and 56.5%,respectively.False-positive masses contained solid components and were mostly fibroadenomas or adnexal leiomyomas,while false-negative masses were mostly junctional cystadenomas with no or few solid components. Conclusions The O-RADS MRI risk stratification has a high diagnostic value for adnexal masses.Further evaluation and refinement are needed to reduce the false-positive rate."

"Gene regulation is inherently multiscale, but scale-adaptive machine learning methods that fully exploit this property in single-nucleus accessibility data are still lacking. Here, we develop ChromatinHD, a pair of scale-adaptive models that uses the raw accessibility data, without peak-calling or windows, to link regions to gene expression and determine differentially accessible chromatin. We show how ChromatinHD consistently outperforms existing peak and window-based approaches and find that this is due to a large number of uniquely captured, functional accessibility changes within and outside of putative cis-regulatory regions. Furthermore, ChromatinHD can delineate collaborating regulatory regions, including their preferential genomic conformations, that drive gene expression. Finally, our models also use changes in ATAC-seq fragment lengths to identify dense binding of transcription factors, a feature not captured by footprinting methods. Altogether, ChromatinHD, available at https://chromatinhd.org , is a suite of computational tools that enables a data-driven understanding of chromatin accessibility at various scales and how it relates to gene expression."
"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) represents a multifaceted pathological condition resulting from external forces that disrupt neuronal integrity and function. This narrative review explores the intricate relationship between dietary macronutrients, gut microbiota (GM), and neuroinflammation in the TBI. We delineate the dual aspects of TBI: the immediate mechanical damage (primary injury) and the subsequent biological processes (secondary injury) that exacerbate neuronal damage. Dysregulation of the gut-brain axis emerges as a critical factor in the neuroinflammatory response, emphasizing the role of the GM in mediating immune responses. Recent evidence indicates that specific macronutrients, including lipids, proteins, and probiotics, can influence microbiota composition and in turn modulate neuroinflammation. Moreover, specialized dietary interventions may promote resilience against secondary insults and support neurological recovery post-TBI. This review aims to synthesize the current preclinical and clinical evidence on the potential of dietary strategies in mitigating neuroinflammatory pathways, suggesting that targeted nutrition and gut health optimization could serve as promising therapeutic modalities in TBI management."
"Tarsal coalition is a disorder of the foot characterized by the abnormal union between 2 or more of the tarsal bones. A minority of patients will develop pain and limited motion when reaching adolescence, for whom surgical resection of the coalition may be necessary. The diagnostic value of clinical and radiologic signs remains unclear. The aim of this study is to assess the predictive value of clinical symptoms and plain x-rays to diagnose tarsal coalition in symptomatic patients."
"Long noncoding RNAs known as roX (RNA on the X) are crucial for male development in Drosophila, as their loss leads to male lethality from the late larval stages. While roX RNAs are recognized for their role in sex-chromosome dosage compensation, ensuring balanced expression of X-linked genes in both sexes, their potential influence on autosomal gene regulation remains unexplored. Here, using an integrative multi-omics approach, we show that roX RNAs not only govern the X chromosome but also target genes on autosomes that lack male-specific lethal (MSL) complex occupancy, together with Polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs). We observed that roX RNAs colocalize with MSL proteins on the X chromosome and PRC components on autosomes. Intriguingly, loss of roX function reduces X-chromosomal H4K16ac levels and autosomal H3K27me3 levels. Correspondingly, X-linked genes display reduced expression, whereas many autosomal genes exhibit elevated expression upon roX loss. Our findings propose a dual role for roX RNAs: activators of X-linked genes and repressors of autosomal genes, achieved through interactions with MSL and PRC complexes, respectively. This study uncovers the unconventional epigenetic repressive function of roX RNAs with PRC interaction."
"Upon invasion into the host cell, a subset of bacterial pathogens resides exclusively in the cytosol. While previous research revealed how they reshape the plasma membrane during invasion, subvert the immune response, and hijack cytoskeletal dynamics to promote their motility, it was unclear if these pathogens also interacted with the organelles in this crowded intracellular space. Here, we examined if the obligate intracellular pathogen Rickettsia parkeri interacts with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a large and dynamic organelle spread throughout the cell. Using live-cell microscopy and transmission and focused-ion-beam scanning electron microscopy, we show that R. parkeri forms extensive contacts with the rough ER that are ∼55 nm apart and cover more than half the bacterial surface. Depletion of the ER-specific tethers VAPA and VAPB reduced rickettsia-ER contacts, and VAPA and VAPB were localized around intracellular rickettsiae. Overall, our findings illuminate an interkingdom ER contact uniquely mediated by rickettsiae that mimics some characteristics of traditional host membrane contact sites."
"The Covid pandemic and its aftermath have triggered new alarm and social unrest across the Global South over the deepening international debt crisis that now threatens to derail Universal Health Coverage (UHC), other Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), future pandemic preparedness, and global warming mitigation. The recent Globalization and Health article by Alex Kentikelenis and Thomas Stubbs (May 2024), ""Social protection and the International Monetary Fund: promise versus performance"", offers a meticulously quantified rendering of the social costs imposed by the crisis and takes aim at IMF solutions. They advocate for a rejection of IMF austerity programs and offer a valuable prescription for change through the International Labor Organization's ""Universal Social Protection"" concept."
"The increasing frequency of heat stress events due to climate change disrupts all stages of plant growth, significantly reducing yields, especially in crops like mung bean (Vigna radiata (L.) R. Wilczek). Mung beans are vital grain legumes in Southeast Asian countries and are crucial for food security. Thus, it is essential to understand the physiological and yield-related trait responses of mung bean genotypes and harness germplasm with enhanced heat tolerance to mitigate the impact of rising heat stress on mung bean yield. This study assesses the physiological and yield-related responses of ten diverse mung bean genotypes grown under three temperature regimes (34/25 °C, 39/30 °C, and 42/30 °C) in three growth chambers. We found significant genetic variability in phenological, physiological, and yield-related traits under control and heat stress conditions. Severe leaf damage, indicated by high cell membrane injury, reduced chlorophyll index, and diminished chlorophyll fluorescence, was observed under 39/30 °C and 42/30 °C conditions. Similarly, significant reductions in yield component traits, including effective pods per plant, total seeds per plant, single-seed weight, and seed yield per plant, were evident in the tested genotypes under 39/30 °C and 42/30 °C conditions. Correlation analysis suggested that selecting genotypes with higher chlorophyll index and increased canopy temperature depression could help identify mung bean varieties with enhanced pod and seed yields under heat stress. Clustering analysis identified genotypes PI 425425, PI 425238, and PI 363361 as potential candidates for breeding programs to develop climate-resilient cultivars."

"Sperm identification is crucial in sexual assault cases. While microscopic analysis is the gold standard for sperm detection, it is a laborious procedure even for trained personnel. Reverse transcription-quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) can enhance the screening by detecting sperm-specific mRNA markers, such as protamine 2 (PRM2). This study aimed to develop a one-step RT-qPCR assay targeting PRM2 mRNA. Our assay was capable of detecting as low as 0.01 μL of semen with high specificity and demonstrated successful detection of PRM2 mRNA in simulated-case samples. Owing to the simple workflow involved, our assay requires <30 min for RNA extraction and <60 min for RT-qPCR. Our assay enables high-throughput sperm screening and offers a promising strategy for enhancing the workflow of sexual assault cases."
"Enantioseparation and enantiorecognition are crucial in the pharmaceutical analysis of chiral substances, impacting safety, efficacy, and regulatory compliance. Enantioseparation refers to the process of separating enantiomers from a mixture, typically achieved through chromatography techniques like HPLC and SFC. In contrast, enantiorecognition involves the identification of enantiomers based on their interaction with a chiral selector without the need for separation. Recent advancements in these techniques have significantly improved enantioseparation efficiency and resolution. Chiral stationary phases (CSPs) have evolved, offering better selectivity, including hybrid organic-inorganic materials and miniaturization. The use of green solvents has also reduced environmental impact. Non-chromatographic methods, such as circular dichroism (CD) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, enable enantiorecognition through interactions with polarized light or chiral solvents. However, these methods face challenges, including high costs, limited solvent compatibility, and shorter operational lifespans compared with chromatographic techniques. Recent developments in solvent-tolerant hybrid CSPs aim to address these limitations. This review highlights these innovations, focusing on their relevance to the pharmaceutical industry, pollution control, and quality assurance, and emphasizes the growing importance of these techniques in the production and regulation of chiral drugs."
"Adherence to 24-h movement guidelines has been associated with early health benefits, including neurodevelopmental outcomes.

"Recent research has concentrated on the development of suitable in vitro cell models for the early identification of hepatotoxicity during drug development in order to reduce the number of animal models and to obtain a better predictability for hepatotoxic reactions in humans. The aim of the presented study was to identify translational biomarkers for acute liver injury in human patients that can serve as biomarkers for hepatocellular injury in vivo and in vitro in simple cell models. Therefore, 188 different metabolites from patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure before and after liver transplantation were analyzed with mass spectrometry. The identified potential metabolic biomarker set, including acylcarnitines, phosphatidylcholines and sphingomyelins, was used to screen primary and permanent hepatocyte culture models for their ability to model hepatotoxic responses caused by different drugs with known and unknown hepatotoxic potential. The results obtained suggest that simple in vitro cell models have the capability to display metabolic responses in biomarkers for liver cell damage in course of the treatment with different drugs and therefore can serve as a basis for in vitro models for metabolic analysis in drug toxicity testing. The identified metabolites should further be evaluated for their potential to serve as a metabolic biomarker set indicating hepatocellular injury in vitro as well as in vivo."
"Microsatellite markers are cost-effective, rapid, efficient, and show great advantages in in large-sample kinship analysis and population structure studies. However, microsatellite loci are seriously underdeveloped in non-model organisms. The plateau zokor (Eospalax baileyi) is a key species living underground in the Tibetan Plateau, the effective management of which has long been challenging. In this study, we analyzed the distribution characteristics and functions of microsatellites in the genome of plateau zokors, and their polymorphic sites. The mononucleotide and dinucleotide types being the most abundant in the genome. The largest number of microsatellites and their abundance in the intergenic region whereas the smallest number of microsatellites and their abundance in the coding region. The coding sequences containing microsatellites were annotated to 52 major functional genes and assigned 19,358 Gene Ontology entries. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway was the most enriched in the signal transduction pathway. Thirteen pairs of polymorphic loci were successfully amplified, with the number of alleles ranging from 3 to 8, observed heterozygosity ranging from 0.059 to 0.810, and expected heterozygosity ranging from 0.469 to 0.854. These microsatellite markers provide a cornerstone for studies on the identification of parentage and population genetics of plateau zokors."
"BACKGROUND: Critical care neuroscience nursing is a specialized field requiring a complex knowledge base and unique clinical orientation. A comprehensive orientation for nurses new to this specialty can improve retention, performance, and satisfaction. Critical care neuroscience orientations are often hospital based and regionally specific, and lack a systematic approach. The aim of this research was to obtain expert consensus on the essential components of a 12- to 18-week critical care neuroscience nursing orientation. METHODS: A Delphi methodology was used to collect expert consensus on the components of a critical care neuroscience nursing orientation. Electronic surveys were distributed to 161 neuroscience critical care orientation experts in 2 Delphi rounds. Participant demographic data and a Likert rating scale (1-5) of literature-based components of a critical care neuroscience orientation were collected. Participants identified additional critical care neuroscience orientation components that were not included in the listed components in round 1 or round 2 of the survey. RESULTS: Round 1 of the survey had 38 responses (23.6%), and round 2 had 23 responses (14.2%). The round 1 survey included 47 elements, and 36 of 47 met the a priori threshold of ≥75% consensus of being important or very important. Two additional elements resulted from write-in recommendations. In round 2, 38 elements were included in the survey, and 37 of 38 elements met consensus. Expert consensus on the essential components of a critical care neuroscience orientation included 37 elements divided among 5 major components. CONCLUSION: Expert consensus was achieved on the essential components of a 12- to 18-week adult critical care neuroscience nursing orientation. Five components and 37 elements were agreed upon by expert consensus."
"Inosine-5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) catalyzes the rate limiting step of de novo purine synthesis. Currently, it remains still largely unknown how this metabolic event is regulated in tumor cells. Here, we report that a deacetylase sirtuin 5 (SIRT5) may possess a regulatory effect on GMP anabolism by desuccinylating IMPDH1. We found that SIRT5 can directly interact with IMPDH1 and promotes desuccinylation on the N terminal of IMPDH1, thereby leading to increased IMPDH enzymatic activity, enhanced purine biosynthesis and promoted cell proliferation. Consistently, downregulation of SIRT5 expression results in decreased IMPDH1 activity and impaired tumor cell proliferation. Therefore, our results reveal that SIRT5-mediated IMPDH1 desuccinylation adapts purine metabolism for rapid cell growth, and could be a potential therapeutic target for tumor cell proliferation inhibition."
"Distinguishing between Parkinson's disease (PD) and essential tremor (ET) can be challenging sometimes. Although positron emission tomography can confirm PD diagnosis, its application is limited by high cost and exposure to radioactive isotopes. Patients with PD exhibit loss of the dorsal nigral hyperintensity on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Novel MRI-based approaches, including susceptibility map-weighted imaging (SMwI), allow visualization of the dorsal nigral hyperintensity at an increased resolution. Herein, we investigated the diagnostic accuracy of dorsal nigral hyperintensity evaluation on SMwI for distinguishing tremor-dominant PD from ET. Consecutive patients with tremor who underwent SMwI and were diagnosed with tremor-dominant PD or ET between July 2021 and July 2022 were enrolled. The dorsal nigral hyperintensity loss on SMwI was compared between the PD and ET groups. All 143 patients (100%) with tremor-dominant PD showed unilateral or bilateral dorsal nigral hyperintensity loss. Among 136 patients with ET, 131 (96.3%) exhibited an intact dorsal nigral hyperintensity, while 5 (3.7%) showed unilateral/bilateral dorsal nigral hyperintensity loss. SMwI discriminated between tremor-dominant PD and ET with a sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 96.3%, respectively."
"Optical aberrations hinder fluorescence microscopy of thick samples, reducing image signal, contrast, and resolution. Here we introduce a deep learning-based strategy for aberration compensation, improving image quality without slowing image acquisition, applying additional dose, or introducing more optics. Our method (i) introduces synthetic aberrations to images acquired on the shallow side of image stacks, making them resemble those acquired deeper into the volume and (ii) trains neural networks to reverse the effect of these aberrations. We use simulations and experiments to show that applying the trained 'de-aberration' networks outperforms alternative methods, providing restoration on par with adaptive optics techniques; and subsequently apply the networks to diverse datasets captured with confocal, light-sheet, multi-photon, and super-resolution microscopy. In all cases, the improved quality of the restored data facilitates qualitative image inspection and improves downstream image quantitation, including orientational analysis of blood vessels in mouse tissue and improved membrane and nuclear segmentation in C. elegans embryos."
"Hamartomas of tuber cinereum present as ectopic tissue in the hypothalamic region. Clinically, the usual hypothalamic hamartomas manifest themself by gelastic seizures and pubertas praecox. We observed an increased coincidence of the presence of X-linked recessive deafness DFNX2 (DFN3) and a hamartoma of the tuber cinereum. Initially five patients presented with hearing loss in childhood, two additional were already adults, not showing any characteristic symptoms for a hamartoma but signs of delayed puberty."
"Overexpression of the myeloid Src-family kinases Fgr and Hck has been linked to the development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here we characterized the contribution of active forms of these kinases to AML cell cytokine dependence, inhibitor sensitivity, and AML cell engraftment in vivo. The human TF-1 erythroleukemia cell line was used as a model system as it does not express endogenous Hck or Fgr. To induce constitutive kinase activity, Hck and Fgr were fused to the coiled-coil (CC) oligomerization domain of the breakpoint cluster region protein associated with the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase in chronic myeloid leukemia. Expression of CC-Hck or CC-Fgr transformed TF-1 cells to a granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-independent phenotype that correlated with enhanced phosphorylation of the kinase domain activation loop. Both CC-Hck and CC-Fgr cell populations became sensitized to growth arrest by Src-family kinase inhibitors previously shown to suppress the growth of bone marrow cells from AML patients in vitro and decrease AML cell engraftment in immunocompromised mice. Methionine substitution of the 'gatekeeper' residue (Thr338) also stimulated Hck and Fgr kinase activity and transformed TF-1 cells to GM-CSF independence without CC fusion. TF-1 cells expressing either active form of Hck or Fgr engrafted immunocompromised mice faster and developed more extensive tumors compared to mice engrafted with the parent cell line, resulting in shorter survival. Expression of wild-type Hck also significantly enhanced bone marrow engraftment without an activating mutation. Reverse phase protein array analysis linked active Hck and Fgr to the mammalian target of rapamycin complex-1/p70 S6 ribosomal protein (mTORC-1/S6) kinase and focal adhesion kinase (Fak) signaling pathways. Combining Hck and Fgr inhibitors with existing mTORC-1/S6 kinase or Fak inhibitors may improve clinical responses and reduce the potential for acquired resistance."
"In 2017 a novel growth factor administration therapy (termed NTCELL®) was trialled for safety and efficacy for Parkinson's disease treatment. NTCELL® administration is the transplantation of encapsulated porcine choroid plexus cells into the putamen. A clinical study demonstrated safety but failed to meet its primary clinical end-point. Here we describe the clinical and neuropathological characteristics of a case who died five years after receiving NTCELL® treatment. Using histochemical and immunohistochemical labelling, we demonstrate that the NTCELL® capsules remain in the striatum but are mainly devoid of cellular contents. A similar pattern of astrogliosis and microgliosis surrounds the capsule placement area to those surrounding the needle track for implanting the capsules. This study is important as it is the first exploration of the long-term clinical and anatomical outcomes of the NTCELL® clinical trial. The results of this study will help inform future studies aimed at regenerating neurons through the implantation of capsules."
"Major depressive disorder (MDD) and myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) frequently occur together; yet their causal relationship remains unclear. To investigate the potential genetic causal link between these conditions, we conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. Summary data from Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) for MDD were sourced from the UK Biobank and the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, while GWAS data for ME/CFS were retrieved from the UK Biobank. Inverse-variance weighting (IVW), the MR-Egger method, and weighted median, simple and weighted modes were used to perform the MR analysis. In addition, Cochrane's Q-test was used to detect heterogeneity among the MR results. Horizontal pleiotropy was detected using the MR-Egger intercept and the MR pleiotropy residual sum and outlier (MR-PRESSO) tests. Leave-one-out analysis was performed to investigate the sensitivity of the association between MDD and ME/CFS. The results of the MR analysis revealed no causal relationship between MDD and ME/CFS. The pleiotropy test revealed that causality bias was improbable, and no evidence of heterogeneity was found among the genetic variants. Finally, the leave-one-out test confirmed the stability and robustness of our findings."
The Contour Neurovascular System (CNS) is a novel intrasaccular flow-disrupting device for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms. This study presents the authors' institutional experience and midterm follow-up results with this device.
"The adult central nervous system (CNS) hosts several niches, in which the neural stem and precursor cells (NPCs) reside. The subventricular zone (SVZ) lines the lateral brain ventricles and the subgranular zone (SGZ) is located in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. SVZ and SGZ NPCs replace neurons and glia in the homeostatic as well as diseased or injured states. Recently, NPCs have been found to express neurotransmitter receptors, respond to electrical stimulation and interact with neurons, suggesting that neuron-NPC communication is an emerging critical regulator of NPC biology. In this review, we discuss reports that demonstrate neuronal innervation and control of the neurogenic niches. We discuss the role of innervating neurons in regulating NPC fates, such as activation, proliferation, and differentiation. Our review focuses primarily on the innervation of the SVZ niche by the following neuronal types: glutamatergic, GABAergic projection and interneurons, cholinergic, dopaminergic, serotonergic, neuropeptidergic, nitrergic, and noradrenergic. We also discuss the origins of SVZ niche innervating neurons, such as striatum, cortex, basal ganglia, raphe nuclei, substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area, hypothalamus, and locus coeruleus. Our review highlights the various roles of innervating neurons in SVZ NPC fates in a spatiotemporal manner and emphasizes a need for future investigation into the impact of neuronal innervation on NPC gliogenesis."
"Aquilaria malaccensis Lam., an Agarwood-producing tree native to Southeast Asia, secretes oleoresin, a resin with diverse applications, in response to injuries. To explore the role of endosphere microbial communities during Agarwood development, we utilized a metagenomics approach across three stages: non-symptomatic (NC), symptomatic early (IN), and symptomatic mature (IN1). The NC metagenome was dominated by Bacillus (19.15%), Klebsiella (13.25%), and Pantoea (12.46%) among bacteria and Saccharomyces (15.92%) among fungi. Notably, bacterial chemotaxis pathway genes were more prevalent in NC (2.14%) compared to IN (0.92%) and IN1 (1.16%), suggesting microbial chemotactic behavior. In the IN stage, Klebsiella (27.05%) and Saccharomyces (34.81%) were the dominant genera. The IN1 metagenome featured Pantoea (8.92%) and Neurospora (8.24%) as leading bacterial and fungal genera, respectively. Functional genes associated with defense mechanisms, lipid transport, and secondary metabolite biosynthesis were increasingly represented in IN1, indicating an enhanced microbial response as infection progresses. Ecological indices, including a high Shannon-Wiener index (H' = 4.467) and Simpson's dominance (1 - D = 0.9697), alongside Pielou's evenness index (J = 0.7034), highlighted a dynamic and diverse microbial community at the mature infection stage, reflecting the complex interactions within the Aquilaria endosphere during Agarwood formation."
"Research into new solutions for wearable assistive devices for the visually impaired is an important area of assistive technology (AT). This plays a crucial role in improving the functionality and independence of the visually impaired, helping them to participate fully in their daily lives and in various community activities. This study presents a bibliometric analysis of the literature published over the last decade on wearable assistive devices for the visually impaired, retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) using CiteSpace, to provide an overview of the current state of research, trends, and hotspots in the field. The narrative focuses on prominent innovations in recent years related to wearable assistive devices for the visually impaired based on sensory substitution technology, describing the latest achievements in haptic and auditory feedback devices, the application of smart materials, and the growing concern about the conflicting interests of individuals and societal needs. It also summarises the current opportunities and challenges facing the field and discusses the following insights and trends: (1) optimization of the transmission of haptic and auditory information while multitasking; (2) advance research on smart materials and foster cross-disciplinary collaboration among experts; and (3) balance the interests of individuals and society. Given the two essential directions, the low-cost, stand-alone pursuit of efficiency and the high-cost pursuit of high-quality services that are closely integrated with accessible infrastructure, the latest advances will gradually allow more freedom for ambient assisted living by using robotics and automated machines, while using sensor and human-machine interaction as bridges to promote the synchronization of machine intelligence and human cognition."
"Age-related cancers are characterized by impaired protein homeostasis, where Kelch protein superfamily members have showed accumulating clues as critical regulators. In this paper, the cancerous role of Kelch-like family member 23 (KLHL23) was comprehensively analyzed with TCGA and single cell GEO database across overall 33 cancer types. By multi-omics analysis upon the transcriptomic, genomic, and methylation data, the current study explored the association of KLHL23 with patient survival, gene ontology, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, and drug responses. The correlation of copy number variations and methylation with dysregulated expression of KLHL23 were also addressed. Notably, KLHL23 levels correlated with survival in cancers such as hepatocellular carcinoma and low-grade glioma. The study also highlighted how reduced KLHL23 expression is linked to increased immune activity and sensitivity to chemotherapy, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for cancer prognosis and treatment responsiveness."
"Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) is a member of the mercaptan isomerase family, primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). At least 21 PDI family members have been identified. PDI plays a key role in protein folding, correcting misfolded proteins, and catalyzing disulfide bond formation, rearrangement, and breaking. It also acts as a molecular chaperone. Dysregulation of PDI activity is thus linked to diseases such as cancer, infections, immune disorders, thrombosis, neurodegenerative diseases, and metabolic disorders. In particular, elevated intracellular PDI levels can enhance cancer cell proliferation, metastasis, and invasion, making it a potential cancer marker. Cancer cells require extensive protein synthesis, with disulfide bond formation by PDI being a critical producer. Thus, cancer cells have higher PDI levels than normal cells. Targeting PDI can induce ER stress and activate the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) pathway, leading to cancer cell apoptosis. This review discusses the structure and function of PDI, PDI inhibitors in cancer therapy, and the limitations of current inhibitors, proposing especially future directions for developing new PDI inhibitors."
"Antimicrobial resistance poses a significant threat to global health, with its spread intricately linked across human, animal, and environmental sectors. Revealing the antimicrobial resistance gene (ARG) flow among the One Health sectors is essential for better control of antimicrobial resistance."
"Lupus nephritis is a severe and common complication of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The pathogenesis of lupus nephritis is characterized by B-cell activation and autoantibody formation. Rituximab and belimumab, as well as telitacicept, target B cells through different mechanisms, potentially exerting a synergistic effect in the treatment of lupus nephritis. This study aims to investigate the efficacy and safety of treatment with rituximab followed by belimumab or telitacicept in the management of refractory lupus nephritis."
"Backyard production systems (BPS) represent an interface of contact between people, domestic and wild animals. Studies conducted in Chile during the last decade have provided extensive evidence of influenza A virus (IAV) circulation in backyard poultry and swine. The aim of this study was to investigate exposure practices of humans to animal-origin IAV within backyards."
"The fallopian tube undergoes extensive molecular changes during the menstrual cycle and menopause. We use single-cell RNA and ATAC sequencing to construct a comprehensive cell atlas of healthy human fallopian tubes during the menstrual cycle and menopause. Our scRNA-seq comparison of 85,107 pre- and 46,111 post-menopausal fallopian tube cells reveals substantial shifts in cell type frequencies, gene expression, transcription factor activity, and cell-to-cell communications during menopause and menstrual cycle. Menstrual cycle dependent hormonal changes regulate distinct molecular states in fallopian tube secretory epithelial cells. Postmenopausal fallopian tubes show high chromatin accessibility in transcription factors associated with aging such as Jun, Fos, and BACH1/2, while hormone receptors were generally downregulated, a small proportion of secretory epithelial cells had high expression of ESR2, IGF1R, and LEPR. While a pre-menopausal secretory epithelial gene cluster is enriched in the immunoreactive molecular subtype, a subset of genes expressed in post-menopausal secretory epithelial cells show enrichment in the mesenchymal molecular type of high-grade serous ovarian cancer."
"Anemia and red blood cell transfusion are associated with adverse outcomes. Large randomized trials have demonstrated that restrictive transfusion strategies can safely reduce patient exposure to transfusion, forming a foundational pillar of patient blood management. The restrictive transfusion thresholds in these trials ranged from 7 to 8 g/dL for different populations and this variability is reflected in recent guideline recommendations for transfusion triggers. Such variability implies heterogeneity among populations with respect to the transfusion threshold for optimal outcomes. Individual variability (tolerance to anemia, risk of tissue hypoxia, risk of red blood cell transfusion) has not been addressed by population-based trials, supporting the argument for 'physiological transfusion triggers' indicative of inadequate organ perfusion. However, physiological triggers have only been assessed in small feasibility trials without convincing outcome data. This review summarizes data from recent transfusion trials and transfusion guidelines, and reviews potential physiological triggers which could further refine transfusion practices and minimize risks of tissue hypoxia and adverse outcomes."
The co-occurrence of mental disorder symptoms is common in people who use substances. It is unclear whether patterns of comorbidity in a population-based sample of adults are consistent with prior work. The study goal was to identify this comorbidity structure and evaluate its stability over time.
"Accurate cause-of-death statistics are vital for public health policy, but less than one-third of deaths globally are assigned a cause. Verbal autopsy (VA) methods are crucial in low- and middle-income countries lacking complete civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) systems. We explored VA implementation in Zambia by using a previously developed framework. The National Mortality Surveillance Subcommittee under the Monitoring and Evaluation Technical Working Group within the Ministry of Health coordinates mortality surveillance activities in Zambia. To date, passive, non-population-representative VA data collection mechanisms have been used, leading to underrepresentation of some communities. In spite of the use of electronic data collection tools, VA systems have not been electronically linked to public health surveillance or CRVS systems. Funding for VA has largely been donor driven. Increasing government funding may ensure sustainability, while the adoption of sample-based platforms while linking VA information technology systems may make VA data more useful, timely, and accessible."
"Although the benefits of anti-hypertensive treatment are well known, the proportion of hypertensive patients with controlled blood pressure (BP) remains suboptimal. The present study aimed to compare BP control conditions in a hypertension-specialized clinic and non-hypertension-specialized clinics. This cross-sectional study used data from 379 treated patients who measured home BP in the Ohasama study between 2016 and 2019 (men: 43.0%, age: 71.6 years). Of those, 172 patients were managed at the hypertension-specialized clinic where physicians distributed home BP devices to each patient, evaluated the home BP data, and adjusted medications to maintain home BP values according to the recent Japanese guidelines. When we set morning home systolic/diastolic BP of <135/ < 85 mmHg as controlled BP, 93.6% of patients fulfilled the controlled home BP range, compared to 43.0% in non-specialized clinics (n = 207). The proportion of the patients with home morning BP < 125/ < 75 mmHg was 73.3% in the hypertension-specialized clinic and 20.8% in the non-hypertension-specialized clinics. Hypertension-specialized clinics prescribed three or more anti-hypertensive drug classes to 41.9% of patients, compared to 15.2% in non-specialized clinics. In the hypertension-specialized clinic, angiotensin II receptor blockers were most commonly prescribed (86.6%), followed by dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (77.9%), thiazide (including thiazide-like) diuretics (30.2%), mineralocorticoid receptor blockers (23.8%), and beta- and alpha-beta blockers (10.5%). In conclusion, the proportion of patients with controlled home BP was excellent in the hypertension-specialized clinic. Home BP-based hypertension practices, as recommended in the current Japanese guidelines, may be the key to achieving sufficient BP control."
"Among older adults with ischemic heart disease, participation in traditional ambulatory cardiac rehabilitation (CR) remains low. While mobile health CR (mHealth-CR) provides a novel opportunity to deliver care, age-specific impairments to technology use may limit uptake, and efficacy data are currently lacking."
"Irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) is a common and chronic gastrointestinal disorder that is characterized by abdominal discomfort and occasional diarrhea. The pathogenesis of IBS-D is thought to be related to a combination of factors, including psychological stress, abnormal muscle contractions, and inflammation and disorder of the gut microbiome. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive analysis of the logical regulatory correlation among these factors. In this study, we found that stress induced hyperproduction of xanthine and altered the abundance and metabolic characteristics of Lactobacillus murinus in the gut. Lactobacillus murinus-derived spermidine suppressed the basal expression of type I interferon (IFN)-α in plasmacytoid dendritic cells by inhibiting the K63-linked polyubiquitination of TRAF3. The reduction in IFN-α unrestricted the contractile function of colonic smooth muscle cells, resulting in an increase in bowel movement. Our findings provided a theoretical basis for the pathological mechanism of, and new drug targets for, stress-exposed IBS-D."
"The standard of care for stage III colon cancer is 3 or 6 months of double-drug regimen chemotherapy following radical surgery. However, patients with positive circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) exhibit a high risk of recurrence risk even if they receive standard adjuvant chemotherapy. The potential benefit of intensified adjuvant chemotherapy, oxaliplatin, irinotecan, leucovorin and fluoropyrimidine (FOLFOXIRI), for ctDNA-positive patients remains to be elucidated."
"Stem cell-based therapies hold significant potential for cancer treatment due to their unique properties, including migration toward tumor niche, secretion of bioactive molecules, and immunosuppression. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from adult tissues can inhibit tumor progression, angiogenesis, and apoptosis of cancer cells. We have previously reported the isolation and characterization of placenta-derived decidua basalis mesenchymal stem cells (DBMSCs), which demonstrated higher levels of pro-migratory and anti-apoptotic genes, indicating potential anti-cancer effects. In this study, we analyzed the anti-cancer effects of DBMSCs on human breast cancer cell lines MDA231 and MCF7, with MCF 10A used as control. We also investigated how these cancer cells lines affect the functional competence of DBMSCs. By co-culturing DBMSCs with cancer cells, we analyzed changes in functions of both cell types, as well as alterations in their genomic and proteomic profile. Our results showed that treatment with DBMSCs significantly reduced the functionality of MDA231 and MCF7 cells, while MCF 10A cells remained unaffected. DBMSC treatment decreased epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related protein levels in MDA231 cells and modulated expression of other cancer-related genes in MDA231 and MCF7 cells. Although cancer cells reduced DBMSC proliferation, they increased their expression of anti-apoptotic genes. These findings suggest that DBMSCs can inhibit EMT-related proteins and reduce the invasive characteristics of MDA231 and MCF7 breast cancer cells, highlighting their potential as candidates for cell-based cancer therapies."
The role of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in the treatment of left ventricular thrombus (LVT) after ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) remains uncertain.
"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause of lower respiratory tract infections in children. In most previously healthy infants, RSV infection is self-limited and resolves without complications. The risk of bacteremia is low in young febrile infants with RSV infection. Herein, we report two previously healthy infants with severe RSV infection who had concurrent Klebsiella bacteremia."
"In the evolving landscape of biomolecular supramolecular chemistry, recent studies on phenylalanine (Phe) have revealed important insights into the versatile nature of this essential aromatic amino acid. Phe can spontaneously self-assemble into fibrils with amyloid-like properties linked to the neurological disorder phenylketonuria (PKU). Apart from its pathological implications, Phe also displays complex phase behavior and can undergo structural changes in response to external stimuli. Its ability to co-assemble with other amino acids opens up new possibilities for studying biomolecular interactions. Furthermore, Phe's coordination with metal ions has led to the development of enzyme-mimicking catalytic systems for applications in organic chemistry, environmental monitoring, and healthcare. Research on L and D enantiomers of Phe, particularly on bio-MOFs, has highlighted their potential in advanced technologies, including bioelectronic devices. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the advancements in Phe-based supramolecular assemblies, emphasizing their interdisciplinary relevance. The Phe assemblies show great potential for future therapeutic and functional biomaterial developments, from disease treatments to innovations in bionanozymes and bioelectronics. This review presents a compelling case for the ongoing exploration of Phe's biomolecular supramolecular chemistry as a fundamental framework for developing sustainable and efficient methodologies across various scientific disciplines."

"The natural stages of chronic hepatitis B can be divided into four stages according to changes in virology, biochemistry, and pathology. However, there have been significant differences in the recommended stage criteria in the several major guidelines for chronic hepatitis B, especially regarding the immune tolerance phase. Inconsistent standards of indicators for different stages resulted in some problems, such as incorrect stage, uncertain stages and poor comparation of related studies. We propose suggestions for revisions to the stage criteria for CHB based on recent researches, including three stages: immune tolerance stage, immune clearance stage, and immune control stage. These revision suggestions rationalize some of the existing problems with the stage criteria for CHB and can significantly reduce the number of patients in the ""uncertain stage"" or ""gray zone,"" which is particularly valuable in guiding clinical practice. However, further clinical studies with large samples are needed to confirm these suggestions."
"Streptococcus oralis is a commensal oral bacterium that acts as an opportunistic pathogen, causing systemic diseases, such as infective endocarditis and aspiration pneumonia. However, the specific molecular mechanisms underlying its transition from commensal to pathogenic state remain unclear. In this study, to further elucidate the mechanisms underlying virulence expression, we identified and characterized the cell surface-associated ecto-5'-nucleotidase (Nt5e) in S. oralis. Biochemical analysis revealed Nt5e as a metal-dependent enzyme dephosphorylating ATP and producing adenosine, an immunosuppressive molecule that inhibits macrophage activation. Additionally, Nt5e was a critical regulator of innate immunity, particularly inflammasome activation, via environmental ATP metabolism. Analysis of an isogenic nt5e deletion mutant and its complemented strain revealed that cell surface-associated Nt5e played a crucial role in degrading extracellular ATP. The Nt5e-orchestrated mechanism possibly maintained the host-bacteria homeostasis under normal conditions, whereas its dysregulation facilitated pathogenicity in specific circumstances. Our study provides new insights into the mechanisms by which oral commensals modulate host immune responses and highlights Nt5e as a potential therapeutic target for S. oralis-associated systemic diseases."
"Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapies have revolutionized the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) and other retinal diseases. However, the necessity for repeated intravitreal injections and the observation of variable treatment responses calls for new treatment modalities where fewer and more effective interventions can result in a clinical effect. Gene therapy might be such an alternative, and therefore the development and clinical application of gene therapy aimed at modifying gene expression has received considerable attention. The article reviews current knowledge of the background, pathophysiological mechanisms, technologies, limitations, and future directions for gene therapy aimed at modifying the synthesis of compounds involved in acquired and senescent retinal disease. The authors have contributed to the field by developing gene therapy to reduce the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), as well as multiple gene therapy for simultaneous downregulation of the synthesis of VEGF and upregulation of pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) using adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors. It is suggested that such multi-target gene therapy might be included in future treatments of retinal diseases where the underlying mechanisms are complex and cannot be attributed to one specific mediator. Such diseases might include dry AMD (dAMD) with geographic atrophy, but also diabetic macular edema (DME) and retinal vein occlusion (RVO). Gene therapy can be expected to be most beneficial for the patients in need of multiple intra-vitreal injections and in whom the therapeutic response is insufficient. It is concluded, that in parallel with basic research, there is a need for clinical studies aimed at identifying factors that can be used to identify patients who will benefit from gene therapy already at the time of diagnosis of the retinal disease."
"This retrospective study aimed to investigate the impact of orthognathic surgery with maxillary advancement (MA) on the velopharyngeal function (VF) in individuals with cleft lip and palate (CLP). The study included 651 patients with repaired CLP, both sexes, aged over 18 years who underwent MA alone or in combination with nasal procedures and/or mandibular osteotomy, operated between 2000 and 2019. The main outcome measures were nasalance (nasal text-NT and oral text-OT) and velopharyngeal orifice area measurement (VA), determined by nasometry and pressure-flow technique, respectively. Preoperatively, mean nasalance scores for NT and OT indicated normality, and VA demonstrated borderline-inadequate velopharyngeal closure in all patients. Following MA, a significant increase in nasalance scores for NT and OT occurred (p < 0.001), revealing hypernasality in those undergoing MA combined with nasal procedure (MAN, N = 191), bimaxillary orthognathic surgery with nasal procedure (BON, N = 227) and bimaxillary orthognathic surgery (BO, N = 151). Conversely, nasalance scores remained within the normal range for those undergoing isolated maxillary advancement (IMA, N = 82). VA exhibited a significant increase leading to the classification of VF as inadequate in the BON and MAN groups. Overall, MA contributed to VF deterioration, resulting in the appearance of hypernasality and increased VA, particularly when combined with nasal procedures."
"Electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) are known to contain heavy metals such as lead (Pb), nickel (Ni) and chromium (Cr). The presence of heavy metals in ENDS may be due to contamination of e-liquids or leaching from elements of the ENDS device. This study investigates differences in ENDS metal concentrations between product type, year of purchase, country of purchase and e-liquid flavour."
"The newly discovered LINC02532 is abnormally expressed in a variety of cancers and promotes cancer progression. The research proposed to discover the biological and molecular mechanisms of LINC02532 in breast cancer (BCa). In the resected BCa tissue samples and adjacent normal tissues, LINC02532, miR-541-3p, and High Mobility Group A1 (HMGA1) levels were determined. Cell function experiments were carried out on the premise of cell transfection with relevant plasmids. Based on that, the influence of LINC02532, miR-541-3p, and HMGA1 on MCF-7 cell activities (proliferation, migration, invasion, cell cycle, and apoptosis) was determined, as well as on EMT. Additionally, animal experiments were allowed to support cell experimental conclusions on LINC02532. Finally, the mechanistic network of LINC02532, miR-541-3p, and HMGA1 was identified. It was BCa tissues highly expressing LINC02532 and HMGA1, while lowly expressing miR-541-3p. Functionally, LINC02532 depletion repressed the activities and EMT process of MCF-7 cells. Silencing LINC02532 delayed tumor growth in mice. In terms of mechanism, LINC02532 mainly existed in the cytoplasm and could mediate HMGA1 expression by absorbing miR-541-3p. The findings offer new insights into the molecular mechanisms of LINC02532 in BCa and, more importantly, new strategies for the clinical treatment of BCa."
"BACKGROUND Decompressive craniectomy is a common life-saving intervention in the setting of elevated intracranial pressure. Cranioplasty restores the calvarium and intracranial physiology once swelling recedes. Cranioplasty is often thought of as a low-risk intervention. However, numerous reports indicate that malignant cerebral edema (MCE) is an often-fatal complication of an otherwise uneventful cranioplasty. A careful review of the literature is needed to better understand this devastating condition. CASE REPORT A 41-year-old man presented after suffering a gunshot wound to the right frontal lobe. Upon initial evaluation, the patient had grossly visible brain matter, left-sided hemiparesis with a Glascow Coma Score (GCS) of 11, and vital signs concerning for elevated intracranial pressure. Computed tomography (CT) showed right-sided intraparenchymal and subarachnoid hemorrhage with a 5 mm leftward midline shift. The patient was taken to the operating room (OR) for right fronto-parietal craniectomy. Over the next 3 months, he recovered steadily and underwent PEEK cranioplasty on post-operative day 83. Pre-operative CT showed sunken skin flap syndrome with an 8-mm midline shift. Following an uneventful cranioplasty, he failed to regain consciousness. Examination revealed absent brainstem reflexes. CT showed global diffuse cerebral edema. The patient was declared brain dead. CONCLUSIONS Continued research is needed to better understand the pathophysiology of malignant cerebral edema so that future incidences may be prevented. A combination of negative-pressure suction drainage, sunken skin flap syndrome, and delayed time to cranioplasty likely play a significant role in the evolution of MCE. We urge neurosurgeons to consider the likelihood of MCE and adapt surgical planning accordingly."
"Despite recommendations in the US National Research Action Plan on Long COVID, gender identity is rarely reported in research and surveillance used to guide public health programming and clinical care. We analyzed data from a cross-sectional study of COVID-19 in a nationwide sample of transgender and nonbinary (TNB) people (N = 2,134). Participants were surveyed between June 14, 2021 and May 1, 2022. Data were restricted to 817 participants who reported confirmed or suspected COVID-19 to estimate the prevalence of long COVID, defined as symptoms persisting for ≥ 3 months. Ten percent of participants with a history of COVID-19 reported symptom duration consistent with long COVID, ranging from 4.8% to 12.9% across gender identities. Long COVID was most common in transmasculine and nonbinary people assigned female sex at birth. There was no evidence of an association with reported hormone therapy, supporting current recommendations that prioritize gender-affirming care during treatment for long COVID. As a condition which profoundly impacts health and productivity, long COVID is likely to exacerbate existing disparities. Principles of equity demand that we reduce barriers to prevention, diagnosis, and care for long COVID, and ensure that research and surveillance are inclusive of TNB people and disaggregate findings by gender identity."
"Pharmacological treatment of diabetes mellitus-induced erectile dysfunction (DMED) has become increasingly challenging due to the limited efficacy of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5i). As the global prevalence of DM continues, there is a critical need for novel therapeutic strategies to address DMED. In our previous studies, we found that Glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), a ferroptosis inhibitor, can ameliorate DMED in diabetic rats. However, the specific role of GPX4 in corpus cavernosum smooth muscle cells (CCSMCs) and its regulatory mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we established primary cultures of CCSMCs and systematically analyzed the role of GPX4 under high-glucose conditions. To further elucidate the upstream regulatory pathways of GPX4, we employed immunoprecipitation coupled with mass spectrometry (IP-MS) to identify potential interacting proteins. Additionally, co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and cycloheximide (CHX) chase assays were conducted to explore the regulatory dynamics and post-translational stability of GPX4. Under high-glucose conditions, the expression of GPX4 in CCSMCs is significantly downregulated, leading to an increase in intracellular oxidative stress and heightened levels of ferroptosis, accompanied by dysfunction in smooth muscle cell relaxation. Furthermore, the CHX chase assay revealed that high glucose accelerates GPX4 protein degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Subsequent IP-MS identified NEDD4, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, as a potential interacting partner of GPX4. Further validation demonstrated that NEDD4 modulates the ubiquitination process of GPX4, thereby influencing its stability and expression. In conclusion, we identified NEDD4 as a key regulator of GPX4 stability through ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation. These findings suggest potential therapeutic strategies targeting the NEDD4-GPX4 axis to alleviate DMED pathology."
"The global prevalence of obesity and its associated comorbidities is rising, with bariatric surgery emerging as a highly efficacious intervention for obese patients. Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is a common complication following bariatric surgery, with a standardised protocol for its prevention and management yet to be established. This study aims to determine the incidence and the influencing factors of PONV following various types of bariatric surgeries, thereby facilitating the targeted prevention strategies."
"VAChT-Cre is a transgenic mouse line targeting slow-twitch fatigue-resistant and fast-twitch fatigue-resistant motor neurons that innervate oxidative type I and type IIa muscle fibers. To ablate these neurons, VAChT-Cre mice were crossbred with NSE-DTA mice, leading to the expression of diphtheria toxin A after Cre-mediated excision. The resulting VAChT-Cre;NSE-DTA mice exhibited motor deficits, abnormal locomotion, muscular atrophy, and tremor, making them a useful model for studying motor neuron physiology and pathology. In this study, we conducted a kinematic analysis to examine their abnormal locomotor phenotype."
"This review aims to evaluate the current psychiatric applications and limitations of machine learning (ML), defined as techniques used to train algorithms to improve performance at a task based on data. The review emphasizes the clinician's role in ensuring equitable and effective patient care and seeks to inform mental health providers about the importance of clinician involvement in these technologies."
"Cellular aging is the inability of structures to proliferate (further division) and repair damage while maintaining metabolic activity. The key well-known factors of cellular aging are the processes of DNA damage, telomere shortening, the development of oxidative stress and epigenetic changes. The above factors provoke the development of a pro-inflammatory environment, leading to errors in gene expression and metabolic dysregulation, thereby affecting the development of age-related diseases that contribute to pathological changes in the functions of tissues and organs. Modern pharmacotherapy approaches aimed at slowing down the processes of cellular aging are mainly focused on three key strategies: influencing the signaling pathways that cause cellular aging, as well as specific factors of the cell cycle (protein structures - receptors, carrier proteins, bioregulators, and so on), improving the elimination of cellular debris by the immune systern pharmacotherapy approaches aimed at slowing down the processes of cellular aging are mainly focused on three key strategies: influencing the signaling pathways that cause cellular aging, as well as specific factors of the cell cycle (protein structures - receptors, carrier proteins, bioregulators, and so on), improving the elimination of cellular debris by the immune system. In the elderly, the regulation of various processes of the cell cycle is disrupted, and the use of polypeptide complexes helps to maintain normal body functions by stimulating the synthesis of proteins-markers of cell functional activity."
"The spinal arachnoid web (SAW) is intradural extramedullary thickened bands of the arachnoid tissue, causing a focal indentation of the spinal cord. In our study, we sought to provide a comprehensive description of the nonoperative progression of this condition, drawing from a 5-year follow-up based on our institutional experience."
"Vocabulary is essential for comprehension, especially in specialized disciplines. However, the research on the lexical features of forestry remains underexplored. This study focuses on the vocabulary frequency profile of forestry academic texts, and compares forestry vocabulary with general vocabulary and general academic vocabulary. Using Range software and the BNC/COCA word lists, this research analyzed a corpus of 331 research articles and 14 textbooks across eight forestry sub-disciplines. Results demonstrate a rich and diverse vocabulary in this discipline. Two forestry-specific word lists, the forestry Latin loan word list and the forestry English word list, were developed from words not included in the BNC/COCA word lists. The analysis indicates that mastering the top 5,000 word families and four supplementary word lists from the expanded BNC/COCA word lists provides 95% lexical coverage of the forestry academic corpus. For 98% coverage, prioritizing the two forestry-specific word lists reduces the required word families from 11,000 to 8,000. While both forestry research articles and textbooks need 5,000 word families for 95% coverage, research articles require an additional 2,000 for 98% coverage. Lexical demands across sub-disciplines range from 4,000 to 6,000 word families for 95% coverage, and from 8,000 to 11,000 for 98% when including the forestry-specific word lists. Furthermore, findings also indicate that the forestry vocabulary contains a higher proportion of mid- and low-frequency words than general vocabulary and general academic vocabulary. These findings provide important guidance for setting vocabulary learning goals and sequences for learners in the forestry discipline, thereby contributing to improved comprehension of forestry academic texts and enhancing the effectiveness of English for Specific Purposes instruction."

"Postoperative anaemia is common among surgical patients. While often viewed as a benign condition, postoperative anaemia is neither inevitable nor harmless, being intricately linked with adverse outcomes. In this review, we summarize the prevalence, aetiology, and outcomes of postoperative anaemia and highlight prevention and management strategies. Further, we propose a novel framework to characterize postoperative anaemia as an acute organ injury (i.e., acute blood injury, anaemic subtype), thereby drawing attention to a condition that is frequently overlooked. Additionally, we discuss areas warranting further research, including risk stratification for patients at heightened risk for the development of postoperative anaemia and associated complications and determination of appropriate treatment strategies."
This study compared the effects of two different warm-up protocols (normal vs. priming) on the oxygen plateau ([Formula: see text]) incidence rate during a ramp test. It also compared the cardiopulmonary responses during the ramp test and subsequent verification phase.
"The arrival of immunotherapy has revolutioned the management of patients with metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC). We conducted an observational, retrospective study of 14 cases treated with avelumab. The response rate was 57%: complete response was reached in 29% of patients, and partial responses in 29%. The drug proved effective in 83% (5/6) of the patients with a single metastatic site. However, the disease progressed in 75% (3/4) of the patients with bone metastases. PD1-L expression, MCC polyomavirus (MCPyV) positivity, and an impaired neutrophil-to-lypmhocyte ratio (NLR) could not be associated with responses to the therapy. Avelumab is an effective and safe drug for the management of advanced MCC, and its effectiveness appears to be impacted by the number and location of metastases."
"For decades, fossil fuels have accounted for 70% to 80% of global primary energy demand. Far from ending this trend, O&G companies continue to be the main fore-runners in providing secure, versatile and widespread energy to the entire world. The relevance of this sector in the economic-financial landscape and the concern for its stability, makes that the high interest of the scientific community to explore the factors that explain the O&G cross-sectional expected returns remains intact. Through a new approach from the Random Matrix Theory, the aim is to know how many are the factors that explain the market performance of the O&G subsectors (upstream, midstream & downstream), and also if the Brent price can be considered an explanatory factor. We will show that for certain periods, Brent becomes the only factor explaining the movements in the upstream and midstream subsectors, while for most of the time the only factor is the market. Other interesting finding is that no significant factors are found for the downstream subsector, except in certain periods. With a purely statistical approach, we show the factors that explain the cross-sectional expected return of the O&G companies, providing information of special relevance for the decision making of investors, executives and politicians."
"Tuberculosis (TB) remains a significant health concern in India, especially among households with children and young adolescents aged 6-17 years. Despite ongoing research, there is a knowledge gap regarding specific risk factors for TB within this demographic. This study aims to bridge this gap by examining the association between TB and various socio-demographic factors, including socioeconomic status, nutritional status, and environmental conditions."
"Postoperative cognitive impairment is a common disorder after major surgery. Advances in medicine and treatment have resulted in an increasingly ageing population undergoing major surgical procedures. Since age is the most important risk factor for postoperative cognitive decline, it is not surprising that impairment of cognitive functions after surgery was recorded in almost a third of elderly patients. Postoperative cognitive dysfunction is part of the spectrum of postoperative cognitive impairment and researchers often confuse it with postoperative delirium and delayed neurocognitive recovery. This is the cause of great differences in the results of research that is focused on the incidence and possible prevention of postoperative cognitive dysfunction. In this review, we focused on current recommendations for a uniform nomenclature of postoperative cognitive impairment and diagnosis of postoperative cognitive dysfunction, the presumed pathophysiology of postoperative cognitive dysfunction and recommendations for its treatment and possible prevention strategies."
"Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH), a pivotal enzyme in serine synthesis, plays a key role in the malignant progression of tumors through both its metabolic activity and moonlight functions. This study aims to elucidate the non-canonical function of PHGDH in promoting hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) metastasis through its interaction with methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3), potentially uncovering a novel therapeutic target."
"Schizophrenia, a debilitating mental disorder, is characterized by persistent negative symptoms such as avolition and anhedonia. Currently, there are no effective treatments available for these symptoms. Thus, our study aims to assess the efficacy of online high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (online HD-tDCS) in addressing the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, utilizing a double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled trial design."
"Interarm systolic blood pressure difference (IASD) values >15 mmHg (IASD > 15) are associated with increased cardiovascular risk, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This report evaluated whether IASD >15, assessed by different protocols [sequential or simultaneous; based on one or several blood pressure (BP) readings], was associated with adverse left ventricular (LV) remodeling."
"The COVID-19 pandemic presented unique and unprecedented challenges for international students, those studying at institutions of higher education outside of their home countries, due to their distinct circumstances and vulnerabilities. This literature review examines the multifaceted mental health burdens they experienced and highlights the need for targeted support and interventions."
"The 2022 White House National Strategy on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health outlined goals for ending hunger in the US. Actions fell into five areas, called pillars; the goal of Pillar 5 was to enhance nutrition and food security research. This study leveraged participatory research theory and the National Strategy for developing a statewide, evidence-informed food security research agenda. A mixed-methods study employing the Community Engagement in Research Continuum (CEnR) was implemented. Engagement strategies included collecting baseline data via a statewide survey and encouraging participants of a statewide Summit to participate in a collective prioritization process. Surveys were emailed to a purposive sample of 1575 contacts; 31 registered for the in-person session. A total of 197 records were included in the survey analysis; all 31 registrants attended the in-person session. The research agenda was to include two objectives for implementation over the next two years. Academic and nonacademic stakeholders interacted as peers during the prioritization exercise. The first research objective was to conduct food assistance usage gap analyses; the second was to investigate barriers to collaboration among Idaho's food security programs. The CEnR proved efficacious for producing a stakeholder-generated research agenda. Leveraging a national framework helped facilitate asset-based, actionable strategies within a proposed timeline."
Myocardial infarction (MI) can range from mild to severe cardiovascular events and typically develops through complex interactions between genetic and lifestyle factors.
"Operating theatres are steeply hierarchical, and yet the hierarchy between surgeons and anaesthetists is unclear, even blurry. Both the steep hierarchy and the blurriness at the top can present a risk to patient safety through inhibiting speaking up with concerns and negotiating safe patient care. A recent study in the British Journal of Anaesthesia explores hierarchy in the surgeon-anaesthesia dyad in China, in particular, the effect of increased seniority gap between surgeons and anaesthetists on anaesthesia-related adverse outcomes. There is very limited information on hierarchy in the surgeon-anaesthetist dyad despite its pivotal importance for patient outcomes. The study prompts us to confront hierarchy in operating theatres and to address its negative effects. This might include explicit whole-team reflections on the hierarchies that divide us, working to overcome divisions through identifying our common values and goals in patient care, and building shared decision-making into our organisational structures and patient care processes so that they no longer reinforce historical hierarchies but rather reflect the needs and realities of modern healthcare."
"To assess the effectiveness of tumor biomarkers in distinguishing epithelial ovarian tumors (EOTs) and guiding clinical decisions across each Ovarian-Adnexal Reporting and Data System (O-RADS) MRI risk category, the aim is to prevent unnecessary surgeries for benign lesions, avoid delays in treating malignancies, and benefit individuals requiring fertility preservation or those intolerant to over-extensive surgery."
"Emerging literature indicates that the microbiome and its byproducts, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), play an important role in childhood diseases such as allergies and asthma. Specifically, there is evidence suggesting that SCFAs play a critical role in fetal immunoprogramming during the late saccular phase of fetal lung development. An increase in acetate during the late saccular phase is known to play a critical role in inhibiting histone deacetylases (HDACs), resulting in a cascade of events, including Treg immune regulation, involved in fetal immunoprogramming, and reduction in the asthma phenotype. However, it is not known whether changes in SCFA levels, especially acetate, occurred during the canalicular or early saccular phase among pregnant women whose children did not develop asthma."
"Wearable technologies offer new opportunities to address in-school physical inactivity. However, children are often excluded from discussing issues which directly impact them, including the use of wearable technologies in a school setting. Thus, the aim of this study is to understand primary school pupils' experiences and perceptions of using wearable physical activity monitoring technologies within schools."
"Our study aimed to update demographic profiles of sinonasal adenocarcinoma (SNAC) between 2000 and 2020, identify independent prognostic risk factors, and devise a predictive nomogram for overall survival (OS)."
"We aimed to evaluate the volatile compounds profile in traditional airag samples collected from two regions, including Bulgan and Uvurkhangai provinces, whereas famous airag-making areas in Mongolia. The volatile compounds of airag were investigated by the GC-MS method. A total of 95 kinds of volatile compounds were detected, and these were classified into 6 different classes: 14 acids, 14 alcohols, 16 aldehydes, 19 esters, 9 ketones, and 23 aliphatic hydrocarbons. Among them, acetic acid, 2-methyl propionic acid, isoamyl lactic acid, 2-methyl butanoic acid, hexanoic acid, heptanoic acid, octanoic acid, nonanoic acid, n-decanoic acid, 1-propanol, 3-methyl 1-butanol, phenyl ethyl alcohol, acetaldehyde, acetoin, ethyl acetate, ethyl hexanoate, ethyl caprylate, ethyl decanoate, ethyl 9-decanoate, and ethyl laurate had a high concentration in airag samples. It may explain that acids, alcohols, and esters mainly influence the taste and aroma of airag, and aldehydes change depending on their fermentation time. We also found that Bulgan provinces` samples contained 20 types of aliphatic hydrocarbons, which may relate to the vegetation and fermentation process. The formation of sensory characteristics in airag is a complex and unclear process because it affects many factors. Our findings provide essential guidance on the composition of volatile compounds in Mongol airag."
"The increasing prevalence of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) infections among children represents a significant global concern, leading to elevated mortality rates. The aim of this study was to evaluate the risk factors, outcomes, 30-day mortality rates and contributing factors in children with CRE bloodstream infections (CRE-BSIs)."
"The current study was designed to evaluate the effect of particle size (PS) and inclusion level of wheat straw (WS) obtained from genetically improved wheat on the performance and feeding behavior of Sahiwal cows. Twelve multiparous, mid-lactating Sahiwal cows (DIM 135 ± 25, mean ± SD; 12.8 ± 1.6 kg/d milk, 331 ± 21 kg of BW) were split into groups of 4 and subjected to each of four treatments in a 2*2 cross-over design. For experimental diets, TMR differed in the length and inclusion level of the WS component in that diet, (1) straw chopped with a 2 cm screen (Fine chopped- FC, and inclusion, i.e., FCA = 20% and FCB = 30%) or (2) straw chopped with a 4 cm screen (long chopped-LC, and inclusion, i.e., LCA = 20% and LCB = 30%). The increased dry matter (DM) intake (9.10 kg/d) and crude protein (CP) intake (1.25 kg/d) were observed in FCA. The diets with the shorter PS and higher inclusion (i.e., FCB) exhibited higher neutral detergent fibre (NDF) intake (3.77 kg) and acid detergent fibre (ADF) intake (2.72 kg). The findings of digestibility showed higher DM-digestibility in LCA (55.24%). Meanwhile, the higher digestibility of CP (52.9%) and ADF (36%) was found in LCB, and NDF (38.5%) was observed in LCA. Moreover, cows receiving FCA diets showed improved milk (15.5 kg/d), 3.5%FCM (17.76 kg/d), fat (0.683/d Kg), and protein (0.516 kg/d) yields and production efficiency. However, the milk composition was improved in cows fed with LCB diets. Furthermore, the behavioural activities showed higher eating (i.e., 228.3 min/day), rumination (391 min./day), and chewing (617.9 min./day) activities in LCB diets. Whereas, the lying activity (568.5 min/day) was greater in FCA-fed cows. Our study suggests that incorporating fine-chopped WS @ 20% improves the overall production performance and feeding behavior of the cows."
"Excess weight during pregnancy is a condition that can affect both mother and fetus, through the maternal-fetal interface, which is constituted by the placenta and umbilical cord. The umbilical vein is responsible for transporting oxygen and nutrients to the fetus, and its proper functioning depends on the integrity of its structure. The remodeling of the umbilical vein represents one of the causes of inadequate transport of nutrients to the fetus, being potentially harmful. This study aims to evaluate whether maternal overweight alters the structural characteristics of the umbilical vein."
"The integrity of the actively transcribed genome against helix-distorting DNA lesions relies on a multilayered cellular response that enhances Transcription-Coupled Nucleotide Excision Repair (TC-NER). When defective, TC-NER is causatively associated with Cockayne-Syndrome (CS), a rare severe human progeroid disorder. Although the presence of unresolved transcription-blocking lesions is considered a driver of the aging process, the molecular features of the transcription-driven response to genotoxic stress in CS-B cells remain largely unknown. Here, an in-depth view of the transcriptional and associated chromatin dynamics that occur in CS-B cells illuminates the role of CSB therein. By employing high-throughput genome-wide approaches, we observed that absence of a functional CSB protein results in a delay in transcription progression, more positioned +1 nucleosomes, and less dynamic chromatin structure, compared to normal cells. We found that early after exposure to UV, CS-B cells released RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) from promoter-proximal pause sites into elongation. However, the magnitude of this response and the progression of RNAPII were reduced compared to normal counterparts. Notably, we detected increased post-UV retainment of unprocessed nascent RNA transcripts and chromatin-associated elongating RNAPII molecules. Contrary to the prevailing models, we found that transcription initiation is operational in CS-B fibroblasts early after UV and that chromatin accessibility showed a marginal increase. Our study provides robust evidence for the role of CSB in shaping the transcription and chromatin landscape both in homeostasis and in response to genotoxic insults, which is independent of its known role in TC-NER, and which may underlie major aspects of the CS phenotype."
The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic required the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) in medical and social contexts to reduce exposure and prevent pathogen transmission. This study aims to analyse possible changes in voice and speech parameters with and without PPE.
"Fitness coaches seem to play an essential role in the field of exercise as they help prevent sedentary lifestyles and promote overall health, quality of life, and well-being. This study aimed to explore the effects of fitness coaches' behavior perceptions, intrinsic motivation, and enjoyment of exercisers on their long-term fitness and health, as well as their commitment to exercise. A total of 202 individuals participated in the study that was developed over three data gathering occasions (baseline, three months and six months). To this end, three psychometric scales were used as part of a multi-section survey: FCBS-Fit (perception of the fitness coach's behavior), IMIp (intrinsic motivation of exercisers), and PACES (enjoyment in exercise), along with the assessment of four health/fitness variables: anthropometry (i.e., waist-hip ratio), strength (i.e., handgrip strength), flexibility (i.e., sit-and-reach), and cardiorespiratory fitness (i.e., VO2máx.). Overall, the results suggested that the perception of the fitness coach's behavior, the exerciser's intrinsic motivation, and enjoyment were predictors of the health/fitness outcomes, and seemed to be related to the exercise commitment at the end of three and six months. The novelty of this study is the examination of psychological and physiological factors in an integrated and longitudinal manner within the scope of exercise in fitness and health clubs. Therefore, these findings shed light on fitness coaches as an important element in the propagation and maintenance of exercise habits, accomplishment of tangible outcomes by exercisers, health promotion and the fitness sector's growth."
"Human neutrophils are abundant, short-lived leukocytes that turn over at a rate of approximately 1011 cells/day via a constitutive apoptosis program. Certain growth factors, inflammatory mediators and infectious agents can delay apoptosis or induce neutrophils to die by other mechanisms. Nonetheless, a large body of data demonstrates that apoptosis of untreated neutrophils typically ensues within 24 hours of cell isolation and in vitro culture. At the molecular level apoptosis is driven by executioner caspase-3, and during this process cell proinflammatory capacity and host defense functions are downregulated. We undertook the current study to determine the extent to which human neutrophil viability and function could be prolonged by treatment with the non-toxic, irreversible, pan-caspase inhibitor Q-VD-OPh. Our data demonstrate that a single 10 μM dose of this drug was sufficient to markedly prolong cell lifespan. Specifically, we show that apoptosis was prevented for at least 5 days as indicated by analysis of nuclear morphology, DNA fragmentation, and phosphatidylserine externalization together with measurements of procaspase-3 processing and caspase activity. Conversely, mitochondrial depolarization declined despite abundant Myeloid Cell Leukemia 1 (MCL-1). At the same time, glutathione levels were maintained and Q-VD-OPh prevented age-associated increases mitochondrial oxidative stress. Regarding functional capacity, we show that phagocytosis, NADPH oxidase activity, chemotaxis, and degranulation were maintained following Q-VD-OPh treatment, albeit to somewhat different extents. Thus, a single 10 μM dose of Q-VD-OPh can sustain human neutrophil viability and function for at least 5 days."
"The increasing adoption of healthcare devices necessitates a deeper understanding of the factors that influence user acceptance in this rapidly evolving area. Therefore, this study examined the factors influencing the technology acceptance of healthcare devices, focusing on radar sensors and wearable devices. A total of 1158 valid responses were used to test hypotheses, mediation, and moderation effects using SmartPLS 4.0. The results highlighted the significant role of performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, and perceived risk in shaping user attitudes and trust, which in turn influence behavioral intention. The findings suggested that attitudes fully mediate the effects of performance expectancy and effort expectancy on behavioral intention, while social influence, facilitating conditions, and perceived risk exhibit partial mediation. Moderation analysis revealed significant effects of generation on the relationship between attitude, trust, and behavioral intention. Additionally, device type moderated the effect of trust on behavioral intention, showing a different influence between radar sensors and wearable devices. These findings provide theoretical contributions by extending the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model and offering practical implications for manufacturers and policymakers to tailor strategies that foster positive attitudes, enhance trust, and address generational and device-specific differences in healthcare technology adoption."
"Breast cancer is currently the most frequently detected cancer in women and the primary cause of cancer-related deaths globally. The incidence of breast cancer has significantly increased in countries across sub-Saharan Africa, counting Ethiopia. There are multiple determinants of breast cancer, a few of these can be changeable whereas others are not. Evidence suggests that breastfeeding, which is a changeable determinant, reduces breast cancer risk. However, there is a lack of evidence specifically linking the duration of breastfeeding to breast cancer risk. To date, no study has been conducted on the association between the duration of breastfeeding and the likelihood of breast cancer among Ethiopian women."
"Three-dimensional (3D) tissue culture models provide in vivo-like conditions for studying cell physiology. This study aimed to examine the efficiency of pyramidal microwell geometries in microfluidic devices on spheroid formation, cell growth, viability, and differentiation in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). The static culture using the hanging drop (HD) method served as a control. The microfluidic chips were fabricated to have varying pyramidal tip angles, including 66°, 90°, and 106°. From flow simulations, when the tip angle increased, streamline distortion decreased, resulting in more uniform flow and a lower velocity gradient near the spheroids. These findings demonstrate the significant influence of microwell geometry on fluid dynamics. The 90° microwells provide optimal conditions, including uniform flow and reduced shear stress, while maintaining the ability for waste removal, resulting in superior spheroid growth compared to the HD method and other microwell designs. From the experiments, by Day 3, spheroids in the 90° microwells reached approximately 400 µm in diameter which was significantly larger than those in the 66° microwells, 106° microwells, and HD cultures. Brachyury gene expression in the 90° microwells was four times higher than the HD method, indicating enhanced mesodermal differentiation essential for cardiac differentiation. Immunofluorescence staining confirmed cardiomyocyte differentiation. In conclusion, microwell geometry significantly influences 3D cell culture outcomes. The pyramidal microwells with a 90° tip angle proved most effective in promoting spheroid growth and cardiac differentiation of mESC differentiation, providing insights for optimizing microfluidic systems in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine."
"Aging is a natural physiological process involving biological and genetic pathways. Growing evidence suggests that alterations in the epigenome during aging result in transcriptional changes, which play a significant role in the onset of age-related diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and neurodegenerative disorders. For this reason, the epigenetic alterations in aging and age-related diseases have been reviewed, and the major extrinsic factors influencing these epigenetic alterations have been identified. In addition, the role of the gut microbiome and its metabolites as epigenetic modifiers has been addressed."
Communities and health organizations are testing novel ways to fund costly initiatives to advance health equity.
"In Malaysia, the recent COVID-19 pandemic had increased the workload of all health professionals, especially primary care doctors (PCDs). Hence, this study aimed to determine the level of work-related stress and factors associated with higher levels of work-related stress among PCDs in Malaysia during this pandemic."
"Sepsis leads to an acute breakdown of muscle to support increased caloric and amino acid requirements. Little is known about the role of adipose and muscle tissue breakdown and intestinal metabolism in glucose substrate supply during the acute phase of sepsis. In a translational porcine model of sepsis, we explored the across organ net fluxes of gluconeogenic substrates. In 13 pigs, acute sepsis was induced by IV infusion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, while in 9 pigs saline (control) was given for 18 h. Blood samples were collected between 12 and 18 h and analyzed with HPLC and LCMS. In sepsis, glucose plasma concentration was reduced (p = 0.0028). A concordant increase in splanchnic area net release of glucose (p = 0.0049), due to reduced uptake in the portal drained viscera (PDV) (p = 0.0032) with an unchanged liver production (p = 0.7861). The hindquarter showed a higher release of alanine (p = 0.0002), glutamine (p = 0.003), and lactate (p = 0.0007), but not for glycerol (p = 0.5718). Diminished PDV uptake of gluconeogenic amino acids, increased liver uptake of these substrates (p < 0.05), while no change in liver glycerol uptake (p = 0.3170), did not lead to an increased net liver glucose release. In the acute phase of sepsis, we hypothesize an important role of altered intestinal amino acid metabolism and breakdown of muscle proteins, but not of glycolysis to support gluconeogenesis."
The aim of this study was to compare the performances of photon-counting detector computed tomography (PCD-CT) and energy-integrating detector computed tomography (EID-CT) for visualizing nodules and airways in human cadaveric lungs.
"The role of immunotherapy in the adjuvant setting seems promising in recent years. As per the findings of the CheckMate 577 trial, patients with esophageal cancer (EC) who had neoadjuvant chemoradiation with residual pathologic disease should be considered adjuvant immunotherapy (AIT). However, it is unknown if individuals with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) who have received neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy (NICT) followed by radical surgery also require AIT."
"Migration is a phenomenon with an impact on the health of adolescents. Barriers to accessing health services expose them to risks such as sexual violence, unwanted pregnancies, and sexually transmitted infections/HIV."
"Despite overall declines in risky teen sexual activity, racial and ethnic disparities persist. This study compared abstinence-only and comprehensive teen pregnancy prevention (TPP) programs to explore the effects of the programs on teen sexual activity-related outcomes that may differ by race/ethnicity."
"Pulmonary large cell carcinoma (LCC) is a rare and aggressive subtype of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with poor prognosis. Surgical resection remains the cornerstone of treatment for resectable LCC; however, its efficacy is limited in advanced stages, necessitating adjuvant therapies to reduce postoperative recurrence risk. Recent advances in immunotherapy have shown promising survival benefits. Here, we present a case of LCC successfully treated with a combination of surgery and pembrolizumab. A 56-year-old male smoker, diagnosed with LCC and staged as T2N1M0 postoperatively, developed recurrent disease one month after surgery, as evidenced by enlarged left hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes on chest CT. The patient received adjuvant chemotherapy and immunotherapy, guided by high PD-L1 expression. However, after three cycles, chemotherapy was discontinued due to severe side effects, and pembrolizumab monotherapy was initiated. After 21 cycles, there was substantial regression of the mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes. The patient remained progression-free after 24 cycles of treatment. This case underscores the potential of combining surgical resection with immunotherapy as an effective strategy not only for resectable LCC but also for other rare NSCLC subtypes with high PD-L1 expression."
"Various forms of oral involvement have been reported in patients with neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1). Here, we analyze register-based associations between NF1 and hospital visits related to oral infections. The Finnish NF1 cohort encompasses all individuals with verified NF1 who have visited the Finnish central and university hospitals in 1987-2011. The Finnish Care Register for Health Care allowed the follow-up of 1349 individuals with NF1, their 1894 siblings without NF1, and 13,870 matched controls for diagnoses related to oral infections in 1998-2014. We observed clearly increased hazards for hospital visits associated with dental caries (ICD-10 K02; NF1 vs. controls, hazard ratio [HR] 4.42, 95% CI 3.23-6.04), diseases of pulp and periapical tissues (K04; HR 3.85, 95% CI 2.68-5.54), and gingivitis and periodontal diseases (K05; HR 3.63, 95% CI 2.37-5.56). In contrast, hospital visits related to diseases of salivary glands (K11), and stomatitis and related lesions (K12) did not show significantly increased hazard in NF1 compared with the controls or the non-NF1 siblings. In conclusion, the findings suggest that hospital visits related to oral infections are relatively common among individuals with NF1. The results highlight the need for early detection, proactive prevention, and timely treatment of oral infections in individuals with NF1."
"Tissue-engineered grafts that mimic articular cartilage show promise for treating cartilage injuries. However, engineering cartilage cell-based therapies to match zonal architecture and biochemical composition remains challenging. Decellularized articular cartilage extracellular matrix (dECM) has gained attention for its chondro-inductive properties, yet dECM-based bioinks have limitations in mechanical stability and printability. This study proposes a rapid light-based bioprinting method using a tyrosine-based crosslinking mechanism, which does not require chemical modifications of dECM and thereby preserves its structure and bioactivity. Combining this resin with Filamented Light (FLight) biofabrication enables the creation of cellular, porous, and anisotropic dECM scaffolds composed of aligned microfilaments. Specifically, we focus on the effects of various biopolymer compositions (i.e. hyaluronic acid, collagen I, and dECM) and inner architecture (i.e. bulk light vs FLight) on immune response and cell morphology, and we investigate their influence on nascent ECM production and long-term tissue maturation. Our findings highlight the importance of FLight scaffolds in directing collagen deposition resembling articular cartilage structure and promoting construct maturation, and they emphasize the superiority of biological-rich dECM over single-component materials for engineering articular cartilage, thereby offering new avenues for the development of effective cartilage tissue engineering strategies."
"This study describes the congenital goiter in an alpaca (Vicugna pacos) fetus aborted in November 2021 with the clinical and pathological findings in the dam that was found dead on the farm three weeks after a miscarriage. The dam was a black coat alpaca bred in the Netherlands, imported in Italy in January 2021, and housed in a farm of central Italy for breeding purposes. Signalment and clinical data on dam and fetus were collected from the farmer and referring veterinarian. Necropsies and histopathological investigations on mother and conceptus were conducted at the Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Perugia. The fetus was aborted at the 5th gestational month and at necropsy revealed bilateral thyroid gland enlargement. Microscopically the thyroid gland presented follicular cell hypertrophy and hyperplasia, follicles greatly varying in size, with macrofollicles lined by attenuated to atrophic epithelium and distended by eosinophilic colloid (colloid goiter). The dam presented a history of anorexia, wasting, dullness, severe weakness, incoordination, recurrent seizures, and, most recently, abortion. At necropsy, a cerebral focal loss of substance was found at the right parietal cortex, which histologically corresponded to laminar ischemic neuronal necrosis; most importantly, histological examination of cerebellum showed multifocal necrosis of the Purkinje cells associated with severe depletion of the granular layer neurons. These cerebellar findings in the dam combined with goiter in the conceptus suggest organomercurial poisoning as the likely cause of abortion followed by mother's death. Mercury poisoning is hypothesized as the possible link between mother's and fetus' lesions."
"In the US, spouses are a major source of informal care for older adults and, therefore, key to the US national strategy to provide long-term care to the growing population of older adults. Understanding the mental health impacts of spousal caregiving is therefore critically important. Existing studies on the topic have often been limited by methodological limitations, and most overlook the role of caregiving intensity. In this study, we assess the impact of providing different intensities of caregiving to a spouse on mental health outcomes using data from the Health and Retirement Study. We address the endogeneity of the decision to provide different caregiving intensities using an augmented inverse probability weighted (AIPW) estimator adapted to handle multivalued treatments. We check the robustness of our estimates to the AIPW's identifying assumptions by re-estimating the model using a dynamic fixed effects estimator. We find strong evidence that becoming a caregiver is associated with worsened mental health outcomes for women, while the evidence for men is weaker. When disaggregating by caregiving intensity, we find that transitions into high-intensity caregiving lead to large increases in depression symptoms and the probability of exhibiting major depression for both men and women. The overall mental health impact of transiting into caregiving is driven almost exclusively by the negative impact of high-intensity caregiving, as transitions into low- and moderate-intensity caregiving are not associated with worsening mental health in most specifications. This study provides timely insights that can inform the targeting of long-term care policies and programs aimed at supporting family caregivers of older adults."
"The shared control system has been a key technology framework and trend, with its advantages in overcoming the performance shortage of safety and comfort in automated vehicles. Understanding human drivers' driving capabilities and styles is the key to improving system performance, in particular, the acceptance by and adaption of shared control vehicles to human drivers. In this research, personalized shared control considering drivers' main human factors is proposed. A simulated scenario generation method for human factors was established. Drivers' driving capabilities were defined and evaluated to improve the rationality of the driving authority allocation. Drivers' driving styles were analyzed, characterized, and evaluated in a field test for the intention-aware personalized automated subsystem. A personalized shared control framework is proposed based on the driving capabilities and styles, and its evaluation criteria were established, including driving safety, comfort, and workload. The personalized shared control system was evaluated in a human-in-the-loop simulation platform and a field test based on an automated vehicle. The results show that the proposed system could achieve better performances in terms of different driving capabilities, styles, and complex scenarios than those only driven by human drivers or automated systems."
"Transcranial ultrasound neuromodulation (TUSN) is a noninvasive and spatially specific therapy that promises to deliver treatments tailored to the specific needs of individuals. To fulfill this promise, each treatment must be modified to adequately correct for variation across individual skulls and neural anatomy. This study examines the use of ultrasound-induced voltage potentials (measured with electroencephalography [EEG]) to guide TUSN therapies."
"The prehospital treatment for stable patients with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response is rate-controlling agents such as calcium channel blockers, often diltiazem given as a bolus. At our agency we encourage the use of a bolus given via the infusion pump over two to four minutes immediately followed by a maintenance infusion, given concerns of recurrent tachycardia or hypotension secondary to rapid bolus administration. We examined if administering a bolus and infusion via an infusion pump shows better heart rate (HR) control at arrival to the emergency department (ED) compared with administration of a bolus only, while maintaining hemodynamic stability during transport. We also analyzed if a patient received a second bolus within 60 min of arrival to the ED."
"Adversity and trauma are commonly misunderstood human experiences affecting most individuals across post-secondary campuses. Depending on contextual factors, they can lead to lifelong challenges or growth. Without an adequate understanding, well-meaning individuals and organisations may unknowingly perpetuate harm. Trauma-informed approaches (TIAs) can help organisations prevent harm, promote empowerment, and enhance connection. Preliminary investigations are critical for the development of sustainable TIAs. This exploratory study investigated the attitudes, knowledge, and workplace culture concerning adversity and trauma at a small Canadian university with no existing TIA. The study involved two phases: first, preliminary consultations with ten community stakeholders and a review of relevant literature, and second, nine semi-structured interviews with staff and faculty, followed by reflexive thematic analysis of the data. Four key themes emerged: (1) limited trauma awareness on campus, highlighting a need for system-wide training and tools, (2) privilege and vulnerability, disparities in safety, flexibility and agency across university departments, (3) pockets of safety, academic culture and other barriers to change, (4) suggestions to address barriers, through trauma education, human-centric practices, and systemic collaboration. This study provides insight into the readiness, challenges, and recommendations for developing system-wide trauma awareness in a Canadian university."
"The literature has reported contradictory findings regarding the association of Intra-radicular posts (IRPs) presence and periapical radiolucent lesions (PRLs) prevalence in endodontically treated teeth (ETT). Considering this, the study aimed to investigate the association between IRPs presence and PRLs prevalence."
"In a new respiratory virus pandemic, optimizing allocation of scarce medical resources becomes an urgent challenge. Infection prognosis takes on particular importance when allocating scarce antiviral antibodies and drugs, which are most effective when administered before the onset of severe disease. During arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic to the United States in 2020, we conducted a prognostic biomarker discovery and validation effort based upon metabolomic profiling with a liquid-chromatography-mass spectrometer (LC-MS) type used clinically for rapid toxicology. We obtained urine specimens from 163 patients presenting for evaluation. We obtained LC-MS profiles in the initial cohort and used machine learning methods to define a simplified urine metabolomic signature associated with respiratory failure or death by 90 days. This signature was composed of three metabotypes linked to intestinal microbiome metabolism and anticonvulsant use, with a receiver-operator characteristic area under the curve (ROC AUC) of 89.4%. Blinded application of this signature to the subsequent validation cohort yielded a ROC AUC of 81.2%. A model trained on the two baseline metabotypes present before intubation exhibited similar performance in the validation cohort. This study demonstrates the plausibility and promise of rapid metabolome-based prognostic discovery and validation in the opening wave of a pandemic. The approach used here could be used to inform therapeutic and resource allocation decisions early in a future epidemic.IMPORTANCEIn a new respiratory virus pandemic, the ability to identify patients at greatest risk for severe disease is essential to direct scarce medical resources to those most likely to benefit from them. Tools to predict disease severity are best developed early in a pandemic, but laboratory-based resources to develop these may be limited by available technology and by infection precautions. Here, we show that an accessible metabolic profiling approach could identify a prognostic signature of severe disease in the initial wave of COVID-19, when patients presenting for care often exceeded the available doses of convalescent plasma and remdesivir. In a future pandemic, this approach, alongside efforts to identify clinical disease severity predictors, could improve patient outcomes and facilitate therapeutic trials by identifying individuals at high risk for severe disease."
"The global rise in obesity underscores the need for effective weight management strategies that address individual metabolic and hormonal variability, moving beyond the simplistic ""calories in, calories out"" model. Body types-ectomorph, mesomorph, and endomorph-provide a framework for understanding the differences in fat storage, muscle development, and energy expenditure, as each type responds uniquely to caloric intake and exercise. Variability in weight outcomes is influenced by factors such as genetic polymorphisms and epigenetic changes in hormonal signaling pathways and metabolic processes, as well as lifestyle factors, including nutrition, exercise, sleep, and stress. These factors impact the magnitude of lipogenesis and myofibrillar protein synthesis during overfeeding, as well as the extent of lipolysis and muscle proteolysis during caloric restriction, through complex mechanisms that involve changes in the resting metabolic rate, metabolic pathways, and hormonal profiles. Precision approaches, such as nutrigenomics, indirect calorimetry, and artificial-intelligence-based strategies, can potentially leverage these insights to create individualized weight management strategies aligned with each person's unique metabolic profile. By addressing these personalized factors, precision nutrition offers a promising pathway to sustainable and effective weight management outcomes. The main objective of this review is to examine the metabolic and hormonal adaptations driving variability in weight management outcomes and explore how precision nutrition can address these challenges through individualized strategies."

"Supervillin (SVIL), the biggest member of the villin/gelsolin superfamily, has recently been reported to promote the metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma by stimulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). However, little is known about the roles of SVIL in the migration of colorectal cancer cells. Here, we investigated the effects of SVIL on the migration of cisplatin-resistant colorectal cancer cells. The model of cisplatin-resistant HCT116 cells (HCT116/DDP) was established. Migration was assessed after SVIL knockdown. Tumor metastasis was assessed using a mouse model with tail vein injection of colorectal cancer cells. The results showed that the expression of SVIL was upregulated in HCT116/DDP cells compared to that in their parental cells. Also, the HCT116/DDP cells showed increased cell migration and lung metastasis. Furthermore, we revealed that the expression of SVIL was associated with the migration of HCT116/DDP cells. Reduced SVIL expression inhibited migration and lung metastasis in HCT116/DDP cells. Further work showed that SVIL knockdown blocked cell migration by targeting zona occludens-1 (ZO-1) mediated tight-junction remodeling. The expression of ZO-1, but not occludin and cludin5, was downregulated after SVIL knockdown. Immunofluorescence indicated that the linear ZO-1 was interrupted while the SVIL knockdown reversed the interruption. This study displayed the relationship between SVIL and ZO-1 in cisplatin-resistant colon cancer cells, providing a new insight into the mechanism of colorectal cancer migration."

"Inflammatory cytokines are key indicators affecting the development of ulcers of lower limb. The causal role of inflammatory cytokines in ulcers of lower limb and whether this can be mediated by metabolites remain unknown. We conducted a two-step, two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study to investigate the causal effect of inflammatory cytokines on ulcers of lower limb and the mediating role of metabolites in the association between inflammatory cytokines and ulcers of lower limb. MR analysis identified seven inflammatory cytokines (CCL19, IL-12β, MCP4, MIP1a, SCF, sirtuin2, and TNFSF9) that promote ulcers of lower limb. Additionally, 56 metabolites were found to be associated with ulcers of lower limb. Mediation MR indicated that the causal effect of sirtuin2 on ulcers of lower limb (total effect Inverse Variance Weighted [IVW]: odds ratio [OR] = 1.162, 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.051, 1.285], p = 0.003) is largely mediated by 4-hydroxyphenylacetate (0.0185, 95% CI [-0.00278, 0.0397], accounting for 11.1% of the total effect)."
"As a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), studies have demonstrated that long-term high-fat diet (HFD) could accelerate the deposition of amyloid beta (Aβ) in the brain. The glymphatic system plays a critical role in Aβ clearance from the brain. However, studies investigating the effects of long-term HFD on glymphatic function have reported paradoxical outcomes, and whether glymphatic dysfunction is involved in the disturbance of Aβ clearance in long-term HFD-fed mice has not been determined. In the present study, we injected fluorescently labeled Aβ into the hippocampus and found that Aβ clearance was decreased in HFD-fed mice. We found that long-term HFD-fed mice had decreased glymphatic function by injecting fluorescent tracers into the cisterna magna and corpus striatum. In long-term HFD-fed mice, aquaporin-4 (AQP4) polarization in the cortex was disrupted, and glymphatic clearance activity was positively correlated with the AQP4 polarization index. In HFD-fed mice, the disturbance of Aβ clearance from the hippocampus was exacerbated by TGN-020, a specific inhibitor of AQP4, whereas TGN-073, an enhancer of AQP4, ameliorated it. These findings suggest that long-term HFD disrupts Aβ clearance by inhibiting AQP4-mediated glymphatic function. The underlying mechanism may involve the disruption of AQP4 polarization."
"Recently, live-attenuated measles, rubella, varicella, and mumps vaccines have been administered to carefully selected post-liver transplant patients. Although attention has been focused on post-vaccination antibody titers and adverse events, the real-life clinical benefits remain unclear. A comprehensive analysis of breakthrough infections and natural boosters (asymptomatic cases with significant elevation in virus antibody titers) following immunization post-liver transplantation was conducted from 2002-2023, exploring the timing, frequency, correlation with domestic outbreaks, and degree of antibody elevation. During the median 10-year observation period among 68 post-liver transplant patients, breakthrough infections occurred only in chickenpox, with 7 mild cases (1 episode/64 person-years). A total of 59 natural booster episodes (1, 5, 20, and 33 for measles, rubella, chickenpox, and mumps, respectively) were observed, with incidence rates of 1 per 569, 110, 22, and 17 person-years, respectively. The timing of natural boosters closely correlated with domestic outbreaks (P < .05 in chickenpox and mumps), influenced by local vaccine coverage. The degree of antibody elevation was significantly higher in individuals with breakthrough infections than in those with natural boosters (P < .05). These findings suggest that immunization with live-attenuated vaccines for post-liver transplant patients has demonstrated clinical benefits. Furthermore, mass vaccination has a positive impact on post-transplant patient outcomes."

"Assessment of sea lamprey texture from the Guadiana and Mondego River basins. Lamprey has served as food for centuries, and nowadays it is highly appreciated, mainly in southern European countries. Therefore, the quality requirements of the lamprey are closely scrutinized by consumers. The texture is commonly referred to as tenderness, and is one crucial sensory attribute valued by consumers. A deep search for scientific publications about texture evaluation of lamprey allows us to conclude that there is no work published. So, a wide review was carried out on methods for evaluating fish texture. This study aims: (i) to assess the texture of specimens caught in two Portuguese rivers, Guadiana, and Mondego and (ii) to validate the Warner-Bratzler shear method for assessing sea lamprey's texture. Our results on texture of sea lampreys caught in Guadiana and Mondego River basins revealed significant differences in texture parameters, obtained through the Warner Bratzler test. Sea lamprey from Guadiana River basin exhibited lower values of firmness (123.15 N) and energy indicating softer flesh, and lampreys from Mondego River basin displayed higher firmness values (147.37 N), indicating harder flesh. This study confirmed the adequacy of the Warner-Bratzler shear method for assessing sea lamprey texture due to its sensitivity and accuracy in measuring the texture parameters obtained through force deformation curve. This knowledge will allow future studies to use a consistent method to assess texture. The certification of regional food products increases fishing communities' income and gives consumers greater confidence in the quality of these delicatessen products."

"Viruses transmitted by mosquitoes threaten the health of millions of people worldwide. There is an urgent need for new tools for personal protection to ensure that vulnerable individuals are protected from infectious bites when outdoors. Here, we test the efficacy of wash-in and spray-on repellents against Aedes aegypti. When applied as a treatment on clothing as well as skin, the novel repellent compound delta-undecalactone provided up to 100% protection initially, and over 50% bite prevention for more than 7 hours. Mathematical modelling indicated that if such a repellent, with 100% initial efficacy, were to be applied twice daily by 80% of the population, more than 30% of Zika virus infections could be averted in an outbreak scenario with a basic reproduction number R0 = 2.2. In a less severe outbreak (R0 = 1.6), the same repellent regimen could avert 96% of infections. If there was much lower uptake, with only 40% of people using the repellent twice per day, just 4% of Zika cases would be averted (outbreak R0 = 2.2). Similar results were found in other scenarios tested for dengue and chikungunya outbreaks. Our model can be extrapolated to other repellents and guide future product development, and provides support to the concept that effective repellents that are used regularly and appropriately could be cost-effective interventions to prevent ill health from arboviral diseases."
"Advanced practice providers (APPs) experience limited clinical opportunities to perform neonatal procedures to maintain competency and hospital credentialing, especially high-acuity procedures that are extremely rare but crucial during patient emergencies. Incorporating simulation as part of continuing professional education can help APPs maintain clinical procedural competency and learn new procedural techniques to improve the quality and safety of procedures performed in the clinical setting. In 2013, we successfully developed and implemented an annual didactic and simulation-based neonatal procedural skills program. Since then, our APP group has experienced significant growth, which introduced challenges to sustain a high-quality program that would be valued by participants. These challenges presented the opportunity for a major program redesign addressing education, competency, credentialing, safety, and quality improvement. In this article, we describe the challenges that we uncovered from a comprehensive needs assessment that informed program redesign. We also present evaluation of the redesigned program, which includes learner, patient care, and systems-based outcomes."
"Melanoma brain metastasis is associated with high morbidity and mortality and remains a major clinical challenge. Despite recent successes with combination immune checkpoint inhibitors in the treatment of affected patients, the mechanistic underpinnings of T-cell entry and response to these drugs in brain metastasis are poorly understood. Using real-time intravital microscopy, Messmer and colleagues identified peritumoral venous vessels (PVV) as critical sites for T-cell entry into brain metastases, a process accelerated by immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment. The expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 on PVVs was found to be important for T-cell recruitment in preclinical models and associated with increased T-cell infiltration in human brain metastatic lesions. This study highlights PVVs as key vascular entry points for T cells into brain metastases, laying the foundation for enhancing the efficacy of cancer immunotherapies."
"Appreciation for the utility of creative arts therapy in rehabilitation is on the rise. The limitations of conventional approaches to address posttraumatic stress disorder and co-occurring traumatic brain injury is spurring the development and increased use of creative arts therapies, especially in US military health care systems. However, emerging applications of creative arts therapies in rehabilitation extend well beyond posttraumatic stress disorder/traumatic brain injury and military populations to span the continuum of care, from the intensive care unit, postoperative recovery unit, acute inpatient medical and surgical wards, outpatient clinics, and home health, as well as in traditional long-term care and psychiatric settings. Critical steps to more fully integrating creative arts therapies in rehabilitation include the following: (1) incorporation of education about creative arts therapies into the curricula across rehabilitation disciplines; (2) alteration of national and state policies to promote greater inclusion of creative arts therapies as reimbursable treatments for a wide array of clinical diagnoses and conditions; and (3) significant expansion of creative arts therapies' evidence base. This can be achieved by increasing funding levels to encourage rigorously designed and controlled studies to determine the efficacy, populations, diagnoses and conditions, cofactors, and the mechanisms of action of creative arts therapies. The time has come for a concentrated effort from the community of rehabilitation professional associations, advocacy organizations, and practitioners to promote the advancement and inclusion of creative arts therapies into appropriate clinical settings to optimize outcomes for patients."
"The Caatinga biome has a wide variety of plants which, despite their irregular distribution, are frequently used to feed animals. This study aimed to evaluate the gas production kinetics of Caatinga plants: Malva (Herissantia crispa), Aroeira (Myracrodruon urundeuva), Marmeleiro (Croton sonderianus), and Bamburral (Hyptis suaveolens). Buffel grass (Cenchrus ciliaris), a cultivated forage, was used as a control. For this evaluation, samples of Aroeira, Malva, Marmeleiro, Bamburral, and Buffel grass were weighed and then incubated in 100 ml flasks containing rumen fluid and buffer solution at 39 °C in a water bath. The volume of gases produced was measured with graduated syringes at various times. The parameters of in vitro degradation kinetics were estimated from cumulative gas production using the NLMIXED procedure of SAS (Statistical Analysis System, Cary, USA). Buffel grass showed higher gas production than the other samples (77.64 ml), followed by the Caatinga samples, Malva and Aroeira (58.16 ml and 54.05 ml, respectively), which were statistically similar. In conclusion, we suggest that Malva and Aroeira are forage plants with promising potential to improve the nutrition of ruminants in arid regions, given their high protein content, moderate fiber content, and characteristics related to gas production identified with the in vitro digestibility test."

Pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) for patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is associated with a high risk of postoperative complications (PoCs) and risk prediction of these is therefore critical for optimal treatment planning. We hypothesize that novel deep learning network approaches through transfer learning may be superior to legacy approaches for PoC risk prediction in the PDAC surgical setting.
"Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is associated with high mortality rates and often results in prolonged hospital stays. The potential of machine learning to enhance prediction accuracy in this context is significant, yet clinicians often lack the programming skills required for effective data mining. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of a low-code approach for assisting clinicians with data mining for mortality and length of stay (LOS) prediction in patients with CAP. A retrospective study was conducted using a low-code platform and the PyCaret library in Google Colab on data from patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) admitted between January 2013 and December 2021 to two medical facilities. Model performance was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for mortality prediction and the R2 score for LOS prediction, with benchmarks set at AUC > 0.9 and R2 > 0.5. The Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) method was used for interpreting individual predictions. A total of 669 CAP patients were enrolled in the analysis.Fifteen models were evaluated for mortality prediction, and nineteen models were evaluated for LOS prediction utilizing the PyCaret library. The Light Gradient Boosting Machine model yielded the highest AUC (0.963) for mortality prediction. In predicting LOS, the Extratrees Regressor model achieved the highest R2 score of 0.585. Factors such as the severity of pneumonia and the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) were significant factors influencing mortality. For the LOS, the CCI score, activities of daily living, and social support were significant predictors. The low-code approach enables medical professionals with limited technical expertise to effectively employ data science in their clinical decision-making process. This approach proved to be a valuable tool in the analysis of CAP patient data."

"In this study, the present status of the public health and wellness sector in China is examined. The main objective is to evaluate the financial risk among publicly listed companies in the sector. Despite the significant expansion of the industry, research in this domain remains limited. Moreover, it frequently lacks depth, especially when it comes to financial studies designed especially for publicly traded companies. Current models for assessing corporate financial risk are frequently applied in diverse industries without necessary adjustments. Therefore, this study examines the financial performance and operational health of five publicly listed anonymized companies between 2020 and 2023. Using an efficient methodology that includes reliable data collection and quality assurance, we analyze key performance indicators such as annual revenues, liquidity ratios, and debt-to-equity ratios to assess financial stability and growth potential. Our findings reveal varied revenue trends shaped by external market shocks such as the COVID-19 pandemic. These trends highlight both the resilience of the sector and its vulnerabilities. To evaluate potential financial risks and outliers, the abnormal revenue patterns are also identified using Z-score. Benchmarking is also conducted using industry averages which provides a clearer understanding of competitive positioning. Several suggestions are made in light of the analysis to manage debt, increase liquidity, and leverage digital transformation for long-term growth. Several future directions are also presented to continue research in the domain. Overall, this study offers valuable information for stakeholders navigating the complexities of the public health and wellness industry in China."
"Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is a novel drug combination authorized by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This report describes the case of a patient with a prior history of kidney transplantation who received nirmatrelvir/ritonavir. In this case, sirolimus use was successfully stopped before nirmatrelvir/ritonavir treatment, and the nirmatrelvir/ritonavir trough concentration was determined. During nirmatrelvir/ritonavir treatment, the sirolimus trough concentration remained stable. This case highlights the risk associated with the concomitant administration of sirolimus and nirmatrelvir/ritonavir. Providers should therefore be cautious when prescribing nirmatrelvir/ritonavir to kidney transplant recipients currently receiving sirolimus, with caution exercised based on creatinine clearance."

"A study was carried out on the immobilization of pepsin in activated carbon functionalized by different techniques (glutaraldehyde, genipin, and metallization) aiming at its application in obtaining bioactive peptides through casein hydrolysis. Studies of the immobilized derivatives were carried out in addition to the evaluation of the antioxidant potential of the peptides. Among the pH range studied, pH 3.0 was selected due to the higher activity of the derivatives at this pH. The support modification by metallization was the method with the best results, providing a 121% increase in enzymatic activity compared to other immobilization methods. In addition, this derivative provided activity closer to the soluble enzyme activity (3.30 U) and better storage stability, and allows reuse for more than 8 cycles. In turn, the peptides from casein hydrolysis showed potential as antioxidant agents, with a DPPH radical scavenging activity higher than 70%, maximum protection against β-carotene oxidation close to 70%, and a maximum reducing power of Fe(III) into Fe(II) of 400 uM by the FRAP assay. The results showed that the new techniques for modification of activated carbon can be a promising approach for pepsin immobilization."

"Electrophoresis of a weakly charged dielectric droplet with constant surface charge density in a chargeless cylindrical pore is investigated theoretically in this study, focusing on the boundary confinement effect of the double layer, which in turn determines the ultimate motion of the droplet. A patched pseudo-spectral method based on the Chebyshev polynomial is adopted to solve the resulting governing fundamental electrokinetic equations. Mobility reversal, among other interesting phenomena, is observed when the droplet is in a narrow cylindrical pore. No such observation was made in the corresponding motion of a rigid particle. The droplet with a thick double layer may even move against the prediction based on the Coulomb electrostatic law, for instance, a positively charged droplet may move against the electric field. The significant enhancement of the motion-deterring double layer polarization due to the severe steric boundary confinement within a narrow cylindrical pore is found to be responsible for this seemingly peculiar phenomenon. Moreover, smaller droplets may move in the opposite direction of the larger ones. The results are useful in capillary electrophoresis involving droplets in particular and migration of droplets through narrow channels in general."

"Radionuclides used for imaging and therapy can show high molecular specificity in the body with appropriate targeting ligands. We hypothesized that local energy delivered by molecularly targeted radionuclides could chemically activate prodrugs at disease sites while avoiding activation in off-target sites of toxicity. As proof of principle, we tested whether this strategy of radionuclide-induced drug engagement for release (RAiDER) could locally deliver combined radiation and chemotherapy to maximize tumor cytotoxicity while minimizing off-target exposure to activated chemotherapy."

Pediatric extended endonasal procedures pose significant surgical challenges. Lesions from the suprasellar region to the lower clivus necessitate extensive exposure. This study examined whether drilling the spheno-occipital synchondrosis (SOS) to remove the posterior clinoid process and dorsum sellae (DS) for greater exposure affects pediatric midfacial growth.
"Rapid evaporative ionization mass spectrometry (REIMS) coupled with a monopolar handpiece used for surgical resection and combined with chemometrics has been previously explored by our research group (Mangraviti et al. in Int J Mol Sci 23(18):10562, 2022) to identify several mammary gland pathologies. Here, the increased sample size allowed the construction of three statistical models to distinguish between benign and malignant canine mammary tumours (CMTs), facilitating a more in-depth investigation of changes in cellular metabolic phenotype during neoplastic transformation and biological behaviour. The results demonstrate that REIMS is effective in identifying neoplastic tissues with an accuracy of 97%, with differences in MS spectra characterized by the relative abundance of phospholipids compared to triglycerides more commonly identified in normal mammary glands. The increased rate of phospholipid synthesis represents an informative feature for tumour recognition, with phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine, the two major phospholipid species identified here together with sphingolipids, playing a crucial role in carcinogenesis. REIMS technology allowed the classification of different histotypes of benign CMTs with an accuracy score of 95%, distinguishing them from normal glands based on the increase in sphingolipids, glycolipids, phospholipids, and arachidonic acid, demonstrating the close association between cancer and inflammation. Finally, dysregulation of fatty acid metabolism with increased signalling for saturated, mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids characterized the metabolic phenotype of neoplastic cells and their malignant transformation, supporting the increased formation of new organelles for cell division. Further investigations on a more significant number of tumour histotypes will allow for the creation of a more extensive database and lay the basis for how understanding metabolic alterations in the tumour microenvironment can improve surgical precision."
"Collagen is a crucial protein in the extracellular matrix (ECM) essential for preserving tissue architecture and supporting crucial cellular functions like proliferation and differentiation. There are twenty-eight identified types of collagen, which are further divided into different subgroups. This protein plays a critical role in regulating tissue homeostasis. However, in solid tumors, the balance can be disrupted, due to an abundance of collagen in the tumor microenvironment, which significantly affects tumor growth, cell invasion, and metastasis. It is important to investigate the specific types of collagens in cancer ECM and their distinct roles in tumor progression to comprehend their unique contribution to tumor behavior. The diverse pathophysiological functions of different collagen types in cancers illustrate collagen's dual roles, offering potential therapeutic options and serving as prognostic markers."
"Although there is currently sufficient information on various parameters of capillary blood flow, including the average values of blood velocity, there is no data on the dynamics of velocity and the mechanisms of its modulation in various parts of the capillary. The main idea of this work is to develop a tool and image data processing to study the characteristics of the capillary blood flow dynamics. In this study, using the developed method of high-speed videocapillaroscopy, the red blood cells (RBC) velocities in the arterial and venous parts of the nailfold capillaries were compared and a time-frequency analysis of the dynamics of the velocity signals with the calculation of phase coherence was performed. We indicated that the velocity in the arterial part is twice as high and that the ratio of velocities in the arterial and venous parts is stable regardless of the local velocity. This study also empirically confirms the similarity between the oscillations of blood flow in different parts of the capillary and the synchronization of the velocity phases. We believe that the determination of the absolute velocity characteristics of blood flow, together with the mechanisms of its regulation and the ratio of velocities in the arterial and venous parts, can act as a diagnostic approach."

"The field of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has advanced rapidly in the past decade, generating significant amounts of valuable data for researchers to study complex tumor profiles. This data is crucial for gaining innovative insights into cancer biology. CancerSCEM (https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/cancerscem) is a public resource that integrates, analyzes and visualizes scRNA-seq data related to cancer, and it provides invaluable support to numerous cancer-related studies. With CancerSCEM 2.0, scRNA-seq data have increased from 208 to 1466 datasets, covering tumor, matching-normal and peripheral blood samples across 127 research projects and 74 cancer types. The new version of this resource enhances transcriptome analysis by adding copy number variation evaluation, transcription factor enrichment, pseudotime trajectory construction, and diverse biological feature scoring. It also introduces a new cancer metabolic map at the single-cell level, providing an intuitive understanding of metabolic regulation across different cancer types. CancerSCEM 2.0 has a more interactive analysis platform, including four modules and 14 analytical functions, allowing researchers to perform cancer scRNA-seq data analyses in various dimensions. These enhancements are expected to expand the usability of CancerSCEM 2.0 to a broader range of cancer research and clinical applications, potentially revolutionizing our understanding of cancer mechanisms and treatments."

"Vagal nerve stimulation has emerged as a promising modality for treating a wide range of chronic conditions, including metabolic disorders. However, the cellular and molecular pathways driving these clinical benefits remain largely obscure. Here, we demonstrate that fibroblast growth factor 3 (Fgf3) mRNA is upregulated in the mouse vagal ganglia under acute metabolic stress. Systemic and vagal sensory overexpression of Fgf3 enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), improved glucose excursion, and increased energy expenditure and physical activity. Fgf3-elicited insulinotropic and glucose-lowering responses were recapitulated when overexpression of Fgf3 was restricted to the pancreas-projecting vagal sensory neurons. Genetic ablation of Fgf3 in pancreatic vagal afferents exacerbated high-fat diet-induced glucose intolerance and blunted GSIS. Finally, electrostimulation of the vagal afferents enhanced GSIS and glucose clearance independently of efferent outputs. Collectively, we demonstrate a direct role for the vagal afferent signaling in GSIS and identify Fgf3 as a vagal sensory-derived metabolic factor that controls pancreatic β-cell activity."
"Regional lymph node metastasis (LNM) assessment is crucial for predicting intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) prognosis. However, imaging assessment has limitations for identifying LNM."
"Clinical remission has emerged as an important treatment goal in severe asthma; however, studies have reported variable attainment due to differences in study populations, definitions, and methods. We aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical remission attainment, definitions, and correlates among patients with severe asthma who have been treated with biologics."
"Balanced chromosomal translocations occur in approximately 0.16 to 0.20% of live births. While most carriers are phenotypically normal, they are at risk of generating unbalanced gametes during meiosis, leading to genetic anomalies such as aneuploidies, deletions, duplications, and gene disruptions. These anomalies can result in spontaneous abortions or congenital anomalies, including neurodevelopmental disorders. Complex chromosomal rearrangements (CCRs) involving more than two chromosomes are rare but further increase the probability of producing unbalanced gametes. Neurodevelopmental disorders such as Angelman syndrome (AS) and duplication 15q11q13 syndrome (Dup15q) are associated with such chromosomal abnormalities."
"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is well known among the elderly and has a profound impact on both patients and their families. Increasing research indicates that AD is a systemic disease, with a strong connection to cardiovascular disease. They share common genetic factors, such as mutations in the presenilin (PS1 and PS2) and the apolipoprotein E (APOE) genes. Cardiovascular conditions can lead to reduced cerebral blood flow and increased oxidative stress. These factors contribute to the accumulation of Aβ plaques and the formation of abnormal tau protein tangles, which are both key pathological features of AD. Additionally, Aβ deposits and abnormal protein responses have been observed in cardiomyocytes as well as in peripheral tissues. The toxic Aβ deposition intensifies damage to the microvascular structure associated with blood-brain barrier disruption and the initiation of neuroinflammation, which may accelerate the onset of neurocognitive deficits and cardiovascular dysfunction. Thus, we discuss the main mechanisms linking AD and cardiac dysfunction to enhance our understanding of these conditions. Ultimately, insights into the brain-heart axis may help us develop effective treatment strategies in the future."
"Patients with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer undergoing continuous adjuvant hormone therapy often experience delayed recurrence with tamoxifen use, potentially causing adverse effects. However, the lack of biomarkers hampers patient selection for extended endocrine therapy. This study aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying delayed recurrence and identify biomarkers. When miRNA expression was assessed in luminal breast cancer tissues with and without delayed recurrence using NanoString, a significant increase in the expression of miR483-3p was observed in samples from patients with delayed recurrence compared with those without. miR483-3p expression was elevated in tamoxifen resistant (TAMR) EFM19 cells than in non-resistant EFM19 cells. Notably, genes associated with cancer metastasis (AMOTL2, ANKRD1, CTGF, and VEGF) were upregulated in TAMR EFM19 cells, although cell motility and proliferation were reduced. Transfection of miR483-3p mimics into both non-resistant EFM19 and MCF7 cells resulted in increased expression of cancer metastasis-related genes, but decreased proliferation and migration. Given that miR483-3p can bind to the 3'UTR region of O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and potentially affect its protein expression, we examined OGT protein levels and found that transfection with miR483-3p mimics selectively reduced OGT expression. Overall, breast cancer cells subjected to long-term hormone therapy displayed elevated miR483-3p expression, reducing motility and dormancy induction via decreased OGT expression. These findings suggest that miR483-3p is a potential biomarker for long-term endocrine therapy."
"In difficult listening conditions, the visual system assists with speech perception through lipreading. Stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) is used to investigate the interaction between the two modalities in speech perception. Previous estimates of audiovisual benefit and SOA integration period differ widely. A limitation of previous research is a lack of consideration of visemes-categories of phonemes defined by similar lip movements when produced by a speaker-to ensure that selected phonemes are visually distinct. This study aimed to reassess the benefits of audiovisual lipreading to speech perception when different viseme categories are selected as stimuli and presented in noise. The study also aimed to investigate the effects of SOA on these stimuli."
This study investigated pathogenic role and mechanism of extracellular histone H4 during oleic acid (OA)-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
"Over the past decade, advancements in rectal cancer research have reshaped treatment paradigms. Historically, treatment for locally advanced rectal cancer has focused on neoadjuvant long-course chemoradiotherapy, followed by total mesorectal excision. Interest in organ preservation strategies has been strengthened by the introduction of total neoadjuvant therapy with improved rates of complete clinical response. The administration of systemic induction chemotherapy and consolidation chemoradiotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting has introduced a new dimension to the treatment landscape and patients now face a more intricate decision-making process, given the expanded therapeutic options. This complexity underlines the importance of shared decision-making and brings to light the crucial role of radiologists. MRI, especially high-spatial-resolution T2-weighted imaging, is heralded as the reference standard for rectal cancer management because of its exceptional ability to provide staging and prognostic insights. A key evolution in MRI interpretation for rectal cancer is the transition from the DISTANCE mnemonic to the more encompassing DISTANCED-DIS, distal tumor boundary; T, T stage; A, anal sphincter complex; N, nodal status; C, circumferential resection margin; E, extramural venous invasion; D, tumor deposits. This nuanced shift in the mnemonic captures a wider range of diagnostic indicators. It also emphasizes the escalating role of radiologists in steering well-informed decisions in the realm of rectal cancer care."
"This study aims to investigate the effect of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation or EBV reactivation with dexamethasone (DXM) in patients with adverse drug reactions (ADRs) through evaluating the levels of monocyte, macrophage M2/M1, and cytokines, and investigating whether expression of EBV receptor EphA2 could specifically influence EBV activation in ADRs. We performed a prospective longitudinal study to analyze the monocytes, macrophages, M2/M1 ratio, and cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-4, IL-13, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interferon (IFN)-γ, IFN-β, C-X-C motif chemokine ligand (CXCL)9, and CXCL10, in patients with maculopapular exanthema (MPE) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN), and control groups after disease onset. Skin biopsy samples from these patients were subjected to hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining to examine tissue architecture and inflammatory cell infiltration, as well as Epstein-Barr virus-encoded RNA (EBER) staining to detect the presence of EBV within the skin lesions. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected from these patients were co-cultured with EBV or EBV combined with DXM to assess the impact on monocytes, macrophages, the M2/M1 ratio, and the associated cytokine profile. Furthermore, we sought to identify which cytokines might be crucial in mediating the interaction between the M2/M1 ratio and EBV. EPhA2 expression was evaluated to determine its role in the reactivation of EBV and its correlation with increased viral load in MPE and SJS/TEN patients. Selective depletion of macrophages occurred during the acute stage of SJS/TEN, while a shift towards M2 macrophages was observed in MPE. Both IFN-β and CXCL9 levels were elevated in MPE and SJS/TEN. Additionally, our study demonstrated the presence of EBV in the skin lesions of SJS/TEN and MPE patients through H&E and EBER staining, confirming EBV's involvement in these conditions. Activation of EBV and EBV combined with DXM led to a shift from M1 to M2 macrophages, accompanied by increased levels of IL-4, IFN-γ, and CXCL9 in MPE and SJS/TEN, compared to healthy individuals. Specifically, EBV combined with DXM primarily drove IFN-γ and IL-4 expansions in MPE, while CXCL9 was predominantly elevated in SJS/TEN. The increased IL-4 levels were associated with the relative rise in EBV viral loads after EBV combined with DXM stimulation. Furthermore, EphA2 expression in monocytes was significantly higher in SJS/TEN and MPE patients compared to controls, with further increases on EBV stimulation. This elevation in EPhA2 correlated with increased EBV viral load, particularly in MPE and SJS/TEN patients. The gradual shift from M1 to M2 cell development observed during the clinical course of MPE and SJS/TEN is mediated by the predominance of EBV and EBV with DXM at the acute stage, leading to elevated IL-4, IFN-γ, and CXCL9 levels, which may exacerbate allergic reactions. The elevation in EPhA2 correlated with increased EBV viral load, particularly in MPE and SJS/TEN patients, suggesting that adverse drug reactions may induce EPhA2 expression, facilitating EBV replication and activation. EphA2 could thus serve as an indicator of EBV activation and a marker for assessing the risk of EBV in patients with adverse drug reactions."
"About 32 million pregnant women are at the risk of malaria infection yearly in malaria-endemic sub-Saharan Africa. To mitigate the risks associated with malaria in pregnancy, the WHO recommends ≥3 doses of intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), covering from the second trimester of pregnancy until delivery."
"Extensive neovascularization is a hallmark of glioblastoma (GBM). In addition to supplying oxygen and nutrients, vascular endothelial cells provide trophic support to GBM cells via paracrine signaling. Here we report that Endocan (ESM1), an endothelial-secreted proteoglycan, confers enhanced proliferative, migratory, and angiogenic properties to GBM cells and regulates their spatial identity. Mechanistically, Endocan exerts at least part of its functions via direct binding and activation of the PDGFRA receptor. Subsequent downstream signaling enhances chromatin accessibility of the Myc promoter and upregulates Myc expression inducing stable phenotypic changes in GBM cells. Furthermore, Endocan confers radioprotection on GBM cells in vitro and in vivo. Inhibition of Endocan-PDGFRA signaling with ponatinib increases survival in the Esm1 wild-type but not in the Esm1 knock-out mouse GBM model. Our findings identify Endocan and its downstream signaling axis as a potential target to subdue GBM recurrence and highlight the importance of vascular-tumor interactions for GBM development."
"Rats which experienced neonatal bladder inflammation (NBI) have been demonstrated to exhibit latent bladder hypersensitivity with a nociceptive component that becomes unmasked by a second inflammatory insult as an adult. Manifested as augmented reflex and neuronal responses to urinary bladder distension (UBD), these NBI-induced changes are revealed by using inflammation of nearby structures as an adult pretreatment. The effect of inflammation in distant structures is not known. These studies examined visceromotor reflex responses and lumbosacral spinal dorsal horn neuronal responses to UBD in rats and compared effects of segmental (hindpaw) versus hetero-segmental (forepaw or face) inflammatory pretreatments in 192 female Sprague-Dawley rats raised from birth. On postnatal days 14-16 these rats underwent either NBI or control procedures. As adults, these rats received control injections or 0.1 ml Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA) injections into one of four sites. Three days later they were studied in reflex or spinal single-cell neuronal experiments where responses were evoked by UBD. Visceromotor responses to UBD were more robust in rats which had injections in the hindpaw (either side) but were not significantly affected by forepaw or facial injections. Similar results were identified in L6/S1 neurons with more robust UBD-evoked responses observed in rats receiving hindpaw CFA injections but not forepaw injections. These results indicate that latent bladder hypersensitivity induced by NBI is made manifest by segmental, but not hetero-segmental inflammatory stimuli. This observation correlates with pain in patients with interstitial cystitis who often have flares in symptoms associated with inflammation of nearby structures."

"Ankle osteoarthritis is a debilitating condition that significantly impairs patients' quality of life. Platelet-rich plasma has emerged as a novel cellular therapy in clinical practice. This study evaluates the clinical efficacy of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) after intervention in ankle disorders, so as to provide strong evidence in support of clinical treatment."
"Laparoscopic microwave ablation (LMWA) has yet to gain a specific place in treatment guidelines for early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study compared the outcomes of LMWA and trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE) for early non-resectable patients with HCC, taking percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (PRFA) as the reference treatment."
"Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are enzymes that play an essential role in the onset and progression of cancer. As a consequence, a variety of HDAC inhibitors (HDACis) have been developed as potent anticancer agents, several of which have been approved by the FDA for cancer treatment. However, recent accumulated research results have suggested that HDACs are also involved in several other pathophysiological conditions, such as fibrotic, inflammatory, neurodegenerative, and autoimmune diseases. Very recently, the HDAC inhibitor givinostat has been approved by the FDA for an indication beyond cancer: the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. In recent years, more and more HDACis have been developed as tools to understand the role that HDACs play in various disorders and as a novel therapeutic approach to fight various diseases other than cancer. In the present perspective article, we discuss the development and study of HDACis as anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory agents, covering the period from 2020-2024. We envision that the discovery of selective inhibitors targeting specific HDAC isozymes will allow the elucidation of the role of HDACs in various pathological processes and will lead to the development of promising treatments for such diseases."
"The global burden of drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) continues to challenge healthcare systems worldwide. There is a critical need to tackle DR-TB by enhancing diagnostics and drug susceptibility testing (DST) capabilities, particularly for emerging DR-TB drugs. This endeavor is crucial to optimize the efficacy of new therapeutic regimens and prevent the resistance and overuse of these invaluable weapons. Despite this urgency, there remains a lack of comprehensive review of public health measures aimed at improving the diagnostics and DST capabilities. In this review, we outline strategies to enhance the capabilities, especially tailored to address the challenges posed by resistance to new DR-TB drugs. We discuss the current landscape of DR-TB drugs, existing diagnostic and susceptibility testing methods, and notable gaps and challenges in these methods and explore strategies for ensuring fair access to DST while narrowing these disparities. The strategies include public health interventions aimed at strengthening laboratory infrastructure, workforce training, and quality assurance programs, technology transfer initiatives, involving drug developers in the DST development, establishing national or regional referral hubs, fostering collaboration and resources pooling with other infection control efforts, extending testing access in underserved areas through public-private partnerships, advocating for lowering costs or loans at low interest, remote technical support, and implementing mandatory molecular surveillance monitoring. This review underscores the urgent need to enhance DST capacities for new DR-TB drugs and identifies opportunities for innovation and improvement. Assessing the extent of the global health impact of these measures is crucial to ensure their effectiveness in combating DR-TB."
"Radon and thoron exhalation rates from samples are estimated by the standard closed-loop technique using online radon monitors. Conventionally, the mass balance equation is formulated by considering the closed air volume of the sample chamber and the detector chamber put together. This model serves the purpose of estimating the radon/thoron exhalation rates for the prescribed pump flow rate of 1 L min-1 using RAD7 online monitor. The flow rate requirement is crucial for thoron measurement due to its short half-life. In the present work, an alternate model is proposed which simulates the dynamics of radon/thoron concentration dictated by the air entry and exit rate and brings out the effect of pump flow rate. This model is more of academic interest, where sample chamber and detector chamber are considered as two separate entities since they are separated by tubing. The mass balance equation is reformulated considering the air entry and exit in and out the individual chambers. The radon buildup in the sample chamber and detector chamber were treated separately by two coupled differential equations. The equations were numerically solved. The model reiterated the fact that the lower flow rates do not affect the buildup profile of relatively long-lived 222Rn (half-life 3.8 d) and its steady-state concentration attained in the closed air volume. However, experiments carried out for flow rates 0.3 and 0.5 L min-1 with RAD7 monitor using powdered granite sample with higher 226Ra and 232Th concentrations gave contradicting results. The radon effective removal rate was found to decrease with increase in flow rate from 0.3 to 1 L min-1. This issue was investigated, and it was speculated that the thoron interference problem might not be properly addressed for flow rates <1 L min-1. This was ascertained by observing the effective radon removal rate in the absence of thoron by conducting radon decay experiments with different flow rates. For the case of short-lived thoron (half-life 55 s), the model described the dynamics of thoron concentration in the closed loop and the steady-state concentrations attained in the detector and sample chamber. As expected, the model showed that due to decay losses during transit of thoron between the chambers, the steady-state concentrations attained in the chambers considerably differ from each other even for 1 L min-1 flow rate."

"This study aimed to identify radiotherapy dosimetric parameters related to local failure (LF)-free survival (LFFS) in patients with lung and liver oligometastases from colorectal cancer treated with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). We analyzed 75 oligometastatic lesions in 55 patients treated with SBRT between January 2014 and December 2021. There was no constraint or intentional increase in maximum dose. LF was defined as the progression of the treated lesion until the last follow-up or death. The dose distributions were recalculated using Monte Carlo-based algorithms. The significance of the planning target volume (PTV) biologically effective dose (BED) 10s (D2, D95, D98, Dmean) in LFFS was evaluated using Cox regression, considering sex, age, primary cancer, tumor site, oligometastatic status, multiplicity, and either tumor size or one of the volume parameters. LF occurred in 23.4% of the lesions. Lesions showing LF received significantly lower PTV D2 (146 ± 21 vs. 164 ± 23, p = 0.006). Multivariate analysis revealed that PTV D2 (< 159 Gy10 vs. ≥ 159 Gy10) was the sole dosimetric parameter associated with LFFS. Tumors equal to or larger than the median size/volume yet receiving < 159 Gy10 of PTV D2 showed the lowest LFFS following stratification by median PTV D2 combined with tumor size or volume parameters. The maximum dose (PTV D2) was significantly associated with LFFS after SBRT for lung and liver oligometastases from colorectal cancer. Increasing the maximum dose may be beneficial for managing larger tumors."
"Anemia is a medical condition resulting from a reduction in the number of red blood cells below the reference range. It is a major public health problem, particularly among adolescents, as it can have negative effects on cognitive performance, growth and reproduction. This study aims to assess the determinants of anemia among adolescents in schools in the city of Douala."
"Obesity and overweight, fundamental components of the metabolic syndrome, predispose individuals to lifestyle-related diseases. The extent to which adopting healthy lifestyles can reduce obesity risk, even in those with a high genetic risk, remains uncertain. Our aim was to assess the extent to which lifestyle modifications can improve outcomes in individuals with a high polygenic score (PGS) for obesity. We quantified the genetic risk of obesity using PGSs. Four datasets from the Tohoku Medical Megabank Community-Based Cohort (TMM CommCohort) were employed in the study. One dataset (n = 9958) was used to select the best model for calculating PGS. The remaining datasets (total n = 69,341) were used in a meta-analysis to validate the model and to evaluate associated risks. The odds ratio (OR) for obesity risk in the intermediate (11th-90th percentiles in the dataset) and high PGS categories (91st-100th) was 2.27 [95% confidence intervals: 2.12-2.44] and 4.83 [4.45-5.25], respectively, compared to that in the low PGS category (1st-10th). Trend analysis showed that an increase in leisure-time physical activity was significantly associated with reduced obesity risk across all genetic risk categories, representing an OR of 0.9 [0.87-0.94] even among individuals in the high PGS category. Similarly, sodium intake displayed a positive association with obesity across all genetic risk categories, yielding an OR of 1.24 [1.17-1.31] in the high PGS category. The risk of obesity was linked to the adoption of healthy lifestyles, even in individuals with high PGS. Our results may provide perspectives for integrating PGSs into preventive medicine."
"Cinnamic acid (CA) possesses important cardiovascular effects such as cardioprotective, antiatherogenic, antihyperlipidemic and antioxidant, which predicts its potential role in the treatment of hypertension. The study was executed to investigate the antihypertensive potential of CA in Sprague Dawley (SD) rats followed by evaluation in diverse vascular preparations. Invasive blood pressure monitoring technique was used in normotensive and hypertensive rats, under anesthesia. Isolated aortic rings from rat and rabbit, Langendorrf's perfused isolated rabbit heart and guinea-pig right atria were used to probe the underlying mechanisms. The responses were recorded with pressure and force transducers connected to PowerLab Data Acquisition System. Intravenous administration of CA induced a respective 54% and 38% fall in mean arterial pressure (MAP) in the hypertensive and normotensive rats, respectively. In rat aortic rings, the CA exhibited muscarinic receptors-linked NO and indomethacin-sensitive endothelium-dependent (>50%) and calcium antagonistic and KATP-mediated endothelium-independent vasodilator effects. The CA showed negative inotropic and chronotropic effects in guinea-pig atrial strips. The CA suppressed force of ventricular contraction and heart rate while caused a 25% increase in coronary flow. This study supports the medicinal importance of CA as antihypertensive agent."
"Neoadjuvant immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors has shown promising results for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. However, it has been associated with immune-related adverse events (irAEs), including checkpoint inhibitor pneumonitis (CIP), which can be life-threatening."
"The brain is structurally and functionally modular, although recent evidence has raised questions about the extent of both types of modularity. Using a simple, toy artificial neural network setup that allows for precise control, we find that structural modularity does not in general guarantee functional specialization (across multiple measures of specialization). Further, in this setup (1) specialization only emerges when features of the environment are meaningfully separable, (2) specialization preferentially emerges when the network is strongly resource-constrained, and (3) these findings are qualitatively similar across several different variations of network architectures. Finally, we show that functional specialization varies dynamically across time, and these dynamics depend on both the timing and bandwidth of information flow in the network. We conclude that a static notion of specialization is likely too simple a framework for understanding intelligence in situations of real-world complexity, from biology to brain-inspired neuromorphic systems."
"Workers regularly using vibrating hand tools may develop a disorder referred to as hand-arm vibration syndrome (HAVS). HAVS is characterized by cold-induced vasospasms in the hands and fingers that result in blanching of the skin, loss of sensory function, pain, and reductions in manual dexterity. Exposure to vibration induces some of these symptoms. However, the soft tissues of the hands and fingers of workers are compressed as a result of the force generated when a worker grips a tool. The compression of these soft tissues might also contribute to the development of HAVS. The goal of this study was to use an established rat tail model to determine the mechanisms by which compression of the tail tissues affects (1) the ventral tail artery (VTA) and ventral tail nerves (VTN), (2) nerves and sensory receptors in the skin, (3) dorsal root ganglia (DRG), and (4) spinal cord. Tissue compression resulted in the following changes (1) circulating pituitary and steroid hormone concentrations, (2) expression of factors that modulate vascular function in the skin and tail artery, and (3) factors associated with nerve damage, DRG, and spinal cord. Some of these observed effects differed from those previously noted with vibration exposure. Based upon these findings, the effects of applied force and vibration are different. Studies examining the combination of these factors might provide data that may potentially be used to improve risk assessment and support revision of standards."
"Cow's milk allergy (CMA) is one of the most prevalent food allergies in early childhood, often treated via elimination diets including standard amino acid-based formula or amino acid-based formula supplemented with synbiotics (AAF or AAF-S). This work aimed to assess the effect of cow's milk (CM) tolerance acquisition and synbiotic (inulin, oligofructose, Bifidobacterium breve M-16 V) supplementation on the fecal metabolome in infants with IgE-mediated CMA."
"Energy deprivation and metabolic rewiring of cardiomyocytes are widely recognized hallmarks of heart failure. Here, we report that HEY2 (a Hairy/Enhancer-of-split-related transcriptional repressor) is upregulated in hearts of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. Induced Hey2 expression in zebrafish hearts or mammalian cardiomyocytes impairs mitochondrial respiration, accompanied by elevated ROS, resulting in cardiomyocyte apoptosis and heart failure. Conversely, Hey2 depletion in adult mouse hearts and zebrafish enhances the expression of mitochondrial oxidation genes and cardiac function. Multifaceted genome-wide analyses reveal that HEY2 enriches at the promoters of genes known to regulate metabolism (including Ppargc1, Esrra and Cpt1) and colocalizes with HDAC1 to effectuate histone deacetylation and transcriptional repression. Consequently, restoration of PPARGC1A/ESRRA in Hey2- overexpressing zebrafish hearts or human cardiomyocyte-like cells rescues deficits in mitochondrial bioenergetics. Knockdown of Hey2 in adult mouse hearts protects against doxorubicin-induced cardiac dysfunction. These studies reveal an evolutionarily conserved HEY2/HDAC1-Ppargc1/Cpt transcriptional module that controls energy metabolism to preserve cardiac function."
"Solar energy generated from photovoltaic panel is an important energy source that brings many benefits to people and the environment. This is a growing trend globally and plays an increasingly important role in the future of the energy industry. However, it intermittent nature and potential for distributed system use require accurate forecasting to balance supply and demand, optimize energy storage, and manage grid stability. In this study, 5 machine learning models were used including: Gradient Boosting Regressor (GB), XGB Regressor (XGBoost), K-neighbors Regressor (KNN), LGBM Regressor (LightGBM), and CatBoost Regressor (CatBoost). Leveraging a dataset of 21045 samples, factors like Humidity, Ambient temperature, Wind speed, Visibility, Cloud ceiling and Pressure serve as inputs for constructing these machine learning models in forecasting solar energy. Model accuracy is meticulously assessed and juxtaposed using metrics such as coefficient of determination (R2), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The results show that the CatBoost model emerges as the frontrunner in predicting solar energy, with training values of R2 value of 0.608, RMSE of 4.478 W and MAE of 3.367 W and the testing value is R2 of 0.46, RMSE of 4.748 W and MAE of 3.583 W. SHAP analysis reveal that ambient temperature and humidity have the greatest influences on the value solar energy generated from photovoltaic panel."

"Global disparities in HIV prevalence among transgender women are well documented. However, current epidemiological literature on HIV disparities demonstrates gaps in research that include the diversity within transgender populations-for example, transgender men and non-binary trans people across global regions. This systematic review and meta-analysis protocol aims to summarise global HIV inequities among all transgender and non-binary (trans) populations. The objectives of this review are to estimate pooled HIV prevalence and prevention outcomes (pre-exposure prophylaxis and antiretroviral therapy) and differences by gender identity, global regions and self-report versus lab-confirmed findings among trans adults worldwide."
"Cell biology and genetic studies have demonstrated that DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair can be performed using an RNA transcript that spans the site of the DNA break as a template for repair. This type of DSB repair requires a reverse transcriptase to convert an RNA sequence into DNA to facilitate repair of the break, rather than copying from a DNA template as in canonical DSB repair. Translesion synthesis (TLS) DNA polymerases (Pol) are often more promiscuous than DNA Pols, raising the notion that reverse transcription could be performed by a TLS Pol. Indeed, several studies have demonstrated that human Pol η has reverse transcriptase activity, while others have suggested that the yeast TLS Pol ζ is involved. Here, we purify all seven known nuclear DNA Pols of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and compare their reverse transcriptase activities. The comparison shows that Pol ζ far surpasses Pol η and all other DNA Pols in reverse transcriptase activity. We find that Pol ζ reverse transcriptase activity is not affected by RPA or RFC/PCNA and acts distributively to make DNA complementary to an RNA template strand. Consistent with prior S. cerevisiae studies performed in vivo, we propose that Pol ζ is the major DNA Pol that functions in the RNA-templated DSB repair pathway."
"Understanding drug addiction as a disorder of maladaptive learning, where drug-associated or environmental cues trigger drug cravings and seeking, is crucial for developing effective treatments. Actin polymerization, a biochemical process, plays a crucial role in drug-related memory formation, particularly evident in conditioned place preference paradigms involving drugs like morphine and methamphetamine. However, the role of actin polymerization in the reconsolidation of heroin-associated memories remains understudied."
"Pulpotomy, which belongs to vital pulp therapy, has become a strategy for managing pulpitis in recent decades. This minimally invasive treatment reflects the recognition of preserving healthy dental pulp and optimizing long-term patient-centered outcomes. Pulpotomy is categorized into partial pulpotomy (PP), the removal of a partial segment of the coronal pulp tissue, and full pulpotomy (FP), the removal of whole coronal pulp, which is followed by applying the biomaterials onto the remaining pulp tissue and ultimately restoring the tooth. Procedural decisions for the amount of pulp tissue removal or retention depend on the diagnostic of pulp vitality, the overall treatment plan, the patient's general health status, and pulp inflammation reassessment during operation. This statement represents the consensus of an expert committee convened by the Society of Cariology and Endodontics, Chinese Stomatological Association. It addresses the current evidence to support the application of pulpotomy as a potential alternative to root canal treatment (RCT) on mature permanent teeth with pulpitis from a biological basis, the development of capping biomaterial, and the diagnostic considerations to evidence-based medicine. This expert statement intends to provide a clinical protocol of pulpotomy, which facilitates practitioners in choosing the optimal procedure and increasing their confidence in this rapidly evolving field."
"GATA2 deficiency syndrome is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by a high risk of developing myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). We conducted a meta-analysis of the literature to explore the prognostic significance of GATA2 mutations in patients diagnosed with MDS/AML, as previous studies have yielded conflicting findings regarding the impact of GATA2 mutations on patient outcomes. We conducted a comprehensive literature search of databases such as PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and the Web of Science to obtain studies on the prognostic significance of GATA2 mutations in patients with MDS/AML that were published through January 2024. We extracted the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and event-free survival (EFS). The meta-analysis was conducted by choosing either a fixed-effect model or a random-effect model, depending on the variability observed among the studies. A total of 13 cohort studies were included in the final meta-analysis, including 2714 patients with MDS, of whom 644 had GATA2 mutations. The results revealed that GATA2 mutations had an adverse impact on OS (HR = 1.54, 95% CI = 1.08-2.18, P = 0.02) and EFS (HR = 1.32, 95% CI = 1.01-1.72, P = 0.04), but no significant effect on DFS (HR = 1.21, 95% CI = 0.89-1.64, P = 0.23). GATA2 mutations were associated with a significantly shorter OS in MDS patients (HR = 2.56, 95% CI = 1.42-4.06, P = 0.002) but not in AML patients (HR = 1.08, 95% CI = 0.92-1.26, P = 0.37). Our meta-analysis revealed that GATA2 mutations are associated with unfavourable outcomes in patients with MDS/AML. Furthermore, patients harbouring these mutations should be prioritized for aggressive therapeutic interventions."
"The Amazon basin is the world's largest hydrographic basin, in terms of both its total area and its species diversity, with more than 2,700 species of fish. Despite this diversity, the data available on the fish fauna of the Amazon basin are still relatively scant and incomplete, in particular from the streams and floodplain lakes of the lower Amazon, which may contain a large proportion of the still undescribed species of the basin. Many of these species are expected to be of interest to the ornamental fish market. The investigation of the diversity of potential ornamental fish using molecular tools is even more limited. Given this scenario, the present study employed DNA barcoding to investigate the diversity of ornamental fish found in two streams and a floodplain lake of the lower Amazon. The mitochondrially encoded cytochrome c oxidase I (MT-CO1) molecular marker was used to identify the taxa, in combination with morphological keys. A total of 51 ornamental species were identified, representing 13 families and three orders. A majority of the species were found at only one of the sampling points, which indicates that the distribution of the species is influenced by ecological factors. The most speciose order was the Characiformes, followed by the Cichliformes and Siluriformes, while the family with the greatest diversity of species was the Acestrorhamphidae (31.3% of the total number of species), followed by the Cichlidae (27.4%), and the Lebiasinidae (9.8%). One specie was registered in the region of the lower Amazon for the first time, and evidence was found of the possible existence of species not formally described of Aphyocharax, Astyanax, Apareiodon and Hemigrammus."
"Efforts to define the key technical elements of breast cancer surgery, the foundation of curative treatment, have been recognized recently by the Commission on Cancer (CoC). Effective 1 January 2023, surgeon documentation in synoptic format of specific technical elements of axillary surgery for breast cancer became a CoC accreditation requirement (standards 5.3 and 5.4)."
"Commissioning for health services has been implemented as one approach to improve the quality and access to healthcare for First Nations, regional and remote populations. This review systematically scoped the literature for studies that described or evaluated the governance, funding, implementation and outcomes from health service commissioning targeting these groups in Canada, Australia, Aotearoa/New Zealand and the United States (CANZUS nations)."
"This first-of-its-kind study explored the essential competencies healthcare chaplaincy hiring managers (HCHMs) sought for entry-level healthcare chaplains (HCCs). We conducted qualitative interviews with 16 HCHMs and using reflexive thematic analysis (RTA), developed nine key themes: interpersonal skills, teamwork, knowledge of family and group dynamics, understanding of the healthcare system, professionalism, proficiency in spiritual assessment, effective communication, commitment to lifelong learning, and knowledge of various religious and spiritual beliefs, extending beyond one's own faith tradition. These themes reflected HCCs roles as healthcare professionals who contribute to patient care, interdisciplinary collaboration, and spiritual leadership responsibilities. The study underscored the need for chaplaincy education to integrate healthcare-specific coursework, interprofessional training, cultural and religious humility, and deeper knowledge of diverse belief systems. Developing and incorporating curriculum standards based on these themes could enhance the readiness of HCCs to deliver comprehensive care and meet the dynamic demands of diverse patient populations within today's healthcare landscape."
"Health care spending in the US reached $4.9 trillion and increased 7.5 percent in 2023, growing from a rate of 4.6 percent in 2022. In 2023, the insured share of the population reached 92.5 percent, as enrollment in private health insurance increased at a strong rate for the second year in a row, and both private health insurance and Medicare spending grew faster than in 2022. For Medicaid, spending and enrollment growth slowed as the COVID-19 public health emergency ended. The health sector's share of the economy in 2023 was 17.6 percent, which was similar to its share of 17.4 percent in 2022 but lower than in 2020 and 2021, during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. State and local governments accounted for a higher share of spending in 2023 than in 2022, while the federal government share was lower as COVID-19-related funding declined and federal Medicaid spending growth slowed."
"Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is becoming increasingly popular in oncology. This study endeavors to scrutinize the radiation protection knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) exhibited by healthcare professionals involved in this imaging modality."
"Dienia is a small, pantropical genus of epidendroid Malaxideae orchids. The floral lip is upwardly directed and does not serve as a landing platform for pollinators. This role has been assumed by sepals and/or gynostemium or whole inflorescence. Information about the pollination and floral morphology of this genus is scarce. Field observations have revealed that the flowers are visited by small flies, midges, other small dipterans, ants, and mites etc. Preliminary observations have revealed that small liquid droplets of at least two types occur on the morphologically adaxial lip surface of Dienia: namely, simple secretions produced by epidermal cells, and cell sap released on the rupturing of raphide cells. These secretions were subjected to sequential organic solvent extraction and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Floral structures were investigated by means of scanning and transmission electron microscopy, and subjected to histochemical tests. The form of liquid droplets on the lip, as well as the presence of a food reward and the sequence of raphide development are reported here for the first time. Tree different form of calcium oxalate crystals were raported in Dienia ophrydis flowers."
"Arthritis seriously affects people's quality of life, and there is an urgent clinical need to improve the efficacy of medications as well as to reduce the adverse effects induced by treatment. Combined colchicine therapy is gradually being embraced in clinical care, but the evidence remains insufficient."
"Developmental coordination disorder (DCD) is a lifelong neurological disorder impairing the coordination and planning of motor and sensory tasks. Its functional manifestation includes difficulties in various aspects of daily living, making early diagnosis and management essential. This cross-sectional, questionnaire-based study targeted healthcare providers in Saudi Arabia's Eastern Province who work with children under the age of 18. The questionnaire was completed through field visit interviews and electronically via social platforms from October 2023 to March 2024, collecting data on demographics, professional experience, familiarity with related disorders, and awareness of dyspraxia symptoms. Of the participants, 21.2% had previously diagnosed at least one child with dyspraxia, with family physicians comprising 30% of those diagnoses. The overall mean knowledge score was 17%, ranging from 8.3% to 23.1%. The most recognized symptom was motor learning difficulties (22.7%), followed by gross and fine motor skill delays (22.3%). Notably, 65.15% of respondents were unsure about the gender distribution of dyspraxia. The findings align with international studies, showing significant knowledge gaps among healthcare providers in the Eastern Province. These findings also emphasize the need for targeted health promotion programs, promotional activities, and media involvement for enhancing public health outcomes, early identification, and better management of DCD."
"Amyloid peptides, whose accumulation in the brain as senile plaques is associated with the onset of Alzheimer's disease, are also found in cerebral vessels and in circulation. In the bloodstream, amyloid peptides promote platelet adhesion, activation, oxidative stress, and thrombosis, contributing to the cardiovascular complications observed in Alzheimer's disease patients. Natural compounds, such as curcumin, are known to modulate platelet activation induced by the hemostatic stimuli thrombin and convulxin. In this study, we investigated the ability of curcumin to modulate platelet activation triggered by amyloid peptides, and we compared its effects with those displayed on platelet activation induced by physiological agonists."
"Over the last three decades, colloidal crystallization has provided an easy-to-craft platform for mesoscale engineering of photonic and phononic crystals. Nevertheless, the crystal lattices achieved thus far with commodity colloids are largely limited to symmetric and densely packed structures, restricting their functionalities. To obtain non-close-packed crystals and the resulting complexity of the available structures, directional binding between ""patchy"" colloids has been pursued. However, the conventional ""patchy"" colloids have been restricted to micrometer-scale spherical particles or clusters. In this Mini-Review, we argue that the time has come to widen the scope of the colloidal palette and include particles made using DNA origami. By benefiting from its unprecedented ability to control nanoscale shapes and patch placement and incorporate various nanomaterials, DNA origami enables novel engineering of colloidal crystallization, particularly for photonic and phononic applications. This mini-review summarizes the recent progress on using DNA origami for colloidal crystallization, together with its challenges and opportunities."
"Bovine mastitis is the most widespread disease that causes financial loss in the dairy industry. Staphylococcus aureus is a well-researched multidrug-resistant opportunistic bacterium that is frequently linked to subclinical mastitis and causes significant economic losses. A further problem in the management of S. aureus infections is its capacity to form biofilms; bacteria inside biofilms exhibit greater resistance to antimicrobials than planktonic cells. The most effective method for controlling mastitis is antibiotic therapy. Cloxacillin (CLX), ampicillin, and ceftiofur are currently the most often utilized drying treatments for dairy cattle. We have evaluated the therapy efficiency of cloxacillin-loaded chitosan nanoparticles (CLX-CS NPs) as well as the relationship between biofilm production, gene profile and the type of trial group (CLX and CLX-CS NPs) against S.aureus isolated from milk samples of cows diagnosed with subclinical mastitis. Investigation of phenotypic biofilm production showed that majority of the S. aureus isolates extracted from milk were producers of biofilm. Cloxacillin-loaded chitosan nanoparticles were able to significantly decrease the MIC (p < 0.05) and MBC values compared to cloxacillin. The relationship between the gene profile and the types of trial groups shows that coating cloxacillin with chitosan nanoparticles (CS-NPs) was able to reduce the MIC and MBC value in all nine gene profile groups. These findings indicate that administration of cloxacillin-loaded CS-NPs in the treatment of mastitis may improve cloxacillin therapeutic properties and could act as a potential alternative to the cloxacillin antibiotic for the treatment of bovine mastitis."
"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has significantly impacted global health and has led the population and the scientific community to live in fear of a future pandemic. Based on viral infectious diseases, innate immunity cells such as mast cells and basophils play a fundamental role in the pathogenesis of viral diseases. Understanding these mechanisms could be essential to better study practical therapeutic approaches not only to COVID-19 but also to other viral infections widely spread worldwide, such as influenza A, HIV, and dengue. In this literature review, we want to study these concepts. Mast cells and basophils intervene as a bridge between innate and acquired immunity and seem to have a role in the damage mechanisms during infection and in the stimulation of humoral and cellular immunity. In some cases, these cells can act as reservoirs and favor the replication and spread of the virus in the body. Understanding these mechanisms can be useful not only in therapeutic but also in diagnostic and prognostic perspectives. The prospects of applying artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms for the creation of very accurate diagnostic/prognostic tools are interesting."
"Oxadiazole compounds are of great interest because they have a range of biological activities ranging from antioxidants to anticancer agents. Against this background, we wanted to demonstrate the antioxidant, enzyme inhibitory, and anticancer effects of 5(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-(N-phenylamino)-1,3,4-oxadiazole (Hppo). Antioxidant abilities were measured through free radical scavenging and reducing power tests. Enzyme inhibitory effects were studied by cholinesterases, tyrosinase, amylase, and glucosidase. The anticancer effect was tested on pancreatic cancer cell lines (PANC-1, CRL-169) and on HEK293 cell lines. The compound showed significant antioxidant activity (particularly in the CUPRAC (cupric acid-reducing antioxidant capacity) assay) and enzyme inhibitory properties (particularly glucosidase inhibition). In the anticancer test, the compound showed strong anticancer activity in pancreatic cancer with apoptotic signaling pathways. These results were confirmed by molecular modeling and bioinformatics tools. Thus, our findings can provide novel and versatile compounds for the development of multidirectional drugs in the pharmaceutical industry."
"During lactation, maternal requirements for many nutrients increase due to the physiological demands of breast milk production, reflected in dietary recommendations. BMI is negatively associated with dietary quality postpartum, and 40% of women in Norway have pre-pregnancy overweight and obesity. Currently, there is limited data on dietary intake among lactating women in Norway and whether they meet nutritional requirements. We aimed to evaluate the nutrient intake in a study sample of lactating women with overweight and obesity, compared with the Nordic Nutrition Recommendations (NNR 2023)."
The effect of Meaning-Centered Interventions (MCI) in advanced cancer patients requires further comprehensive research.
"Lactose is one of the most commonly used tablet diluents and fillers. However, the moisture sorption of lactose powder could exert detrimental effects on the excipient itself, as well as on the tablet quality. The effects of storage relative humidity (RH) conditions for different grades of lactose powders and tablets on compression behavior and tablet qualities were investigated. Four types of lactose were selected in this study: sieved lactose (Pharmatose 110M), granulated lactose (SuperTab 30GR), anhydrous lactose (SuperTab 21AN), and spray-dried lactose (SuperTab 14SD). These powders and tablets were stored at three RH levels (33, 58, 75%) for a certain period of time before determining their properties. For the moisture-sorbed powder, there was little change in the basic physical properties of lactose powder. Based on the dynamic vapor sorption (DVS) results, the lactose grades determined their hygroscopic properties. The reduction in mechanical strength of lactose powder during storage became less pronounced except for 14SD. But a reduction was observed in the tensile strength (TS) of the 14SD powder from 2.1 to 0.9 MPa after storage at 75% RH for 30 days. The fragmentation of lactose increased with increasing storage humidity. By using multivariate statistical analysis, the similarity and variation of powder properties between 14SD and other types of lactose were visualized. For the moisture-sorbed tablet, the TS became higher and the friability became lower. The TS of lactose tablets exhibited an increase of up to 59.8%. Whether water uptake occurred before or after compression adversely affected tablet disintegration. In conclusion, adverse phenomena during production and storage can be effectively minimized by a better understanding of the effects of moisture sorption on lactose powder and tablets."
The purpose of this study was to conduct survival analysis of teeth following clinical crown lengthening procedures (CLPs) and crown insertions via a retrospective cohort study.
"Theabrownin (TB), the primary pigment in Pu-erh tea, has shown potential in alleviating metabolic syndrome (MS), though its precise mechanisms remain unclear. This study investigated the effects of Pu-erh tea water extract (WE) and TB on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced MS in rats, focusing on miRNA regulation and gut microbiota composition. Both WE and TB significantly improved markers of MS, including dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and inflammation. These improvements were linked to the normalization of specific miRNAs (miR-125b-5p, miR-223-3p_R + 2, miR-148b-3p, and miR-1247-5p), which activated the PI3K/AKT/FOXO signaling pathway, subsequently modulating key genes involved in glucolipid metabolism (SREBP-1C, PEPCK, PGC-1α, and G6pc). Additionally, WE and TB restored gut microbiota balance by decreasing the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio and increasing beneficial bacteria such as Bacteroides, Lactobacillus, and Bifidobacterium, while reducing harmful bacteria like Pseudomonas. These findings underscore the potential of theabrownin as a functional food component for MS prevention, offering new insights into its miRNA-mediated and microbiota-related mechanisms."
"Finely regulated Ghrelin (Ghrl) secretion is essential during early pregnancy, as infra or supraphysiologic levels can be detrimental. Since oestrogens stimulate Ghrl synthesis, ovarian stimulation (OS) might increase ghrelinemia, thus being detrimental for fertility. The aim of this work was to evaluate whether OS increases ghrelinemia and associates with maternal endocrine and immune biomarkers and reproductive success."
"Exposure to electronic cigarette (EC) marketing is associated with EC use, particularly among youth. In England, the Tobacco and Related Products Regulations and Committee of Advertising Practice (CAP) regulate EC marketing to reduce appeal to youth; however, there are little published data on EC marketing claims used online. This study therefore provides an overview of marketing claims present on the websites of EC brands popular in England."
"Despite the accuracy and robustness attained in the field of object tracking, algorithms based on Siamese neural networks often over-rely on information from the initial frame, neglecting necessary updates to the template; furthermore, in prolonged tracking situations, such methodologies encounter challenges in efficiently addressing issues such as complete occlusion or instances where the target exits the frame. To tackle these issues, this study enhances the SiamRPN algorithm by integrating the convolutional block attention module (CBAM), which enhances spatial channel attention. Additionally, it integrates the kernelized correlation filters (KCFs) for enhanced feature template representation. Building on this, we present DSiam-CnK, a Siamese neural network with dynamic template updating capabilities, facilitating adaptive adjustments in tracking strategy. The proposed algorithm is tailored to elevate the Siamese neural network's accuracy and robustness for prolonged tracking, all the while preserving its tracking velocity. In our research, we assessed the performance on the OTB2015, VOT2018, and LaSOT datasets. Our method, when benchmarked against established trackers, including SiamRPN on OTB2015, achieved a success rate of 92.1% and a precision rate of 90.9%. On the VOT2018 dataset, it excelled, with a VOT-A (accuracy) of 46.7%, a VOT-R (robustness) of 135.3%, and a VOT-EAO (expected average overlap) of 26.4%, leading in all categories. On the LaSOT dataset, it achieved a precision of 35.3%, a normalized precision of 34.4%, and a success rate of 39%. The findings demonstrate enhanced precision in tracking performance and a notable increase in robustness with our method."
"Multimorbidity, the co-existence of two or more conditions within an individual at any one time, is globally increasing and forecasted to rise. This poses a significant challenge for current models of healthcare delivery, which are now ill-equipped to meet the future population health needs. Interprofessional collaborative practice is a specific way professionals work closely together and with patients and their families to improve patient outcomes. Evidence suggests it can improve outcomes for people living with a single condition. What remains unknown is if interprofessional collaborative practice has been used to improve the outcomes of people living with multimorbidity, and if so, to what extent?"
"Hypobaric hypoxia (HH) is regarded as the main cause of high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE), however, the effect of diurnal temperature fluctuation and exercise has been overlooked. The aim of current study was to elucidate the role of diurnal temperature fluctuation and exercise in the development of HAPE and establish a reliable experimental rat model. Male SPF Wistar rats were assigned to control group (1400 m, 25 °C) and five model groups: Model Ⅰ group (6000 m, 25 °C), Model Ⅱ group (6000 m, 2 °C), Model Ⅲ group (6000 m, 12 °C/2 °C light/dark cycle), Model IV group (6000 m, 2 °C, and exercise) and Model V group (6000 m, 12 °C/2 °C light/dark cycle, and exercise). After exposure for 72 h, the blood and lung tissues were collected for further research. The rats in Model I group did not show signs of HAPE. Compared with Model I group, the rats in Model II and Model III groups were suffered from more damage, evidence by enhanced oxidative stress and inflammatory reaction, but still did not show signs of HAPE. Model IV and Model V could induce HAPE, display the obvious pathological changes and edema, more serious oxidative stress and inflammatory reaction in lung tissues, suggesting that the key role of exercise in the development of HAPE. The rats in the Model V group showed the best performance in terms of modeling indicators, indicating that diurnal temperature fluctuation could further aggravate the degree of lung edema. In summary, HH combined with diurnal temperature fluctuation and exercise is a stable and reliable modeling method for HAPE, which can be used for subsequent research on the prevention and treatment of HAPE."
"Kisspeptin and galanin-like peptide (GALP) neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC) are involved in gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neuron-mediated pulsatile luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion. Zucker fatty (ZF) rats display a leptin receptor gene abnormality and suppressed pulsatile LH secretion. ZF rats reportedly exhibit low hypothalamic GALP and kisspeptin expression, and GALP administration induces LH release in ZF rats. Therefore, we performed a histochemical analysis to determine whether GALP-induced LH release is mediated by kisspeptin neurons in ZF rats. All ZF rats were ovariectomized and subcutaneously implanted with an estradiol tube before the central injection of GALP or vehicle. GALP administration increased the plasma LH concentration. However, no significant difference was observed in the number of Kiss1 cells and the proportion of Fos-positive Kiss1 cells. The number of c-Fos-positive GnRH neurons significantly increased after GALP administration. Our results suggest that hypothalamic GALP neurons promote LH release by activating GnRH neurons without the activation of kisspeptin neurons in the ARC."
"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exerts a notable impact on the quality of life of individuals, precipitating substantial economic burdens. A probable association exists between chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and chronic rhinitis (CR)."
"Many aquatic organisms utilize suction-based organs to adhere to diverse substrates in unpredictable environments. For multiple fish species, these adhesive discs include a softer disc margin consisting of surface structures called papillae, which stabilize and seal on variable substrates. The size, arrangement, and density of these papillae are quite diverse among different species, generating complex disc patterns produced by these structures. Considering papillae arrangements in three fish species, the Northern Clingfish (Gobiesox maeandricus), Tidepool Snailfish (Liparis florae), and Chilean Clingfish (Sicyases sanguineus), we fabricated physical disc models that tested relevant surface pattern parameters under shear loading conditions. Parameters of interest included the area of papillae-like structures, the spacing between adjacent structures (channel spacing), and the percent coverage of elements relative to the total disc area. To create our models, a soft silicone elastomer was added to a stiff circular suction cup, which was then ""stamped"" using a laser-etched and thermoformed mold base to create the desired surface patterning. Discs were tested using a robotic arm equipped with a force sensor, which sheared them across smooth and rough surfaces at a fixed speed and distance. The arm was also used to vary the initial compression to test performance under both suction-dominant and friction-dominant preloads. For our designs, patterns with smaller papillae-like structures and channel spacing often produced higher peak forces than those with larger features. However, the design that withstood the highest shear load featured an intermediate pad size and channel spacing, potentially highlighting a balance between overall surface area and fluid channeling. Additionally, discs with surface patterns often outperformed the control discs (no pattern) on both smooth and rough surfaces, but performance was highly dependent on preload, with patterned discs exhibiting benefits with the higher ""friction-dominant"" preloads."
"Rupture of extensor pollicis longus tendon (EPL) is a known complication following a distal radius fracture (DRF). Although the precise mechanisms behind these ruptures remain unclear, vascular impairment is thought to play a significant role. Additionally, the impact of an EPL rupture on microstructure of the tendon and muscle is not well understood, but such information could be important in guiding treatment strategies. This study aims to explore the histopathological changes in the EPL tendon and muscle in patients who have experienced an EPL rupture following a DRF."
"Many general pediatrics residents lack sufficient opportunities to conduct difficult conversations with families, particularly about end-of-life care. Simulation learning is an effective means of practicing professional skills. A pediatric palliative care (PPC) physician is uniquely suited to mentor residents and fellows learning to lead difficult conversations through simulation. Co-facilitation of the simulated difficult conversation by a bereaved parent or family member enhances the learning experience."
"As soon as they can move, animals must learn to avoid potential predators. New research demonstrates that larval zebrafish can quickly learn to avoid specific predator-like robots in their first week of life, through coordinated noradrenergic and forebrain activity."
"The physiological well-being of buffaloes, encompassing phenotypic traits, reproductive health, and productivity, depends on their energy status. Mitochondria, the architects of energy production, orchestrate a nuanced interplay between nuclear and mitochondrial domains. Oxidative phosphorylation complexes and associated proteins wield significant influence over metabolic functions, energy synthesis, and organelle dynamics, often linked to tissue-specific pathologies. The unexplored role of ATP synthase in buffalo tissues prompted a hypothesis: in-depth exploration of nuclear-derived mitochondrial genes, notably ATP synthase, reveals distinctive tissue-specific diversity. RNA extraction and sequencing of buffalo tissues (kidney, heart, brain, and ovary) enabled precise quantification of nuclear-derived mitochondrial protein gene expression. The analysis unveiled 24 ATP synthase transcript variants, each with unique tissue-specific patterns. Kidney, brain, and heart exhibited elevated gene expression compared to ovaries, with 10, 8, and 19 up-regulated genes, respectively. The kidney showed 3 and 12 down-regulated genes compared to the brain and heart. The heart-brain comparison highlighted ten highly expressed genes in ATP synthase functions. Gene ontology and pathway analyses revealed enriched functions linked to ATP synthesis and oxidative phosphorylation, offering a comprehensive understanding of energy production in buffalo tissues. This analysis enhances understanding of tissue-specific gene expression, emphasizing the influence of energy demands. Revealing intricate links between mitochondrial gene expression and tissue specialization in buffaloes, it provides nuanced insights into tissue-specific expression of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial protein genes, notably ATP synthase, advancing the comprehension of buffalo tissue biology."
"Rampant phospholipid peroxidation initiated by iron causes ferroptosis unless this is restrained by cellular defences. Ferroptosis is increasingly implicated in a host of diseases, and unlike other cell death programs the physiological initiation of ferroptosis is conceived to occur not by an endogenous executioner, but by the withdrawal of cellular guardians that otherwise constantly oppose ferroptosis induction. Here, we profile key ferroptotic defence strategies including iron regulation, phospholipid modulation and enzymes and metabolite systems: glutathione reductase (GR), Ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1), NAD(P)H Quinone Dehydrogenase 1 (NQO1), Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), retinal reductases and retinal dehydrogenases (RDH) and thioredoxin reductases (TR). A common thread uniting all key enzymes and metabolites that combat lipid peroxidation during ferroptosis is a dependence on a key cellular reductant, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). We will outline how cells control central carbon metabolism to produce NADPH and necessary precursors to defend against ferroptosis. Subsequently we will discuss evidence for ferroptosis and NADPH dysregulation in different disease contexts including glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, cancer and neurodegeneration. Finally, we discuss several anti-ferroptosis therapeutic strategies spanning the use of radical trapping agents, iron modulation and glutathione dependent redox support and highlight the current landscape of clinical trials focusing on ferroptosis."
"Tool use to crack open palm nuts has been observed extensively in some capuchin monkey species. However, for southern black-horned capuchin monkeys (Sapajus nigritus cucullatus), there is only one published record of stone tool use from the 1990s, from an urban park in Londrina, Brazil. In the present study, we returned to this urban park to systematically investigate the hammer-and-anvil sites used to crack nuts by this capuchin monkey population. We analyzed the fruit and shell remnants resulting from hammering to test the following hypotheses: (1) hammers at tool-use sites are actively chosen for size and/or weight, (2) tool use sites that are closer to a tree of the processed plant species are more frequently used, and (3) there is no seasonal effect modulating hammer-and-anvil use for processing nuts. We located and identified 205 tool-use sites through active search within the park, and we measured and weighed the tools involved in hammering activity. We compared hammer weight and size to that of the comparable material available in the environment and found that hammer size and weight differed significantly from that of the raw materials found in the environment, suggesting active choice of the hammers. We identified three plant species for which nuts were processed through tool use: Syagrus romanzoffiana, Acrocomia aculeata and Terminalia catappa. Through measuring the distance between each tool-use site and the nearest tree of the plant species processed there, we found that closer proximity between the tool-use site and the nearest target tree (Syagrus and Acrocomia) increased cracking frequency. We returned to each site three times during the study year to determine if new tool use activity had occurred, and our data indicate habitual use of tools to crack open nuts throughout the year, with no large differences between seasons."
"This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of gilteritinib combined with chemotherapy in treating newly diagnosed FLT3-mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We retrospectively collected clinical data from 16 patients newly diagnosed with FLT3-mutated AML at Jiangsu Province Hospital. Patients received induction therapy with the classic ""3 + 7"" regimen or the VA regimen, and all patients were immediately supplied with gilteritinib after detecting FLT3-ITD/TKD mutations. Of the 16 patients, 12 were male and 4 were female, with a median age of 52.5 years (range: 15-76 years). Additionally, 15 patients had FLT3-ITD mutations and 1 had FLT3-TKD mutation. The complete remission (CR/CRi) rate was 93.8% (15/16) after the first cycle of gilteritinib-based induction therapy, with 13 patients achieving MRD negativity detected with flow cytometry. All patients achieved a CR(MRD-) during the consolidation phase. FLT3 mutation clearance was achieved among all 14 patients who underwent next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis. The 12-month overall survival and relapse-free survival rates were both 73.9%, respectively, with a median followup of 18 months. Nine (56.2%) patients experienced infectious fever during the induction therapy. Three patients had grade 3 QTc prolongation during consolidation and maintenance therapy. Treatment-related adverse events were generally tolerable."
"This review outlines significant clinical research developments in the field of critical care respiratory medicine from October 2023 to September 2024. In the post-pandemic era, the new global definition of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has improved practicality and early warning capabilities, although further refinement through respiratory mechanics and multi-omics approaches is required. Novel patterns of pulmonary microbiota distribution in ARDS patients have emerged, with microbiota-host immune interactions significantly influencing clinical outcomes. Limitations of conventional antiviral and broad-spectrum immunosuppressive therapies have prompted exploration of novel approaches in cell survival regulation and immune maintenance, while modulation of fibroblast phenotypic transformation holds promise for effective repair after severe lung injury. The development of risk prediction tools and machine learning models, which integrate multidimensional bioinformatics data, presents novel opportunities for stratified patient management in critical care and the implementation of intelligent ICU systems. Personalized respiratory support has progressed in the areas of optimal oxygenation targets, positive end-expiratory pressure titration, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. While breakthrough therapeutic agents remain elusive, innovations in traditional critical care medication management (vasopressors, sedatives, and proton pump inhibitors) have yielded significant benefits, demonstrating that the field continues to evolve towards more personalized approaches."
"While African countries have expanded access to HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) since 2015, regional targets for PrEP uptake remain unmet. Understanding which populations are prioritized for PrEP at the policy level is an important step in determining the scope of PrEP distribution across Africa and identifying gaps in programme implementation. We reviewed national guidance to characterize populations prioritized for PrEP in Africa."
"The prognostic value of easily accessible hematologic biomarkers, such as the neutrophil-to-HDL ratio, as well as the monocyte-to-HDL, lymphocyte-to-HDL, and platelet-to-HDL ratios, remains underexplored in patients with established ischemic heart disease (IHD). Community-dwelling adults aged ≥ 20 with established IHD from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2018 were eligible. Mortality was tracked through linkage to the National Death Index (NDI) until the end of 2019. Cox regressions examined the associations between these hematologic ratios and all-cause mortality. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis assessed the predictive accuracy of these ratios for mortality. A total of 2265 patients were analyzed, with a median follow-up period of 80 months. After adjusting for demographic factors, lifestyle variables, and comorbidities, patients in the highest quartile of the neutrophil/HDL had a significantly increased all-cause mortality risk (aHR = 1.41, 95% CI: 1.13-1.77) compared to those in the lowest quartile. No significant associations were found between the other ratios and mortality. In conclusion, this study found that among the hematologic ratios analyzed, an elevated neutrophil-to-HDL ratio has the strongest potential for mortality risk stratification in community-dwelling patients with ischemic heart disease in the US, offering important guidance for both patients and clinicians."
"In the present study, the mixed micellization behavior of gemini surfactant-1, 5-bis (N-hexadecyl- N, N-dimethylammonium) pentane dibromide (G5) with non-ionic surfactant triton X-100 (TX-100) was investigated in the micellar phase by utilizing the conductometric technique. The deviation of ideal critical micelle concentration (cmc*) from experimental critical micelle concentration (cmc) has been estimated using well-known Clint's theory of mixed micelles. The regular solution approximation was used to determine the interaction parameter (β) and found to be negative. The negative values of β at all mole fractions confirm an attractive interaction between two mixed components. The activity coefficients and excess Gibbs free energy of mixed micelles have been calculated by using different approximations, like Rubingh, Lange and Motomura. Counterion binding (g) computed from the post and premicellar slopes of specific conductance vs. concentration graph. Overall, in most of cases, in presence of TX-100, the counterion binding of gemini surfactant was found to be less in magnitude. The molecular interaction was also investigated by the density function theory (DFT). A polarizable continuum model (PCM) was used (with water as a solvent) to optimize the single surfactants and their mixture. The computational process was carried out by the B3LYP method and the 6-31G basis set."
"Structural variation (SV), defined as balanced and unbalanced chromosomal rearrangements >1 kb, is a major contributor to germline and neoplastic disease. Large variants have historically been evaluated by chromosome analysis and now are commonly recognized by chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA). The increasing application of genome sequencing (GS) in the clinic and the relatively high incidence of chromosomal abnormalities in sick newborns and children highlights the need for accurate SV interpretation and reporting. In this review, we describe SV patterns of common cytogenetic abnormalities for laboratorians who review GS data."
"Following DNA replication, the newly reassembled chromatin is disorganized and must mature to its steady state to maintain both genome and epigenome integrity. However, the regulatory mechanisms governing this critical process remain poorly understood. Here, we show that histone H3K56 acetylation (H3K56ac), a mark on newly-synthesized H3, facilitates the remodeling of disorganized nucleosomes in nascent chromatin, and its removal at the subsequent G2/M phase of the cell cycle marks the completion of chromatin maturation. In vitro, H3K56ac enhances the activity of ISWI chromatin remodelers, including yeast ISW1 and its human equivalent SNF2h. In vivo, a deficiency of H3K56ac in nascent chromatin results in the formation of closely packed di-nucleosomes and/or tetra-nucleosomes. In contrast, abnormally high H3K56ac levels disrupt chromatin maturation, leading to genome instability. These findings establish a central role of H3K56ac in chromatin maturation and reveal a mechanism regulating this critical aspect of chromosome replication."
"The use of latent construct measurement scales is widespread in the medical literature. An essential condition is that the instrument be validated, in addition to being highly reliable."
"Improving the germination performance of bread wheat is an important breeding target in many wheat-growing countries where seedlings are often established in soils with high salinity levels. This study sought to characterize the molecular mechanisms underlying germination performance in salt-stressed wheat. To achieve this goal, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed on 292 Iranian bread wheat accessions, including 202 landraces and 90 cultivars."
"In many eukaryotes, meiotic recombination occurs preferentially at discrete sites, called recombination hotspots. In various lineages, recombination hotspots are located in regions with promoter-like features and are evolutionarily stable. Conversely, in some mammals, hotspots are driven by PRDM9 that targets recombination away from promoters. Paradoxically, PRDM9 induces the self-destruction of its targets and this triggers an ultra-fast evolution of mammalian hotspots. PRDM9 is ancestral to all animals, suggesting a critical importance for the meiotic program, but has been lost in many lineages with surprisingly little effect on meiosis success. However, it is unclear whether the function of PRDM9 described in mammals is shared by other species. To investigate this, we analyzed the recombination landscape of several salmonids, the genome of which harbors one full-length PRDM9 and several truncated paralogs. We identified recombination initiation sites in Oncorhynchus mykiss by mapping meiotic DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). We found that DSBs clustered at hotspots positioned away from promoters, enriched for the H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 and the location of which depended on the genotype of full-length Prdm9. We observed a high level of polymorphism in the zinc finger domain of full-length Prdm9, indicating diversification driven by positive selection. Moreover, population-scaled recombination maps in O. mykiss, Oncorhynchus kisutch and Salmo salar revealed a rapid turnover of recombination hotspots caused by PRDM9 target motif erosion. Our results imply that PRDM9 function is conserved across vertebrates and that the peculiar evolutionary runaway caused by PRDM9 has been active for several hundred million years."
"The entomopathogenic fungus, Isaria fumosorosea, shows promise as a biological control agent in managing the diamondback moth (DBM) Plutella xylostella, a highly destructive global pest of cruciferous vegetables. To date, the miRNA-mRNA regulatory networks underlying the immune response of DBM to I. fumosorosea infection are still poorly understood. Here, we characterize the expression profiles of miRNA and mRNA, and construct the miRNA-gene regulatory network in DBM infected with I. fumosorosea."
"Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is an emerging neuromodulation technique. The effect of tDCS can vary significantly depending on electrode position and current intensity, making it crucial to find an optimized tDCS montage. However, because of the high computational load, most tDCS optimization approaches have been performed with a limited number of candidates for electrode positions, such as 10-10 or 10-20 international channel configurations. This study introduced the Bayesian optimization and hyperband (BOHB) method to seek optimal tDCS montage for the entire human scalp without conventional constraints."

"In spite of the developments in understanding of denitrifying methylotrophy in the recent years, challenges still exist in unravelling the overall biochemistry of nitrate-dependent methane oxidation in novel or poorly characterized/not-yet-cultured bacteria. In the present study, landfill site was mined for novel C1-carbon-metabolizing bacteria which can use nitrate/nitrite as an electron acceptor. A high-throughput rapid plate assay identified three bacterial isolates with eminent ability for nitrate-dependent methane metabolism under anaerobic conditions. Taxonomic identification by whole-genome sequence-based overall genome relatedness indices accurately assigned the isolates AAK_M13, AAK_M29, and AAK_M39 at the species level to Enterobacter cloacae, Bacillus subtilis, and Bacillus halotolerans, respectively. Several genes encoding sub-components involved in alcohol utilization and denitrification pathways, such as adh, fdh, fdo, nar, nir, and nor, were identified in all the genomes. Though no gene clusters encoding MMO/AMO were annotated, sequencing of PCR amplicons revealed similarity with pMMO/AMO gene using translated nucleotide sequence of strains AAK_M29 and AAK_M39, while strain AAK_M13 showed similarity with XRE family transcriptional regulator. This suggests the horizontal gene transfer and/or presence of a truncated version of a housekeeping enzyme encoded by genes exhibiting partial sequence similarity with pMMO genes that mimicked its function at greenhouse gas emission sites. Owing to lack of conclusive evidence for presence of methane metabolism genes in the selected isolates, further experiment was performed to validate their nitrate-dependent methane oxidation capacities. Bacillus subtilis AAK_M29, Bacillus halotolerans AAK_M39, and Enterobacter cloacae AAK_M13 could oxidize 60%, 75%, and 85% of the added methane respectively accompanied by high nitrate reduction (56-62%) thus supporting the correlation between these two activities. The remarkable ability of these isolates for nitrate-dependent methane metabolism has highlighted their role in ecological contribution and biotechnological potential to serve as methane and nitrate sinks in the landfill sites."
"Drug-refractory epilepsy (DRE) refers to the failure of controlling seizures with adequate trials of two tolerated and appropriately chosen anti-seizure medications (ASMs). For patients with DRE, surgical intervention becomes the most effective and viable treatment, but its success rate is unsatisfactory at only approximately 50%. Predicting surgical outcomes in advance can provide additional guidance to clinicians. Despite the high accuracy of invasive methods, they inevitably carry the risk of post-operative infection and complications. Herein, to noninvasively predict surgical outcomes of DRE, we propose the ""source causal connectivity"" framework."
"Single cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq) experimental designs have become increasingly complex, with multiple factors that might affect chromatin accessibility, including genotype, cell type, tissue of origin, sample location, batch, etc., whose compound effects are difficult to test by existing methods. In addition, current scATAC-seq data present statistical difficulties due to their sparsity and variations in individual sequence capture. To address these problems, we present a zero-adjusted statistical model, Probability model of Accessible Chromatin of Single cells (PACS), that allows complex hypothesis testing of accessibility-modulating factors while accounting for sparse and incomplete data. For differential accessibility analysis, PACS controls the false positive rate and achieves a 17% to 122% higher power on average than existing tools. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PACS through several analysis tasks, including supervised cell type annotation, compound hypothesis testing, batch effect correction, and spatiotemporal modeling. We apply PACS to datasets from various tissues and show its ability to reveal previously undiscovered insights in scATAC-seq data."
"Mangrove plants, which have evolved to inhabit tidal flats, may adjust their physiological and morphological traits to optimize their growth in saline habitats. Furthermore, the confined distribution of mangroves within warm regions suggests that warm temperature is advantageous to their growth in saline environments. We analyzed growth, morphology and respiratory responses to moderate salinity and temperature in a mangrove species, Rhizophora stylosa. The growth of R. stylosa was accelerated in moderate salinity compared with its growth in fresh water. Under warm conditions, the increased growth is accompanied by increased specific leaf area (SLA) and specific root length. Low temperature resulted in a low relative growth rate due to a low leaf area ratio and small SLA, regardless of salinity. Salinity lowered the ratio of the amounts of alternative oxidase to cytochrome c oxidase in the mitochondrial respiratory chain in leaves. Salinity enhanced the leaf respiration rate for maintenance, but under warm conditions this enhancement was compensated by a low leaf respiration rate for growth. In contrast, salinity enhanced overall leaf respiration rates at low temperature. Our results indicate that under moderate saline conditions R. stylosa leaves require warm temperatures to grow with a high rate of resource acquisition without enhancing respiratory cost."
"A combination of microwave digestion and three-phase hollow fiber electromembrane extraction (HF-EME) with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was designed to determine carcinogenic heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAAs) in steak samples. The recorded fingers of merit (LOD: 1.4-1.6 ng/g, LOQ: 4.5-5.2 ng/g, RSD: 6.1-7.2 %, recovery: 91-95 % and EF: 107-112) underlines the adequacy of the proposed technique. The total of 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f] quinoline (IQ), 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo [4,5-f] quinoxaline (MeIQx), 2-amino-3,4 dimethylimidazo[4,5-f] quinoline (MeIQ) and 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4'5-b] pyridine (PhIP) in steak samples were 93.46 ± 4.93-174.52 ± 10.91 ng/g, 31.65 ± 1.87-877.97 ± 56.19 ng/g, 10.08 ± 1.01-535.73 ± 18.93 ng/g, and 62.56 ± 1.89-341.23 ± 41.45 ng/g, respectively. Lamb steak contain highest amount of MeIQx (877.97 ± 56.19 ng/g) and beef steak showed lowest concentration of MeIQ (10.08 ± 1.07 ng/g). In conclusion, several interesting features such as great recovery, suitable enrichment factor, very low sample amount and organic solvent requirement and short extraction time make this novel method appropriate for the analysis of the negligible levels of HAAs in complex food matrices."

"This nurse-led research study investigates the comparative effectiveness of heparin versus 0.9% sodium chloride locking in blood cancer patients with peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs). Subjects were randomly assigned to receive either heparin or 0.9% sodium chloride locking for up to 7 days. Results show no significant difference in maintaining the PICCs' patency between the 2 locking methods. Additionally, heparin was associated with more side effects, higher costs, and increased nursing time compared to 0.9% sodium chloride. These findings support adopting 0.9% sodium chloride for PICC maintenance in blood cancer patients, aiming to enhance patient safety and reduce costs."
"Cancer progression involves genetic and epigenetic changes that disrupt chromatin 3D organization, affecting enhancer-promoter interactions and promoting growth. Here, we provide an integrative approach, combining chromatin conformation, accessibility, and transcription analysis, validated by in silico and CRISPR-interference screens, to identify relevant 3D topologies in pediatric T cell leukemia (T-ALL and ETP-ALL). We characterize 3D hubs as regulatory centers for oncogenes and disease markers, linking them to biological processes like cell division, inflammation, and stress response. Single-cell mapping reveals heterogeneous gene activation in discrete epigenetic clones, aiding in patient stratification for relapse risk after chemotherapy. Finally, we identify MYB as a 3D hub regulator in leukemia cells and show that the targeting of key regulators leads to hub dissolution, thereby providing a novel and effective anti-leukemic strategy. Overall, our work demonstrates the relevance of studying oncogenic 3D hubs to better understand cancer biology and tumor heterogeneity and to propose novel therapeutic strategies."
"Opportunistic behaviour has become a research hotspot in hydraulic infrastructure project management owing to its serious damage to the cooperation efficiency of all participants in a project. The trust networks formed by each participant can restrain opportunistic behaviour, but due to the dynamic evolution of the networks, its research should adopt a dynamic paradigm. The structure and evolution of trust networks can be simulated using computer simulations and modelling. This study explores the influence mechanism of the structural characteristics of trust networks on the diffusion of opportunistic behaviour. The results show that trust network density has a positive effect on inhibiting the implementation tendency of opportunistic behaviour. However, the centralisation of trust networks has a negative correlation with the degree of inhibition of opportunistic behaviour."
"Focused ultrasound (FUS) is a recognized tool that can be used clinically for the thermal ablation of tumors. However, excessive heat can cause side effects on the ultrasound transmission path and normal tissues around the tumor. To address the issue, this work detected for the first time the effect of microscopic heating of nanoparticles under the action of FUS through the luminescence intensity ratio (LIR) and luminescence lifetime of temperature-responsive lanthanide-doped nanoparticles. When FUS is applied to the tissue embedded with nanoparticles, the increase in the microscopic temperature of the nanoparticles synchronously monitored by LIR is more obvious than the increase in the macroscopic temperature. Based on this phenomenon, the intensity of focused ultrasound can be finely regulated to avoid overheating while ensuring a therapeutic effect. This work achieves the measurement of the microscopic heating of nanoparticles under FUS, which is of great significance for the development of sonothermal cancer therapy."
The study evaluated the effects of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI) therapy in people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) and a clinical history of Aspergillus fumigatus (AF) infection.
"The relationship between unemployment and mental disorders has been a significant subject of study since at least the Industrial Revolution. However, most data show associations of unemployment and isolated mental disorders, and this study field has been neglected in the last years. Therefore, this narrative review aims to provide an updated overview of the association between unemployment and mental health in general as well as the most prevalent mental disorders. A literature search was conducted using PubMed with the initial search terms ""unemployment"" and ""mental health"". The identified disorders were then used as search terms for a more in-depth search. Two raters screened abstracts and identified the literature containing relevant information. As a main result, it could be demonstrated that regardless of age and sex, there is still a broad association between unemployment and mental well-being in general (e.g., quality of life measure for example by the General Health Questionnaire), suicide attempts, suicide rates, as well as specific psychiatric disorders (substance use disorder, schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorders, compulsive/obsessive disorders, eating disorders, specific personality disorders, intelligence disorders/impairment, and ADHD). The most significant association was found for affective disorders (depression) and substance use disorders. The association in general was particularly evident for long-term unemployment and mental disorders. Returning to work reduced the prevalence rates of mental disorders significantly. The literature review confirms the results of much older and disease centered studies that unemployment and mental disorders are associated with each other. The main conclusion is that early medical detection and intervention among the mentally ill are as crucial as labor market policy interventions to prevent, avoid, and reduce unemployment."
"The Multidimensional Psychological Flexibility Inventory (MPFI) is a measure of all facets of psychological flexibility and inflexibility, potentially important processes of change in psychological treatment for chronic pain.

"Cascaded amplification showed promising potential for detection of trace target miRNAs in molecular diagnosis and prevention of many diseases. In this study, miRNA21 was chosen as the target, and rolling circle amplification (RCA)-based DNA nanoscaffold was integrated with target triggered RNA-cleaving DNAzyme for sensitive detection of miRNA21. That is, the H1 probe was bound with the long-chain product of RCA to self-assemble into DNA nanoscaffold. Target miRNA21 triggered the hybridization chain reaction (HCR) located on the nanoscaffold, and led to rapid proximity of DNAzyme fragments modified at both ends of the H2 probe, which realized the cyclic cleavage of self-quenching substrate probe efficiently, and the fluorescence signal was restored. The results demonstrated that the proposed assay was sensitive, 0.76 pM of miRNA21 can be detected. The proposed assay was specific; only one-base mismatched miRNA21 can be effectively recognized, other nucleic acid sequence and the serum matrix did not cause any interference. The proposed assay was accurate; recoveries from 82.1 to 115.0% can be obtained in the spiked fetal bovine serum (FBS). The flexible and programmable characteristics of DNA nanoscaffold and DNAzyme provide a confident and robust strategy for more sensitive nucleic acid detection, and can be developed to be a universal sensing platform for detecting other miRNAs just needing modification on the corresponding sequence of H1 probe in HCR."

"As the largest family of dicotyledon, the Asteraceae family comprises a variety of economically important crops, ornamental plants and numerous medicinal herbs. Advancements in genomics and transcriptomic have revolutionized research in Asteraceae species, generating extensive omics data that necessitate an efficient platform for data integration and analysis. However, existing databases face challenges in mining genes with specific functions and supporting cross-species studies. To address these gaps, we introduce the Asteraceae Multi-omics Information Resource (AMIR; https://yanglab.hzau.edu.cn/AMIR/), a multi-omics hub for the Asteraceae plant community. AMIR integrates diverse omics data from 74 species, encompassing 132 genomes, 4 408 432 genes annotated across seven different perspectives, 3897 transcriptome sequencing samples spanning 131 organs, tissues and stimuli, 42 765 290 unique variants and 15 662 metabolites genes. Leveraging these data, AMIR establishes the first pan-genome, comparative genomics and transcriptome system for the Asteraceae family. Furthermore, AMIR offers user-friendly tools designed to facilitate extensive customized bioinformatics analyses. Two case studies demonstrate AMIR's capability to provide rapid, reproducible and reliable analysis results. In summary, by integrating multi-omics data of Asteraceae species and developing powerful analytical tools, AMIR significantly advances functional genomics research and contributes to breeding practices of Asteraceae."

"The Junín virus (JUNV) is one of the New World arenaviruses that cause severe hemorrhagic fever. Human transferrin receptor 1 (hTfR1) has been identified as the main receptor for JUNV for virus entry into host cells. To date, no treatment has been approved for JUNV. Herein, we investigated 12 anti-hTfR1 VHH (variable domain of the heavy chain of heavy-chain antibody) antibodies and confirmed their interaction with hTfR1. Most of them could bind to the hTfR1 apical domain, which is the glycoprotein 1 (GP1) binding domain of JUNV. Among them, 18N18 exhibited neutralizing activity against both the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-vectored lentiviral Junín pseudoviruses and the recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-vectored Junín pseudoviruses. We also verified that 18N18 blocked the interaction between hTfR1 and JUNV GP1. In addition, 18N18 could neutralize another New World arenavirus, the Machupo virus. Using AlphaFold 3-based simulation of 18N18-hTfR1 docking, we determined that 18N18's binding epitope was located at the JUNV GP1 binding epitope. 18N18 represents a candidate for JUNV treatment and provides a potential approach that could be applied to New World arenaviruses."
"As an important carrier of intercellular information transmission, exosomes regulate the physiological and pathological state of local or distant cells by carrying a variety of signal molecules such as microRNAs (miRNAs). Current research indicates that exosomes and miRNAs can serve as biomarkers and therapeutic targets for a variety of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). This narrative review summarizes the research progress of exosomes and their miRNAs in CVDs, particularly in pulmonary valve diseases (PVDs), and, for the first time, explores their potential associations with transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement (TPVR). Currently, miRNAs play a crucial role in determining the optimal timing for TPVR intervention, and they demonstrate broad application prospects in post-TPVR right ventricular (RV) remodeling, treatment, and prognosis monitoring. However, the association between exosomes and miRNAs and the development of PVDs, particularly pulmonary regurgitation, remains unclear. The molecular mechanisms of exosomes and miRNAs in PVDs and RV remodeling after TPVR have not been fully elucidated, and their application in postoperative treatment following TPVR is still in its infancy. Future research must focus on advancing fundamental studies, validating biomarkers, and enhancing clinical applications to achieve significant breakthroughs."
"For patients with breast cancer receiving preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy with anthracyclines, there is an increased risk of postoperative myocardial injury due to the cardiotoxicity of the chemotherapeutic agents. The optimal intraoperative blood pressure regulation regimen for these patients is unclear. This study is being conducted to determine whether targeting mean arterial pressure (MAP) to 100%-120% of the patient's baseline blood pressure reduces the incidence of myocardial injury after non-cardiac surgery (MINS) compared with targeting MAP to 80%-100%. MINS is defined as elevated cardiac troponin levels within 30 days after non-cardiac surgery with or without clinical and electrocardiographic signs of cardiac ischaemia."

"Surgical performance that improves with experience is often depicted as representing a ""learning curve."" Although numerous studies examine the tensile properties of various flexor tendon repairs, few compare the associated learning curves. This study aims to address this gap by comparing the learning curves of Adelaide- and Gan-modified Lim-Tsai repairs. Emphasizing the difference in learning curves is crucial because it highlights the tension between achieving biomechanically superior repairs, which may be challenging to many surgeons, and opting for possibly incrementally less strong but more feasible techniques."
"User satisfaction with Assistive Technology (AT) is one of the crucial factors in the success of any AT service. The current study aimed to estimate satisfaction with AT and the reasons for dissatisfaction and unsuitability among persons with functional difficulties in India. Using the WHO Rapid Assistive Technology Assessment tool, a cross-sectional study was conducted in eight districts, representing four zones of India. Multi-stage cluster random sampling and probability proportional to size techniques were used to select smaller administrative units from the larger ones. Satisfaction was reported in terms of assistive products and service delivery. In total, 8486 participants were surveyed out of which 8964 individuals were enumerated with a response rate of 94.6%. Around 22.2% (1888) of participants had functional difficulties and reported using AT, out of which 3.9% (74) were dissatisfied with their products. The assistive products, assessment and training, and repair and maintenance-related services were reported to be satisfied by approximately 92.2% (1740), 88.4% (1669), and 85.2% (1609) of respondents, respectively. Further, 3.2% (61) and 3.7% (70) of respondents reported that their AT was not suitable for home and public environments, respectively. According to 2.8% (53) respondents, their AT did not assist them in executing daily living activities. Discomfort (56.6%), poor fitting (37.7%), low quality of service (20.7%), and poor aesthetic values (18.9%) were identified as reasons for dissatisfaction. Satisfaction was good for AT received from friends and family but was poor for those received from the public sector. The study shows that overall satisfaction and suitability with AT were high among users with functional difficulties, but few have reported barriers to effective device use and facing challenges in accessing repair and follow-up services."
"This study aimed to investigate the protective effects and mechanisms of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) preconditioning in a rat model of acute myocardial infarction (MI) established by ligation of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery. Microarray, real-time PCR, and western blotting (WB) results demonstrated that the Mst1 gene was downregulated in the heart tissue of the MI rat model. HBO preconditioning significantly increased Mst1 expression in cardiac tissues of rats after MI modeling. Lentiviral infection was used to silence the Mst1 gene in rats treated with HBO to probe the effect of Mst1 on HBO cardioprotection. HBO preconditioning decreased heart infarct size and ameliorated cardiac function in MI rats, whereas Mst1 silencing reversed the effect of HBO administration, as indicated after heat infarct size determination via TTC staining, histological examination via HE staining, and measurements of cardiac function. HBO preconditioning reduced oxidative stress and inflammation in cardiac tissue of MI rat model, evidenced by alteration of malondialdehyde (MDA), 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), and protein carbonyl contents, as well as production of inflammation-associated myeloperoxidase (MPO), IL-1β, and TNF-α. These findings provide a new signaling mechanism through which HBO preconditioning can protect against acute MI injury through the Mst1-mediating Keap1/Nrf2/HO-1-dependent antioxidant defense system."
"Swine influenza virus (SIV) is a highly contagious pathogen that poses significant economic challenges to the swine industry and carries zoonotic potential, underscoring the need for vigilant surveillance. In this study, we performed a comprehensive genetic and molecular analysis of H3N2 SIV isolates obtained from 372 swine samples collected in Shandong Province, China. Phylogenetic analysis revealed two distinct genotypes. The surface genes of both genotypes clustered with the human-like H3N2 lineage, while the internal genes of one genotype clustered with the 2009 pandemic H1N1 (pdm/09) lineage. In the second genotype, the NS gene clustered with the classical swine (CS) H1N1 lineage, while the remaining internal genes clustered with pdm/09, suggesting stable integration of pdm/09 gene segments into H3N2 SIV. Homology analysis showed over 96% genetic similarity between the isolates and reference strains from China and Brazil, suggesting potential transmission through swine trade or human movement. Molecular characterization identified amino acid substitutions in the HA protein (190D, 226I, and 228S), potentially enhancing the virus's affinity for human-like receptors, thereby increasing the zoonotic risk. Key mutations in the PB2 (271A, 591R), PA (336M, 356R, 409N), and M2 (S31N) proteins, along with novel drug resistance mutations, indicate the potential for enhanced virulence and drug resistance in these isolates. Moreover, glycosylation site analysis revealed four differences, and antigenic site analysis showed 13 differences between the HA proteins of the isolates and the WHO-recommended vaccine strain A/Cambodia/E0826360/2020 for the 2021-2022 season, which may reduce vaccine efficacy. Serological analysis revealed that 11 out of the tested serum samples were positive for H3N2 antibodies, resulting in an overall positivity rate of 0.42%. These findings emphasize the urgent need for strengthened SIV surveillance in China to monitor the risk of human transmission and ensure better preparedness for future influenza outbreaks."
"Axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) poses a significant diagnostic challenge to health care professionals, with opportunities for early recognition often being missed in primary care. With musculoskeletal First Contact Practitioners (FCPs) rapidly becoming common place in primary care settings, the question is raised as to whether FCPs are adequately considering axSpA as a potential diagnosis. Swift recognition and timely referral are the antecedents to early diagnosis and better outcomes for people with suspected axSpA; therefore, it is imperative that FCPs can readily identify this condition. To date, no research has been conducted to thoroughly understand the determinants influencing axSpA identification by FCPs specifically."
"The purpose of this program evaluation was to examine preliminary outcomes associated with a novel stepdown program for clients of early intervention in psychosis services (""Step Up"") that featured occupational therapy (OT) as a critical treatment component. Clients participated in Step Up for at least 6 months and were administered pre-post assessments of clinician-rated performance of daily living activities and self-perceived performance and satisfaction with daily occupational functioning. Paired samples Wilcoxon tests were used to compare outcomes across the two time points. Data from 23 participants of Step Up were analyzed. Clinician-rated performance of daily living (especially in the areas of money and time management and leisure engagement) and client-rated performance and satisfaction with daily occupational functioning improved significantly over time. Results demonstrate the promise of programs such as Step Up that capitalize on OT and promote functional outcomes during the transition from early intervention."
"Low temperatures in late spring pose a potential threat to the maintenance of grain yield and quality. Despite the importance of protein and starch in wheat quality, they are often overlooked in models addressing climate change effects. In this study, we conducted multiyear environment-controlled phytotron experiments and observed adverse effects resulting from low-temperature stress (LTS) on plant carbon and nitrogen dynamics, grain protein and starch formation, and sink capacity. We quantified the relationships between low temperature during the jointing and booting stages and plant nitrogen uptake, grain nitrogen accumulation, grain starch accumulation, grain setting, and potential grain weight using source-sink relationship-based methods. The LTS factor was introduced to account for the cultivar-specific to LTS at different growth stages. Compared with the original model, the improved model produced fewer errors when simulating aboveground nitrogen accumulation, grain protein concentration, grain starch concentration, grain starch yield, grain number, and grain weight under LTS, with reductions of 60%, 71%, 73%, 58%, 50% and 65%, respectively. The improvements in the model enhance its mechanism and applicability in assessing short-term successive frost effects on wheat grain quality. Furthermore, when using the improved model, special attention should be given to the low-temperature sensitivity parameters."
"Species reintroductions are increasingly seen as important methods of biodiversity restoration. Reintroductions of red kites Milvus milvus and white-tailed eagles Halieaeetus albicilla to Britain, which were extirpated in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, represent major conservation successes. Here, we measured stable isotope ratios of carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) in feather keratin and bone collagen of museum specimens of red kites and white-tailed eagles, which were collected from across Scotland between the 1800s and 2010s. Our objectives were to investigate dietary differences between species and between the pre- and post- reintroduction periods. Among reintroduced birds, δ13C values were significantly less negative and δ15N values higher in feather keratin and bone collagen of white-tailed eagles compared to red kites, likely reflecting a greater reliance on marine resources by the former. Our stable isotope data showed a wide range, confirming the dietary diversity observed in conventional diet studies of both taxa, with white-tailed eagles, in particular, having wide dietary niches and a considerable degree of inter-individual variability. Isotopic data from pre-introduction red kites mostly fell within the range of post-reintroduction birds, suggesting they had similar diets to the pre-reintroduction birds, or the prey base for modern birds is isotopically indistinguishable from that of their historic counterparts. For white-tailed eagles, several pre-reintroduction birds were isotopically distinct from the post-reintroduction population. These differences may indicate a changing prey base, although these conclusions are complicated by shifting distributions and small population samples. Overall, our study demonstrates the utility of natural history collections in examining changes in diet, environment, and interactions with humans in reintroduced species compared with pre-extirpation indigenous populations."
"Although renal angiomyolipomas (AMLs) are benign lesions, they can grow and cause serious complications. In this study, we aimed to determine the factors affecting the growth of renal AMLs."
"Religiousness has been consistently linked to positive health outcomes and flourishing, yet the underlying mechanisms are complex and not well-understood. The forgiveness and relational spirituality model offers a framework to explore the moderated mediation among religious commitment, health, and forgiveness by God. Understanding these relationships among university students and community residents in Trinidad and Tobago can provide valuable insights into the role of religiousness in promoting wellbeing."
"Biodegradation effectiveness of S. maltophilia DHHJ is determined by its ability to attach to the hydrolyzed feather keratin monomers. This binding capacity can be influenced by many components in the culture medium. Keratin monomers from feathers or those produced by gene overexpression can induce keratinase production in S. maltophilia DHHJ, and several proteases lack the ability to degrade keratin fragments and cysteines. In this study, we co-incubated FITC-labelled keratin monomers with S. maltophilia DHHJ cells in the presence of BSA, DNA, ATP, and several metal ions, and measured fluorescence values and keratinase activity. BSA was found to compete with keratins for cell binding sites, resulting in less keratinase production. DNA did not interfere with cellular binding to keratins revealing unchanged keratinase level. ATP, along with metal ions, enhanced the cellular binding capacity to keratins and increased the production of keratinase by S. maltophilia DHHJ. Fragments of keratin monomers degraded by proteases reduced the ability of cells to bind to keratin and affected enzyme production. Cysteine, a characteristic amino acid of feather keratin, did not have an effect on cellular binding to keratin monomer or on keratinase production. This study will facilitate the tweaking of catalytic parameters to improve feather biodegradation by S. maltophilia DHHJ."
"Bipolar disorder is a chronic disease that imposes a lifelong burden on those that suffer from it. Lithium is still considered both gold standard treatment and first-line maintenance treatment, and access to treatment with lithium is paramount to improving patient outcomes. However, access to adequate treatment is not only contingent on symptom recognition, accurate diagnosis, and individualization of treatment, but also affected by racial and ethnic disparities at each stage of patient experience. Individuals of African Ancestry with bipolar disorder are more frequently misdiagnosed with non-affective psychoses, less likely to receive minimally adequate treatment or be prescribed lithium, and more likely to be prescribed antipsychotics. To compare prescription patterns in the treatment of bipolar disorder between individuals of African and European Ancestry, we conducted a pooled meta-analysis of four cohorts spanning different clinical settings, recruitment periods, and ascertainment methods, followed by sex-stratified analyses. We found that, overall, individuals of African Ancestry with bipolar disorder were significantly less likely to be prescribed lithium, and more likely to be prescribed first and second-generation antipsychotics during their lifetime, than those of European Ancestry. Furthermore, both men and women of African Ancestry were independently less likely to be prescribed lithium and more likely to be prescribed second generation antipsychotics than men and women of European Ancestry. However, women appeared to be more burdened by the significantly increased likelihood of first-generation antipsychotic prescription than men, for whom the association was marginally non-significant. This continued underutilization of lithium likely stems from the complex interaction of multiple biases."
"SN-38, the active metabolite of irinotecan, may cause adverse events necessitating treatment discontinuation and management. Diarrhea, which is treated with loperamide, is one such event. However, loperamide may delay SN-38 elimination, causing more adverse events. Therefore, understanding the adverse events caused by symptomatic drugs is crucial for safe drug therapy. This study aimed to assess the association between loperamide and irinotecan-induced adverse events."
"The COVID-19 Pandemic contributed to accelerating the process of using information and communication technologies and digital technologies in healthcare management and delivery within healthcare systems. At that time, the Czech healthcare system faced the same problems as other European systems and struggled with a temporary limitation of direct provision of healthcare services. It was solved by switching to telemedicine. The Czech healthcare system used telemedicine to a minimal extent until then. Despite adopting the law on healthcare digitisation, it is still one of the countries with a lower level of digitisation of healthcare processes. The article presents the results of an exploratory expert investigation focused on the implementation and development of telemedicine in the Czech Republic. The conducted research aimed to identify problems related to the implementation of telemedicine in practice, place them in the broader framework of the healthcare system and structure them, propose possible solutions, and identify the future challenges of telemedicine in the Czech Republic. We based our study on the results of a three-phase QUAL-QUAN-QUAL research. Data collection in the first phase took the form of individual semi-structured interviews with patients (25) with practical experience in the field of telemedicine, followed by the second quantitative phase of the questionnaire survey with patients (650). The third qualitative phase included semi-structured interviews with experts (17) with practical experience in telemedicine. The introduction and expansion of telemedicine require several fundamental changes. These include adjustments to the legislative environment and changes to the technological infrastructure, organisation of care and work. Several barriers have been identified at the healthcare system level, healthcare providers, healthcare professionals and patients."
"Malnutrition among women of reproductive age is a critical public health issue in LMICs, where undernutrition coexists with rising overweight and obesity rates. In Ethiopia, particularly among urban women, maternal and child undernutrition remains high despite efforts to combat poverty and food insecurity. This study examined the relationship between food affordability and the nutritional status of 4797 women in Addis Ababa. Using repeated cross-sectional surveys, body mass index was calculated, and women's nutritional status was categorized. Data on the affordability of 11 healthy family food groups were collected and categorized into terciles. Multinomial logistic regression models analyzed the association between food affordability and nutritional status, adjusting for confounding factors. The prevalence of underweight among women was 7.3%, while 39.1% were overweight or obese. On average, families could afford 6.1 out of the 11 food groups. Women with higher food affordability had increased odds of being overweight (AOR: 1.32; 95% CI 1.09, 1.60) or obese (AOR: 1.50; 95% CI 1.14, 1.97). The findings highlight that two out of five women are either overweight or obese, with obesity more likely in those with greater perceived food affordability. Addressing food choices as food affordability improves is crucial, as better food affordability is associated with an increased risk of becoming overweight and obese."
"Achalasia is characterized by symptoms of esophageal obstruction, preventing food consumption. However, weight loss is observed only in a subset of patients, and data from literature is conflicting."
"Gene-expression noise can influence cell-fate choices across pathology and physiology. However, a crucial question persists: do regulatory proteins or pathways exist that control noise independently of mean expression levels? Our integrative approach, combining single-cell RNA sequencing with proteomics and regulator enrichment analysis, identifies 32 putative noise regulators. SON, a nuclear speckle-associated protein, alters transcriptional noise without changing mean expression levels. Furthermore, SON's noise control can propagate to the protein level. Long-read and total RNA sequencing shows that SON's noise control does not significantly change isoform usage or splicing efficiency. Moreover, SON depletion reduces state switching in pluripotent mouse embryonic stem cells and impacts their fate choice during differentiation. Collectively, we demonstrate a class of proteins that control noise orthogonally to mean expression levels. This work serves as a proof of concept that can identify other functional noise regulators throughout development and disease progression."
"This review discusses sources of reactive oxygen species, enzymatic antioxidant systems, and low molecular weight antioxidants. We present the pathology of varicose veins (VVs), including factors such as hypoxia, inflammation, dysfunctional endothelial cells, risk factors in varicose veins, the role of RBCs in venous thrombus formation, the influence of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and RBCs on VV pathology, and the role of hemoglobin in the damage of particles and macromolecules in VVs. This review discusses the production of ROS, enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidants, the pathogenesis of varicose veins as a pathology based on hypoxia, inflammation, and oxidative stress, as well as the participation of red blood cells in the pathology of varicose veins."
"The exploration of digital transformation peer effects on the innovation performance of emerging industries is crucial for analyzing the underlying mechanisms of digital transformation, optimizing resource allocation among peer enterprises, and enhancing industrial competitiveness. This study empirically examines the influence of digital transformation peer effects on the innovation performance of the photovoltaic industry, using data from 150 photovoltaic companies listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen between 2011 and 2022. The study found that: (1) The digital transformation of the photovoltaic industry is influenced by regional and industry-specific peer effects. Regional peer effects in digital transformation have a positive impact on the innovation performance of the photovoltaic industry, while industry-specific peer effects exert a negative impact on innovation performance. Moreover, these effects exhibit dynamic persistence; (2) Further analysis of the transmission mechanism reveals that the digital transformation peer effect positively influences the innovation performance of the photovoltaic industry, primarily through the mediating role of enhanced absorptive capacity. Additionally, the level of marketization and executive tenure significantly moderate this relationship; (3) The study further investigates the photovoltaic industry within the context of subsidy policy implementation, firm types, and strategic pacing. The results indicate that the digital transformation peer effect on innovation performance is most pronounced for technology-intensive firms adopting an analytical strategy after the withdrawal of photovoltaic subsidies. For labor-intensive firms employing a defensive strategy, the peer effect is more significant before the withdrawal of subsidies. In contrast, the negative impact of industry-specific digital transformation peer effects on innovation performance is more evident in photovoltaic companies that pursue an offensive strategy; (4) The heterogeneity analysis reveals that the digital transformation peer effect on innovation performance is more significant for small-scale photovoltaic enterprises with state-owned property rights. In contrast, the peer effect negatively impacts innovation performance in large-scale photovoltaic enterprises. These findings provide theoretical insights and practical guidance for governments and enterprises in formulating digital transformation strategies for emerging industries."
"Patients undergoing surgery often experience stress and anxiety, which can increase complications and hinder recovery. Effective management of these psychological factors is key to improving outcomes. Preoperative anxiety is inversely correlated with the amount of information patients receive, but accessible, personalized support remains limited, especially in preoperative settings. Face-to-face education is often impractical due to resource constraints. Digital health (DH) interventions offer a promising alternative, enhancing patient engagement and empowerment. However, most current tools focus on providing information, overlooking the importance of personalization and psychological support."
"D-Galactose (D-gal) accumulation triggers the generation of oxygen free radicals, resulting in skin aging. Sulforaphene (SFE), an isothiocyanate compound derived from radish seeds, possesses diverse biological activities, including protective effects against inflammation and oxidative damage. This investigation delves into the antioxidant impact of SFE on age-related skin injury. In vivo experiments demonstrate that SFE treatment significantly improves the macro- and micro-morphology of dorsal skin. It effectively diminishes the elevation of oxidative stress biomarkers in mice skin tissue treated with D-gal, concurrently enhancing the activity of antioxidant enzymes. Additionally, SFE mitigates collagen mRNA degradation, lowers pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, and downregulates MAPK-related protein expression in the skin. Moreover, SFE supplementation reduces lipid metabolite levels and elevates amino acid metabolites, such as L-cysteine and L-histidine. These findings suggest that SFE holds promise as a natural remedy to mitigate aging induced by oxidative stress."
"Research on concurrent parent and patient-reported outcomes has primarily focused on reaching agreement. However, little is known about how to interpret and address discrepancies, which are not uncommon, between both viewpoints."
"Anemia is common among people living with HIV (PLWH), particularly in Africa. Outcomes for PLWH on modern antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens are not well documented. We conducted an observational study to determine the outcomes and predictors of anemia after ART initiation in Tanzania. We enrolled and followed ART-naïve PLWH and HIV-uninfected individuals at three clinics in Tanzania. We grouped participants into four longitudinal categories based on hemoglobin concentration measured at baseline and 6 months after ART initiation (normal, resolved anemia, incident anemia, and persistent anemia) and followed them for 24 months. There were 991 study participants (494 PLWH, 497 HIV uninfected). After 6 months of ART, 33.9% of PLWH had persistent anemia and 9.9% had incident anemia compared with 12.6% and 9.6% for HIV-uninfected controls. Female sex (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 2.62; 95% CI: 1.91-6.75) and low income (aOR: 3.10; 95% CI: 1.36-7.20) were strong predictors of persistent anemia for both PLWH and HIV-uninfected individuals. For PLWH, having a CD4+ T cell count of less than 350 cells/mm3 (aOR: 0.34; 95% Cl: 0.15-0.73) was significantly associated with anemia resolution. Mortality was higher for PLWH who had persistent anemia or incident anemia than for PLWH who had normal hemoglobin or improved anemia (hazard ratio: 4.0, 95% Cl 1.3-12.2). One-third of adults in Tanzania had persistent anemia after 6 months on ART, and persistent anemia was associated with increased mortality. PLWH with persistent or incident anemia after 6 months on modern ART deserve close follow-up, particularly women and low-income adults."
"The global trend of population aging has resulted in more frequent cardiovascular disease among seniors. Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI) is the standard of care for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) without an upper age limit. Nevertheless, the outcomes are variable among studies, and data on pPCI outcomes in the elderly in Africa is scarce. Thus, we attempted to gain better insight into the outcomes of primary PCI in this age group from a single center in upper Egypt."
"Hearing impairment in patients with rheumatoid arthritis has been underestimated for decades. Rheumatoid arthritis can affect both the middle ear (specifically, the incudomalleolar and incudostapedial joints) and inner ear (including the cochlea and acoustic nerve) simultaneously. Despite ongoing research, consensus on effective treatments for hearing impairment in these patients remains elusive. This systematic review aims to consolidate clinically relevant information for healthcare providers by summarizing current evidence on hearing impairment in rheumatoid arthritis patients. We conducted the current systematic review by searching platforms of PubMed, Embase, ClinicalKey, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect to retrieve eligible articles regarding hearing impairment related to rheumatoid arthritis. We extract any data on characteristics, pathophysiology, examination, and treatment related to rheumatoid arthritis. Based on the currently available evidence, we advocate for the use of specific audiometric tests to facilitate early detection of hearing impairment in these patients. Regular audiological assessments are recommended to monitor hearing ability and potentially prevent further deterioration. Finally, we propose a modified treatment protocol that integrates steroids, hydroxychloroquine, and non-invasive brain stimulation as a novel therapeutic approach for managing these symptoms. This protocol aims to offer clinicians new strategies to address hearing impairment in patients with rheumatoid arthritis effectively."
"Many chemicals in food packaging can leach as complex mixtures to food, potentially including substances hazardous to consumer health. Detecting and identifying all of the leachable chemicals are impractical with current analytical instrumentation and data processing methods. Therefore, our work aims to expand the analytical toolset for prioritizing and identifying chemical hazards in food packaging. We used a high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC)-based bioassay to detect genotoxic fractions in paperboard packaging. These fractions were then processed with non-targeted liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS/MS) and machine learning-based toxicity prediction (MLinvitroTox). The HPTLC bioassay detected four genotoxic zones in extracts of the paperboard. One-dimensional HPTLC separation and targeted fraction collection reduced the number of chemical features extracted from paperboard and detected with LC-HRMS by at least 98% (from 1695-2693 to 14-50). The entire process was successful for spiked genotoxic chemicals, which were correctly prioritized in the fractionation and non-target analysis workflow. The native chemical with the strongest genotoxicity signal was identified with a suspect list as 5-chloro-2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one and confirmed with LC-HRMS/MS and HPTLC bioassay. Toward identification of the remaining unknown genotoxicants, two-dimensional HPTLC further reduced the number of chemical features. Genotoxicity predictions with MLinvitroTox based on molecular fingerprints of the unknown signals derived from their MS2 fragmentation spectra helped prioritize two chemical features and suggested candidate structures. This work demonstrates strategies for using HPTLC, HRMS, and toxicity prediction to help identify toxicants in food packaging."
The COVID-19 pandemic substantially impacted the healthcare system and society in 2020. This study assessed its possible impact on occurrence and stage of colorectal cancer diagnoses in Belgium.
"A Schiff base of Chitosan was prepared by condensing of the Chitosan (CS) with six aromatic aldehydes and confirmed by FT-IR, NMR, XRD, TGA, and DSC. XRD results showed the disappeared of peaks at 2θ = 10° for CS and appeared one peaks at around 2θ of 23° for Schiff bases, while TGA was demonstrated that the thermal stability of CS has improved after the modification with the corresponding aldehyde. Also, DSC shows endothermal peak of CS at 100 °C due to the loss of water and second thermal event related to the decomposition of amine units with an exothermic peak at 295 °C, while Schiff bases shows endothermal peak around 70-95 °C which is related to the loss of water for all samples and the second exothermic peak around 260-280 °C is related to the decomposition of the amine group in the polymer units. The antimicrobial activities of Schiff bases were tested against + ve/ - ve Gram bacteria, and fungi, while antitumor activities were evaluated against cell lines, MCF-7, HCT-116, and HepG-2. The result shows that Schiff bases exhibited higher antimicrobial activity than Amoxycillin and Tetracycline, while Schiff bases indicated the absence of cytotoxic activity when compared to the Colchicine."
"Effective treatment options are scarce for relapsed or refractory T-cell lymphoma. This study assesses the safety and activity of CTX130 (volamcabtagene durzigedleucel), a CD70-directed, allogeneic chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) immunotherapy manufactured from healthy donor T cells, in patients with relapsed or refractory T-cell lymphoma."
"Type VI secretion systems (T6SSs) are widespread bacterial protein secretion machines that inject toxic effector proteins into nearby cells, thus facilitating both bacterial competition and virulence. Pseudomonas aeruginosa encodes three evolutionarily distinct T6SSs that each export a unique repertoire of effectors. Owing to its genetic tractability, P. aeruginosa has served as a model organism for molecular studies of the T6SS. However, P. aeruginosa is also an opportunistic pathogen and ubiquitous environmental organism that thrives in a wide range of habitats. Consequently, studies of its T6SSs have provided insight into the role these systems play in the diverse lifestyles of this species. In this review, we discuss recent advances in understanding the regulation and toxin repertoire of each of the three P. aeruginosa T6SSs. We argue that these T6SSs serve distinct physiological functions; whereas one system is a dedicated defensive weapon for interbacterial antagonism, the other two T6SSs appear to function primarily during infection. We find support for this model in examining the signalling pathways that control the expression of each T6SS and co-ordinate the activity of these systems with other P. aeruginosa behaviours. Furthermore, we discuss the effector repertoires of each T6SS and connect the mechanisms by which these effectors kill target cells to the ecological conditions under which their respective systems are activated. Understanding the T6SSs of P. aeruginosa in the context of this organism's diverse lifestyles will provide insight into the physiological roles these secretion systems play in this remarkably adaptable bacterium."
"Deficient internal rotation after shoulder arthroplasty can inhibit specific essential activities of daily living that require behind-the-back arm positioning. Although postoperative internal rotation deficits occur, their impact on outcomes of total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) is not well established. Previous authors have validated the Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (SANE) as a patient-reported assessment of acceptable outcomes of TSA."
"Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are an ideal source for the treatment of many hematological diseases and malignancies, as well as diseases of other systems, because of their two important features, self-renewal and multipotential differentiation, which have the ability to rebuild the blood system and immune system of the body. However, so far, the insufficient number of available HSCs, whether from bone marrow (BM), mobilized peripheral blood or umbilical cord blood, is still the main restricting factor for the clinical application. Therefore, strategies to expand HSCs numbers and maintain HSCs functions through ex vivo culture are urgently required. In this review, we outline the basic biology characteristics of HSCs, and focus on the regulatory factors in BM niche affecting the functions of HSCs. Then, we introduce several representative strategies used for HSCs from these three sources ex vivo expansion associated with BM niche. These findings have deepened our understanding of the mechanisms by which HSCs balance self-renewal and differentiation and provided a theoretical basis for the efficient clinical HSCs expansion."
"Exome- or genome-based panels-also known as slices or virtual panels-are now a popular approach that involves comprehensive genomic sequencing while restricting analysis to subsets of genes based on patients' phenotypes. This flexible strategy enables frequent gene updates based on novel disease associations as well as reflexing to analyzing other genes up to the whole exome or genome. With recent improvements addressing limitations associated with virtual panels, the advantages of this approach, relative to static custom-based panels, remain to be systematically characterized."
"Cancer is a significant public health issue all over the world. The diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of cancer patients are a huge health, economic and social burden for societies. The link between the state of health of a country and its economic performance has been proven by numerous studies. The aim of this study was to examine the age-standardized death rate of oral cancer in relation to the economic development of 13 European countries."
"The brain is the central hub of the entire nervous system. Its development is a lifelong process guided by a genetic blueprint. Understanding how genes influence brain development is critical for deciphering the formation of human cognitive functions and the underlying mechanisms of neurological disorders. Recent advances in multi-omics techniques have now made it possible to explore these aspects comprehensively. However, integrating and analyzing extensive multi-omics data presents significant challenges. Here, we introduced MAPbrain (http://bigdata.ibp.ac.cn/mapBRAIN/), a multi-omics atlas of the primate brain. This repository integrates and normalizes both our own lab's published data and publicly available multi-omics data, encompassing 21 million brain cells from 38 key brain regions and 436 sub-regions across embryonic and adult stages, with 164 time points in humans and non-human primates. MAPbrain offers a unique, robust, and interactive platform that includes transcriptomics, epigenomics, and spatial transcriptomics data, facilitating a comprehensive exploration of brain development. The platform enables the exploration of cell type- and time point-specific markers, gene expression comparison between brain regions and species, joint analyses across transcriptome and epigenome, and navigation of cell types across species, brain regions, and development stages. Additionally, MAPbrain provides an online integration module for users to navigate and analyze their own data within the platform."
"The genus Neisseria includes two major human pathogens: N. meningitidis causing bacterial meningitis/septicemia and N. gonorrhoeae causing gonorrhoea. Mathematical models have been used to simulate their transmission and control strategies, and the recent observation of a meningococcal B (MenB) vaccine being partially effective against gonorrhoea has led to an increased modeling interest. Here we conducted a systematic review of the literature, focusing on studies that model vaccination strategies with MenB vaccines against Neisseria incidence and antimicrobial resistance. Using journal, preprint, and grey literature repositories, we identified 52 studies that we reviewed for validity, model approaches and assumptions. Most studies showed a good quality of evidence, and the variety of approaches along with their different modeling angles, was assuring especially for gonorrhoea studies. We identified options for future research, including the combination of both meningococcal and gonococcal infections in studies to have better estimates for vaccine benefits, and the spill over of gonorrhoea infections from the heterosexual to the MSM community and vice versa. Cost-effectiveness studies looking at at-risk and the wider populations can then be used to inform vaccine policies on gonorrhoea, as they have for meningococcal disease."
"The treatment of fungal keratitis(FK) remains challenging due to delayed fungal detection and the limited effectiveness of antifungal drugs. Fungal infection can activate both innate and adaptive immune responses in the cornea. Fungi stimulate the production of oxidative stress-related biomarkers and mediate the infiltration of neutrophils, macrophages, and T cells. These cells can induce infiltration of cytokines, chemokines, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), leading to corneal tissue damage and even corneal perforation. The signaling pathway regulates the expression of inflammatory cytokines in fungal keratitis. Immune inflammatory damage is the main mechanism of FK, and oxidative stress damage is also involved in this infection process. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) is a member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily, with different subtypes of PPAR a, PPAR β/δ, and PPARγ. PPARs play important roles in the antioxidant response, anti-inflammatory, lipid metabolism, neuroprotection, and immune regulation processes. PPAR γ can promote macrophage polarization and reduce oxidative stress damage by regulating ROS production. PPAR has made some progress in the treatment of eye diseases: PPARa agonists can inhibit diabetes keratopathy and corneal neuropathy. PPARa agonists inhibit early immature angiogenesis in corneal alkali burns and have potential therapeutic effects on inflammatory corneal angiogenesis. PPARs can control the progression of dry eye disease and improve the condition of meibomian gland dysfunction. Based on this, we explored the potential roles of PPARs in the treatment of FK."
"Over the past year, significant advances have been made in the field of sleep-disordered breathing, particularly in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). This article reviewed key research published from October 1, 2023, to September 30, 2024, focusing on various aspects of OSA, including diagnosis and assessment, treatment, and the management of comorbidities and complications. These studies were expected to further improve the comprehensive diagnosis and treatment of OSA."
"Lateral Meningocele Syndrome (LMS), a disorder associated with NOTCH3 pathogenic variants, presents with neurological, craniofacial and skeletal abnormalities. Mouse models of the disease exhibit osteopenia that is ameliorated by the administration of Notch3 antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) targeting either Notch3 or the Notch3 mutation. To determine the consequences of LMS pathogenic variants in human cells and whether they can be targeted by ASOs, induced pluripotent NCRM1 and NCRM5 stem (iPS) cells harboring a NOTCH36692-93insC insertion were created. Parental iPSCs, NOTCH36692-93insC and isogenic controls, free of chromosomal aberrations as determined by human CytoSNP850 array, were cultured under conditions of neural crest, mesenchymal and osteogenic cell differentiation. The expected cell phenotype was confirmed by surface markers and a decline in OCT3/4 and NANOG mRNA. NOTCH36692-93insC cells displayed enhanced expression of Notch target genes HES1, HEY1, 2 and L demonstrating a NOTCH3 gain-of-function. There was enhanced osteogenesis in NOTCH36692-93insC cells as evidenced by increased mineralized nodule formation and ALPL, BGLAP and BSP expression. ASOs targeting NOTCH3 decreased both NOTCH3 wild type and NOTCH36692-93insC mutant mRNA by 40% in mesenchymal and 90% in osteogenic cells. ASOs targeting the NOTCH3 insertion decreased NOTCH36692-93insC by 70-80% in mesenchymal cells and by 45-55% in osteogenic cells and NOTCH3 mRNA by 15-30% and 20-40%, respectively. In conclusion, a NOTCH3 pathogenic variant causes a modest increase in osteoblastogenesis in human iPS cells in vitro and NOTCH3 and NOTCH3 mutant specific ASOs downregulate NOTCH3 transcripts associated with LMS."
"A total of 384 animals (sheep, goat, cattle, and buffalo) were examined for the presence of hydatid cysts only in the lungs. The lung tissue samples associated with the hydatid cyst were collected immediately after slaughter, followed by fixation in 10% formalin. The fixed tissue was subjected to paraffin embedding technique. Tissue sections of 5 microns were cut by microtome and stained using Harri's Haematoxilin and Eosin method. Overall, 13.80% of ruminants were found positive for lung infections with hydatid cyst. Only the sex of ruminants showed significant (P < 0.05) association with the infection of hydatid cyst in lungs. All other variables, such as species of ruminants, age, and months showed non-significant (P > 0.05) association. Pulmonary sections taken from infected animals revealed laminated membranes encased in a region with significant (P < 0.05) cellular infiltration (53.4 ± 7.9 µm2), primarily composed of lymphocytes, plasma cells, macrophages, and occasionally neutrophils, and eosinophils. In addition, significant (P < 0.05) epithelial disruption in the bronchioles (0.94 ± 0.05 µm2) and alveolar septa were also noticed in sections. These histopathological findings lead to the conclusion that pathological changes occur in the tissues surrounding the cyst as well as in areas more distant from the cyst."
"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits in social interaction and communication. While many studies suggest that individuals with ASD struggle with emotion processing, the association between emotion processing and autistic traits in non-clinical populations is still unclear. We examine whether neurotypical adults' facial emotion recognition and expression imitation are associated with autistic traits. We recruited 32 neurotypical adults; each received two computerized tasks, the Dynamic Emotion Recognition and Expression Imitation, and two standardized measures: the Chinese version AQ and the Twenty-Item Prosopagnosia Index (PI-20). Results for the dynamic emotion recognition showed that happiness has the highest mean accuracy, followed by surprise, sadness, anger, fear, and disgust. For expression imitation, it was easiest to imitate surprise and happiness, followed by disgust, while the accuracy of imitating sadness, anger, and fear was much lower. Importantly, individual AQ scores negatively correlated with emotion recognition accuracy and positively correlated with PI-20. The AQ imagination, communication sub-scores, and PI-20 positively correlated with the expression imitation of surprise. In summary, we found a significant link between recognizing emotional expressions and the level of autistic traits in non-clinical populations, supporting the concept of broader autism phenotype."
"Elevated body mass index (BMI) and type 2 diabetes are prevalent in asthma and are associated with an increase in the risk of asthma attacks. In experimental studies, the diabetes medications metformin and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) have mitigated airway inflammation, hyperresponsiveness, and remodeling. However, epidemiological evidence is limited."
"Pharmacy practice faculty research profiles extend beyond the clinical and social domains, which are core elements of pharmacy practice. But as highlighted by journal editors in the Granada Statements, there is no consensus on these terms. Four domains (clinical, education, social & administrative, and basic & translational) of pharmacy practice faculty research are proposed."
"Avian reoviruses (ARVs) represent a significant economic burden on the poultry industry due to their widespread prevalence and potential pathogenicity. These viruses, capable of infecting a diverse range of avian species, can lead to a variety of clinical manifestations, most notably tenosynovitis/arthritis. While many ARV strains are asymptomatic, pathogenic variants can cause severe inflammation and tissue damage in organs such as the tendons, heart, and liver. In broilers and turkeys, ARVs can induce severe arthritis/tenosynovitis, characterized by swollen hock joints and lesions in the gastrocnemius tendons. Additionally, ARVs have been implicated in other diseases, although their precise role in these conditions remains to be fully elucidated. In recent years, ARV cases have surged in the United States, emphasizing the need for effective control measures. Routine vaccination with commercial or autogenous vaccines is currently the primary strategy for mitigating ARV's impact. Future research efforts should focus on enhancing our understanding of ARV-induced pathogenesis, identifying host factors that influence disease severity, and developing novel vaccines based on ongoing surveillance of circulating ARV strains. This review aims to explore the molecular aspects of ARV, including virus structure, replication, molecular epidemiology, the roles of its encoded proteins in host pathogenesis, and the immune response to ARV infection. Furthermore, we discuss the diagnostic approaches of avian reovirus and the potential biosecurity measures and vaccination trials in combating ARV and developing effective antiviral strategies."
"Loureirin B (LB) is an iconic component of Chinese dragon's blood that presents anti-cancer effects in gastric cancer and liver cancer. Although LB has shown benefits in treating several disorders such as cardiac fibrosis, cerebral ischemia/reperfusion, and osteoporosis, its effect on cervical cancer remains unknown. This study aimed to investigate the effects and mechanisms of LB on treating cervical cancer. A CCK-8 assay was conducted to determine the influence of LB on the viability of HeLa cells. Colony formation assay was performed to verify the impact of LB on HeLa cell proliferation. Cell cycle and apoptosis were detected by flow cytometry and western blot. The scratch assay, Transwell assay and western blot were used to examine the migration and invasion capacity of HeLa cells. The potential targets and signaling pathways of LB treating cervical cancer were predicted by network pharmacology analysis and subsequently validated in vitro. The results showed that the HeLa cell viability gradually declined to 64.83% for 12 h, 53.17% for 24 h, and 42.38% for 48 h after treatment with 5-80 μg/mL LB. Treatment with 20 μg/mL LB decreased cell colonies from 156.7 ± 11.7 to 102.7 ± 5.7. LB arrested cell cycle by reducing the expressions of Ki-67 and PCNA. Compared to the cell apoptosis rate of 2.63% in control group, LB increased it to 6.59% via upregulating Bax and suppressing Bcl-2 expressions. Additionally, LB reduced the invasion and migration capacity of HeLa cells by decreasing MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels. Network pharmacology analysis revealed that LB might suppress the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway to exert the aforementioned effects, as evidenced by a PI3K agonist attenuating the effects of LB on HeLa cells. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that LB inhibited the proliferation of cervical cancer cells, induced its apoptosis, and reduced its invasion and migration via targeting the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway."

"Continuous surveillance is critical for early intervention against emerging novel SARS-CoV-2 variants. Therefore, we investigated and compared the variant-specific evolutionary epidemiology of all the Delta and Omicron sequences collected between 2021 and 2023 in Kuwait. We used Bayesian phylodynamic models to reconstruct, trace, and compare the two variants' demographics, phylogeographic, and host characteristics in shaping their evolutionary epidemiology. The Omicron had a higher evolutionary rate than the Delta. Both variants underwent periods of sequential growth and decline in their effective population sizes, likely linked to intervention measures and environmental and host characteristics. We found that the Delta strains were frequently introduced into Kuwait from East Asian countries between late 2020 and early 2021, while those of the Omicron strains were most likely from Africa and North America between late 2021 and early 2022. For both variants, our analyses revealed significant transmission routes from patients aged between 20 and 50 years on one side and other age groups, refuting the notion that children are superspreaders for the disease. In contrast, we found that sex has no significant role in the evolutionary history of both variants. We uncovered deeper variant-specific epidemiological insights using phylodynamic models and highlighted the need to integrate such models into current and future genomic surveillance programs."
"SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 are still active in the population. Some patients remained PCR-positive for more than 4 weeks, called ""persistently PCR-positive"". Recent evidence suggests a link between the gut microbiota and susceptibility to COVID-19, although no studies have explored persistent PCR conditions. We aimed to evaluate the relationship between persistent positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, the gut microbiome, and individual host determinants."
"Cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) allows characterizing protein-protein interactions (PPIs) in native biological systems by capturing cross-links between different proteins (inter-links). However, inter-link identification remains challenging, requiring dedicated data filtering schemes and thorough error control. Here, we benchmark existing data filtering schemes combined with error rate estimation strategies utilizing concatenated target-decoy protein sequence databases. These workflows show shortcomings either in sensitivity (many false negatives) or specificity (many false positives). To ameliorate the limited sensitivity without compromising specificity, we develop an alternative target-decoy search strategy using fused target-decoy databases. Furthermore, we devise a different data filtering scheme that takes the inter-link context of the XL-MS dataset into account. Combining both approaches maintains low error rates and minimizes false negatives, as we show by mathematical simulations, analysis of experimental ground-truth data, and application to various biological datasets. In human cells, inter-link identifications increase by 75% and we confirm their structural accuracy through proteome-wide comparisons to AlphaFold2-derived models. Taken together, target-decoy fusion and context-sensitive data filtering deepen and fine-tune XL-MS-based interactomics."

"Effective early mentoring is essential for propelling academic careers. There is a growing cohort of junior faculty with advanced skills in medical education and research; these individuals need both mentoring and the opportunity to take on mentorship roles. Generalists who pursue advanced training in medical education or clinical research often enter junior faculty positions alongside recent residency graduates, leaving their skillset untapped. Junior faculty with advanced training are challenged to establish their expertise and set themselves apart. By leveraging their unique skills as near-peer mentors, these individuals can build connections and reach career goals more cohesively and rapidly. In this perspective, we review the skills necessary for junior faculty with advanced career training to balance effectively the dual roles of mentee and near-peer mentor, as well as how departments can best support these unique new faculty members."
"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) can cause chronic infections, significantly increasing the risk of death from cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A key player in chronic HBV infection is covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), a stable episomal form of viral DNA that acts as a persistent reservoir in infected hepatocytes and drives continuous viral replication. Despite the development of several animal models, few adequately replicate cccDNA formation and maintenance, limiting our understanding of its dynamics and the evaluation of potential therapeutic interventions targeting cccDNA. In this study, we aimed to develop a mouse model to investigate cccDNA formation and maintenance. We infected C57BL/6 mice with recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) carrying a 1.3-overlength HBV genome (genotype C) and collected liver tissue at various time points to assess cccDNA levels and viral replication. Our results demonstrated the successful establishment of a chronic hepatitis B mouse model using rAAV-HBV1.3, which supported persistent HBV infection with sustained cccDNA expression in hepatocytes. Serum levels of HBsAg and HBeAg were elevated for up to 12 weeks, while alanine transaminase (ALT) levels remained within the normal range, indicating limited liver damage during this period. We confirmed HBV DNA expression in hepatocytes, and importantly, cccDNA was detected using qPCR after Plasmid-Safe ATP-Dependent DNase treatment, which selectively removes non-cccDNA forms. Additionally, Southern blot analysis confirmed the presence of cccDNA isolated using the Hirt extraction method. This established model provides a valuable platform for studying the long-term maintenance of cccDNA in chronic HBV infection and offers an important tool for testing novel therapeutic strategies aimed at targeting cccDNA."

"Diazoxide is the first-line treatment for children with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (HI). In these cases, diazoxide raises blood glucose levels by suppressing insulin release, preventing hypoglycemia, and potentially devastating end-organ sequelae. Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) is an exceedingly rare side effect of diazoxide. This complication has been described in neonates and in adults, but few children."

"Cervical cancer remains a significant global health concern. KIF18A, a kinesin motor protein regulating microtubule dynamics during mitosis, is frequently overexpressed in various cancers, but its regulatory mechanisms are poorly understood. This study investigates KIF18A's role in cervical cancer and its regulation by the JNK1/c-Jun signaling pathway. Cell growth was assessed in vitro using MTT and colony formation assays, and in vivo using a nude mouse xenograft model with KIF18A knockdown HeLa cells. The Genomic Data Commons (GDC) data portal was used to identify KIF18A-related protein kinases in cervical cancer. Western blot analysis was employed to analyze phosphor-c-Jun, c-Jun, and KIF18A expression levels following JNK1 inhibition, c-Jun knockdown/overexpression, and KIF18A knockdown in cervical cancer cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and luciferase reporter assays were performed to assess c-Jun binding and transcriptional activity of the KIF18A promoter. KIF18A knockdown significantly impaired cervical cancer cell growth both in vitro and in vivo. A strong positive correlation was observed between JNK1 and KIF18A expression in cervical and other cancers. JNK1 inhibition decreased both KIF18A expression and c-Jun phosphorylation. c-Jun was found to directly bind to and activate the KIF18A promoter. Furthermore, c-Jun knockdown inhibited cervical cancer cell growth, and this effect was partially rescued by KIF18A overexpression. This study demonstrates that the JNK1/c-Jun pathway activates KIF18A expression, which is essential for cervical cancer cell growth. Targeting the JNK/c-Jun/KIF18A axis may represent a promising novel therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment."
"Our study explores the complex dynamics of the integrated stress response (ISR) axis, highlighting PIM2 kinase's critical role and its interaction with the BCL2 protein family, uncovering key mechanisms of cell survival and tumor progression. Elevated PIM2 expression, a marker of various cancers, often correlates with disease aggressiveness. Using a model of normal and malignant plasma cells, we show that inhibiting PIM2 kinase inhibits phosphorylated BAD production and activates ISR-mediated NOXA expression. This shift towards MCL1 dependence underscores the synergy achieved through combined PIM/MCL1 inhibition, driven largely by ISR-mediated NOXA expression. In mouse xenograft models, dual targeting of PIM2 and MCL1 effectively controls tumor growth-a response reversed by ISR-specific inhibition and upregulation of genes linked to tumor cell dissemination. This work elucidates the molecular intricacies of PIM2 inhibition and its implications for cancer therapy, especially in tumors with elevated PIM2 expression."
"The mechanisms underlying the establishment of asymmetric structures during development remain elusive. The wing of Drosophila is asymmetric along the Anterior-Posterior (AP) axis, but the developmental origins of this asymmetry is unknown. Here, we investigate the contribution of cell recruitment, a process that drives cell fate differentiation in the Drosophila wing disc, to the asymmetric shape and pattern of the adult wing. Genetic impairment of cell recruitment in the wing disc results in a significant gain of AP symmetry, which results from a reduction of the region between longitudinal vein 5 and the wing margin (L5-M) in the adult wing. Morphometric analysis confirms that blocking of cell recruitment results in a more symmetric wing with respect to controls, suggesting a contribution of cell recruitment to the establishment of asymmetry in the adult wing. In order to verify if this phenotype is originated during the time in which cell recruitment occurs during larval development, we examined the expression of a reporter for the selector gene vestigial (vg) in the corresponding pro-vein regions of the wing disc, but our findings could not explain our findings in adult wings. However, the circularity of the Vg pattern significantly increases in recruitment-impaired wing discs, suggesting that cell recruitment may contribute to AP asymmetries in the adult wing shape by altering the roundness of the Vg pattern. We conclude that cell recruitment, a widespread mechanism that participates in growth and patterning of several developing systems, may contribute, at least partially, to the asymmetric shape of the Drosophila wing."
"Thinning of anterolateral thigh flap is challenging. Anatomical studies have shown variations in arterial branching patterns in the subcutaneous layer, which were suspected to be the reason for the high frequency of thinning failures. We attempted to visualize subcutaneous arterial courses preoperatively and perform thinning of perforator flaps using this information appropriately. We accumulated evidence on the accuracy of noninvasive vascular visualization using photoacoustic tomography (PAT). In the present case, we applied a medical imaging projection system (MIPS), which enabled real-time surgical navigation using indocyanine green (ICG) emission signals, to use photoacoustic information intraoperatively during the flap thinning procedure. A 69-year-old woman underwent half-tongue resection using the pull-through method for right-sided tongue cancer. Preoperative PAT was performed 5 days before surgery. The 12 × 6-cm area took ~8 min to scan. We used an ICG test card containing ICG-positive control material cut into strips to show tentative artery lines by projection mapping. The transparent vascular map was laminated and sterilized. MIPS captured ICG fluorescence signals that penetrated the anterolateral thigh flap and continuously projected the purple area on the reverse side of the flap, guiding the position of the tentative arteries. A 20 × 6.5-cm anterolateral thigh flap was elevated with the distal part of the reconstructed tongue and proximal de-epithelialized part to fill the pull-thorough tunnel in the submandibular region. Active bleeding was observed when cutting marginal fat tissue near the purple line of the distal ALT flap projected by MIPS. The study protocol did not include a highly invasive trial for MIPS-guided thinning; therefore, we removed minimal marginal fat tissue. The ALT flap showed no postoperative complications while maintaining conversation and swallowing functions. We present the concept of subcutaneous arterial real-time navigation surgery using PAT and MIPS for safe, easy, and fast flap thinning procedures in the future."
"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a prevalent autoimmune disorder characterized by neuroinflammation and demyelination in the central nervous system (CNS), leading to neurological dysfunction.

This study investigates the therapeutic potential of Crocin in a murine model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)."
"Reference sequences and annotations serve as the foundation for many lines of research today, from organism and sequence identification to providing a core description of the genes, transcripts and proteins found in an organism's genome. Interpretation of data including transcriptomics, proteomics, sequence variation and comparative analyses based on reference gene annotations informs our understanding of gene function and possible disease mechanisms, leading to new biomedical discoveries. The Reference Sequence (RefSeq) resource created at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) leverages both automatic processes and expert curation to create a robust set of reference sequences of genomic, transcript and protein data spanning the tree of life. RefSeq continues to refine its annotation and quality control processes and utilize better quality genomes resulting from advances in sequencing technologies as well as RNA-Seq data to produce high-quality annotated genomes, ortholog predictions across more organisms and other products that are easily accessible through multiple NCBI resources. This report summarizes the current status of the eukaryotic, prokaryotic and viral RefSeq resources, with a focus on eukaryotic annotation, the increase in taxonomic representation and the effect it will have on comparative genomics.

"CELF2 variants have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD), including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, the molecular mechanisms remain unclear. We generated Celf2 Nestin-Cre knockout mice.Our findings revealed that Celf2 Nestin-Cre heterozygous knockout mice exhibited social impairment and anxiety, an autism-like behavior, though no manifestations of repetitive stereotyped behavior, learning cognitive impairment, or depression were observed. Immunofluorescence assay showed an underdeveloped cerebral cortex with significantly reduced cortical thickness, albeit without abnormal cell density. Further in vitro neuronal culture demonstrated a significant reduction in dendritic spine density and affected synaptic maturation in Celf2 deficient mice, with no notable abnormalities in total neurite and axon length. RNA-seq and RIP-seq analysis of the cerebral cortex revealed differentially expressed genes post Celf2 gene knockout compared with the control group. Enrichment analysis highlighted significant enrichment in dendrite and synapse-related biological processes and pathways. Our study delineated the behavioral and neurodevelopmental phenotypes of Celf2, suggesting its potential involvement in autism through the regulation of target genes associated with dendritic spines and synapse development. Further research is needed to elucidate the specific mechanisms involved."
"A 36-year-old woman with ulcerative colitis presented with progressive chest pain and neurovegetative symptoms. The electrocardiogram showed ST segment elevation in the inferior wall. The patient had a previous history of fatigue and night sweats. She underwent coronary angiography, which revealed severe disease of two coronary vessels, with successful primary angioplasty of the culprit vessel. Aortitis was suspected, which led to additional studies, among which a slight elevation of inflammatory activity indices stood out, and a computed tomography angiography showed periaortic fibrotic thickening and significant stenosis in multiple arteries, suggesting Takayasu vasculitis. She was treated with prednisone and methotrexate and underwent delayed myocardial revascularization surgery with good results. This case highlights the complexity of Takayasu arteritis, its possible association with ulcerative colitis, and the importance of early diagnosis for adequate management."
"With soil salinity levels rising at an alarming rate, accelerated by climate change and human interventions, there is a growing need for crop varieties that can grow on saline soils. Alfalfa (Medicago sativa) is a cool-season perennial leguminous crop, commonly grown as forage, biofuel feedstock and soil conditioner. It demonstrates significant potential for agricultural circularity and sustainability, for example by fixing nitrogen, sequestering carbon and improving soil structures. Although alfalfa is traditionally regarded as a moderately salt-tolerant species, modern alfalfa varieties display specific salt-tolerance mechanisms, which could be used to pave its role as a leading crop able to grow on saline soils."
"BACKGROUND: Sleep disorders are common and various in persons with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). However, their assessment and management remain in the background compared with motor symptoms. This study was conducted to better understand sleep disorders in PwMS and to analyze sleep problems and their predictive symptoms. METHODS: This cross-sectional design study was conducted with 136 PwMS. Data were collected using a participant identification form, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Insomnia Severity Index, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, and Stop-Bang Test. In data analysis, 1-way analysis of variance, t test and Pearson correlation, and multiple regression analysis were used. RESULTS: The study found that 51.5% of the participants have poor sleep quality, 36.8% have insomnia, 24.3% have excessive daytime sleepiness, and 19.9% were at risk of obstructive sleep apnea. Symptoms of forgetfulness (β = 0.199), depression (β = 0.223), pain (β = 0.278), and increased urinary frequency at night (β = 0.236) explain approximately 40% of the change in sleep quality score; difficulty swallowing (β = 0.218), depression (β = 0.253), and pain (β = 0.313) symptoms explain 33% of the change in insomnia score; fatigue (β = 0.292) and anxiety (β = 0.409) symptoms explain 32% of the change in sleepiness score. CONCLUSIONS: PwMS start to experience sleep disorders in the early stages of the disease, some characteristics affect sleep disorders, and the symptoms they experience explain sleep disorders at significant rates. Sleep disorders should be evaluated by nurses and interdisciplinary healthcare teams from the early stages of multiple sclerosis with different aspects and to include predictive symptoms in the interventions to be implemented to reduce sleep disorders."
"Laboratory medicine provides pivotal medical information through analyses of body fluids and tissues, and thus, it is essential for diagnosis of diseases as well as monitoring of disease progression. Despite its universal importance, the field is currently suffering from the limited workforce and analytical capabilities due to the increasing pressure from expanding global population and unexpected rise of noncommunicable diseases. The emerging technologies of microfluidic automation and artificial intelligence (AI) has led to the development of advanced diagnostic platforms, positioning themselves as adaptable solutions to enable highly efficient and accessible laboratory medicine. In this review, we will provide a comprehensive review of microfluidic automation, focusing on the microstructure design and automation principles, along with its intended functionalities for diagnostic purposes. Subsequently, we exemplify the integration of AI with microfluidics and illustrating how their combination benefits for the applications and what the challenges are in this rapidly evolving field. Finally, the review offers a balanced perspective on the microfluidics and AI, discussing their promising role in advancing laboratory medicine."

"Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is a severe disorder characterized by complex pathophysiological processes, which can lead to disability and death. This study aimed to determine necroptosis-associated genes in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and to investigate their potential as diagnostic and therapeutic targets for AIS. Expression profiling data were acquired from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, and necroptosis-associated genes were retrieved from GeneCards. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and necroptosis-related genes were intersected to obtain the necroptosis-related DEGs (NRDEGs) in AIS. In AIS, a total of 76 genes associated with necroptosis (referred to as NRDEGs) were identified. Enrichment analysis of these genes revealed that they were primarily enriched in pathways known to induce necroptosis. Using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), five co-expression modules consisting of NRDEGs were identified, along with two modules that exhibited a strong correlation with AIS. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis resulted in the identification of 20 hub genes. The Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model demonstrated promising potential for diagnostic prediction. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve validated the diagnostic model and selected nine characteristic genes that exhibited statistically significant differences (p < 0.05). By employing consensus clustering, distinct patterns of necroptosis were identified using these nine signature genes. The results were validated by quantitative PCR (qPCR) in venous blood from patients with AIS and healthy controls and HT22 cells, as well as external datasets. Furthermore, the analyzed ceRNA network included nine lncRNAs, six miRNAs, and three mRNAs. Overall, this study offers novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying NRDEGs in AIS. The findings provide valuable evidence and contribute to our understanding of the disease."

"Gene fusions are nucleotide sequences formed due to errors in replication and transcription control. These errors, resulting from chromosomal translocation, transcriptional errors or trans-splicing, vary from cell to cell. The identification of fusions has become critical as key biomarkers for disease diagnosis and therapy in various cancers, significantly influencing modern medicine. Chimeric Transcripts and RNA-Sequencing database version 8.0 (ChiTaRS 8.0; http://biosrv.org/chitars) is a specialized repository for human chimeric transcripts, containing 47 445 curated RNA transcripts and over 100 000 chimeric sequences in humans. This updated database provides unique information on 1055 chimeric breakpoints derived from public datasets using chromosome conformation capture techniques (the Hi-C datasets). It also includes an expanded list of gene fusions that are potential drug targets, and chimeric breakpoints across 934 cell lines, positioning ChiTaRS 8.0 as a valuable resource for testing personalized cancer therapies. By utilizing text mining on a curated selection of disease-specific RNA-sequencing data from public datasets, as well as patient blood and plasma samples, we have identified novel chimeras-particularly in diseases such as oral squamous cell carcinoma and glioblastoma-now catalogued in ChiTaRS. Thus, ChiTaRS 8.0 serves as an enhanced fusion transcript repository that incorporates insights into the functional landscape of chimeras in cancers and other complex diseases, based on liquid biopsy results."

"Due to therapeutic side effects and physical weakness, patients are not always able to carry out strenuous and lengthy exercises. Hence, this study investigated the effectiveness and feasibility of a short-term Whole-body electromyostimulation (WB-EMS) for oncological patients during and after anticancer treatment. The primary aim was to ensure the feasibility of WB-EMS training. Furthermore, the effects of WB-EMS training were investigated over a period of 2 weeks on parameters such as quality of life, body composition and physical performance."
"This study aimed to develop and validate a cost-effective, customizable patient-specific phantom for simulating external ventricular drain placement, combining image segmentation, 3-D printing and molding techniques. Two variations of the phantom were created based on patient MRI data, integrating a realistic skin layer with anatomical landmarks, a 3-D printed skull, an agarose polysaccharide gel brain, and a ventricular cavity. To validate the phantom, 15 neurosurgeons, residents, and physician assistants performed 30 EVD placements. The effectiveness of the phantom as a training tool was assessed through a standardized user experience questionnaire, which evaluated the physical attributes, realism, and overall satisfaction. The mechanical properties of the phantom brain were quantified by measuring catheter insertion forces using a linear force tester to compare them to those experienced in real brain tissue. The study participants successfully completed EVD placements with a 76.7% optimal placement rate, which aligns with rates observed in clinical practice. Feedback highlighted the anatomical accuracy of the phantom and its value in enhancing surgical skills, though it also identified areas for improvement, particularly in the realism of the skin layer. Mechanical testing demonstrated that the insertion forces required were comparable to those encountered in actual brain tissue. The developed phantom offers a realistic, low-cost, and adaptable model for EVD simulation. This tool is particularly beneficial for both training and research, with future enhancements planned to improve the realism of the skin and incorporate more anatomical features to increase the fidelity of the simulation."
"Dopamine modulates a wide range of cognitive processes in the prefrontal cortex, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we examined the roles of prefrontal vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)-expressing neurons and their D1 receptors (D1Rs) in working memory using a delayed match-to-sample task in mice. VIP neurons conveyed robust working-memory signals, and their inactivation impaired behavioral performance. Moreover, selective knockdown of D1Rs in VIP neurons also resulted in impaired performance, indicating the critical role of VIP neurons and their D1Rs in supporting working memory. Additionally, we found that dopamine release dynamics during the delay period varied depending on the target location. Furthermore, dopaminergic terminal stimulation induced a contralateral response bias and enhanced neuronal target selectivity in a laterality-dependent manner. These results suggest that prefrontal dopamine modulates behavioral responses and delay-period activity based on laterality. Overall, these findings shed light on dopamine-modulated prefrontal neural processes underlying higher-order cognitive functions."
"Dystonia is a common neurological hyperkinetic movement disorder that can be caused by mutations in anoctamin 3 (ANO3, TMEM16C), a phospholipid scramblase and ion channel.

"As a transcription factor, GLI1 plays an important role in cell cycle regulation, DNA replication, and DNA damage responses. The aberrant activation of GLI1 has been associated with cancers such as glioma, osteosarcoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma. The binding of GLI1 to a specific DNA sequence was achieved by five tandem zinc finger motifs (Zif motifs) on the N-terminal part of the molecule. Here, we reported a novel homodimeric crystal structure of Zif1-2. These two Zif motifs are linearized. Namely, Zif2 does not bend and interact with Zif1 of the same molecule. Instead, Zif1 from one molecule interacts with Zif2 from another molecule. The dimer interface of Zif1-2 is unique and different from the conformation of Zif1-2 from the GLI1-DNA co-crystal structure. The dimeric conformation of Zif motifs could represent the native conformation of apo form GLI1 Zif motifs in the cell. The molecular dynamics simulation result of the homodimer, the in silico mutagenesis, and the predicted protease stability of these mutants using a large language model are also presented."

"Patellofemoral instability (PFI) is a common problem with various anatomic risk factors identified, including patella alta as one of the most powerful predictors. Given that the medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) is the primary soft tissue stabilizer of the patella, a common procedure to treat recurrent patellar instability is MPFL reconstruction. The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between MPFL reconstruction and patellar height. We hypothesize that after reconstruction, patellar instability patients would have demonstrable reduction in patella height and patella alta correction."

"A slew of common metabolic disorders, including type 2 diabetes, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease and steatohepatitis, are exponentially increasing in our sedentary and overfed society. While macronutrients directly impact metabolism and bioenergetics, new evidence implicates immune cells as critical sensors of nutritional cues and important regulators of metabolic homeostasis. A deeper interrogation of the intricate and multipartite interactions between dietary components, immune cells and metabolically active tissues is needed for a better understanding of metabolic regulation and development of new treatments for common metabolic diseases. Responding to macronutrients and micronutrients, immune cells play pivotal roles in interorgan communication between the microbiota, small intestine, metabolically active cells including hepatocytes and adipocytes, and the brain, which controls feeding behavior and energy expenditure. This Review focuses on the response of myeloid cells and innate lymphocytes to dietary cues, their cross-regulatory interactions and roles in normal and aberrant metabolic control."
"G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest family of cell receptors. They mediate the effects of a multitude of endogenous and exogenous cues, are deeply involved in human physiology and disease, and are major pharmacological targets. Whereas GPCRs were long thought to signal exclusively at the plasma membrane, research over the past 15 years has revealed that they also signal via classical G-protein-mediated pathways on membranes of intracellular organelles such as endosomes and the Golgi complex. This review provides an overview of recent advances and emerging concepts related to endomembrane GPCR signaling, as well as ongoing research aimed at a better understanding of its mechanisms, physiological relevance, and potential therapeutic applications."

"Among patients with chronic epilepsy, 70‑80% have cognitive impairment. To investigate the relationship between adiponectin (ADPN) and the cognitive level in epilepsy and its mechanism, 20 epileptic patients and 20 healthy controls were included for the assessment of the cognitive level. An ELISA was used to evaluate the serum ADPN level. An epileptic rat model was established and treated with AdipoRon, an ADPN receptor (AdipoR) agonist, which binds to AdipoR1 and AdipoR2. The Morris water maze test was used to assess the cognitive function of rats, and the expression levels of the synapsis‑associated proteins postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95), synaptosomal associated protein 25 (SNAP25) and synaptophysin (SYP), as well as AMP‑activated protein kinase (AMPK), mTOR, phosphorylated (p‑)AMPK and p‑mTOR were determined by immunoblotting. Serum ADPN levels were positively correlated with the Montreal cognitive assessment score. AdipoRon improved the cognitive function of epileptic rats, maintained the structural integrity of hippocampal neurons and reduced neuronal damage. It also promoted the mRNA expression of AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 in the hippocampus. Furthermore, AdipoRon increased the expression of the synapsis‑associated proteins PSD95, SNAP25 and SYP by activating the AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway. ADPN improved cognitive impairment in epilepsy by targeting the AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway, providing novel insights for the treatment of epilepsy."
"KLHL24 (Kelch-like protein 24) is a significant component of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), involved in regulating protein turnover through targeted ubiquitination and degradation.

"Plasmodiophora brassicae, a soil-borne biotroph, establishes galls as strong physiological sinks on Brassicaceae plants including Brassica napus and Arabidopsis thaliana. We compare transcriptional profiles of phloem dissected from leaf petioles and hypocotyls of healthy and infected B. napus plants. Our results highlight how pathogenesis accompanies phloem-mediated defence responses whilst exerting a strong influence on carbon-nitrogen (C-N) economy. We observe transcriptional changes indicating decreased aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis, fluctuating jasmonic acid responses, altered amino acid (AA) and nitrate transport, carbohydrate metabolism and modified cytokinin responses. Changes observed in phloem-dissected from upper versus lower plant organs point to phloem as a conduit in mediating C-N repartitioning, nutrition-related signalling and cytokinin dynamics over long distances during clubroot disease. To assess changes in physiology, we measured AAs, sugars and cytokinins, in phloem exudates from B. napus plants. Despite the decrease in most AA and sucrose levels, isopentyl-type cytokinins increased within infected plants. Furthermore, we employed Arabidopsis for visualising promoter activities of B. napus AA and N transporter orthologues and tested the impact of disrupted cytokinin transport during P. brassicae-induced gall formation using Atabcg14 mutants. Our physiological and microscopy studies show that the host developmental reaction to P. brassicae relies on cytokinin and is accompanied by intense nitrogen and carbon repartitioning. Overall, our work highlights the systemic aspects of host responses that should be taken into account when studying clubroot disease."
"Autoimmune disorders (ADs) pose significant health and economic burdens globally, characterized by the body's immune system mistakenly attacking its own tissues. While the precise mechanisms driving their development remain elusive, a combination of genetic predisposition(s) and environmental triggers is implicated. Interleukin-27 (IL-27), among numerous cytokines involved, has emerged as a key regulator, exhibiting dual roles in immune modulation. This review delves into the molecular structure and signaling mechanisms of IL-27, highlighting its diverse effects on various immune cells. Additionally, it explores the involvement of IL-27 in autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), offering insights into its potential therapeutic implications. Moreover, its involvement in autoimmune diseases like type 1 diabetes (T1D), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), myasthenia gravis (MG), Sjögren's syndrome (SS), and Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is multifaceted, with potential diagnostic and therapeutic implications across these conditions. Further research is essential to fully understand IL-27's mechanisms of action and therapeutic potential in autoimmune diseases."
"The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) has a major impact on a person's social and personal lives, affecting both physical and mental health. To meet the global 95-95-95 target, it is essential to understand and address the multi-level challenges to improve the continuum of care for persons living with HIV (PLWH). This study delves into the care-seeking pathways and barriers encountered by PLWH residing in rural areas of Nepal, shedding light on the complexities of accessing and navigating the continuum of care."

"Dominant missense mutations of the calcium-permeable cation channel TRPV4 cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) type 2C and two forms of distal spinal muscular atrophy. These conditions are collectively referred to as TRPV4-related neuromuscular disease and share features of motor greater than sensory dysfunction and frequent vocal fold weakness. Pathogenic variants lead to gain of ion channel function that can be rescued by TRPV4 antagonists in cellular and animal models. As small molecule TRPV4 antagonists have proven safe in trials for other disease indications, channel inhibition is a promising therapeutic strategy for TRPV4 patients. However, the current knowledge of the clinical features and natural history of TRPV4-related neuromuscular disease is insufficient to enable rational clinical trial design. To address these issues, we developed a TRPV4 patient database and administered a TRPV4-specific patient questionnaire. Here, we report demographic and clinical information, including CMT Examination Scores (CMTES), from 68 patients with known pathogenic TRPV4 variants, 40 of whom also completed the TRPV4 patient questionnaire. TRPV4 patients showed a bimodal age of onset, with the largest peak occurring in the first 2 years of life. Compared to CMT type 1A (CMT1A) patients, TRPV4 patients showed distinct symptoms and signs, manifesting more ambulatory difficulties and more frequent involvement of proximal arm and leg muscles. Although patients reported fewer sensory symptoms, sensory dysfunction was often detected clinically. Many patients were affected by vocal fold weakness (55%) and shortness of breath (55%), and 11% required ventilatory support. Skeletal abnormalities were common, including scoliosis (64%), arthrogryposis (33%) and foot deformities. Strikingly, patients with infantile onset of disease showed less sensory involvement and less progression of symptoms. These results highlight distinctive clinical features in TRPV4 patients, including motor-predominant disease, proximal arm and leg weakness, severe ambulatory difficulties, vocal fold weakness, respiratory dysfunction and skeletal involvement. In addition, patients with infantile onset of disease appeared to have a distinct phenotype with less apparent disease progression based on CMTES. These collective observations indicate that clinical trial design for TRPV4-related neuromuscular disease should include outcome measures that reliably capture non-length dependent motor dysfunction, vocal fold weakness and respiratory disease."
"Many publicly available databases provide disease related data, that makes it possible to link genomic data to medical and meta-data. The cancer genome atlas (TCGA), for example, compiles tens of thousand of datasets covering a wide array of cancer types. Here we introduce an interactive and highly automatized TCGA-based workflow that links and analyses epigenomic and transcriptomic data with treatment and survival data in order to identify possible biomarkers that indicate treatment success. TREMSUCS-TCGA is flexible with respect to type of cancer and treatment and provides standard methods for differential expression analysis or DMR detection. Furthermore, it makes it possible to examine several cancer types together in a pan-cancer type approach. Parallelisation and reproducibility of all steps is ensured with the workflowmanagement system Snakemake. TREMSUCS-TCGA produces a comprehensive single report file which holds all relevant results in descriptive and tabular form that can be explored in an interactive manner. As a showcase application we describe a comprehensive analysis of the available data for the combination of patients with squamous cell carcinomas of head and neck, cervix and lung treated with cisplatin, carboplatin and the combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel. The best ranked biomarker candidates are discussed in the light of the existing literature, indicating plausible causal relationships to the relevant cancer entities."

"The objective of this study was to determine the match level of school furniture with student dimensions and conduct a pilot study to examine practicality of a computer-aided ergonomic analysis software with a Motion Capture System (MoCap) for the purpose of improving school furniture design process in terms of determining optimum dimensions. The research involved measuring the anthropometric data of 218 voluntary primary school students in Mugla, Turkiye and the dimensions of the existing school desks they use. The compatibility between the students' anthropometry and the existing school desks were analysed by using reference equations. Computer-aided ergonomic analysis performed only for seat and desk height. Four virtual human model and ten different school desks in various dimensions were created and evaluated according to joint reaction forces and muscle activations in three different postures by using Anybody Modelling System (AMS). The results of compatibility level showed that there were significant incompatibilities between the students' anthropometry and the existing school desks, with 80% of seat heights and 96% of desk heights being too high. Overall, in order to assess the optimal school desk dimensions, ergonomic analyses provided data indicating reduced joint reaction forces and muscle activations within the musculoskeletal system for the seat and desk height dimensions determined using reference equations. Also, the findings from the ergonomic analysis revealed valuable information on how even minor dimensional modifications to school desks can affect the musculoskeletal system."
"Using the QM/MM methodology and a local mode analysis, we investigated a character and a strength of FeS bonds of heme groups in oxidized and reduced forms of Bacterioferritin from Azotobacter vinelandii. The strength of the FeS bonds was correlated with a bond length, an energy density at a bond critical point, and a charge difference of the F and S atoms. Changing the oxidation state from ferrous to ferric generally makes the FeS bonds weaker, longer, more covalent, and more polar. We also investigated the SFeS bond bending and found that the stronger FeS bond, generally makes the SFeS bond bending stiffer, which could play a key role in the balance between ferric and ferrous oxidation states and related biological activities."
"Leishmaniasis, a neglected tropical disease caused by Leishmania parasites, continues to pose global health challenges. Current treatments face issues like resistance, safety, efficacy, and cost. This review covers the discovery, mechanisms of action, clinical applications, and limitations of key antileishmanial agents: pentavalent antimonials, amphotericin B, miltefosine, paromomycin, and pentamidine. Despite toxicity and resistance (antimonials), hospitalization needs and side effects (amphotericin B), regional efficacy variability (miltefosine), inconsistent outcomes (paromomycin), and severe side effects (pentamidine), these drugs are vital. Novel strategies to overcome the deficiencies of current therapies are highlighted, including combination regimens, advanced drug delivery systems, and immunomodulatory approaches. Comprehensive and cooperative efforts are crucial to fully realize the potential of advancements in antileishmanial pharmacotherapy and to reduce the unacceptable worldwide burden imposed by this neglected disease."
"Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is used to modulate neuronal activity, but the exact mechanism of action (MOA) is unclear. This study investigates tDCS-induced modulation of the corticospinal excitability and the underlying MOA. By anesthetizing the scalp before applying tDCS and by stimulating the cheeks, we investigated whether stimulation of peripheral and/or cranial nerves contributes to the effects of tDCS on corticospinal excitability."
"This study aimed to investigate the regulatory effects of raspberry ketone on hypothalamic inflammation and its mechanism. Mouse microglia cells (BV2 cells) were cultured in vitro with palmitic acid (100 μM) to induce inflammation model and then incubated with raspberry ketone (5, 20, 50 μM) alone or raspberry ketone (50 μM) and the specific inhibitor of uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2), genipin (10 μM), to test the role of UCP2 in raspberry ketone regulatory of inflammation. Meanwhile, C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat diet containing raspberry ketone (0.2%, wt/wt) for 16 wk or 7 d to observe the effects of raspberry ketone on the body weights and hypothalamic inflammation of mice. The expression levels of inflammatory factors, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1beta (IL-1β) and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), were detected using RT-qPCR, Elisa, and Western blotting, respectively. At the cellular level, raspberry ketone reduced the content of inflammatory factors in BV2 cells and in the cell culture medium. Genipin inhibited the anti-inflammatory effect of raspberry ketone on BV2 cells. At the animal level, after 16 wk of feeding, raspberry ketone-containing diets significantly reduced the body weight of mice, but had no significant effect on the mRNA expression level of hypothalamic inflammatory factors. On the other hand, 7 d of raspberry ketone gavage significantly reduced mRNA and protein expression of hypothalamic inflammatory factors. The results of this study suggest that raspberry ketone could regulate high-fat diet-induced obesity in mice, and the specific mechanism may be to inhibit hypothalamic inflammation in mice by regulating UCP2 gene expression."
"Homocysteine (Hcy) levels are elevated in different conditions, including cardiovascular diseases (CVD), diabetes, and metabolic-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD).

"Water-table maps are fundamental to hydrogeological studies and a manual, hand-drawn method is still commonly used to produce them. Despite this, the accuracy and variability of such maps have received little attention in international literature. In a unique experiment, 63 groundwater professionals drew water-table equipotential contours based on the same dataset of point measurements and were asked to infer flow directions and predict groundwater elevations at predefined locations. The root mean squared error (RMSE) for the average map calibration data was 10.5 m, which is accuracy comparable to numerical groundwater models. This study confirmed that to produce hand-drawn water-table maps, practitioners seek to not only fit the spatial data, but also to conform to their own cognitive model of hydrogeological concepts and processes. The calibration accuracy increased with experience; from a RMSE of 13.3 m for practitioners with 0-3 years of experience to a RMSE of 9.2 m for those with four or more years. Despite considerable variability in the style of the hand-drawn water-table maps, the maps were consistent in their representation of the dominant regional groundwater flow directions. There was less consensus, however, in predicting the direction of surface water-groundwater interaction for a stream reach. Hand-drawn water-table mapping remains useful and valid, especially as a starting point for hydrogeological conceptualization, yet further work is required to resolve issues around transparency, repeatability, and reproducibility."
There have been a number of clinical trials in glaucoma research published in the past two decades. Most of these trials were designed to evaluate very specific issues in selected populations placing them in the explanatory end of the pragmatic-explanatory continuum. The purpose of this study was to assess the level of pragmatism of published randomized controlled trials in glaucoma.

"In 2023, the Canadian Society of Abdominal Radiology (CSAR) and Canadian Emergency, Trauma, and Acute Care Radiology Society (CETARS) received Canadian Association of Radiologists (CAR) member feedback that there was an unmet educational need for guidance in the imaging investigation of right lower quadrant (RLQ) pain. Members requested specific guidance on how to handle controversial scenarios including which test to order when, specifics of imaging protocols, and managing pregnant patients who have RLQ pain-all from a Canadian perspective. After conducting an exhaustive literature review, the working group agreed that a Canadian-specific set of guidelines was warranted. The management recommendations presented in this guideline were discussed as a group to achieve expert consensus. As the workup for RLQ pain can vary considerably in the paediatric population, the scope of this paper was restricted to adults (18 years of age or older). Whenever possible, the best evidence was used to inform the clinical guidance, and where gaps existed, the guidelines reflect consensus among experts in the field. The result is a framework to aid in this process of managing patients with RLQ pain across various clinical scenarios while addressing current questions and controversies, particularly those most relevant to the Canadian healthcare system."
"Endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) maximized for topical steroid irrigations is highly effective for polyp disease.

"This program evaluation aimed to assess the impact of a streamlined and less expensive version of Goslings-I (a NICU parent education program) on parents' early language and literacy practices and their confidence in interacting with their infants. This evaluation used a single-group, pre- and posttest, mixed-methods design. Sixty-three parents completed pre- and postprogram questionnaires on the frequency of language and literacy activities, confidence in understanding infant signals, and program satisfaction. Seven parents participated in follow-up interviews. Interview participants reported on interaction with their infants 1-2 weeks after attending the program. Goslings-II resulted in self-reported positive behavioral changes in parent-infant interactions, increased early language and literacy activities, and enhanced confidence. Parents also reported they could apply Goslings-II skills to other parent-infant interactions, like diapering. Positive results from this evaluation are similar to the original program, Goslings-I, demonstrating program effectiveness at a more affordable price."
"Corticospinal motor neurons (CSMN), located in the motor cortex of the brain, are one of the key components of the motor neuron circuitry. They are in part responsible for the initiation and modulation of voluntary movement, and their degeneration is the hallmark for numerous diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), hereditary spastic paraplegia, and primary lateral sclerosis. Cortical hyperexcitation followed by in-excitability suggests the early involvement of cortical dysfunction in ALS pathology. However, a high-spatiotemporal resolution on our understanding of their functional health and connectivity is lacking. Here, we combine optical imaging with high-density microelectrode array (HD-MEA) system enabling single cell resolution and utilize UCHL1-eGFP mice to bring cell-type specificity to our understanding of the electrophysiological features of healthy CSMN, as they mature and form network connections with other cortical neurons, in vitro. This novel approach lays the foundation for future cell-type specific analyses of CSMN that are diseased due to different underlying causes with cellular precision, and it will allow the assessment of their functional response to compound treatment, especially for drug discovery efforts in upper motor neuron diseases."
"Past observational studies have reported the association between patient-ventilator asynchronies and poor clinical outcomes, namely longer duration of mechanical ventilation and higher mortality. But causality has remained undetermined. During the era of lung and diaphragm protective ventilation, should we revolutionize our clinical practice to detect and treat dyssynchrony?"
"Depression substantially impacts on quality of life, personal relationships, and self-care. Gastrointestinal disorders are the common comorbidity of depression and 24.3% of patients with depression have disordered bowel habits. Dietary intake of live microbes alters the host's microflora and is beneficial for the prevention and control of bowel health and depression. We aim to investigate the association of dietary intake of live microbes with bowel health and depression and to further examine weather bowel health or depression mediates the therapeutic effect of live microbes."
"Identifying novel targets for molecular radiosensitization is critical for improving the efficacy of colorectal cancer (CRC) radiotherapy. Alpha-thalassemia/mental retardation X-linked (ATRX), a member of the SWI/SNF-like chromatin remodeling protein family, functions in the maintenance of genomic integrity and the regulation of apoptosis and senescence. However, whether ATRX is directly involved in the radiosensitivity of CRC remains unclear. Our results showed that silencing ATRX increased the radiosensitivity of HCT116 CRC cells, which was further strengthened when p53 was depleted. To explore the potential mechanism, we focused on the impact of the ionizing radiation (IR)-induced DNA damage response (DDR), apoptosis, and senescence and the activation of the Daxx/MDM2/p53 pathway caused by ATRX loss. The results showed that IR induced DNA damage and G2/M arrest after depleting ATRX, especially in p53-depleted HCT116 cells, and inhibited ATM/Chk2 pathway activation, indicating that ATRX loss leads to failure of triggering the ATM/Chk2 pathway. Accordingly, ATRX loss promotes cell apoptosis and attenuates cell senescence. Interestingly, our results indicate that ATRX loss upregulates p53 function via the Daxx/MDM2 pathway to mediate radiosensitivity. Thus, ATRX may represent a novel radiosensitizing target for CRC, particularly p53-deficient CRC."

"Two dwarf bunt resistance QTLs were mapped to chromosome 6D, and KASP markers associated with the loci were developed and validated in a panel of regionally adapted winter wheats. UI Silver is an invaluable adapted resistant cultivar possessing the two identified QTL potentially associated with genes Bt9 and Bt10 and will be useful in future cultivar development to improve dwarf bunt resistance. Dwarf bunt, caused by Tilletia controversa, is a fungal disease of wheat that can cause complete loss of grain yield and quality during epidemics. Traditional breeding for dwarf bunt resistance requires many years of field screening under stringent conditions with disease assessment possible only near or after plant maturity. Molecular marker-assisted selection (MAS) offers a more efficient alternative. This study identified quantitative trait loci (QTL) and associated molecular markers for dwarf bunt resistance in wheat. A doubled haploid (DH) mapping population of 135 lines, derived from bunt-resistant cultivar 'UI Silver' and susceptible line 'Shaan89150', was evaluated in field nursery in Logan, Utah in 2017, 2018, and 2023. The population was genotyped using Illumina 90 K SNP iSelect marker platform. Using inclusive composite interval mapping (ICIM), the major QTL Qdb.ssdhui-6DL was consistently identified on chromosome arm 6DL across all environments, explaining phenotypic variations ranging from 15.29% to 35.40%. Another QTL, Qdb.ssdhui-6DS, was detected on chromosome arm 6DS, explaining approximately 11% of the phenotypic variation. These two QTLs exhibit additive-by-additive effects for increased resistance within the DH population. Kompetitive allele-specific PCR (KASP) markers were developed within QTL intervals and used in a validation panel of regionally adapted winter wheat lines to confirm the association between the two QTL and dwarf bunt resistance. Thus, 'UI Silver' and additional resistant cultivars with these two QTLs are valuable parental lines for improving dwarf bunt resistance through marker-assisted selection. These genetic resources are essential for understanding gene function via map-based gene cloning."
"Chronic heart failure (CHF) represents a substantial public health challenge, impacting patients' emotional well-being, quality of life, and overall prognosis. Palliative care and hospice services are increasingly recognized in managing advanced CHF, yet their evidence-based benefits remain underexplored. This study aimed to assess the influence of hospice care on CHF patient outcomes. A total of 120 inpatients with CHF were randomly assigned to receive either hospice care in addition to standard treatment (experimental group) or standard care alone (control group). Patient assessments included heart function classification, activities of daily living, Minnesota Living With Heart Failure Questionnaire, anxiety scale, and pain assessment. Results demonstrated significant improvements in cardiac function, activities of daily living, anxiety levels, pain scores, and heart failure-related quality of life in the experimental group compared with controls. Reduced anxiety, enhanced emotional well-being, and overall health status improvements were particularly notable postintervention. Hospice care was associated with enhanced functional abilities, emotional well-being, pain management, and overall quality of life for CHF patients. In conclusion, this study underscores hospice care's positive impact on prognosis, quality of life, and emotional well-being in CHF, emphasizing its potential as a critical component in comprehensive CHF management strategies."

"Geographic atrophy (GA), a late manifestation of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), leads to irreversible vision loss. Early identification of precursor lesions, such as incomplete and complete retinal pigment epithelium and outer retinal atrophy (iRORA and cRORA), is crucial for predicting GA formation. The latter stage has been associated with irreversible and progressive changes, and the eventual development of a dense scotoma on the compromised area. We present an 80-year-old woman with AMD in both eyes, demonstrating progressive changes over a 2-year follow-up. While the right eye developed cRORA with vision decline, the left eye exhibited unexpected restoration of the outer retinal layers within the cRORA lesion. This finding challenges the notion of ""end-stage atrophy"" in GA development and highlights the potential reversibility of early atrophic lesions. Recognizing these dynamics has implications for the development of targeted therapies aimed at preserving vision in AMD's early stages."
"The deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flap is currently the gold standard for autologous breast reconstruction. In cases where the DIEP is contraindicated, the profunda artery perforator (PAP) flap is now the preferred second-line option in our institution. The PAP flap poses unique challenges to the reconstructive surgeon, especially in Asian women with low body mass index (BMI). Herein, we share the unique technical pearls when performing breast reconstruction in this population."
"Sepsis, characterized by a severe immune response to infection, remains a leading cause of mortality, with few effective strategies to prevent organ damage. Targeting inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis is crucial for improving outcomes and advancing sepsis management. We investigated the protective effects of Ganoderma Lucidum Polysaccharide Peptide 2 (GL-PP2) against sepsis-induced organ damage, focusing on immune regulation and kidney protection. In a murine sepsis model, mice received intraperitoneal injection of GL-PP2 (25, 50, 100 mg/kg) for seven days, with dexamethasone (5 mg/kg) as a positive control. Sepsis was induced by intraperitoneal lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 10 mg/kg), followed by histological, biochemical, molecular, and network pharmacology analyses to evaluate kidney and spleen damage. Results demonstrated that GL-PP2 mitigates LPS-induced kidney and spleen damage, preserving tissue integrity and improving renal function markers (blood creatinine, urea nitrogen). GL-PP2 also lowers pro-inflammatory cytokines, boosts antioxidant enzymes, and modulates the Nrf2/NF-κB pathways, highlighting its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. Additionally, it reduces apoptosis by regulating Bax, cleaved caspase-3, and Bcl-2 expression. These findings indicate that GL-PP2 is a promising sepsis therapy candidate, as it targets inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis, reducing organ injury. By modulating key pathways, GL-PP2 could improve clinical outcomes, warranting further study."
"Previous studies have reported high diversity between and within populations of Toxoplasma gondii in South America. In the present study, isolates of T. gondii from chickens were obtained from the Amazon region. Adult free-range chickens were acquired from 29 municipalities in the Brazilian Amazon region that included Acre (n = 9 municipalities), Amapá (n = 6), Amazonas (n = 6), Pará (n = 6), and Roraima (n = 2) states and from two municipalities in Peru, three in Bolivia, one in Guyana, and one in Venezuela. Heart, brain, and blood samples were collected from 401 chickens. Anti-T. gondii serum antibodies were detected in 273 (68.1%) chickens using the Modified Agglutination Test (MAT ≥ 5), and bioassays in mice were performed using 220 birds. Isolates were obtained from 116 (52.7%) chickens with antibody titers ≥ 20. Of these isolates, 93 (84.5%) led to acute sickness in more than 50% of the infected mice within 30 days post-inoculation. The 116 isolates were genotyped using multilocus nested polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (Mn-nPCR-RFLP) with 12 markers and 15 microsatellite (MS) markers. PCR-RFLP analysis revealed 42 genotypes from the 116 isolates. Of these, 20 (46.51%) genotypes are described for the first time. The most abundant genotype was ToxoDB PCR-RFLP genotype #7 with 40 isolates. A total of 83 genotypes were observed from the 116 isolates by MS analysis. The phylogenetic network constructed of T. gondii genotypes from current and previously reported isolates, using PCR-RFLP data, revealed five groups with clear indication of geographical separation of T. gondii population in the Amazon region versus the Southeastern region of Brazil. Such spatial diversity was also observed within the Amazon region. This study expands our knowledge of T. gondii population in South America and emphasizes the importance of genetic diversity and high mouse-virulence of the parasite in the Amazon region."

"The relationship between the concomitant use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and elevated prothrombin time-to-international standard ratio (PT-INR) in patients receiving warfarin remains unclear. In the present study, 26 patients treated with ICIs during warfarin therapy were examined for increases in PT-INR within 60 d of ICI administration. Of these patients, 13 developed Grade 2 or higher PT-INR elevations, 5 of which required the immediate administration of vitamin K. The increased risk of bleeding and the impact on the continuation of cancer drug therapy are significant burdens for patients. Immune-related adverse events caused by ICIs have been suggested as one of the reasons for increases in PT-INR, and patients taking warfarin and ICIs need to be managed in consideration of the risk of elevated PT-INR by frequently checking the blood coagulation capacity."
"Electrical coupling is vital to neural communication, facilitating synchronized activity among neurons. Despite its significance, the precise mechanisms governing the establishment of gap junction connections between specific neurons remain elusive. Here, we identified that the PVC interneuron in Caenorhabditis elegans forms gap junction connections with the PVR interneuron. The transcriptional regulator CFI-1 (ARID3) is specifically expressed in the PVC but not PVR interneuron. Reducing cfi-1 expression in the PVC interneuron leads to enhanced gap junction formation in the PVR neuron, while ectopic expression of cfi-1 in the PVR neuron restores the proper level of gap junction connections in the PVC neuron, along with the normal touch response. These findings unveil the pivotal role of CFI-1 in bidirectionally regulating the formation of gap junctions within a specific neuronal pair, shedding light on the intricate molecular mechanisms governing neuronal connectivity in vivo."

"mRNA-based vaccines against the COVID-19 pandemic have propelled the use of nucleic acids for drug delivery. Conventional lipid-based carriers, such as liposomes and nanolipogels, effectively encapsulate and deliver RNA but are hindered by issues such as premature burst release and immunogenicity. To address these challenges, cell membrane-coated nanoparticles offer a promising alternative. We developed a novel nanoparticle system using chitosan methacrylate-tripolyphosphate (CMATPP), which capitalizes on interactions involving membrane proteins at biointerfaces. Ionic crosslinking between chitosan methacrylate and tripolyphosphate facilitates the formation of nanoparticles amenable to coating with red blood cell (RBC) membranes, extracellular vesicles (EVs), and cell-derived nanovesicles (CDNs). Coating CMATPP nanoparticles with RBC membranes effectively mitigated the initial burst release of encapsulated small interfering RNA (siRNA), sustaining controlled release while preserving membrane proteins. This concept was extended to EVs, where CMATPP nanoparticles and CDNs were incorporated into a microfluidic device and subjected to electroporation to create hybrid CDN-CMATPP nanoparticles. Our findings demonstrate that CMATPP nanoparticles are a robust siRNA delivery system with suppressed burst release and enhanced membrane properties conferred by cell or vesicle membranes. Furthermore, the adaptation of the CDN-CMATPP nanoparticle formation in a microfluidic device suggests its potential for personalized therapies using diverse cell sources and increased throughput via automation. This study underscores the versatility and efficacy of CMATPP nanoparticles in RNA delivery, offering a pathway towards advanced therapeutic strategies that utilize biomimetic principles and microfluidic technologies."

"22q11 deletion syndrome consists of a variable grouping of phenotypic features and immunological defects secondary to the loss of genetic material located in the 22q11.2 band. The 22q11 deletion spectrum encompasses different syndromes related to the same etiology and with overlapping anomalies, including DiGeorge syndrome, velocardiofacial syndrome, among others."
"Persistence is a strategy used by many viruses to evade eradication by the immune system, ensuring their permanence and transmission within the host and optimizing viral fitness. During persistence, viruses can trigger various phenomena, including target organ damage, mainly due to an inflammatory state induced by infection, as well as cell proliferation and/or immortalization. In addition to immune evasion and chronic inflammation, factors contributing to viral persistence include low-level viral replication, the accumulation of viral mutants, and, most importantly, maintenance of the viral genome and reliance on viral oncoprotein production. This review focuses on the process of genome integration, which may occur at different stages of infection (e.g., HBV), during the chronic phase of infection (e.g., HPV, EBV), or as an essential part of the viral life cycle, as seen in retroviruses (HIV, HTLV-1). It also explores the close relationship between integration, persistence, and oncogenesis. Several models have been proposed to describe the genome integration process, including non-homologous recombination, looping, and microhomology models. Integration can occur either randomly or at specific genomic sites, often leading to genome destabilization. In some cases, integration results in the loss of genomic regions or impairs the regulation of oncogene and/or oncosuppressor expression, contributing to tumor development."
"The aims of this study were to develop a questionnaire on peripheral intravenous catheter (PIVC) maintenance, evaluate its content validity, and assess factors influencing the level of knowledge of nursing professionals regarding best practices.The study was conducted in 3 stages: (1) development of a questionnaire on PIVC maintenance; (2) content validity assessment by experts with assessment of comprehensiveness, relevance, and clarity; and (3) application of the questionnaire to 1493 nursing professionals. Relationships between personal characteristics and knowledge levels were evaluated. The questionnaire score ranged from 0 to 26. The participants obtained a mean score of 13.7 (SD, 2.4). Factors associated with a higher knowledge level included higher educational level, training on PIVC maintenance upon admission, and employment in an institution with recurrent PIVC maintenance training. Gaps in knowledge included the recommended technique for active disinfection, how catheter stabilization should be performed, recommended technique for flushing and minimizing blood reflux into the catheter, appropriate frequency for assessing the insertion site of the catheter, and signs of catheter complications. A questionnaire for assessing knowledge of best practices in PIVC maintenance was developed and had adequate evidence of content validity. Aspects related to greater education were associated with a higher knowledge level. Knowledge gaps were identified."
"This study explored using small molecular weight hydrolysates from enzymolyzed thawed drip as cryoprotectants to preserve myofibrillar protein quality in pork patties during freeze-thaw cycles. Hydrolysates were added at 0.36 %, 0.72 %, and 1.4 % concentrations, compared to a control with deionized water and a positive control with sorbitol and sucrose. Results indicated that thawed drip hydrolysates significantly reduced thawing loss and cooking loss. Moreover, the color deterioration during the 3rd and 6th freeze-thaw cycles was delayed. Myofibrillar protein denaturation and oxidation in the experimental groups were inhibited, shown by decreased surface hydrophobicity, reduced carbonyl groups and protein surface roughness, and increased free sulfhydryl groups, α-helix content, and protein particle height. The highest hydrolysate concentration (1.4 %) provided the most benefits, performing comparably to the positive control. Correlation analysis confirmed that hydrolysates enhanced both myofibrillar protein and pork quality, offering a promising approach to improve meat resilience against freeze-thaw conditions."
"The brain tumors have been characterized with aggressive and heterogeneous nature. The treatment of brain tumors has been challenging due to their sensitive location and also, presence of blood-brain barrier (BBB) that reduces the entrance of bioactive compounds to the brain tissue. Therefore, the new treatment strategies should be focused on improving the efficacy of conventional therapeutics, crossing over biological barriers and introducing new kinds of methods for brain tumor elimination. In the recent years, the application of carbohydrate polymers in the treatment of human cancers has been increased as they possess biocompatibility, biodegradability and selective targeting of tumor cells. Moreover, carbohydrate polymer-based nanoparticles demonstrate desirable drug loading and encapsulation, making them suitable for the delivery of bioactive compounds. Accordingly, the carbohydrate polymers and their nanoparticles have been developed to improve the drug and gene delivery to brain tumors. Moreover, these nanoparticles can increase sensitivity of chemotherapy and immunotherapy. In addition to providing combination therapy, the carbohydrate polymer-based nanoparticles can elevate the phototherapy-mediated tumor ablation. These nanocarriers have demonstrated desirable particle size, zeta potential and encapsulation efficiency that are beneficial for brain tumor therapy. Moreover, these nanoparticles have high biocompatibility that can be subsequently utilized in clinical studies."
"The rhomboid intercostal and subserratus plane (RISS) block is an effective, safer alternative for managing postoperative acute pain following abdominal surgeries. The RISS block offers several advantages over traditional approaches, including reduced incidence of puncture-related complications, lower rates of systemic opioid consumption, and more consistent analgesic coverage of lower thoracic dermatomes."
An increasing incidence of positive blood cultures has been reported in several countries. This represents an important challenge for public health due to the large number of hospital admissions with high mortality among these patients. This study aims to characterize the epidemiology and mortality associated with positive blood cultures.
"Black, Native American, Latinx, Asian, and Pacific Islander women all have histories of sexual violence in the United States. Their historical victimizations have set a precedence for contemporary commercial sex victimization. The purpose of this study was to examine the role of ""race"" in sex trafficking. Data from 50 women with sex trafficking histories resulted in three candidate themes and five subthemes that include (a) sex trafficked women (White women, Black women vs. White women, and all women with unique subthemes related to drug use and locations); (b) Black male traffickers; and (c) Black and White male customers."
"Our aim was to investigate the test-retest reliability of the 2-min walk test (2MWT), timed up and go test (TUG), and five times sit-to-stand test (FTSST) in prostate cancer (PC) patients."
"Anaemia is a common phenomenon in patients with malignant gynecological tumors. The occurrence of anaemia in the perioperative period leads to an increased probability of blood transfusion, increased surgical complications,poor wound healing, prolonged hospitalization, increased medical costs, and increased mortality. Intravenous iron, which is known for its rapid onset and lack of gastrointestinal side effects, has become increasingly prevalent in clinical practice. A total of 300 patients with gynaecological malignancies were admitted to The First Affiliated Hospital,Hengyang Medical School,University of South China between January, 2019 and December , 2021. Anaemia was assessed during routine blood tests by measuring red blood cell (RBC) counts, hemoglobin (Hb) levels, haematocrit (HCT) values, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH). The postoperative blood transfusion rate, transfusion volume, infection rate, and hospitalization duration were also recorded and comparisons were made between the control and treatment groups.Our study showed that preoperative intravenous iron injection can effectively increase haemoglobin levels in patients with anemia caused by gynecological cancer, reduces the probability of perioperative blood transfusion., decreases postoperative complications and infection rates, shortens hospital stays, and improves short-term prognosis in patients. We concluded that intravenous iron presents is a valuable clinical option for addressing perioperative anaemia in patients with gynecologic malignancies."
Determine the association between clinical and demographic factors and 30-day readmission risk after pituitary surgery.
"The mechanisms underlying obesity-induced insulin resistance remain incompletely understood, as impaired cellular insulin signaling, traditionally considered the primary driver of insulin resistance, does not always accompany impaired insulin action. Overnutrition rapidly increases plasma norepinephrine (NE), suggesting overactivation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). However, the role of the SNS in obesity is controversial, as both increased and decreased SNS activity (SNA) have been reported. Here, we show that reducing catecholamine (CA) release from the SNS protects against overnutrition-induced insulin resistance as well as hyperglucagonemia, adipose tissue dysfunction, and fatty liver disease, as we demonstrate utilizing a mouse model of inducible and peripherally restricted deletion of tyrosine hydroxylase (th; THΔper). A key mechanism through which heightened SNA induces insulin resistance is by triggering adipose tissue lipolysis. Increased SNA emerges as a critical driver in the pathogenesis of overnutrition-induced insulin resistance and metabolic disease independent of cellular insulin signaling."
"Over a decade ago, it was discovered that microglia, the brain's immune cells, engulf synaptic material in a process named microglial pruning. This term suggests that microglia actively sculpt brain circuits by tagging and phagocytosing unwanted synapses. However, live imaging studies have yet to demonstrate how microglial synapse elimination occurs. To address this issue, we propose a new conceptual framework distinguishing between two potential mechanisms of synapse elimination, culling and scavenging. During culling, microglia may use a contractile ring to sever the neuronal plasma membrane, removing the unwanted synapse. During scavenging, synapse elimination is neuronal-driven, and the neuronal plasma membrane fission machinery sheds off synapses that are later phagocytosed by microglia. We will discuss the current limitations of studying microglial synapse elimination and evaluate evidence supporting either culling or scavenging. Discerning between these mechanisms is essential for determining the therapeutic value of phagocytosis modulators in diseases with altered brain connectivity."
"Uropygi is an order of arachnids commonly known as vinegaroons or whip-scorpions. So far, two genera are known to occur in Brazil: Thelyphonellus Pocock, 1894 and Mastigoproctus Pocock, 1894. We examined the morphology of 182 specimens of Brazilian Mastigoproctus and sequenced 42 specimens for phylogenetic analyses, using mitochondrial and nuclear molecular markers. Phylogenetic inference was performed under maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference. Our results suggest that the Brazilian species previously included in Mastigoproctus represent two different genera, with the following species and synonymies: the revalidated Amauromastigon Mello-Leitão, 1931, composed of A. maximus (Tarnani, 1889), comb. nov. (=Mastigoproctus annectens Werner, 1916, M. butleri Pocock, 1894 and M. perditus Mello-Leitão, 1931), and Heptatarsus gen. nov., composed of H. brasilianus (Koch, 1843), comb. nov. (=Mastigoprotus minensis Mello-Leitão, 1931) and H. custodioi sp. nov. Also, we urge caution when using certain morphological characters when describing uropygid taxa based on specimens in early developmental stages.

"Late-onset hypogonadism (LOH) refers to sexual and non-sexual symptoms in men caused by age-related decreases in circulating testosterone. Leydig cells (LCs) transplantation is considered to be one of a viable approach for LOH therapy, but the limited source of LCs limits the application of this approach. The aim of this study was to induce the directed differentiation of rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) into LCs in vitro, and explore the potential involvement of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in the differentiation process. BMSCs were extracted from rats and characterized by flow cytometry for positive rates of mesenchymal stem cell markers CD29, CD44, CD90, and the hematopoietic marker CD45. BMSCs were divided into three groups: Control, Wnt agonist (CHIR-99021), and Wnt inhibitor (LGK-974), each incubated for 14 days. ELISA and RT-qPCR were used to verify the protein and mRNA expression of β-catenin, LRP5 and TCF, the key factors in Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. The average fluorescence intensity of 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD) on the surface of LCs was detected by immunofluorescence (IF) assay. The content of testosterone secreted in cell culture medium was detected by ELISA. The results of flow cytometry indicated that we successfully extracted and cultured BMSCs. Moreover, post 14 days of incubation, the changes of β-catenin, LRP5 and TCF, at the protein and mRNA level demonstrate successful intervention in the activation and inhibition of the intracellular Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Compared with the control group, the LCs surface marker 3β-HSD expression intensity in the CHIR-99,021 group was significantly increased by 69% (p < 0.01), while significantly decreased by 59% in LGK-974 group (p < 0.01). The ELISA results indicated a higher testosterone concentration in the CHIR-99,021 group (359.58 ± 17.46 pg/mL) than in the control (225.31 ± 15.42 pg/mL) and LGK-974 groups (183.67 ± 4.47 pg/mL), and the difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05). This study successfully demonstrates the directed differentiation of BMSCs into LCs under the action of inducers. We verified that the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is involved in this differentiation process. The idea proposed in our study for efficiently inducing differentiation of BMSCs into LC in vitro, may provide a safe and sustainable LC source for developing clinically feasible cell transplantation-based LOH therapies."
"To mitigate adverse reactions induced by 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), Cnidium officinale fraction 2 (F2) polysaccharides served as the macromolecular carrier, facilitating its reaction with carboxymethyl-5-fluorouracil (C-5-FU) for producing F2-C-5-FU. Subsequently, this compound could react with folic acid (FA) through the ester bond, forming F2-C-5-FU-FA, as verified through NMR analysis. The in vitro anticancer efficacy of F2-C-5-FU-FA was evaluated using SKOV-3 cells that expressed folate receptor (FR) and FR-deficient A549 cells, showing greater cytotoxicity in the SKOV-3 cell line due to the FRs on the cell membrane. In vivo experiments were conducted on SKOV-3-bearing xenograft mice using an in vivo imaging system (IVIS). Animals injected with F2-C-5-FU-FA exhibited significantly stronger targeting of tumor tissue compared to those injected with F2-C-5-FU. These findings highlighted enhanced drug delivery and accumulation in targeted tumor regions facilitated by folate-targeted conjugates. Moreover, F2-C-5FU-FA showed reduced cardiac toxicity in mice and minimal spleen accumulation, indicating a negligible effect on the immune system. Overall, this study introduced a novel strategy for achieving highly efficient anticancer drug delivery into tumor cells that express FR."
"Synthetic illicit drugs, such as nitazenes and fentanyls, are becoming commonplace in countries around the world, including in Europe, Australia, and Latin America, which raises concern for overdose crises like those seen in North America. An important dimension of the risk represented by synthetic drugs is the fact that they are increasingly packaged in counterfeit pill form. These pills-often indistinguishable from authentic pharmaceuticals-have substantially widened the scope of populations susceptible to synthetic drug overdose in North America (eg, among adolescents experimenting with pills or tourists from the USA seeking psychoactive medications from pharmacies in Mexico). The non-medical use of diverted prescription medications is relatively more common, and less stigmatised, than the use of powder drugs. Many consumers of counterfeit pills are unaware that they contain synthetic illicit drugs, believe them to be authentic pharmaceuticals, and would be unlikely to consume those drugs knowingly or if in powder form. Given these issues, we recommend the expansion of educational and awareness campaigns, pill testing programmes to help consumers shift demand to safer products, increased monitoring in routine clinical scenarios and overdose death toxicology, and expanding medically managed safer alternatives to counterfeit pill use."
"Debridement, a mainstay of nursing clinical practice, refers to the removal of dead or unhealthy tissue from a wound to facilitate healing. Debridement is one component of the concept of wound bed preparation that has long guided the approach to wound management. The ability of a wound to heal must be determined prior to the initiation of any method of debridement. In areas where high-quality, comparative studies on the relative benefits of different debridement modalities are lacking, nurses should adopt an evidence-informed approach to care. To do this, nurses must understand the importance of following a comprehensive, holistic approach when treating chronic wounds. Nurses should have knowledge of inflammation and infection control and of the fundamentals of moisture management, recognize the need for debridement in healable wounds, and be familiar with different debridement options. This article provides nurses with a wound management framework, an overview of wound debridement options based on the potential for wound healing, and scope of practice considerations for developing a plan of care. A composite case is presented to illustrate the critical considerations in wound care."

"Surgical augmentation methods have been introduced to the Modified Broström (MB) technique to support native anterior talo-fibular ligament (ATFL) healing and function. This study aimed to investigate the isolated biomechanical performance of common MB augmentation elements, including allograft, suture tape, and copolymer, compared to native ATFL. Six cadaveric feet were dissected, isolating the ATFL from all surrounding soft tissue. The fibula and talus were clamped on the testing frame so that the ligament was in line with the load cell. Six samples per augment group were fixed on a test frame with a gauge length of 20 mm to replicate ATFL length. All samples were pulled to failure at 305 mm/min. Biomechanical outcomes included stiffness, elongation, and ultimate load. Mean ± standard deviation was reported. Stiffness was highest for suture tape (246.4 ± 52.1N/mm), followed by allograft (114.2 ± 26.2 N/mm), native ATFL (78.6 ± 31.8 N/mm), and copolymer (9.4 ± 2.9 N/mm). Significant differences in stiffness were observed between all groups except when comparing ATFL stiffness to allograft (P = 0.086). Copolymer resulted in significantly larger elongation at ultimate load compared to native ATFL, suture tape, and allograft (P < 0.001). Elongation at ultimate failure was highest for copolymer (30.0 ± 8.7 mm) and significantly greater than all other groups (P < 0.001). Ultimate load was highest for suture tape (544.1 ± 59.7 N), followed by native ATFL (338.5 ± 63.7 N), allograft (308.3 ± 98.5 N) and copolymer (146.7 ± 8.9 N). Suture tape ultimate load was significantly greater than copolymer (P < 0.001). Isolated biomechanical data of augment materials can be utilized by foot and ankle surgeons when considering appropriate ligament augmentation options."
"Discovering antigen-reactive T cell receptors (TCRs) is central to developing effective engineered T cell immunotherapies. However, the conventional technologies for isolating antigen-reactive TCRs (i.e., major histocompatibility complex (MHC) multimer staining) focus on high-affinity interactions between the TCR and MHC-antigen complex, and may fail to identify TCRs with high efficacy for activating T cells. Here, we develop a microfluidic single-cell screening method for antigen-reactive T cells named ATLAS-seq (Aptamer-based T Lymphocyte Activity Screening and SEQuencing). This technology isolates and characterizes activated T cells via an aptamer-based fluorescent molecular sensor, which monitors the cytotoxic cytokine IFNγ secretion from single T cells upon antigen stimulation, followed by single-cell RNA and single-cell TCR sequencing. We use ATLAS-seq to screen TCRs reactive to cytomegalovirus (CMV) or prostate specific antigen (PSA) from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). ATLAS-seq identifies distinct TCR clonotype populations with higher T cell activation levels compared to TCRs recovered by MHC multimer staining. Select TCR clonotypes from ATLAS-seq are more efficient in target cell killing than those from MHC multimer staining. Collectively, ATLAS-seq provides an efficient and broadly applicable technology to screen antigen-reactive TCRs for engineered T cell immunotherapy."
Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is an emerging tick-borne viral disease. It has been described in Spain in both ticks and humans. Until July 2024 most cases have been described in the central-western part of the Iberian Peninsula.

"To investigate the location of white matter lesions (WMLs) in migraineurs with right‒to‒left shunts (RLS); the relationships among the severity of WMLs, changes in brain structural volume and RLS shunts; and the relationships among the severity of WMLs, changes in brain structural volume and degree of headache in RLS migraine patients. A total of 102 migraineurs with RLS admitted to the affiliated Central Hospital of Dalian University of Technology from December 2018 to December 2022 were enrolled in this study. RLS flow and the 6-item Headache Impact Test (HIT-6) scores were recorded to reflect the degree of headache. The brain structural volumes of 102 migraineurs with RLS were calculated from T1-weighted images via artificial intelligence, and the brain structural volumes of healthy controls matched according to age and sex were also calculated. The correlations among WML location, RLS, headache degree, WML severity and brain structural volume changes in migraineurs were analyzed. (1) The WMLs of migraineurs with RLS were concentrated mainly in the white matter of the lateral ventricular margin and deep white matter. Subcortical WMLs were concentrated mainly in the parietal lobe, occipital lobe and frontal lobe. (2) There were no significant differences in the WML variables of cerebral white matter high signal volume, ratio of high-signal white matter volume to whole-brain white matter volume (%) or Fazekas score among migraineurs with different RLS flows, but there were significant differences in WML variables among migraineurs with RLS with different HIT-6 grades and MIDAS grades. RLS flow, HIT-6 score and MIDAS grade were not correlated with the WML variables measured in this study. (3) There was a significant difference in the volume of the precentral gyrus between migraineurs with RLS and normal controls (P < 0.001), and there was a significant difference between migraineurs with different RLS flows and different HIT-6 scores and peripheral cerebrospinal fluid volumes. There was also a positive correlation between frontal pole structural volume and RLS flow. The volume of the precentral gyrus was negatively correlated with RLS flow, whereas the volume of the pons gyrus was positively correlated with the HIT-6 score. The volume of the temporal pole was negatively correlated with the HIT-6 score. (1) The WMLs of migraineurs with RLS were concentrated mainly in the white matter of the lateral ventricular margin and deep white matter. Subcortical WMLs were concentrated mainly in the parietal lobe, occipital lobe and frontal lobe. (2) There was no correlation between WML severity and RLS flow in migraineurs with RLS. (3) There was no correlation between WML severity and migraine severity in migraineurs with RLS. (4) Volume changes occurred in some brain structures of migraineurs with RLS. (5) Shunt flow and the degree of headache in migraineurs with RLS were correlated with structural volume changes in specific brain regions."

SYNBIP 2.0 is now freely accessible at https://idrblab.org/synbip/."
"With the escalating crisis of bacterial multidrug resistance, anti-virulence therapeutic strategies have emerged as a highly promising alternative to conventional antibiotic treatments. Anti-virulence compounds are specifically designed to target virulence factors (VFs), disarming pathogens without affecting bacterial growth and thus reduce the selective pressure for resistance development. However, due to the complexity of bacterial pathogenesis, no anti-virulence small molecules have been approved for clinical use thus far, despite the documentation of hundreds of potential candidates. To provide valuable reference resources for drug design, repurposing, and target selection, the virulence factor database (VFDB, http://www.mgc.ac.cn/VFs/) has systematically collected public data on anti-virulence compounds through extensive literature mining, and further integrated this information with its existing knowledge of bacterial VFs. To date, the VFDB has curated a comprehensive dataset of 902 anti-virulence compounds across 17 superclasses reported by 262 studies worldwide. By cross-linking the current knowledge of bacterial VFs with information on relevant compounds (e.g. classification, chemical structure, molecular targets and mechanisms of action), the VFDB aims to bridge the gap between chemists and microbiologists, providing crucial insights for the development of innovative and effective antibacterial therapies to combat bacterial infections and address antibiotic resistance."
"A long-standing goal of neuroimaging is the non-invasive volumetric assessment of whole brain function and structure at high spatial and temporal resolutions. Functional ultrasound (fUS) and ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) are rapidly emerging techniques that promise to bring advanced brain imaging and therapy to the clinic with the safety and low-cost advantages associated with ultrasound. fUS has been used to study cerebral hemodynamics at high temporal resolutions while ULM has been used to study cerebral microvascular structure at high spatial resolutions. These two methods have complementary spatio-temporal characteristics, making them ideally suited for multimodal imaging, but both suffer from limitations associated with transcranial ultrasound imaging. Here, these two methods are combined on the same data acquisition, completely non-invasively, using contrast-enhancements, which solves the dual challenges of sensitivity during transcranial imaging and the ability to implement super-resolution. From this combined approach, the cerebral blood flow, activated brain region, brain connectivity, vessel diameter, and vessel velocity were all calculated from the same data acquisition. During stimulation periods, there was a statistically significant (p<0.0001) increase in cerebral blood flow, diameter, and global velocity, but a decrease in velocity in the activated region. Additionally, the global flow increased (p=0.11) and connectivity decreased (24.7%) when compared to baseline. This multimodal approach allows for the study of the relationship between cerebral hemodynamics (30 ms resolution) and the microvasculature (14.6 μm resolution) using one ultrasound scan."
This substudy's objectives were to (1) examine the transferability of a four archetype framework (simplified pattern of prototypical features) for patients at high risk for opioid use disorder (OUD) developed from a previous study with a similar population; (2) explore how patient preferences for terminology can inform clinician communication strategies for patients with OUD across archetypes and (3) explore how patient perceptions of opioid risks can inform clinician communication strategies across patient archetypes.
"With the increasing prevalence of comorbidity in an ageing population, it is crucial to better understand the impact of comorbidity on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) after lymphoma or multiple myeloma (MM) diagnosis. We included 261 newly diagnosed patients (67% response rate) diagnosed with lymphoma or MM between October 2020 and March 2023 in a longitudinal survey. The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) questionnaires were used to measure generic and disease-specific HRQoL. Evidence-based guidelines for interpretation of the EORTC questionnaires were used to identify clinical importance. Patients were classified as having 'no comorbidity', 'mild comorbidity' (e.g. arthrosis or rheumatism), or 'moderate-severe comorbidity' (e.g. heart or lung disease), using the adapted self-administered comorbidity questionnaire. At diagnosis, the mean age was 64 years, 63% were male and 38% reported no comorbidity, 33% mild comorbidity, and 29% moderate-severe comorbidity. Patients with mild or moderate-severe comorbidity reported clinically relevant worse HRQoL at diagnosis than patients without comorbidity. One year post-diagnosis most outcomes showed clinically relevant improvement, irrespective of comorbidity. However, outcomes of physical functioning (β=-7.9, p < 0.05), global health status (β=-7.6, p < 0.05), bone pain (β = 8.1 to 9.1, p < 0.05), muscle/joint pain (β = 14.5 to 18.8, p < 0.01) and muscle weakness (β = 10.4 to 15.6, p < 0.05) improved less among those with comorbidity, and clinically relevant differences between comorbidity groups persisted over time. With clinically relevant worse HRQoL at diagnosis and less recovery of HRQoL during the first year after diagnosis in patients with comorbidity, consideration of both prognosis and HRQoL is important when making treatment decisions."
"Rates of cannabis use disorder (CUD) have increased disproportionately among Veterans Administration (VA) patients with psychiatric disorders compared to patients with no disorder. However, VA patient samples are not representative of all U.S. adults, so results on disproportionate increases in CUD prevalence could have been biased. To address this concern, we investigated whether disproportionate increases in the prevalence of cannabis outcomes among those with psychiatric disorders would replicate in nationally representative samples of U.S. adults."

"Acute altered mental status (AAMS) is often a challenge for clinicians, since the underlying etiologies cannot always easily be inferred based on the patient's clinical presentation, medical history, or early examinations. The aim of this study is to evaluate the role of electroencephalogram (EEG) as a diagnostic tool in AAMS of unknown etiology in children."
"Health disparities related to race, ethnicity, gender, level of education, and other social determinants of health remain prevalent in medicine and surgery. Understanding the impact of health disparities on treatment decisions and outcomes among common hand surgery conditions has been a major focus of the American Society for Surgery of the Hand. Creative strategies are necessary to go beyond the description of disparities and move toward the proposal of actionable solutions. Community engagement research is one feasible approach that can help hand surgeons narrow these gaps and improve health care outcomes. With this approach, hand surgeons can improve patient-provider communication, increase knowledge of specific hand conditions among community members, and help guide subsequent initiatives to improve access and usage of hand surgery treatment. Community members can take on various roles ranging from participants to partnered investigators, enhancing the overall process to identify actionable solutions with the end user in mind. Additionally, the creation of community-academic partnerships through community engagement research is an excellent way to dismantle the historical mistrust among underrepresented groups through the deliberate inclusion of community members in the research design and execution."

"Pain catastrophizing, or the interpretation of pain as unbearable or intolerable, can increase pain-related anxiety and severity. High levels of pain catastrophizing have also been linked to substance use, particularly for substances with analgesic properties. Importantly, behavioral treatments can reduce pain catastrophizing, making them promising interventions for mitigating pain-related substance use. The aim of this scoping review is to summarize literature investigating the relationship between pain catastrophizing and substance use in adults."
"The ocular tissue is one of the most densely populated tissues in the body with extremely small blood vessels, and vascular lesions have been reported to be a factor in vision loss and visual field defects in many ocular diseases. Currently, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-targeted agents are the first line of treatment for intraocular vascular lesions, however, there are some cases in which they are not fully effective. Therefore, we explored pathogenic molecules other than VEGF, aiming to develop new molecular-targeted therapy. Using an experimental pathological model mimicking intraocular vascular lesions, we found that B-cell CLL/lymphoma 6 member B protein (BCL6B), which has been identified as a Bric-a-brac, Tramtrack, and Broad Complex protein, may play an important role in intraocular angiogenesis and vascular hyperpermeability. In this article, we introduce the usefulness of suppressing BCL6B expression and discuss the possibility of drug discovery by targeting Notch signaling in chorioretinal vascular lesions."
"Music evokes strong and persistent emotional responses. However, the mechanisms underlying the emotional effects of music, particularly in older adults, are largely unknown. One purported mechanism by which music evokes emotions is through memory - that is, music evokes personal, autobiographical memories that then lead to emotional responses."
"The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered several challenges on the front of mental health. Undergraduate medical students face considerable stress in their academic routines. Thus, there is a need to explore the implications for the mental health of undergraduate medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic."
Affective modulation of startle reflex (AMSR) is a widely used experimental tool for assessing emotional reactivity. Previous research has shown inconsistent findings of emotional reactivity in amplitude in bipolar patients (BP). This study examined emotional reactivity (ER) in euthymic BP compared to healthy controls using both subjective and objective measures.
"Perioperative immunosuppressants, such as surgical stress and opioid use may downregulate anti-cancer immunocytes for patients undergoing pancreatectomy. Thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) may attenuate these negative effects and provide better anti-cancer immunocyte profile change than intravenous analgesia using opioid."
"Persistent latent reservoirs of intact HIV-1 proviruses, capable of rebounding despite suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART), hinder efforts towards an HIV-1 cure. Hence, assays specifically quantifying intact proviruses are crucial to assess the impact of curative interventions. Two recent assays have been utilized in clinical trials: intact proviral DNA assay (IPDA) and quadruplex quantitative PCR (Q4PCR). While IPDA is more sensitive due to amplifying short fragments, it may overestimate intact fractions by relying only on quantification of 2 proviral regions. Q4PCR samples 4 proviral regions, yet is sequencing-based, favoring amplification of shorter, hence non-intact, proviral sequences."
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is one of the most common and aggressive forms of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of the abbreviated Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (aCGA) in assessing frailty and predicting clinical outcomes in elderly patients with DLBCL.
"This article explores the role of optical coherence tomography (OCT) in neurology practice, particularly in diagnosing and monitoring conditions such as papilledema, optic neuritis, and retinal artery occlusion. OCT has been increasingly utilized as a noninvasive and effective tool for detecting and monitoring neuroaxonal damage in the visual pathway, which is important for early intervention and improved patient outcomes across a variety of neurologic conditions."
"In the past decades, Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy has achieved remarkable success, leading to the approval of six therapeutic products for haematological malignancies. Recently, the therapeutic potential of this therapy has also been demonstrated in non-tumoral diseases. Currently, the manufacturing process to produce clinical-grade CAR-T cells is complex, time-consuming, and highly expensive. It involves multiple steps, including the collection of T cells from patients or healthy donors, in vitro engineering and expansion, and finally reinfusion into patients. Therefore, despite the impressive clinical outcomes, ex vivo manufacturing process makes CAR-T cells out of reach for many cancer patients. Direct in vivo engineering of T cells could be a more rapid solution able to circumvent both the complexity and the costs associated with ex vivo manufactured CAR-T cells. This novel approach allows to completely eliminate ex vivo cell manipulation and expansion while producing therapeutic cell populations directly in vivo. To date, several studies have demonstrated the feasibility of in vivo T cell reprogramming, by employing injectable viral- or nanocarrier-based delivery platforms in tumour animal models. Additionally, in vivo production of CAR-T cells might reduce the incidence, or at least the severity, of systemic toxicities frequently occurring with ex vivo produced CAR-T cells, such as cytokine release syndrome and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome. In this review, we highlight the challenges associated with the current ex vivo manufacturing protocols and review the latest progresses in the emerging field of in vivo CAR-T therapy, by comparing the various platforms so far investigated. Moreover, we offer an overview of the advantages deriving from in vivo reprogramming of other immune cell types, such as Natural Killer and macrophages, with CAR constructs."
"The nuclear envelope (NE) is a double-membrane structure critical for genome maintenance and cellular function, composed of the inner and outer nuclear membranes. In fission yeast, the inner nuclear membrane (INM) proteins Lem2 and Bqt4 are essential for maintaining NE integrity. The study published by Hiraoka group explores the interactions between Lem2 and Bqt4 with lipid synthesis enzymes, addressing their roles in NE maintenance. The authors identified Lem2- and Bqt4-binding proteins using immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, revealing that Lem2 interacts with lipid synthesis enzymes, whilst Bqt4 binds to an enzyme that involves in glucosylceramide synthesis. These findings suggest that Lem2 and Bqt4 independently contribute to NE structure and its integrity through distinct lipid metabolic pathways, highlighting their complementary roles in nuclear membrane homeostasis. This study represents a significant step forward in the field of NE biology to unravel the complexities of nuclear membrane dynamics."
"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by oxidative stress have emerged as critical factors in the pathophysiology of malignancies. This study investigated the antioxidant and anticancer properties of zinc (Zn), selenium (Se), and silver (Ag) nanoparticles (NPs) against the A2780 human ovarian cancer cell line. Here, the bioinformatics approach was used to determine the top differentially expressed genes associated with oxidative stress. The ZnO-, Se-, and Ag-NPs were then synthesized via a green synthesis method and subsequently characterized using techniques, such as FTIR, XRD, DLS, zeta potential analysis, FESEM, and TEM. The antioxidant capacity of the NPs was evaluated using a DPPH scavenging assay and their effect on superoxide dismutase enzyme activity was determined. HDF and A2780 cells were treated with varying concentrations of ZnO-, Se-, and Ag-NPs, and cell viability and colony formation were assessed using MTT and clonogenic assays, respectively. Additionally, qPCR was performed to analyze the expression of the candidate genes NOX4, SOD2, and NR4A4. Characterization techniques confirmed the successful synthesis of pure, crystalline, and spherical NPs. Antioxidant assays demonstrated the significant antioxidant properties of ZnO-, Se-, and Ag-NPs. In vitro studies indicated that ZnO-, Se-, and Ag-NPs effectively inhibited cell proliferation and suppressed colony formation, likely owing to the downregulation of NOX4 and upregulation of SOD2 genes. Our findings suggest that ZnO-, Se-, and Ag-NPs may serve as promising anticancer agents for ovarian cancer and NOX4 downregulation and SOD2 upregulation can be proposed as oxidative stress biomarkers; however, further experimental investigation is required to elucidate the therapeutic potential of NPs and the early detection potential of biomarkers."
"Effective vaccines to prevent sexually transmitted Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) infection have eluded researchers for decades. However, recent studies of a promising vaccine in human trials, and emerging understanding of the complexity of the natural immune response to infection have provided hope for the eventual approval of a vaccine. This review highlights recent progress toward developing effective vaccines for Ct."
"Removal of the metaphyseal screw from tension band plate constructs after correction of angular deformity in patients treated with hemiepiphysiodesis has been suggested as an alternative to removing the plate and both screws. While this has the potential benefit of easier implant removal and reinsertion in the event of rebound, there is debate in the literature regarding the benefits and risks of leaving the epiphyseal screw and plate in place."
"Hemorrhage is the most common and dangerous complication after percutaneous nephrolithotripsy (PCNL). Therefore, this study introduces the management experience of bleeding complications in our center."
"Understanding the mechanisms underlying doxorubicin resistance in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) holds paramount clinical significance. In our study, we investigate the potential of STK32C, a little-explored kinase, to impact doxorubicin sensitivity in TNBC cells. Our findings reveal elevated STK32C expression in TNBC specimens, associated with unfavorable prognosis in doxorubicin-treated TNBC patients. Subsequent experiments highlighted that STK32C depletion significantly augmented the sensitivity of doxorubicin-resistant TNBC cells to doxorubicin. Mechanistically, we unveiled that the cytoplasmic subset of STK32C plays a pivotal role in mediating doxorubicin sensitivity, primarily through the regulation of glycolysis. Furthermore, the kinase activity of STK32C proved to be essential for its mediation of doxorubicin sensitivity, emphasizing its role as a kinase. Our study suggests that targeting STK32C may represent a novel therapeutic approach with the potential to improve doxorubicin's efficacy in TNBC treatment."
"Chili anthracnose, a fungal disease caused by Colletotrichum scovillei, is among the most devastating diseases affecting pepper (Capsicum annuum L.). Although WRKY transcription factors play important roles in plant immunity, it is unknown how WRKY gene family members contribute to pepper plant resistance to C. scovillei. Here, CaWRKY20 was found to negatively regulate pepper resistance to C. scovillei, which was demonstrated by virus-induced gene silencing and transient overexpression in pepper. Moreover, overexpression of CaWRKY20 enhanced susceptibility to C. scovillei in tomato. Additionally, our findings demonstrated that CaWRKY20 can indirectly regulate the expression of salicylic acid (SA)-related defense genes (CaPR1, CaPR10 and CaSAR8.2) as well as reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging enzyme genes (CaCAT, CaPOD and CaSOD) in response to C. scovillei. In addition, CaWRKY20 was found to interact with CaMIEL1 in the nucleus to regulate the defense response to C. scovillei in pepper. Furthermore, CaWRKY20 directly bound to the W-box in the promoter of SYSTEMIC ACQUIRED RESISTANCE DEFICIENT 1 (CaSARD1) and suppressed its expression, resulting in reduced resistance to C. scovillei. These results will clarify the mechanism by which WRKY transcription factors are involved in pepper disease resistance and can thus facilitate molecular breeding for anthracnose-resistant varieties."
"The ability of biological systems to withstand and recover from various disruptions, such as spontaneous genetic mutations and environmental damage, largely relies on intricate feedback mechanisms. We theoretically study the mechanical response of an epithelial tissue facing damage in the form of a circular wound. Our model describes a feedback loop between the generation of active forces in the actomyosin and tissue mechanics, described by the vertex model. While the exact dynamics of wound closure may be influenced by several biophysical mechanisms that interplay in a nontrivial way, our findings suggest that the closure may initiate as an active instability, triggered by a reduced myosin turnover rate at the wound's perimeter. We explore the interplay between myosin dynamics and the elastic properties of the tissue, elucidating their collective role in determining a wound's loss of stability, leading to the initiation of the closure process."
"Digital interventions typically involve using smartphones or PCs to access online or downloadable self-help and may offer a more accessible and convenient option than face-to-face interventions for some people with mild to moderate eating disorders. They have been shown to substantially reduce eating disorder symptoms, but treatment dropout rates are higher than for face-to-face interventions. We need to understand user experiences and preferences for digital interventions to support the design and development of user-centered digital interventions that are engaging and meet users' needs."
"Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) represents a significant health threat worldwide. However, there are deficiencies in large-scale epidemiological research focusing on these issues, especially among young women. We aim to examine the trend of IBD in young females globally."
"Understanding the risk factors of hypertension among women of reproductive age (18-44 years) is important for guiding health programs aimed at reducing the burden of hypertensive disorders in this population. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate predictors of self-reported hypertension among women of reproductive age in North Dakota."
"One of the key strategies to achieve the sustainable development goal by reducing maternal deaths below 70 per 100,000 is improving knowledge of obstetric danger signs (ODS). However, mothers' knowledge of ODS is low in general and very low in rural settings, regardless of local and national efforts in Ethiopia. Further, there is significant variation of ODS knowledge among women from region to region and urban/rural settings. Most studies are limited only to northern Ethiopia and focused on individual-level determinants. Thus, this study aimed to assess the individual and community-level determinants of knowledge of obstetrics danger signs among women who delivered in the last 12 months in the northern zone of the Sidama region, Ethiopia."
"Although surgery for pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is generally associated with an improvement in sexual function, knowledge on specific changes is limited."
"Whole-body vibration (WBV) has gained attention as a light-resistance exercise and can increase energy metabolism. The rare sugar D-allulose has anti-obesity effects that are mediated by the suppression of hepatic lipogenesis. In this study, we examined the anti-obesity effects of a combination of WBV and dietary D-allulose in rats fed a high-fat diet. Thirty-two male Wistar rats (3-wk-old) were randomly assigned to four groups: sedentary control (C), WBV (V), D-allulose (A), and WBV+D-allulose (VA). Rats in Groups A and VA were fed a 5% D-allulose diet, and rats in Groups V and VA were subjected to WBV using a vibrating platform during the 8-wk experimental period. Total abdominal adipose tissue was significantly lower in Groups V, A, and VA than that in Group C, whereas no differences were observed between Groups V, A, and VA. Dietary D-allulose significantly decreased the weights and percentages of carcass and total body fats, whereas the WBV stimulus significant reduced only the total body fat mass. We observed that both long-term WBV stimulation and dietary D-allulose intake inhibited body fat accumulation in rats fed a high-fat diet, which led to obesity; however, no synergistic effect of this combination could be confirmed."
"Intraabdominal adhesions increase the incidence and length of surgical complications. Many anti-adhesive agents have been used for this purpose, but no definitive solution has yet been found. Studies on the prevention and reduction of anastomotic leakage, therefore, remain up to date. This study aimed to determine the effects of Rosmarinus Officinalis extract on colon anastomosis as a surgical model, its antiadhesive activity, and its impact on wound healing in the laparotomy site simultaneously to facilitate the clinical application of Rosmarinus Officinalis extract."

"Detrimental effects of terminal heat stress could be mitigated by exogenous application of synthetic compounds by preserving cell membrane integrity and protecting against oxidative damage. A field experiment was conducted to test the application of seven synthetic compounds on wheat growth traits: (1) thiourea (20 mM and 40mM); (2) potassium nitrate (1% and 2%); (3) sodium nitroprusside (400 μg mL-1 and 800μg mL-1 ); (4) dithiothreitol (25 ppm and 50ppm); (5) salicylic acid (100 ppm and 200ppm); (6) thioglycolic acid (200 ppm and 500ppm); and (7) putrescine (4 mM and 6mM). These compounds were applied at the anthesis and grain-filling stages to enhance physio-biochemical traits and yield attributes of wheat (Triticum aestivum ) cvs GW-11 and GW-496 under terminal heat stress. The results indicated that GW-11 plants treated with 100ppm salicylic acid exhibited significant improvements (P ≤0.05) in canopy temperature depression, proline content, total chlorophyll content, and the membrane stability index. Compared with the control treatment, foliar application of 100ppm salicylic acid at both stages caused increases in grain yield (19.5%), followed by a 14% increase with 4mM putrescine. These yield improvements were attributed to higher grains per spike, more effective tillers, and greater 1000-grain weight, reflecting enhanced sink capacity and grain development under stress. Consequently, the foliage application of 100ppm salicylic acid at the anthesis and grain-filling stages is recommended to improve late-sown wheat productivity and reduce terminal heat stress."
Atrial fibrillation is an independent risk factor for the development of cognitive impairments. Regular coffee consumption has shown cognitive benefits in healthy individuals. Whether regular consumption reduces cognitive decline in vulnerable patients is controversial. We investigated the association in elderly people with atrial fibrillation.
"Protein phosphorylation is a crucial process in various cellular functions, and its irregularities have been implicated in several diseases, including cancer. Antibodies are commonly employed to detect protein phosphorylation in research. However, unlike the extensive studies on recognition mechanisms of the phosphate group by proteins such as kinases and phosphatases, only a few studies have explored antibody mechanisms. In this study, we produced and characterized two rabbit monoclonal antibodies that recognize a monophosphorylated Akt peptide. Through crystallography, thermodynamic mutational analyses, and molecular dynamics simulations, we investigated the unique recognition mechanism that enables higher binding affinity and selectivity of the antibodies compared to other generic proteins with lower binding affinity to phosphorylated epitopes. Our results demonstrate that molecular dynamics simulations provide novel insights into the dynamic aspects of molecular recognition of posttranslational modifications by proteins beyond static crystal structures, highlighting how specific atomic level interactions drive the exceptional affinity and selectivity of antibodies."
"There are many infectious factors causing the outbreak of hemodialysis infection, which may easily lead to the delay of investigation and treatment. This study aimed to develop an investigation form for hemodialysis infection outbreak (HIO), and to identify sources of outbreak in early stage."
"Family physicians in Ontario provide most of the primary care to the healthcare system. However, given their broad scope of practice, they often provide additional services including emergency medicine, hospital medicine, and palliative care. Understanding the spectrum of services provided by family physicians across different regions is important for health human resource planning (HHRP). We investigated the services provided by family physicians in Ontario, Canada using a provincial physician database and administrative physician billing data from 2017. Billing codes were used to define 18 general services that family physicians may provide. We then evaluated variation in the services provided by different physicians based on the physicians' geographic location (north-urban, north-rural, south-urban, and south-rural) and career stage (i.e., years in practice). Ontario had 14,443 family physicians in 2017, with most practicing in urban communities in southern Ontario and only 6.5% practicing in any setting in northern Ontario. In general, rural physicians provided a greater range of services than their urban colleagues. Their practices most often included clinic medicine, mental health services, emergency medicine, palliative care, and hospital medicine. Physicians in urban southern Ontario and those at a more advanced career stage were more likely to provide a narrower range of services. Overall, our findings have the potential to shape HHRP, medical education curriculum development, and clinical services planning in Ontario and elsewhere. Moreover, our results provide policy- and decision-makers with a basis for integrating knowledge of the specific clinical services delivered by family physicians into their future planning, with the goal of ensuring a fit-for-purpose workforce able to meet community healthcare needs."
"Spinal cord injury (SCI) can lead to permanent paralysis and various motor, sensory and autonomic nervous system dysfunction. The complex pathophysiological processes limit the effectiveness of many clinical treatments. Mitochondria has been reported to play a key role in the pathogenesis of SCI; while mitophagy is a protective mechanism against mitochondrial dysfunction. However, there is recently little drugs that may targeted activate mitophagy to treat SCI. In this study, we evaluated the role of 20-Deoxyingenol (20-DOI) in SCI and explored its potential mechanisms. We used a SCI rat model and evaluated the functional outcomes after the injury. Western blotting and immunofluorescence techniques were used to analyze the levels of mitophagy, apoptosis, and TFEB-related signaling pathways. Our research results show that 20-DOI significantly improves the apoptosis of neural cells after TBHP stimulation and functional recovery after spinal cord injury. In addition, mitophagy, TFEB levels, and apoptosis are related to the mechanism of 20-DOI treatment for spinal cord injury. Specifically, our research results indicate that 20-DOI restored the autophagic flux after injury, thereby inducing mitophagy, eliminating the accumulation of Cyto C, and inhibiting apoptosis. Further mechanism research suggests that 20-DOI may regulate mitophagy by promoting TFEB nuclear translocation. These results indicate that 20-DOI can significantly promote recovery after spinal cord injury, which may be a promising treatment method for spinal cord injury."
"Naming difficulties are commonly reported in the acute and subacute stages of recovery of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and across severity levels. Previous studies, however, have used samples of mixed chronicity (acute and chronic) and severity (mild and severe) and then aggregated data across individuals from these distinct groups. Thus, we have little knowledge about the persistence of naming difficulties into the chronic stage of recovery in individuals with moderate-severe TBI."
"Facultative parthenogenesis (FP), or asexual reproduction by sexually reproducing female animals, has been reported across several clades of vertebrates and is increasingly being recognized as a reproductive mechanism with significant implications for the genetic variation of captive and wild populations. The definitive identification of parthenogens requires molecular confirmation, with large genomic datasets necessary to accurately parse the parthenogenetic mechanism (i.e. endoduplication, gametic duplication, terminal fusion automixis, or central fusion automixis). Current methods for inferring FP from large genomic datasets are statistically intensive, require competency in R scripting for their execution, and are not designed for detection of facultative parthenogenesis or screening of large numbers of mother/offspring pairs, whereas small datasets (i.e. microsatellites) that can be evaluated visually lack the power to discriminate among FP mechanisms. Here, we present the user-friendly software program, ParthenoGenius, that uses intuitive logic to infer the presence and mechanism of FP from even large genomic datasets comprising many mothers and offspring. ParthenoGenius runs relatively quickly and does not require the researcher to have knowledge of R scripting or statistics. ParthenoGenius was tested on eight empirical datasets and in each case identified parthenogens (and parthenogenic mechanism when present) consistent with results of previous studies or corroborating evidence. ParthenoGenius will facilitate the rapid screening of large genomic datasets comprising many mothers and offspring for the presence and mechanism of parthenogenesis, improving our understanding of the frequency and phylogenetic distribution of FP across the animal kingdom."
"Severe acute malnutrition (SAM) is a severe condition causing bilateral pitting edema or signs of wasting in children, with a high mortality risk. An outpatient therapeutic program is recommended for managing SAM children without complications, but there is limited information on recovery time and its determinants."
"The 2022 mpox outbreak marked a significant shift in the epidemiology of this zoonotic disease, traditionally confined to Central and West Africa. With over 80 countries reporting cases, this outbreak was characterized by a rapid spread in non-endemic regions, leading to more than 70,000 confirmed cases globally."
"Tertiary lymphoid structures play important roles in autoimmune and non-autoimmune conditions. While many of the molecular mechanisms involved in tertiary lymphoid structure formation have been identified, the cellular sources and temporal and spatial relationship remain unknown. Here we use combine single-cell RNA-sequencing, spatial transcriptomics and proteomics of minor salivary glands of patients with Sjogren's disease and Sicca Syndrome, with ex-vivo functional studies to construct a cellular and spatial map of key components involved in the formation and function of tertiary lymphoid structures. We confirm the presence of a fibroblast cell state and identify a pericyte/mural cell state with potential immunological functions. The identification of cellular properties associated with these structures and the molecular and functional interactions identified by this analysis may provide key therapeutic cues for tertiary lymphoid structures associated conditions in autoimmunity and cancer."
"Interstitial lung disease (ILD) represents a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by inflammation and fibrosis of the pulmonary interstitium. Risk factors for ILD include various environmental exposures and identifying specific exposures offers a point of intervention for preventing disease. Here, we present several cases of patients who worked in the dry-cleaning business and have ILD or abnormalities consistent with early ILD on chest CT imaging. While this report does not attempt to establish causality, we hypothesize that exposure to the industrial solvent tetrachloroethylene may serve as a contributing factor given its links to epithelial injury, inflammation, redox imbalance and apoptosis. We hope that this report serves to not only inform readers of this possible connection between dry cleaning and ILD but also lay the foundation for additional studies examining the effects of tetrachloroethylene on the lung."
"The advent of digital wildlife cameras has led to a dramatic increase in the use of camera traps for mammalian biodiversity surveys, ecological studies and occupancy analyses. For cryptic mammals such as mice and shrews, whose small sizes pose many challenges for unconstrained digital photography, use of camera traps remains relatively infrequent. Here we use a practical, low-cost small mammal camera platform (the ""MouseCam"") that is easy and inexpensive to fabricate and deploy and requires little maintenance beyond camera service. We tested the MouseCam in two applications: a study of small mammal species composition on two transects across a barrier island and a study of small mammal occupancy along a subtle elevation gradient in a mainland forest. The MouseCam was reasonably efficient, with over 78% of all images containing a recognizable small mammal (mouse, vole, rat or shrew). We obtained an accurate estimate of species composition on the island transects, as indicated by comparison with both concurrent and long-term trapping records for the same transects. MouseCams required a smaller expenditure of personnel and transportation resources than would be required for live trapping. They also detected subtle elevation-related differences in species occupancy in the mainland forest for the marsh rice rat, with the species occurring at lower elevations in the forest. This is consistent with the typical occurrence of the marsh rice rat in marshes and wetlands. We also tested devices (barriers, runways) designed to reduce disturbance by mesopredators (e.g., raccoons). Adding an internal barrier to the MouseCam did not reduce use by white-footed mice, whereas adding an external runway did. We believe specialized small mammal camera-based sensors may have wide applicability in field studies of small mammal distribution, abundance and biology."

"The Shh pathway may shed new light on developing new cell death inhibitors for the therapy of ischemic stroke. We aimed to examine whether the Shh co-reporter SMO or its agonist halcinonide can upregulate Bcl-2 to suppress neuronal cell death, ultimately improving behavioral deficits and reducing cerebral infarction in an ischemic stroke model."
"This study describes the applicability of the fluorescence polarization assay (FPA) based on the use of FITC-labeled oligosaccharide tracers of defined structure for the measurement of active lysozyme in hen egg white. Depending on the oligosaccharide chain length of the tracer, this method detects both the formation of the enzyme-to-tracer complex (because of lectin-like, i.e., carbohydrate-binding action of lysozyme) and tracer splitting (because of chitinase activity of lysozyme). Evaluation of the fluorescence polarization dynamics enables simultaneous measurement of the chitinase and lectin activities of lysozyme, which is crucial for its detection in complex biological systems. Hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL), unlike human lysozyme (HL), formed a stable complex with the chitotriose tracer that underwent no further transformations. This fact allows for easy measurement of the carbohydrate-binding activity of the HEWL. The results of the lysozyme activity measurement for hen egg samples obtained through the FPA correlated with the results obtained using the traditional turbidimetry method. The FPA does not have the drawbacks of turbidimetry, which are associated with the need to use bacterial cells that cannot be precisely standardized. Additionally, FPA offers advantages such as rapid analysis, the use of compact equipment, and standardized reagents. Therefore, the new express technique for measuring the lysozyme activity is applicable for evaluating the complex biomaterial, including for the purposes of food product quality control."

"A plethora of studies has exhibited the effectiveness of using measurement-based care feedback systems within mental health services to improve treatment outcomes; however, patient gender/race and patient-therapist matching on gender and race remain relatively unexplored as predictors/moderators in feedback studies. We conducted predictor/moderator analyses focusing on the relation of gender, race/ethnicity, and patient-therapist gender and race/ethnicity matching on two outcomes: patient self-reported levels of (1) functioning and (2) trust/respect within the therapeutic relationship. We used data from a randomized controlled trial studying the effectiveness of a feedback system comparing patient-reported levels of trust and respect towards their provider (together with symptom feedback) in comparison to symptom only feedback. We found that men improved in functioning more than women when their therapists received trust/respect feedback compared to symptom only feedback (F[1, 902] = 9.79, p = .002, d = 0.21). We also found that dyads matched on race/ethnicity but not gender, and those matched on gender but not race/ethnicity, improved in functioning over time more than dyads mismatched on both gender and race/ethnicity and those matched on both gender and race/ethnicity (F[1, 897] = 8.63, p = .0034, d = 0.20). On trust/respect outcomes, we found a gender difference over time (F[1, 759] = 6.61, p = .01, d = 0.19), a gender matching difference by feedback condition interaction (F[1, 757] = 5.25, p = .02, d = 0.17), and a racial/ethnic matching difference on trust/respect scores over time (F[1, 785] = 3.89, p = .049, d = 0.14). Male patients showed an initial decrease followed by a steady increase in trust/respect over time while female patients showed an initial increase followed by a steady decrease. Gender-matched therapeutic dyads showed higher levels of trust/respect compared to mismatched dyads when therapists received symptom only feedback, but this difference was not apparent when trust/respect feedback was provided. Dyads mismatched on race/ethnicity improved steadily in trust/respect over time, but matched dyads decreased in trust/respect after an initial increase. Future research should focus on the use of feedback systems to enhance outcomes for patients with specific gender and racial/ethnic identities."
"Here we present a study that explores the feasibility, user engagement, and usability of an interactive system that involves the use of tangible objects with various shapes and properties to interact with virtual tasks designed for upper limb rehabilitation following a stroke. We evaluated five different types of interaction modalities, including three grasps modalities (power grasp, lateral grasp and tripod grasp) and two strength modalities. These were tested using five basic game-like tasks with a total of 20 stroke patients. High levels of enjoyment were reported, and the system overall was considered feasible. The usability mean score (63.3) was acceptable for a system still in development. Enabling the use of tangibles during serious games in rehabilitation settings can enhance the transfer of learning to real-world situations."
"Urban drainage system (UDS) plays a key role in city urbanization, where defective pipes can lead to seepage. Previous studies have identified the locations of defects in UDS using inverse optimization models. However, the unique optimal solution neglects uncertainty analysis, which may lead to misdiagnosis. In addition, the multi-point defect diagnosis has heavy computational burden due to high dimensional parameters space. To address these issues, this paper proposes a hybrid method that leverages the genetic algorithm (GA) to identify probable space, and then utilizes the adaptive Metropolis (AM) to provide an estimation of the posterior probability distribution (PPD). Firstly, a multi-population GA is employed for the maximum exploration within the model space. Then, AM algorithm is used to explore the final PPD of each pipe defect parameter. The metrics accuracy (ACC), Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) and mean absolute error (MAE) are used to evaluate the diagnosis performance. A synthetic UDS case with randomized multi-point seepage scenarios is used to validate the method. Results indicate that the proposed hybrid method is effective in diagnosing multi-point defect, with 0.91, 0.78 of the hybrid method and 0.87, 0.69 of the DiffeRential Evolution Adaptive Metropolis method for the ACC and MCC, respectively. Meanwhile, the diagnosis speed has increased by 32 %. The result PPD passes the 90 % confidence interval validation. The proposed method can provide effective uncertainty analysis to reduce misdiagnosis of the traditional method."
"As the presurgical size and anatomic location of non-melanoma skin cancer correlates to the complexity of Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS), patients are frequently asked to self-report their preoperative tumor size to aid in efficient scheduling and triage. We aimed to assess the accuracy of patient's self-reported lesion measurements prior to MMS by comparing patient's estimates of lesion size to the measurements taken by a Mohs surgeon. We conducted a retrospective chart review of 1,000 patients who underwent MMS and self-reported their lesion size at a preoperative telehealth visit. The patients reported their lesion size in one dimension (1D)/two dimensions (2D) or using a pencil eraser as a size reference. Patients demonstrated excellent reliability (intra-class correlation coefficient [ICC]: 0.916) while reporting their lesion size in two dimensions, and moderate reliability (ICC: 0.644) while reporting their lesion size in one dimension. Patients had slight agreement (κ = 0.178) with the surgeon's preoperative measurement while using a pencil eraser as a size reference. Dermatology practices must be encouraged to utilize telehealth to obtain presurgical size estimates from patients using 1D or 2D size measurements. By utilizing presurgical size estimates, surgeons can better triage and schedule patients to provide appropriate anticipatory guidance to patients and their caretakers."
"Adonis amurensis Regel et Radde is a remarkable and important spring ephemeral plant and gained considerable attention because of its remarkable medicinal properties. Extensive research has been conducted on its therapeutic applications, physical characteristics, flowering patterns, reproductive, cultural and molecular biology. However, there is a lack of comprehensive understanding regarding the metabolic changes associated with flower developmental stages. This study was designed to investigate the changes in metabolites and their interrelationships at five distinct developmental stages of A. amurensis flower: Flower Primordium (FP), Sepal Stage (SE), Perianth Primordium (PE), Stamens Stage (SE), and Pistil Stage (PI). High-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) was utilized to investigate and characterize the metabolites associated with specific flower developmental stages. The various stages of flower development exerted a substantial influence on both the quantity and composition of metabolites present, signifying significant changes in the types and quantities of metabolites throughout the developmental progression of the flower. Metabolite Set Enrichment Analysis (MSEA) and annotation via the KEGG database highlighted enriched pathways such as flavonoid biosynthesis and plant hormone signal transduction, which are crucial for flower maturation. The highest number of differentially expressed metabolites was identified between the SE and PI stages, emphasizing a marked appreciation in metabolite expression linked to the development of reproductive organs. Key pathways such as flavonoid biosynthesis and plant hormone signal transduction were markedly enriched, underscoring their roles in flower maturation and potential pharmacological applications. Our research not only helps us in understanding the metabolomic dynamics during the flower development of A. amurensis but also emphasizes the potential pharmacological implication of stage-specific metabolites. Identifying these metabolites can help targeted bioprospecting and optimization of extraction methods to tackle the plant's full therapeutic potential, particularly in the development of treatments for cardiac insufficiency, edema, and possibly cancer."
"Keratinocyte carcinomas (KCs) are commonly located on the scalp and often treated with excision with peripheral and deep en face margin assessment (PDEMA), with Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) being the most frequently used method. Resection of these malignancies results in wounds with a wide variety of sizes, ranging from small, sub-centimeter defects, to extensive, nearly complete scalp defects. MMS is often the preferred treatment for tumor resection and margin clearance, as it allows for maximal healthy tissue preservation and has the lowest recurrence rates. Multiple local flap reconstruction options exist, and the selection depends on the size and location of the defect. This review highlights the indications, typical locations, potential risks, and advantages of frequently used local flaps on the scalp, accompanied by artistic representations of each flap herein. An exhaustive list of the local scalp flaps discussed in this review includes single, bilateral, and triple rotation flaps, the pinwheel flap, the double hatchet flap, the triple rhomboid flap, both the unilateral and bilateral banner flaps with split thickness skin grafts, A to T flaps, H-plasty flaps, single and double bridge flaps, and the pacman flap. Inelasticity of the scalp inhibits tissue movement so flaps on the scalp must be designed to be much larger than flaps in most other facial locations. One of the greatest benefits of working with local flaps on the scalp is often the presence of hair-bearing skin which provides the reconstructive surgeon the ability to hide significant scars under hair-bearing scalp, and the ability to perform wound repair under local anesthetic immediately following tumor removal by MMS."
"CIC-rearranged sarcomas (CRS) are clinically aggressive undifferentiated round cell sarcomas (URCS), commonly driven by CIC::DUX4. Due to the repetitive nature of DUX4 and the variability of the fusion breakpoints, CIC::DUX4 fusion may be missed by molecular testing. Immunohistochemical (IHC) stains have been studied as surrogates for the CIC::DUX4 fusion. We aim to assess the performance of DUX4 IHC in the work-up of CRS and its expression in non-CRS round cell or epithelioid neoplasms."
"Cancers of the mesothelium, such as malignant mesothelioma (MM), historically have been attributed solely to exposure to asbestos. Recent large scale genetic and genomic functional studies now show that approximately 20% of all human mesotheliomas are causally linked to highly penetrant inherited (germline) pathogenic mutations in numerous cancer related genes. The rarity of these mutations in humans makes it difficult to perform statistically conclusive genetic studies to understand their biological effects. This has created a disconnect between functional and epidemiological studies. However, since the molecular pathogenesis of MM in mice accurately recapitulates that of human disease, this disconnect between functional and epidemiological studies can be overcome by using inbred mouse strains that harbor mutation(s) in genes involved in the disease. Most mouse studies have focused on the effect of asbestos exposure, leaving the effects of genetic mutations in the absence of exposure understudied. Here, using existing peer-reviewed studies, we investigate the rate of spontaneous MM among mice with and without germline genetic mutations, in the absence of asbestos exposure. We leveraged these published data to generate a historical control dataset (HCD) to allow us to improve statistical power and account for genetic heterogeneity between studies. Our Bayesian analyses indicate that the odds of spontaneous MM among germline BAP1 mutant mice is substantially larger than that of wildtype mice. These results support the existing biological study findings that mesotheliomas can arise in the presence of pathogenic germline mutations, independently of asbestos exposure."

"The study aims to explore Resveratrol (RES) as a potential therapeutic agent for Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a challenging brain cancer. RES, a polyphenolic compound with known benefits in various diseases including cancer, has shown promise in inhibiting glioma progression through its effects on the AKT signaling pathways. However, its limited ability to cross the blood-brain barrier restricts its clinical application in GBM treatment. This study seeks to enhance efficacy of RES by developing RES-loaded nanoparticles designed to improve penetration into glioma cells and potentially overcome the blood-brain barrier, thereby enhancing therapeutic outcomes."
This qualitative study explored the beliefs and values influencing healthcare providers' delivery of gender-affirming care (GAC) to transgender and gender-diverse (TGD) youth amidst current social and political dynamics.
"Medicinal plants contain bioactive compounds that have therapeutic effects on human health. Ophioglossum vulgatum L. is a representative species of the fern genus Ophioglossum that has anti-inflammatory properties as recognized in folk medicine. Herein, we performed a nitric oxide (NO) assay-guided screening in RAW264.7 cells to investigate the active components of the plant. We found that ophioglonin (OPN), a characteristic homoflavonoid of the genus Ophioglossum, is one of the bioactive components. Therefore, we performed a comparative analysis of the isolated compounds and found that OPN has effects similar to those of isolated dihydroquercetin and luteolin at the concentrations tested. The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of OPN were extensively validated using lipopolysaccharide -stimulated RAW264.7 cells, mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), and peritoneal exudate macrophages (PEMs). In vivo experiments with a carrageenan-induced mouse paw edema model further confirmed the anti-inflammatory effect of OPN. Additionally, we found that OPN and Ophioglossum vulgatum extracts inhibit the activation of signal transducers, NF-ĸB p65, IĸBα, ERK, p38, and JNK, consistent with the findings of pathway enrichment analysis. This work reinforces the anti-inflammatory properties of Ophioglossum vulgatum and indicates that OPN is a promising therapeutic agent for inflammation-associated disorders. Further clinical evaluations, including clinical trials, would be beneficial to validate the anti-inflammatory properties of OPN."
"Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA) is a powerful technique for studying nucleic acid and protein interactions. This technique is based on the principle that nucleic acid-protein complex and nucleic acid migrate at different rates due to differences in size and charge. Nucleic acid and protein interactions are fundamental to various biological processes, such as gene regulation, replication, transcription, and recombination. Transcription factors and DNA interaction regulate gene expression. Homeobox (Hox) genes encode a family of transcription factors and are essential during embryonic development. Understanding the specific interactions between Hox proteins and their DNA targets is critical for elucidating the mechanisms underlying their regulatory functions.This chapter explains the principles and methodologies of EMSA in the context of Hox genes. This chapter includes detailed experimental design, including the formulation of reagents, labeling DNA probes, preparation of nuclear extracts/recombinant proteins, and binding conditions. The step-by-step protocol has been provided as an initial reference point to help a researcher conduct EMSA."

"The recovery process following ischemic stroke is a complex undertaking involving intricate cellular and molecular interactions. Cellular dysfunction or aberrant pathways can lead to complications such as brain edema, hemorrhagic transformation, and glial scar hyperplasia, hindering angiogenesis and nerve regeneration. These abnormalities may contribute to long-term disability post-stroke, imposing significant burdens on both families and society. Current clinical interventions primarily focus on endovascular therapy, overlooking the protection of brain cells themselves. However, the use of bioactive materials in stroke management has shown notable safety and efficacy. By precisely targeting the ischemic site at a cellular and molecular level, this therapeutic approach mitigates ischemia-induced brain tissue damage and promotes site repair. This review examines the protective benefits of bioactive materials in reducing cell damage and facilitating nerve restoration in accordance with the pathophysiological basis of ischemic stroke. Enhanced understanding of ischemic stroke mechanisms has the potential to advance the targeted and efficient clinical use of bioactive materials."

"Novel calcium phosphate cements (CPCs) that can be resorbed into the human body need to be developed. One approach for improving bioresorbability is reducing the content of calcium phosphate in CPCs; however, this may induces difficulties in setting the cement and increases the risk of decay. Adding bioresorbable polymers to a liquid solution can shorten the setting time and inhibit decay during setting. A novel bioresorbable polymer, phosphorylated pullulan (PPL), was recently reported. The effect of adding PPL to α-tricalcium phosphate (α-TCP)-based CPCs was examined and compared to that of adding bioresorbable polymers such as collagen, chitosan, and alginate. Collagen did not significantly inhibit the conversion of α-TCP to hydroxyapatite (HA), and its combination with calcium phosphate decreased the setting time and suppressed decay; chitosan decreased the setting time when combined with calcium phosphate; and alginate inhibited the conversion of α-TCP to HA and contributed to suppressing the decay. In contrast, PPL slightly inhibited the conversion of α-TCP to HA; however, its combination with calcium phosphate decreased the setting time. Thus, selecting bioresorbable polymers can help effectively control the properties of CPCs."
"Machine learning and its specialized forms, such as Artificial Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks, are increasingly being used for detecting and managing gastrointestinal conditions. Recent advancements involve using Artificial Neural Network models to enhance predictive accuracy for severe lower gastrointestinal (LGI) bleeding outcomes, including the need for surgery. To this end, artificial intelligence (AI)-guided predictive models have shown promise in improving management outcomes. While much literature focuses on AI in early neoplasia detection, this review highlights AI's role in managing LGI and small bowel disorders, including risk stratification for LGI bleeding, quality control, evaluation of inflammatory bowel disease, and video capsule endoscopy reading. Overall, the integration of AI into routine clinical practice is still developing, with ongoing research aimed at addressing current limitations and gaps in patient care."

"The prevalence of mental health disorders among children and adolescents presents a significant public health challenge. Children exposed to armed conflicts are at a particularly high risk of developing mental health problems, necessitating prompt and robust intervention. The acute need for early intervention in these situations is well recognized, as timely support can mitigate long-term negative outcomes. Pediatricians are particularly suited to deliver such interventions due to their role as primary health care providers and their frequent contact with children and families. However, barriers such as limited training and resources often hinder their ability to effectively address these issues."
"The autonomic regulation of the pulmonary vasculature has been under-appreciated despite the presence of sympathetic and parasympathetic neural innervation and adrenergic and cholinergic receptors on pulmonary vessels. Recent clinical trials targeting this innervation have demonstrated promising effects in pulmonary hypertension, and in this context of reignited interest, we review autonomic pulmonary vascular regulation, its integration with other pulmonary vascular regulatory mechanisms, systemic homeostatic reflexes and their clinical relevance in pulmonary hypertension. The sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems can affect pulmonary vascular tone and pulmonary vascular stiffness. Local afferents in the pulmonary vasculature are activated by elevations in pressure and distension and lead to distinct pulmonary baroreflex responses, including pulmonary vasoconstriction, increased sympathetic outflow, systemic vasoconstriction and increased respiratory drive. Autonomic pulmonary vascular control interacts with, and potentially makes a functional contribution to, systemic homeostatic reflexes, such as the arterial baroreflex. New experimental therapeutic applications, including pulmonary artery denervation, pharmacological cholinergic potentiation, vagal nerve stimulation and carotid baroreflex stimulation, have shown some promise in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension."
"The COVID-19 pandemic had wide impacts and repercussions for the NHS in the UK beyond the acute medical sector. This qualitative study evaluates the experience of medical (4) and non-medical prescribers (7) plus other staff (2 recovery workers; 2 community pharmacists) involved in opioid substitution therapy (OST) in a southern English county during and following the COVID-19 pandemic. Remote contact and a shift to predominantly weekly OST pick-up were anxiety-producing for clinicians, especially during the first lockdown. Widespread negative consequences were anticipated, such as a rise in fatal overdoses, which largely failed to materialise. Some diversion of medication was noted as were negative mental health consequences of enforced social isolation. Following a hiatus, psychosocial therapies transitioned to fully digital and subsequently hybrid delivery before returning to in-person group work towards the close of the pandemic. Changing power dynamics between clinicians and those accessing OST services were reported particularly around the re-introduction of daily supervised consumption and associated surveillance. Implications for future OST service delivery and national clinical guidance are suggested by way of conclusions."

"Varicocele is a prevalent condition in the infertile male population. However, to date, which patients may benefit most from varicocele repair is still a matter of debate. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether certain preintervention sperm parameters are predictive of successful varicocele repair, defined as an improvement in total motile sperm count (TMSC). We performed a retrospective study on 111 patients with varicocele who had undergone varicocele repair, collected from the Department of Endocrinology, Metabolic Diseases and Nutrition, University of Catania (Catania, Italy), and the Unit of Urology at the Selcuk University School of Medicine (Konya, Türkiye). The predictive analysis was conducted through the use of the Brain Project, an innovative tool that allows a complete and totally unbiased search of mathematical expressions that relate the object of study to the various parameters available. Varicocele repair was considered successful when TMSC increased by at least 50% of the preintervention value. For patients with preintervention TMSC below 5 × 10 6 , improvement was considered clinically relevant when the increase exceeded 50% and the absolute TMSC value was >5 × 10 6 . From the preintervention TMSC alone, we found a model that predicts patients who appear to benefit little from varicocele repair with a sensitivity of 50.0% and a specificity of 81.8%. Varicocele grade and serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels did not play a predictive role, but it should be noted that all patients enrolled in this study were selected with intermediate- or high-grade varicocele and normal FSH levels. In conclusion, preintervention TMSC is predictive of the success of varicocele repair in terms of TMSC improvement in patients with intermediate- or high-grade varicoceles and normal FSH levels."
"Kangaroo mother care (KMC) is a care of preterm and low birthweight infants carried skin-to-skin contact with the mother's chest and breastfeeding when possible. KMC has been proven to reduce mortality and morbidity in these infants. However, research on KMC has been limited by significant variability and inconsistency in reported outcomes across studies. These discrepancies hinder the inclusion of KMC clinical research in systematic reviews or meta-analyses, reducing its research value, leading to resource wastage and raising concerns about selective reporting biases. A core outcome set (COS), which defines a list of critical outcomes, can help harmonise the outcomes reported across studies in the same healthcare field. Further, how these outcomes should be measured and/or reported is defined in a core measurement set (CMS). This study aims to develop both a COS and a CMS for KMC to standardise outcome reporting, improve the quality assessments in clinical trials and facilitate data integration. This protocol outlines the methodology for developing a COS and CMS for KMC."
"BACKGROUND Mondor's disease (MD), or sclerosing superficial thrombophlebitis of the veins of the anterior thoracic wall, is a rare condition of unknown cause that usually involves the superior epigastric vein, producing a visible and palpable Mondor cord. This report describes a 27-year-old Japanese woman presenting with left chest wall pain due to palpable and visible sclerosing superficial thrombophlebitis. CASE REPORT We present the case of a 27-year-old Japanese woman who presented with 8 days of left chest wall and upper abdominal pain. Physical examination revealed a firm, palpable cord in the painful area. Chest wall ultrasound revealed a tubular and anechoic superficial cord. Doppler imaging demonstrated normal blood flow surrounding the cord, with no blood flow within. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a subtle structure beneath the lower left breast skin and without breast or lung involvement. We diagnosed her as having MD, and she was treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Her pain gradually improved in 3 weeks and the cord disappeared after approximately 2 months. CONCLUSIONS Mondor's disease can be distressing and painful for patients. Clinicians should be aware of this rare and benign disease when a longitudinal painful cord is found in the torso wall. Pain relief and reassurance are typically adequate until resolution. In addition to ultrasonography, CT is also important for diagnosing MD. This report of a rare diagnosis of MD highlights the importance of accurate and timely diagnosis and investigating the patient to exclude superficial and deep venous thrombotic disease."

"Thiazole and isothiazole are types of five-membered heterocycles that contain both sulfur and nitrogen atoms. They have gained attention in the field of green pesticide research due to their low toxicity, strong biological activity, and ability to undergo diverse structural modifications. By incorporating thiazole and isothiazole groups into various compounds, researchers have been able to create a wide range of pesticides with broad-spectrum effectiveness. Understanding the relationship between the structure of these compounds and their activities is crucial for the development of new and highly potent pesticides. This review highlights thiazole and isothiazole derivatives with various biological activities and aims to inspire the development of innovative pesticide based on these structures."

"Atomic-level simulations are widely used to study biomolecules and their dynamics. A common goal in such studies is to compare simulations of a molecular system under several conditions-for example, with various mutations or bound ligands-in order to identify differences between the molecular conformations adopted under these conditions. However, the large amount of data produced by simulations of ever larger and more complex systems often renders it difficult to identify the structural features that are relevant to a particular biochemical phenomenon. We present a flexible software package named Python ENSemble Analysis (PENSA) that enables a comprehensive and thorough investigation into biomolecular conformational ensembles. It provides featurization and feature transformations that allow for a complete representation of biomolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids, including water and ion binding sites, thus avoiding the bias that would come with manual feature selection. PENSA implements methods to systematically compare the distributions of molecular features across ensembles to find the significant differences between them and identify regions of interest. It also includes a novel approach to quantify the state-specific information between two regions of a biomolecule, which allows, for example, tracing information flow to identify allosteric pathways. PENSA also comes with convenient tools for loading data and visualizing results, making them quick to process and easy to interpret. PENSA is an open-source Python library maintained at https://github.com/drorlab/pensa along with an example workflow and a tutorial. We demonstrate its usefulness in real-world examples by showing how it helps us determine molecular mechanisms efficiently."
"Falls pose a significant threat to human health and safety. Accurately assessing the protective effectiveness of fall protection products can significantly reduce the occurrence of fall accidents. This paper systematically reviews the types and risk factors of human falls and then discusses the current research status and future prospects of various test methods for human fall protection. A literature search was conducted in databases such as Web of Science, Google Scholar, and Scopus. This study focuses on experimental methods for human fall testing, simulation model experiments, and finite element simulations, providing an outlook on future development trends. In the discussion of three different fall testing methods, research indicates that human fall simulation testing faces limitations such as ethical concerns and safety issues. Although simulation experiments allow for multiple tests in a short period, the complexity and accuracy of the models may affect the reliability of the results. By integrating more experimental data, optimizing the design of human models, and incorporating finite element simulation technology, the scope of testing applications can be expanded, thereby improving the effectiveness of protective product designs. In conclusion, future research on fall protection testing methods should aim to establish unified international standards, which will enhance consistency and repeatability in testing, facilitating better comparison and evaluation of the effectiveness of various protective measures. Furthermore, the integration of more experimental data with real-world scenarios, the optimization of human models and test environments, and the promotion of finite element simulation technology will be crucial in enhancing the precision of protective assessments."
"The prevalence of substance use among young adults has been increasing in Turkiye. Probation as a form of execution continues to grow in popularity around the world, as it has the potential for more successful outcomes than closed institutional execution methods. However, in the face of changing societal and individual needs, the probation system must rapidly adapt to current public realities, especially with new approaches, including the use of purposeful physical movement for young adults who are obliged due to illegal substance use. These competencies are the ability to regulate emotions, manage social relationships, and make responsible decisions."
"Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is a malignant tumor with the characteristics of progressive advancement and high mortality rate worldwide. We aimed to explore the role and mechanism of helicase Lymphoid-Specific (HELLS) in LUAD. Bioinformatics databases were applied to predict HELLS and kinesin family member (KIF)11 expression in LUAD tissues. The expressions of HELLS and KIF11 before and after HELLS knockdown were detected by RT-qPCR and western blot. After HELLS was knocked down, the proliferative, migratory, and invasive capabilities of A549 cells were evaluated. Cell apoptotic level was assessed using TUNEL. Western blot was employed to evaluate the expressions of Akt/CREB pathway-related proteins. The interaction between HELLS and KIF11 was analyzed using bioinformatics databases, and testified by Co-IP assay. Results revealed that HELLS and KIF11 expressions were significantly upregulated in LUAD cells and tissues. High HELLS and KIF11 expression was correlated with the poor prognosis of patients with LUAD. Additionally, HELLS knockdown suppressed the capabilities of LUAD cells to proliferate, migrate, and invade whereas promoted the cell apoptotic level. Moreover, HELLS could interact with KIF11 and had positive correlation with KIF11. Furthermore, KIF11 overexpression partially counteracted the impacts of HELLS knockdown on cell proliferative, migratory, invasive capabilities, and apoptotic level in LUAD cells. Besides, Akt/CREB pathway was blocked by HELLS silencing, which was restored by KIF11 overexpression. Collectively, HELLS knockdown blocked Akt/CREB pathway by downregulating KIF11 expression, thereby inhibiting LUAD cell proliferation, invasion, migration, and promoting apoptosis."
"Ambulatory electrocardiogram (AECG) monitoring is an attractive method for objectively identifying atrial fibrillation (AF) symptoms by documenting simultaneous arrhythmia with symptomatic episodes. However, no study yet has evaluated this simultaneous symptom-rhythm correlation in patients with heart failure (HF). We aimed to measure the correlation between symptoms and atrial arrhythmia (ATAF) episodes among patients with HF and known AF using prolonged AECG monitoring."
"Ex vivo expansion of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) requires the maintenance of a stemness state while cells are proliferating. This can be achieved via exposure to UM171 which leads to the degradation of chromatin modifiers and prevents the loss of key epigenetic marks. However, the chromatin landscape varies across populations within the hematopoietic system and the effect of UM171 on self-renewal and differentiation potential of different hematopoietic progenitor cells is less characterized. To address this, we use the CellTag barcoding approach to track the fate of individual stem and progenitor cells during in vitro expansion. We show that, in addition to its HSC self-renewing property, UM171 specifically modulates cell fate of a precursor common to erythroid, megakaryocytic, and mast cells in favor of self-renewal and a mast-bias differentiation trajectory. This differentiation bias can be driven by pro-inflammatory signaling pathways that are activated downstream of UM171 and results in an abundant mast cell population that can be transplanted as part of the graft to populate mice tissues in xenotransplantation studies."
"The objective of this investigation was to identify parameters at initial contact that would predict the subsequent maximum ankle inversion angle during cutting movements. We conducted a secondary data analysis and calculated kinematics of 1,400 cuttings performed by 46 male soccer athletes. The movement task consisted of an approach run, followed by a pre-planned cutting movement. A linear mixed regression model was applied to predict the maximum ankle inversion angle during the first 100 ms of ground contact. The prediction was made based on six predictors that describe change-of-direction intensity and foot placement as found to be relevant in the literature. The model explained 62% of the variance of maximum ankle inversion angles. A change of the main predictors (foot rotation, cutting angle and initial ankle inversion) by 1 SD caused a reduction of the subsequent maximum ankle inversion angle by 2.6-4.4°. Regarding the intensity of a change-of-direction movement, cutting angle seems to have a higher influence on maximum ankle inversion angle than approach velocity. With respect to the individual foot positioning, the maximum ankle inversion angle can be reduced by increasing exorotation and eversion of the foot while shifting towards forefoot landing."
Mucormycosis is an opportunistic fungal infection which is associated with poor prognosis. Only a few antifungals are available in the arsenal against mucormycosis. The global guidelines for diagnosing and managing mucormycosis recommend high doses of liposomal amphotericin B (LAmB) as the first-line treatment. Isavuconazole is another potential treatment option for mucormycosis.

"A strategy to increase the transfection efficiency of chitosan-based nanoparticles for gene therapy is by adding nuclear localization signals through karyophilic peptides. Here, the effect of the length and sequence of these peptides and their interaction with different plasmids on the physical characteristics and biological functionality of nanoparticles is reported. The karyophilic peptides (P1 or P2) were used to assemble nanoparticles by complex coacervation with pEGFP-N1, pQBI25 or pSelect-Zeo-HSV1-tk plasmids, and chitosan. Size, polydispersity index, zeta potential, and morphology, as well as in vitro nucleus internalization and transfection capability of nanoparticles were determined. The P2 nanoparticles resulted smaller compared to the ones without peptides or P1 for the three plasmids. In general, the addition of either P1 or P2 did not have a significant impact on the polydispersity index and the zeta potential. P1 and P2 nanoparticles were localized in the nucleus after 30 min of exposure to HeLa cells. Nevertheless, the presence of P2 in pEGFP-N1 and pQBI25 nanoparticles raised their capability to transfect and express the green fluorescent protein. Thus, karyophilic peptides are an efficient tool for the optimization of nonviral vectors for gene delivery; however, the sequence and length of peptides have an impact on characteristics and functionality of nanoparticles."
"Budd-Chiari syndrome with obstruction in the inferior vena cava causes increased venous pressure in the azygous-hemiazygous system and paravertebral venous plexus, which is transmitted to the epidural venous plexus, devoid of the valves. It causes epidural venous plexus engorgement and venous congestion and may present rarely with low back pain or radiating pain. However, patients developing lower limb weakness as a complication of Budd-Chiari syndrome is an infrequent and severe presentation. Herein, we describe a case of Budd-Chiari syndrome with chronic inferior vena cava thrombosis in a patient in his 40s presenting with lower limb weakness, which improved after inferior vena cava stenting. In patients with back pain or lower limb weakness due to epidural venous engorgement and venous congestion, inferior vena cava occlusion secondary to Budd-Chiari syndrome should always be kept in mind, which can be treated successfully with endovascular stenting. Also, early intervention in Budd-Chiari syndrome can prevent permanent neurological deficits and the long-term complications of cirrhosis."
"Clinical practice guidelines are widely used in oncology to guide clinical decision making and inform health policy and planning. In recent years, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network and the American Society of Clinical Oncology, as well as other international groups, have developed resource-stratified guidelines to guide clinicians and policymakers on cancer diagnosis and management in settings with various levels of resource constraints. Current methods for developing resource-stratified guidelines rely heavily on supporting evidence originating from high-income countries. In this commentary, the authors discuss limitations of the existing methods to develop resource-stratified guidelines and offer perspective on ways to strengthen the guidelines and their evidence base. Pulling from conceptual frameworks in the health policy domain, the authors outline a more inclusive approach to evidence synthesis that seeks to integrate the growing volume of cancer research emerging from low- and middle-income countries. The authors also introduce a revised evidence framework that provides transparency into the generalizability of evidence within the guidelines. These changes have the potential to enhance resource-stratified guidelines and bring us one step closer to the goal of evidence-based guidelines that are appropriate for diverse settings and unique patient populations across the world."
"Patients at high risk of deep vein thrombosis are recommended to undergo lower-extremity ultrasonography to screen for pulmonary embolism (PE); however, there are few reports on whether this can effectively reduce the occurrence of fatal pulmonary embolism (FPE). This study aimed to assess the risk factors associated with PE and to investigate whether perioperative ultrasound screening of lower extremity veins in orthopedic patients can effectively reduce the incidence of FPE. We enrolled 137 patients with PE who underwent orthopedic surgery between 2013 and 2020. Patients were divided into survival and non-survival groups based on whether FPE occurred during hospitalization. Demographic and clinical data were compared between groups. Ultrasound screening was effective in reducing the incidence of FPE in orthopedic patients. Thrombolytic therapy and computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) were highlighted factors that protect against FPE. Coronary heart disease was found to be independent risk factors for FPE. Proximal thrombus associated with an FPE. Ultrasound screening of the lower limb veins should be routinely performed in orthopedic patients during the perioperative period. Prophylactic inferior vena cava filter implantation, thrombolytic therapy, and CTPA can be performed in patients with suspected PE to reduce its incidence."

"Voxelotor modifies hemoglobin-oxygen affinity improving anemia and reducing hemolysis in sickle cell patients. However, the impact of Voxelotor on fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels is unknown. We describe here variations of percentage of HbF measured by high performance liquid chromatography and mean corpuscular fetal Hb in a cohort of sickle cell patients treated with Voxelotor at Henri Mondor Sickle Cell Referral Center. Our data show a decrease in HbF levels in sickle cell patients after 6 months of treatment with Voxelotor, which is likely to be associated with an increase in the lifespan of red blood cells that are no longer prematurely removed from the circulation, particularly those with low HbF. This work raises the question of the risk of a rebound effect when stopping Voxelotor, which has a short half-life, during the time it takes to increase HbF."
"To investigate the potential of an MRI-based radiomic model in distinguishing malignant prostate cancer (PCa) nodules from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)-, as well as determining the incremental value of radiomic features to clinical variables, such as prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level and Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) score. A restrospective analysis was performed on a total of 251 patients (training cohort, n = 119; internal validation cohort, n = 52; and external validation cohort, n = 80) with prostatic nodules who underwent biparametric MRI at two hospitals between January 2018 and December 2020. A total of 1130 radiomic features were extracted from each MRI sequence, including shape-based features, gray-level histogram-based features, texture features, and wavelet features. The clinical model was constructed using logistic regression analysis. Radiomic models were created by comparing seven machine learning classifiers. The useful clinical variables and radiomic signature were integrated to develop the combined model. Model performance was assessed by receiver operating characteristic curve, calibration curve, decision curve, and clinical impact curve. The ratio of free PSA to total PSA, PSA density, peripheral zone volume, and PI-RADS score were independent determinants of malignancy. The clinical model based on these factors achieved an AUC of 0.814 (95% CI: 0.763-0.865) and 0.791 (95% CI: 0.742-840) in the internal and external validation cohorts, respectively. The clinical-radiomic nomogram yielded the highest accuracy, with an AUC of 0.925 (95% CI: 0.894-0.956) and 0.872 (95% CI: 0.837-0.907) in the internal and external validation cohorts, respectively. DCA and CIC further confirmed the clinical usefulness of the nomogram. Biparametric MRI-based radiomics has the potential to noninvasively discriminate between-BPH and malignant PCa nodules, which outperforms screening strategies based on PSA and PI-RADS."

"The outbreak of COVID-19, led to an ongoing pandemic with devastating consequences for the global economy and human health. With the global spread of SARS-CoV-2, multidisciplinary initiatives were launched to explore new diagnostic, therapeutic, and vaccination strategies. From this perspective, proteomics could help to understand the mechanisms associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and to identify new therapeutic options. A TMT-based quantitative proteomics and phosphoproteomics analysis was performed to study the proteome remodeling of human lung alveolar cells expressing human ACE2 (A549-ACE2) after infection with SARS-CoV-2. Detectability and the prognostic value of selected proteins was analyzed by targeted PRM. A total of 6802 proteins and 6428 phospho-sites were identified in A549-ACE2 cells after infection with SARS-CoV-2. The differential proteins here identified revealed that A549-ACE2 cells undergo a time-dependent regulation of essential processes, delineating the precise intervention of the cellular machinery by the viral proteins. From this mechanistic background and by applying machine learning modeling, 29 differential proteins were selected and detected in the serum of COVID-19 patients, 14 of which showed promising prognostic capacity. Targeting these proteins and the protein kinases responsible for the reported phosphorylation changes may provide efficient alternative strategies for the clinical management of COVID-19."

"This review article explores the relationship between hyperglycemia during pregnancy and the visual development of offspring, specifically focusing on refractive error. The authors conducted a comprehensive search for relevant articles in various databases and assessed the methodological quality of the included studies. The findings consistently indicate that hyperglycemia during pregnancy can have a detrimental impact on the structural and functional aspects of visual development in offspring. The intrauterine hyperglycemic environment appears to negatively affect the retina and lens, leading to refractive errors. In conclusion, there is likely an association between hyperglycemia during pregnancy and the development of refractive errors in offspring."
"The increasing cultivation of perennial C4 grass known as Miscanthus spp. for biomass production holds promise as a sustainable source of renewable energy. Unlike the sterile triploid hybrid of M. × giganteus, which cannot reproduce through seeds, M. sinensis possesses attributes that could potentially address these limitations by effectively establishing itself through seed propagation. This study aimed to investigate how 18 genotypes of M. sinensis respond to chilling stress and subsequent recovery. Various traits were measured, including growth and biomass yield, the rate of leaf elongation, and a variety of chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, as well as chlorophyll content estimated using the SPAD method. Principal Component Analysis revealed unique genotype responses to chilling stress, with distinct clusters emerging during the recovery phase. Strong, positive correlations were identified between biomass content and yield-related traits, particularly leaf length. Leaf growth analysis delineated two subsets of genotypes: those maintaining growth and those exhibiting significant reductions under chilling conditions. The Comprehensive Total Chill Stress Response Index (SRI) pinpointed highly tolerant genotypes such as Ms16, Ms14, and Ms9, while Ms12 showed relatively lower tolerance."
"Adequate intraoperative visualization is mandatory for implant application in pelvic ring injuries. Several fluoroscopic X-ray views are in practical use. The gold standard primary X-ray is the anteroposterior view of the pelvis. In addition to this view, oblique views for pelvic ring instabilities and acetabular fractures are well defined. Combinations of these views allow better identification of osseous corridors for screw applications. These corridors are based on the 3-ring concept of the hemipelvis. For pelvic ring stabilization the main osseous corridors include the retrograde and antegrade superior ramus/anterior column corridor, the supraacetabular corridor and the gluteus medius pillar corridor. The radiographic anatomy of these corridors is described in detail for screw applications with definition of image intensifier angulations, risk zones and corridor parameters. This allows for intraoperative safe implant application."

"Telomere repeat-binding factor 2 (TRF2) is a key component of the shelterin complex which guards the integrity of the telomere. Most of the TRF2 discussed previously was focused on the telomere, and relatively less is discussed on aspects other than that. It is proved that TRF2 also localizes to other potential G-quadruplex-forming sequences among the whole genome besides the telomere. Therefore, it may participate in regulating genes generally except for the well-known function of protecting telomeres. Here, we demonstrate that the N-terminal basic domain of TRF2 (TRF2B) can interact with the G-quadruplex formed by the 5'-UTR sequence of its gene. Subsequently, this interaction was identified as G-quadruplex-specific. Using a reporter gene system, we proved that the translation of the reporter gene was dramatically reduced, triggered by the interaction between TRF2B and the G-quadruplex. Altogether, we propose that TRF2 can be ""auto-regulated"" through the G-quadruplex formed by its own gene sequence. This finding indicates a potential feedback mechanism in the regulation of the TRF2 gene. Additionally, it suggests a common mode in gene regulation involving the cooperation of TRF2 and the G-quadruplex."

"Introduction: Cyanide poisoning, whether it be accidental or intentional, remains a significant danger to adults and children, especially in societies where agriculture is a primary source of income. We examined the clinical follow-up, complications, and results of cyanide poisoning cases that occurred after eating the pits and seeds of plants containing cyanide glycosides, such as apricot kernels and almonds. Methods: Between 01/01/2017 and 01/08/2022, 14 children aged 1-18 years who were followed up with a prediagnosis of cyanide poisoning in our Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) were retrospectively analysed. Results: Eight of the patients followed with a preliminary diagnosis of cyanide poisoning were female and six were male. The most common admission month was July (42.8%) coinciding with the agricultural season. The most common symptoms at presentation were weakness and fatigue (n = 7). In the PICU, 4 patients presented lip cyanosis; 3, altered level of consciousness. Vomiting, seizure, headache, dizziness and palpitatons were less frequent. Four patients were treated with hydroxocobalamin (Cyanokit®) as an antidote due to acidosis in their blood gases. All patients treated for cyanide poisoning were discharged. Conclusions: Cyanide poisoning should be considered in paediatric patients with suspicious findings, sudden loss of consciousness, increased anion gap acidosis and lactic acidosis. The history of eating the seeds of plants such as apricot and almonds should be investigated."
"Lipids are the key component of all membranes composed of a variety of molecules that transduce intracellular signaling and provide energy to the cells in the absence of nutrients. Alteration in lipid metabolism is a major factor for cancer heterogeneity and a newly identified cancer hallmark. Reprogramming of lipid metabolism affects the diverse cancer phenotypes, especially epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). EMT activation is considered to be an essential step for tumor metastasis, which exhibits a crucial role in the biological processes including development, wound healing, and stem cell maintenance, and has been widely reported to contribute pathologically to cancer progression. Altered lipid metabolism triggers EMT and activates multiple EMT-associated oncogenic pathways. Although the role of lipid metabolism-induced EMT in tumorigenesis is an attractive field of research, there are still significant gaps in understanding the underlying mechanisms and the precise contributions of this interplay. Further study is needed to clarify the specific molecular mechanisms driving the crosstalk between lipid metabolism and EMT, as well as to determine the potential therapeutic implications. The increased dependency of tumor cells on lipid metabolism represents a novel therapeutic target, and targeting altered lipid metabolism holds promise as a strategy to suppress EMT and ultimately inhibit metastasis."
"Infertility, defined as the inability to achieve pregnancy after one year of unprotected, frequent sexual intercourse, is a global burden that affects approximately 15% of couples, or 190-230 million people worldwide, who are trying to start a family. The male contributes significantly, directly accounting for 30-35% and up to 52% of total couple infertility, affecting approximately 7-8% of all men. This work aims to present, in a didactic and objective way, a standardization of the initial steps toward a thorough evaluation of subfertile and infertile men. We have focused on the evaluation of initial management, emphasizing the need for a comprehensive evaluation that includes a detailed history, physical examination, and semen analysis as the golden triple helix of basic evaluation of the infertile male. General and genital physical examinations are highly valuable due to the wealth of information they provide, from potential diagnoses to pregnancy prognoses. Comprehensive and quality-controlled semen analysis provides reliable information as a baseline test to evaluate the patency of the reproductive tract and to evaluate basic sperm parameters and fertility potential. However, it is not a fertility determinant and should preferentially be complemented with sperm functional tests. like biomarkers of oxidative stress, sperm immaturity and DNA fragmentation. Most cases of infertility require evaluation by a specialist in andrology, nonetheless the understanding and rationale of the initial assessment of the infertile male can be undertaken by non-specialists, thus improving the care and counseling of couples facing this troubling issue and avoiding unnecessary use of assisted reproductive technologies (ART) since most cases of male infertility can be treated and reversed by medical or surgical interventions, and the fertility status can be restored. The ultimate goal is to achieve natural pregnancy, the use of ART should not be the initial offered resource."
"Depression has emerged as a significant public health concern, with its prevalence fluctuating based on varying environmental and demographic factors. This study categorized participants based on altitude. A convenient sampling approach was used, and the hamilton depression rating scale-24 was used to assess depressed symptoms while gathering demographic information. A total of 600 Tibetan residents from the Dege area of Garze Prefecture, Sichuan, China, participated in the survey. The mean age is 56.81 years, males comprising 52.8% and females 47.2% of the sample. Of the participants, 41.2% resided permanently at elevations exceeding 3500 m. The results found that the weighted prevalence of depression in the area was 24.62%. Regardless of gender, the age group with the highest prevalence was 55-64 years old. Depression increased with age as well as gradually decreased after the age of 60. Logistic regression analysis showed that middle-aged (OR 2.86, 95% CI 1.69-4.82, P < 0.01) and elderly people (OR 2.27, 95% CI 1.30-3.98, P < 0.01), living in ultra-high altitude areas (OR 3.48, 95% CI 1.35-2.91, P < 0.01) and low BMI (OR   4.31, 95% CI 1.33-13.93) are high-risk factors for depression. This study enhances the understanding of the characteristics of depression in high-altitude regions of China, contributing to a more comprehensive view of the psychological well-being of residents in these areas. The findings underscore the need for targeted prevention and treatment strategies tailored to the specific needs of these populations."

"Aortic stenosis (AS) is a leading cause of surgical intervention in adults with acquired heart disease, driven by an aging population and advancements in diagnostic and treatment approaches. This study aimed to investigate levels of macroelements (Ca, K, Na, Mg, and P) in aortic valve tissues, serum, and epicardial fat in patients undergoing aortic valve replacement due to degenerative disease. Elemental composition was determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Analyses revealed a distinct accumulation of Ca and P in aortic valve tissues, not correlated to and exceeding that in epicardial adipose tissue, suggesting localized mineralization. Significant relationships between serum and aortic valve element concentrations were found, with serum K and Mg levels inversely correlated with Ca and P deposition and Ca/P ratio in the valve, highlighting their potential role as calcification inhibitors. Moreover, serum and valvular Na/K ratios were positively correlated. Furthermore, patient age was associated with increased Ca, Mg, Na, P levels, and Ca/P ratio in valve tissues, reinforcing age as a risk factor for valvular calcification. Creatinine and lipoprotein (a) levels correlated positively with valvular K content and Ca/P ratio, respectively, while high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration was positively associated with Ca, Mg, and P content in epicardial fat. Patients with increased transvalvular systolic pressure gradient revealed higher valvular Na content. Future longitudinal research should address mineralization across earlier disease stages, exploring additional trace elements and molecular contributors to advance understanding of calcification mechanisms, ultimately aiding in developing biomarkers or therapeutic strategies for postponing or preventing AS onset."
"Red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is considered to be associated with the prognosis of patients with severe infections. This study aims to investigate the relationship between RDW and prognosis in osteomyelitis patients admitted to the ICU. Through a retrospective cohort study, relevant records of severe osteomyelitis patients were collected from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) database. Patients were divided into low-level and high-level groups based on the median RDW. The primary outcome was the one-year mortality rate of ICU patients. Univariate and multivariate Cox models were used to determine the relationship between RDW and mortality rate in osteomyelitis patients, with hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) calculated. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to analyze patient survival status. Restricted Cubic Spline (RCS) was used to detect the nonlinear relationship between RDW and mortality rate. Stratified analysis was performed to explore the interaction between different subgroups. The study included a total of 1109 patients, among which 134 (12.08%) died within one year. Results from both univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses indicated a significant association between elevated RDW levels (HR = 2.128, 95% CI 1.324-3.420) and an increased risk of mortality in patients with osteomyelitis. Kaplan-Meier survival curves demonstrated that the survival time of patients in the low RDW group was greater than that of those in the high RDW group (p < 0.0001). RCS analysis revealed a non-linear increase in the strength of the correlation between patient mortality rate and continuous changes in RDW. Subgroup analysis also observed a relationship between RDW levels and mortality rates in patients with osteomyelitis. Elevated RDW levels are correlated with an increased risk of mortality in osteomyelitis patients admitted to the ICU."
"The aging process is a multifactorial biological phenomenon starting at birth and persisting throughout life, characterized by a decline in physiological functions and adaptability. This decline results in the diminished capacity of aging organisms to respond to environmental changes and stressors, leading to reduced efficiency in metabolic, immune, and hormonal functions. As behavioral flexibility wanes, older individuals face longer recovery times and increased vulnerability to diseases. While early research proposed nine core hallmarks of mammalian aging, recent studies have expanded this framework to twelve key characteristics: epigenetic changes, genomic instability, telomere shortening, loss of proteostasis, altered metabolism, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, disrupted intercellular communication, stem cell depletion, immune system dysfunction, accumulation of toxic metabolites, and dysbiosis. Given the growing interest in the aging area, we propose to add a new hallmark: impaired water homeostasis. This potential hallmark could play a critical role in aging processes and might open new directions for future research in the field. This review enhances our understanding of the physiological aspects of aging in dogs, suggesting new clinical intervention strategies to prevent and control issues that may arise from the pathological degeneration of these hallmarks."
"The goals of this narrative review are to review the literature on psychotherapeutic interventions for older adults with histories of child maltreatment (CM) and to examine the unique considerations for assessing, diagnosing, and treating older adults with CM histories."
"Because there is not a link between COVID-19 and pediatric hydrocephalus, the COVID-19 pandemic should not have altered the incidence of pediatric hydrocephalus or the rate of CSF diversion procedures or shunt failure. Therefore, hydrocephalus-related surgical volume should have remained constant. The goal of this study was to evaluate the rates of hydrocephalus surgeries in the COVID-19 era compared with the baseline pre-COVID-19 era."
"Sarcoglycanopathies (SGPs) are limb-girdle muscular dystrophies (LGMDs) that can be classified into four types, LGMDR3, LGMDR4, LGMDR5, and LGMDR6, caused by mutations in the genes, SGCA, SGCB, SGCG, and SGCD, respectively. SGPs are relatively rare in Japan. This study aims to profile the genetic variants that cause SGPs in Japanese patients."
"Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) potentially provides a cure for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who are unlikely to be cured with chemotherapy alone. Previously, human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched related donors were used exclusively, which made the procedure available for a limited proportion of patients. The introduction of high-resolution HLA-typing technology, innovations in immunosuppressive therapy, and improved supportive care measures have significantly changed the situation. Now, patients without a matched related donor have an ample opportunity to receive allogeneic HCT with the use of matched or mismatched unrelated donors, umbilical cord blood grafts, or haploidentical related donors. The outcomes of alternative donor transplantations have improved over the past decades, and the growth of unrelated donor registries as well as the donor diversification have enhanced the chance of finding a suitable donor. With multiple alternative donor choices available for most patients, the donor selection is becoming increasingly important. To discuss the optimal donor choice in case of unavailability of an HLA-matched related donor, this article reviews the existing literature of retrospective and prospective comparisons of different alternative donor transplantations in AML and discusses the current state-of-art modalities in allogeneic HCT using alternative donors."
"The presence of severely calcified plaque remains problematic in endovascular therapy, and no specific endovascular treatment strategy has been established. Estimating plaque solidity before the procedure may help operators penetrate calcified plaque with a guide wire. The aim of this study was to establish a method of measuring plaque solidity with noncontrast computed tomography (CT)."
"The sustainability of maize cultivation would benefit tremendously from early sowing, but is hampered by low temperatures during early development in temperate climates. We show that allelic variation within the gene encoding subunit M of the NADH-dehydrogenase-like (NDH) complex (ndhm1) in a European maize landrace affects several quantitative traits that are relevant during early development in cold climates through NDH-mediated cyclic electron transport around photosystem I, a process crucial for photosynthesis and photoprotection. Beginning with a genome-wide association study for maximum potential quantum yield of photosystem II in dark-adapted leaves (Fv/Fm), we capitalized on the large phenotypic effects of a hAT transposon insertion in ndhm1 on multiple quantitative traits (early plant height [EPH], Fv/Fm, chlorophyll content, and cold tolerance) caused by the reduced protein levels of NDHM and associated NDH components. Analysis of the ndhm1 native allelic series revealed a rare allele of ndhm1 that is associated with small albeit significant improvements of Fv/Fm, photosystem II efficiency in light-adapted leaves (ΦPSII), and EPH compared with common alleles. Our work showcases the extraction of favorable alleles from locally adapted landraces, offering an efficient strategy for broadening the genetic variation of elite germplasm by breeding or genome editing."
"Retroperitoneal robotic-assisted laparoscopic pyeloplasty (R-RALP) is the commonest urologic procedure performed in children, entailing retroperitoneal CO2 insufflation and lateral decubitus, whose effects on cardiopulmonary variables are poorly known. We, therefore, studied hemodynamic and respiratory changes due to CO2 insufflation and lateral decubitus in children undergoing R-RALP and their effects on regional tissue oxygenation. Between 1/2021 and 7/2024, children affected by ureteropelvic joint obstruction (UPJO) underwent a pyeloplasty by R-RALP at Necker Enfants Malades Hospital (Paris, France), using a standardized surgical technique and a lung-protecting anesthetic protocol aimed to prevent hypercarbia. Cerebral and renal Near InfraRed Spectroscopy (NIRS) were added to standard monitoring. Mean monitoring parameters and NIRS values were derived from the prospectively kept continuous reading at eight preset points and analyzed. 37 patients were prospectively included (21 males), with a mean age of 6.0 ± 3.9 years, and mean body weight of 22.5 ± 11.3 kg; 15 patients were operated on in Left Lateral Decubitus (LLD) and 22  in Right Lateral Decubitus (RLD). No different LLD/RLD time trends were observed for standard monitoring parameters and NIRS measurements. Conversely, EtCO2 was higher in the RLD group at trocars insertion (T4, + 3.3 mmHg), beginning of CO2 insufflation (T5, + 2.9), and 45 min after the start of the procedure (T6, + 3.1). At the same time points, Pplat was higher in the LLD group at T4 (+ 3.0 cmH2O); T5, (+ 3.4) and T6 (+ 4.7). During R-RALP, the combination of RLD and CO2 insufflation promotes hypercarbia, while LLD requires increasing Pplat pressures, potentially favoring lung injury and hemodynamic instability during prolonged procedures."
"Portal vein (PV) resection and reconstruction, which includes the resection and reconstruction of the PV and superior mesenteric vein, enable surgical removal of borderline resectable and locally advanced pancreatic cancer. Thrombosis of the reconstructed PV represents a major cause of early postoperative and long-term morbidity and mortality. No universally accepted standard for anticoagulation exists. This study aimed to assess early and late thrombosis rates after PV reconstruction with special regard to the type of PV reconstruction and anticoagulation regimen and to comprehensively assess thrombotic events and their clinical effect in patients receiving pancreatic surgery with venous resection and reconstruction."
"This study investigates the way theta burst stimulation (TBS) applied to the motor cortex (M1) affects TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs). There have been few direct comparisons of continuous TBS (cTBS) and intermittent TBS (iTBS), and there is a lack of consensus from existing literature on the induced effects. We performed an exploratory trial to assess the effect of M1-cTBS and M1-iTBS on TEP components."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is etiologically complex, with well-documented genetic and nongenetic origins. In this Review, we speculate that the development of IPF requires two hits: the first establishes a vulnerable bronchoalveolar epithelium, and the second triggers mechanisms that reprogram distal epithelia to initiate and perpetuate a profibrotic phenotype. While vulnerability of the bronchoalveolar epithelia is most often driven by common or rare genetic variants, subsequent injury of the bronchoalveolar epithelia results in persistent changes in cell biology that disrupt tissue homeostasis and activate fibroblasts. The dynamic biology of IPF can best be contextualized etiologically and temporally, including stages of vulnerability, early disease, and persistent and progressive lung fibrosis. These dimensions of IPF highlight critical mechanisms that adversely disrupt epithelial function, activate fibroblasts, and lead to lung remodeling. Together with better recognition of early disease, this conceptual approach should lead to the development of novel therapeutics directed at the etiologic and temporal drivers of lung fibrosis that will ultimately transform the care of patients with IPF from palliative to curative."

"Advances in diabetes technologies have enabled automated insulin delivery (AID) systems, which have demonstrated benefits to glycemia, psychosocial outcomes, and quality of life for people with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Despite the many demonstrated benefits, AID systems come with their own unique challenges: continued user attention and effort, barriers to equitable access, personal costs vs benefits, and integration of the system into daily life. The purpose of this narrative review is to identify challenges and opportunities for supporting uptake and onboarding of AID systems to ultimately support sustained AID use. Setting realistic expectations, providing comprehensive training, developing willingness to adopt new treatments and workflows, upskilling of diabetes team members, and increasing flexibility of care to tailor care to individual needs, preferences, lifestyle, and personal goals will be most effective in facilitating effective, widespread, person-centered implementation of AID systems."
"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a complex psychiatric condition significantly impacted by environmental stress and inflammation. Previous research suggests that stress-induced alterations in the blood-brain barrier (BBB) may allow pro-inflammatory cytokines like interleukin-6 (IL-6) to enter the brain, contributing to depression. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) is another prominent cytokine implicated in depression, but its role in the context of BBB integrity and stress-mediated depression remains unclear."
"Parkinson's disease (PD), characterized by death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, is the second most prevalent progressive neurodegenerative disease. However, the etiology of PD is largely elusive. This study employed the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) rodent model to examine the effectiveness of 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoic acid (1,4-DHNA), an aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) active gut bacteria-derived metabolite, in mitigating MPTP's motoric deficits, and the role of AhR in mediating these effects. Male C57BL/6 mice were fed daily with vehicle, 20 mg/kg 1,4-DHNA, or AhR-inactive isomer 3,7-DHNA, for 3 weeks before administration of 80 mg/kg MPTP or vehicle. Four weeks later, mice were assessed for motoric functions. Both 1,4-DHNA and 3,7-DHNA prevented MPTP-induced deficits in the motor pole test and in the adhesive strip removal test. Additionally, 1,4-DHNA improved balance beam performance and completely prevented MPTP-induced reduction in stride length. In contrast, 3,7-DHNA, an AhR-inactive compound, did not improve balance beam performance and had only a partial effect on stride length. This study suggests that natural metabolites of gut microbiota, such as 1,4-DHNA, could be beneficial to counteract the development of motor deficits observed in PD. Thus, this study further supports the hypothesis that pathological and mitigating processes in the gut could play an essential role in PD development. Moreover, this indicates that 1,4-DHNA's ability to combat various motor deficits is likely mediated via multiple underlying molecular mechanisms. Specifically, AhR is involved, at least partially, in control of gait and bradykinesia, but it likely does not mediate the effects on fine motor skills."
"The purpose of this quasi-experimental study was to explore the influence of an interprofessional simulation experience on student perceptions of interprofessional collaboration, as well as to explore the influence of the participant and observer roles on these beliefs. A two-session simulation experience was developed to engage professional students in the collaborative care of a patient admitted to a home health agency. To provide the simulation experience in a time efficient manner within the curriculum, students participated in two interprofessional teams of nursing and physical therapy students. Each team actively participated in the collaborative care of the patient in one session. In the alternate session, the interprofessional team observed the care of the patient, documented behaviors ideal for interprofessional teamwork, and provided feedback regarding the interprofessional collaboration and communication observed during debriefing. Observers in this study consistently improved their self-perceived comfort in working with others irrespective of the order in which they participated in the simulation scenario. The use of observers in simulation may provide opportunities for programs to integrate large scale simulation experiences in a time efficient manner to further engage students in active learning as a component of interprofessional education."
"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) presents a formidable global health challenge owing to significant morbidity, high mortality rates, and substantial economic burden. Recent advances in targeted therapies and immunotherapies have transformed NSCLC treatment, but efficacy varies across patients. Tailoring treatment to patients can improve outcomes and potentially improve cost-effectiveness (ie, value for money) as well. For NSCLC, cost-effectiveness must often be estimated using economic modeling, and estimates are only as good as the models. Existing cost-effectiveness models are not necessarily suitable for evaluating personalized medicines."
"Although there are a lot of studies examining the effects of different blocks for postoperative analgesia after video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS), the results are controversial."
"Minimally invasive molecular profiling using cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is increasingly important to the management of cancer patients; however, low sensitivity remains a major limitation, particularly for brain tumor patients. Transiently attenuating cfDNA clearance from the body-thereby, allowing more cfDNA to be sampled-has been proposed to improve the performance of liquid biopsy diagnostics. However, there is a paucity of clinical data on the effect of higher cfDNA recovery. Here, we investigated the impact of collecting greater quantities of cfDNA on circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) sensitivity in the ""low-shedding"" cancer type glioblastoma by analyzing up to approximately 15-fold more plasma than routinely obtained clinically."
"Home visits prior to inpatient rehabilitation facility (IRF) discharge allow occupational therapists to observe functional abilities among patients with stroke and address barriers that impact daily activities at home. However, home visits prior to IRF discharge are not standard practice due to barriers of time and cost constraints. We explored whether an access visit (visiting the home without the patient) could serve as an alternative to a home visit (with the patient) to anticipate functional abilities at home."
"Previous research has explored the associations between anxiety, depression, and academic burnout primarily from a variable-level perspective. However, there is limited understanding of which symptoms might play a significant role in anxiety, depression, and academic burnout among adolescents at different stages."
"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) continues to be a significant issue, leading to premature death or reduced quality of life. It's important to assess the current burden of COPD and its risk factors on a geographical basis to guide health policy."
"Salmonella enterica is a common foodborne pathogen that causes intestinal illness varying from mild gastroenteritis to life-threatening systemic infections. The frequency of outbreaks due to multidrug-resistant Salmonella has been increased in the past few years with increasing numbers of annual deaths. Therefore, new strategies to control the spread of antimicrobial resistance are required. In this work, we found that N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) inhibits S. enterica at MIC of 3 mg ml-1 and synergistically activates the bactericidal activities of common antibiotics from three-fold for ampicillin and apramycin up to1000-fold for gentamycin. In addition, NAC inhibits the expression of virulence genes at sub-inhibitory concentrations in a dose-dependent manner. The whole-genome sequencing revealed that continuous exposure of S. enterica to NAC leads to the development of resistance; these resistant strains are attenuated for virulence. These results suggest that NAC may be a promising adjuvant to antibiotics for treating S. enterica in combination with other antibiotics."
"The growth of patient and public involvement in clinical research highlights the paucity of literature on operational practices that ensure the success of large, patient-centered outcomes trials. The authors' objective was to identify tools launched by the Comparison of Intravesical Therapy and Surgery as Treatment Options for Bladder Cancer (CISTO) study team to determine their effectiveness in maximizing patient enrollment in this observational, pragmatic trial."

"The rapid proliferation of mobile social networks has significantly accelerated the dissemination of misinformation, posing serious risks to social stability, public health, and democratic processes. Early detection of misinformation is essential yet challenging, particularly in contexts where initial content propagation lacks user feedback and engagement data. This study presents a novel hybrid model that combines Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to enhance the detection of misinformation using only textual content. Extensive evaluations revealed that the BERT-LSTM model achieved an accuracy of 93.51%, a recall of 91.96%, and an F1 score of 92.73% in identifying misinformation. A controlled user study with 100 participants demonstrated the model's effectiveness as an educational tool, with the experimental group achieving 89.4% accuracy in misinformation detection compared to 74.2% in the control group, while showing increased confidence levels and reduced decision-making time. Beyond its technical efficacy, the model exhibits significant potential in fostering critical thinking skills necessary for digital literacy. The findings underscore the transformative potential of advanced AI techniques in addressing the challenges of misinformation in the digital age."
"Maternal stress is a potential factor affecting fetal growth, but it is unknown whether it directly affects fetal growth restriction. This study aims to investigate the association between pre-pregnancy maternal stress with small for gestational age (SGA)."
"Respectful maternity care (RMC) is a topic that has received increasing focus among clinicians, researchers, and the public in recent years. While clinicians recognize the importance of respectful care, patients report that they are not consistently receiving it. The Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses (AWHONN) created the RMC Framework, Evidence-Based Guidelines and Implementation Toolkit to provide nursing teams with the knowledge, tools, and structures they need to promote RMC. For true change to happen, the implementation of respectful care must be translated across the maternity care continuum, including in the NICU. This article shares a health care organization's journey toward respectful, equitable maternity care for women, neonates, and their families. This article outlines the AWHONN RMC Framework and the leverage of its components to promote RMC for neonates and their families in the NICU. The outcomes of these efforts are also highlighted."
"Antrodia cinnamomea ( Ac ), also known as ""Niu-Chang-Chih"" in Chinese, is a valuable fungus that has been widely used as medicine and food among indigenous people in Taiwan. Ac is rich in polysaccharides ( Ac -PS), making it a promising candidate for adjunctive therapy in cancer and inflammation conditions. There are two types of Ac -PS: general (non-sulfated) PS ( Ac -GPS) and sulfated PS ( Ac -SPS). This review highlights that both Ac -GPS and Ac -SPS possess immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer properties. Each type influences interleukin signaling pathways to exert its anti-inflammatory effects. Ac -GPS is particularly effective in alleviating inflammation in the brain and liver, while Ac -SPS shows its efficacy in macrophage models. Both Ac -GSP and Ac -SPS have demonstrated anticancer effects supported by in vitro and in vivo studies, primarily through inducing apoptosis in various cancer cell lines. They may also synergize with chemotherapy and exhibit antiangiogenic properties. Notably, Ac -SPS appears to have superior anticancer efficacy, potentially due to its sulfate groups. Furthermore, Ac -SPS has been more extensively studied in terms of its mechanisms and effects on lung cancer compared with Ac -GPS, highlighting its significance in cancer research. In addition, Ac -SPS is often reported for its ability to activate macrophage-mediated responses. Clinically, Ac -GPS has been used as an adjunctive therapy for advanced lung cancer, as noted in recent reports. However, given the numerous studies emphasizing its anticancer mechanisms, Ac -SPS may exhibit greater efficacy, warranting further investigation. This review concludes that Ac -derived Ac -GPS or Ac -SPS have the potential to be developed into functional health supplements or adjunctive therapies, providing dual benefits of anti-inflammatory and anticancer effects."
"Phospholipids (PhLs) are essential components of cell membranes, characterized by a hydrophobic tail and a hydrophilic headgroup. They play several roles in biological systems, including energy storage, protection, and antioxidant properties. PhLs are found naturally in foods such as egg yolks, milk, or vegetable oils. The composition and concentration of PhLs observed in these foods vary according to the analytical methodology applied, mainly in the extraction and sample treatment process. Analytical targeted approaches for characterized PhLs involve liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry techniques. These methods provide insights into the composition and content of PhLs in food matrices. However, there is limited research on using PhL profiles for food quality evaluation and authentication purposes. Untargeted approaches, such as fingerprinting, have the potential to assess the authenticity of food products by capturing analytical signals linked to the PhL fraction. This review focusses on recent analytical strategies used in characterizing PhLs in distinctive foodstuffs (eggs, milk, and vegetable oils). It discusses sample preparation, analytical separation, and detection techniques. The review also highlights the potential of multivariate approaches to incorporate information on PhL composition to assess the authenticity of food products, an area that has been largely overlooked in previous studies."

"Pear lace bug (Stephanitis nashi) is a significant herbivorous pest, harbouring a diverse microbiome crucial for crabapple (Malus sp.) host adaptation. However, the mutual influence of S. nashi- and plant-associated microbiomes on plant responses to pest damage remains unclear. This study found that S. nashi damage significantly altered bacterial community structure and reduced bacterial evenness in the crabapple phyllosphere. Notably, bacterial diversity within S. nashi was significantly lower than that in the environment, potentially influenced by insect developmental stage, bacterial diffusion stage and endosymbiont species number and abundance. Extensive bacterial correlation and diffusion effect between S. nashi and adjacent plant environments were observed, evident in a gradual decrease in bacterial diversity and an increase in bacterial acquisition ratio from soil to phyllosphere to S. nashi. Correspondingly, S. nashi significantly impacted the metabolic response of crabapple leaves, altering pathways involved in vitamin, amino acid and lipid metabolism and so forth. Furthermore, association analysis linked these metabolic changes to phyllosphere bacterial alterations, emphasizing the important role of diffusive phyllosphere microbiome in regulating S. nashi-crabapple interactions. This study highlights bacterial diffusion effect between insect and plants and their potential role in regulating insect adaptability and plant defence responses, providing new insights into plant-insect-microbiome interactions."
"Molecular dyes containing carbazole-based π bridges and/or julolidine-based donors should be promising molecules for intense SWIR emission with potential application to molecular bioimaging. This study stochastically analyzes the combinations of more than 250 organic dyes constructed within the D-π-D (or equivalently D-B-D) motif. These dyes are built from 22 donors (D) and 14 π bridges (B) and are computationally examined using density functional theory (DFT). The DFT computations provide optimized geometries from which the excited state transition wavelengths and associated oscillator strengths and orbital overlaps are computed. While absorption is used as a stand-in for emission, the longer the absorption wavelength, the longer the emission should be as well for molecules of this type. Nearly 100 novel dyes reported in this work have electronic absorptions at or beyond 1200 nm, opening the possibility for future synthesis and experimental characterization of new molecular dyes with promising properties for bioimaging."
"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, disabling neurodegenerative disease, leads to reduced quality of life. The increasing prevalence of MS around the world and its comorbidities increase its burden. Primary vasculitis subtypes, one of autoimmune diseases with different prevalence in different ages and genders, should be considered one of the important differential diagnosis in patients with MS. This study aims to verify the relationship between MS and primary vasculitis by conducting a systematic review."
"Glutathione reductase (GR) plays a pivotal role in managing oxidative stress, a process crucial for microbial virulence and adaptation, yet it has not been extensively explored in bacteria such as Avibacterium paragallinarum (Av. paragallinarum). This study examined the specific roles of GR in Av. paragallinarum, focusing on how GR modulates the bacterium's response to oxidative stress and impacts its pathogenic behavior. Using gene knockouts together with transcriptomic and metabolomic profiling, we identified an important shift in redox balance due to GR deficiency, which disrupted energy metabolism and weakened the oxidative stress defense, culminating in a notable decline in virulence. In addition, decreased growth rates, reduced biofilm production, and weakened macrophage interactions were observed in GR-deficient strains. Notably, our findings reveal a sophisticated adaptation mechanism wherein the bacterium recalibrated its metabolic pathways in response to GR deficiency without fully restoring virulence. Our in vivo studies further highlight the pivotal role of GR in pathogen fitness. Together, our findings connect GR-mediated redox control to bacterial virulence, thereby furthering the understanding of microbial adaptation and positioning GR as a potential antimicrobial target. Our insights into the GR-centric regulatory network pave the way for leveraging bacterial redox mechanisms in the development of novel antimicrobial therapies, highlighting the importance of oxidative stress management in bacterial pathogenicity."
"The COVID-19 pandemic has spotlighted the potential of in vitro transcribed (IVT) mRNA vaccines with their demonstrated efficacy, safety, cost-effectiveness, and rapid manufacturing. Numerous IVT mRNA vaccines are now under clinical trials for a range of targets, including infectious diseases, cancers, and genetic disorders. Despite their promise, IVT mRNA vaccines face hurdles such as limited expression levels, nonspecific targeting beyond the liver, rapid degradation, and unintended immune activation. Overcoming these challenges is crucial to harnessing the full therapeutic potential of IVT mRNA vaccines for global health advancement. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the latest research progress and optimization strategies for IVT mRNA molecules and delivery systems, including the application of artificial intelligence (AI) models and deep learning techniques for IVT mRNA structure optimization and mRNA delivery formulation design. We also discuss recent development of the delivery platforms, such as lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), polymers, and exosomes, which aim to address challenges related to IVT mRNA protection, cellular uptake, and targeted delivery. Lastly, we offer insights into future directions for improving IVT mRNA vaccines, with the hope to spur further progress in IVT mRNA vaccine research and development."
The effective deployment of rapid on-site cytologic evaluation (ROSE) requires the availability of a cytologist/pathologist.

This study aimed to determine the validity and adequacy of ROSE by pulmonologists (P-ROSE).
"A biologically safe, noninvasive method for visualizing bone and soft tissue relationships has been developed recently. Termed the ultrasonic transmission imaging system, its advantages include visualization of soft tissues in real time while motion is underway. The image can be correlated to standard x-ray films, but since no ionizing radiation is involved, repeated risk-free visualization of extremities for either diagnostic assessment or biomechanical studies is permitted. Resolution of 1 mm and a depth of field of 8 mm are adequate for visualization of neurovascular bundles, tendons, ligaments, bones, and joints. The image can be digitized and stored for later analysis on computer graphic systems. Pilot studies have correlated the ultrasonic anatomy of normal and abnormal living and cadaver hands with known anatomic structures. The benefits to biomechanical analysis include the ability to visualize and accurately measure in a noninvasive manner the in vivo changes of position of tendons and other structures during movement. These initial efforts indicate the growing diagnostic and analytic capabilities of this instrument."
"Buruli ulcer (BU) a neglected disease induced by the bacterium Mycobacterium ulcerans, predominantly impacts tropical and subtropical areas with its pathophysiology ascribed to the Mycolactone protein. Current antibiotics frequently prove insufficient to manage advanced or chronic ulcers and the rise of drug resistance presents a considerable challenge. This work aims to address these challenges by employing computational methods to identify therapeutic candidates from organic compounds, which may be developed into more effective therapies for Buruli ulcer. The Gas-Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (GCMS) analysis of the Thymus Vulgaris identified the 29 bioactive compounds as potential drug candidates having different medicinal properties. Out of the 29 compounds against the mycolactone protein, 14 compounds demonstrated a binding affinity higher than - 6 kcal/mol predicted through PyRx. Among all compounds, gamma sitosterol and borneol showed the highest binding affinity - 7.7 kcal/mol. The ADMET analysis predicted that the compound borneol crosses the PGP + through the Blood Brain Barrier and gastrointestinal tract without violating Lipinski's rule of 5 having high water solubility, and log p-value of 2.29. The molecular dynamic simulation was performed and showed the Eigenvalue of 1.332692e-04. The leads identified in the study have demonstrated encouraging outcomes with regard to their efficacy, toxicity, pharmacokinetics, and safety. Further experimental investigations can be conducted to evaluate their anti-bacterial activity, and their molecular frameworks could be utilized as a valuable foundation for designing new drugs for the treatment of Buruli ulcer."
Medication adherence in older adults is a growing concern and is a critical element in treating chronic diseases. This pilot study aimed to assess the impact of a mobile device reminder on medication adherence in those aged 60 and over. Initiating the mobile reminder proved to be beneficial in increasing medication adherence. The Adherence to Refill Medications Scale (ARMS) was used to measure medication adherence. The scale was used pre- and post-intervention. Results concluded that participants' medication adherence significantly improved using the mobile device reminder intervention. Positive outcomes with medication adherence were apparent based on participants' response in this pilot study.
"Antigen recognition by human leukocyte antigen (HLA) restriction is critical for an adequate antiviral response in both natural infection and vaccination. However, the overwhelming polymorphism of HLA, with nearly 40,000 alleles identified, is an important limitation for the global analysis of cellular immune responses and vaccine efficacy. In this narrative review, we included several immunoinformatics studies performed in our laboratory to circumvent this limitation. These analyses focused on studying the cellular immune responses restricted by the most common HLA alleles, and their role in vaccine efficacy. Computational studies validated experimentally, such as our laboratory has carried out, represent a useful, rapid, and cost-effective strategy to combat future pandemics."
"The trigeminal artery is a rare anatomical variant, representing an embryonic vestige of the anastomosis between the internal carotid artery and the posterior circulator system, that can be asymptomatic or could have vast clinical manifestations produced by insufficient flow or by vascular nervous conflicts.

"Photic phenomena are more pronounced in presbyopia-corrected than in monofocal intraocular lens (IOL), causing dissatisfaction after cataract surgery. Photic Phenomena Test (PPT) quantifies photic phenomena in eyes with two types of presbyopia-corrected IOL. We examined the relationship between preoperative eye shape and pupil diameter. We included patients with PanOptix IOLs (PanOptix group, n = 38; 65.7 ± 9.2 years old) and Synergy IOLs (Synergy group, n = 39; 61.9 ± 9.6 years old), who underwent the PPT between 1 and 3 months after cataract surgery, from January 2021 to April 2023. The relationships between age, sex, pupil diameter, and higher-order corneal aberrations were examined and mean values for PPT measurements were compared between the groups. There was no difference in glare between the two groups. The halo was larger and thicker, and the starburst was larger and stronger in the Synergy group (P < 0.01). Postoperative halo brightness was positively correlated with the corneal coma aberration in the PanOptix group (P < 0.05). The Synergy group showed a positive correlation between the size and brightness of the postoperative halo and starburst and pupil diameter (P < 0.01). PPT, thus, revealed risk factors in eyes with two types of presbyopia-corrected IOL, which can be examined before cataract surgery to provide critical information for IOL selection."
"CXCL13 is a chemokine which is upregulated within the CNS in multiple sclerosis, Lyme neuroborreliosis, and other inflammatory diseases and is increasingly clinically useful as a biomarker. This review provides background for understanding its function in the immune system and its relationship to ectopic lymphoid follicles.

"Tirofiban plus recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) shows good efficacy and safety in treating acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients, but there is a lack of comprehensive assessment. This meta-analysis aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of rtPA plus tirofiban with rtPA alone in AIS patients."
"A new fusidic acid-loaded hydrogel film was prepared via the solvent casting technique using alginate and Aloe vera. The hydrogel films were optimized using different ratios of sodium alginate, Aloe vera, and glycerin. The films containing 10% glycerin (w/w of alginate) exhibited the best appearance. Incorporating Aloe vera influenced the thickness, swelling behavior, water vapor permeability, and drug release profile of the hydrogel films. Higher Aloe vera content resulted in thicker films (up to a certain ratio), increased swelling, reduced water vapor permeability, and a prolonged drug release of up to 93% over 12 h. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis confirmed the presence of key functional groups and the interaction between the hydrogel components. The study suggests that the combination of sodium alginate, Aloe vera, and glycerin can improve the mechanical properties and drug release profiles of hydrogel films, making them a promising option for enhanced topical drug delivery and wound healing applications."

"The diagnosis of neurological diseases can be expensive, invasive, and inaccurate, as it is often difficult to distinguish between different types of diseases with similar motor symptoms. However, the dysregulation of miRNAs can be used to create a robust machine-learning model for a reliable diagnosis of neurological diseases. We used miRNA sequence descriptors and gene target data to create machine-learning models that can be used as diagnostic tools. The top-performing machine-learning models, trained on filtered miRNA datasets for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Diseases of this research yielded 94, 97, and 96, percent accuracies, respectively. Analysis of dysregulated miRNA in neurological diseases elucidated novel biomarkers that could be used to diagnose and distinguish between the diseases. Machine-learning models developed using sequence and gene target descriptors of miRNA biomarkers can achieve favorable accuracies for disease classification and attain a robust discerning capability of neurological diseases."
"Lead is a ubiquitous and neurotoxic heavy metal particularly harmful to children, who are more susceptible than adults to its toxic effects. The prevalence of lead poisoning and iron deficiency (ID) is high in socioeconomically vulnerable child populations, negatively affecting neurocognitive development in children. Although numerous studies have shown the association between blood lead levels (BLL) and ID, the issue remains controversial. Here, we aimed to identify the association between BLL and iron nutritional status in children. We conducted an analytical cross-sectional study of healthy children aged 1-6 y attending periodic health checks in primary healthcare units from La Plata and its surroundings, Buenos Aires, Argentina, between 2012 and 2017. We performed anthropometric evaluations and determined BLL, hemoglobin (Hb) and serum ferritin levels. Blood lead levels ≥ 5 µg/dL were defined as elevated BLL; ferritin levels < 12 ng/ml were considered ID; Hb levels < 11 g/dL (< 11.5 g/dL for children ≥ 5 y) were defined as anemia. Data were analysed using Mann Whitney test, Student´s t-test, chi-square test and logistic regression. The R package (v. 4.2.2.) was used for the statistical analysis of data. The sample included 392 children (mean age, 2.4 ± 1.4 y; 44.6% females). The prevalence of elevated BLL, ID and anemia was 8.7%, 26.3% and 31.8%, respectively. We found a significant association between elevated BLL and ID (odds ratio [OR], 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.16 (1.50, 6.63)). The prevalence of elevated BLL was 16.2% and 5.8% in children with and without ID, respectively (p = 0.003). We also found association between elevated BLL and anemia (OR 95% CI: 3.03 (1.49, 6.29)). In conclusion, blood lead levels ≥ 5 µg/dL were significantly associated with ID and anemia in children aged 1-6 years."
"In recent decades, affirmative actions have enabled Indigenous people to access medical school, historically occupied by white people with high family incomes. This research analyzed experiences of otherness by Indigenous people in federal medical schools. This qualitative, exploratory study adopted interviews and conversation circles, with the participation of 40 students from 15 courses. We established four categories of analysis: encounter between ""strangers"" and the medical school; differences and inequalities; relationships with students and teachers; and conflicts and transformations. We noticed that medical schools are unwelcoming to Indigenous people, with racism, intolerance, and tutelage, when their differences become inequalities, resulting from structural processes in these Brazilian institutions. The Indigenous presence in medical courses reveals social inequalities, causes conflicts, and initial transformations, pointing out paths for plurality and social justice, and possibilities for medical education with visibility and actions for the health of Indigenous peoples."
Ovarian Cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death among women worldwide and the therapeutic landscape to treat it is constantly evolving. One of the major points of decision for the treatment choice is the presence of some genomic alterations that could confer sensitivity to the new available therapies including inhibitors of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARPi) with BRCA1 and 2 genes playing the most important role.
The purpose of this study was to biomechanically evaluate the stability of the 6.5 mm intramedullary (IM) olecranon screw compared to locking compression plate fixation for Orthopedic Trauma Association/AO Foundation (OTA/AO) 2U1B1 olecranon fractures under cyclic range of motion of the elbow.
"Nanomedicine is an interdisciplinary area that utilizes nanoscience and technology in the realm of medicine. Rapid advances in science and technology have propelled the medical sector into a new era. The most commonly used nanotechnology in the field of medicine is nanoparticles. Due to their unique physicochemical properties, nanoparticles offer significant benefits of precision medicine for diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease that cannot be effectively treated by existing approaches. Nanomedicine has emerged as a highly active research field, with extensive scientific and technological studies being carried out, as well as growing international competition in the commercialization of this field. The accumulation of expertise in the key technologies relating to nanomedicine would provide strategic advantages in the development of cutting-edge medical techniques. This review presented a comprehensive analysis of the primary uses of nanoparticles in medicine, including recent advances in their application for the diagnosis and treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. Furthermore, we discussed the challenges and possibilities associated with the application of nanoparticles in clinical settings."
"Virtual reality (VR) has been used in research and clinical practice in the management of Parkinson's disease (PD), potentially enhancing physiotherapy. Adverse events (AEs) associated with VR applications in PD have been poorly explored. We conducted a randomized controlled trial to compare two 12-week interventions using physiotherapy and immersive VR, and analyzed the frequency and type of AEs occurring in 30 people with PD. We reported 144 AEs (8.4% of the sessions), predominantly classified as mild and unrelated to the interventions. Two were serious AEs, one leading to study discontinuation. Notably, discomfort/pain, motor fluctuations, and falls were the most frequently reported, accounting for 63% of the total AEs. Five falls were definitely associated with the 'sense of presence' provided by the fully immersive VR system, which underscores the necessity for careful game selection when designing interventions for PD. Motor fluctuations may have been associated with various factors, which merit further investigation. We also explored the role of SSQ as a measure of cybersickness in PD. In conclusion, it is important to closely monitor and characterize AEs to ensure safety and efficacy in clinical practice as AEs may be more common than previously recognized in VR interventions in PD."

"The application of face recognition technology in Library Access Control System (LACS) has an important impact on improving the security and management efficiency of the library. However, the traditional face recognition methods have some limitations in the face of complex environmental conditions such as illumination and posture change. To solve this problem, an improved method combining the Aggregating Spatial Embeddings for Face Recognition (ASEF) algorithm and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is proposed. The PCA algorithm is optimized by introducing beta prior and full probability Bayesian model. In addition, the research also integrates K-means Clustering Algorithm (KA) to further improve the accuracy and efficiency of face recognition. The experiment showed that the improved PCA method had an average recognition rate of 92.6%, an average recognition speed of 0.40s, and higher accuracy compared to other related methods, reaching 96%. In practical applications, the system quickly and accurately completes the identification of personnel entry and exit, and improves the efficiency and security of library access management."

"Humans rarely speak without producing co-speech gestures of the hands, head, and other parts of the body. Co-speech gestures are also highly restricted in how they are timed with speech, typically synchronizing with prosodically-prominent syllables. What functional principles underlie this relationship? Here, we examine how the production of co-speech manual gestures influences spatiotemporal patterns of the oral articulators during speech production. We provide novel evidence that words uttered with accompanying co-speech gestures are produced with more extreme tongue and jaw displacement, and that presence of a co-speech gesture contributes to greater temporal stability of oral articulatory movements. This effect-which we term coupling enhancement-differs from stress-based hyperarticulation in that differences in articulatory magnitude are not vowel-specific in their patterning. Speech and gesture synergies therefore constitute an independent variable to consider when modeling the effects of prosodic prominence on articulatory patterns. Our results are consistent with work in language acquisition and speech-motor control suggesting that synchronizing speech to gesture can entrain acoustic prominence."
"Human T follicular helper (Tfh) cells play a crucial role in orchestrating B cell differentiation, maturation, and immunoglobulin class switching. Recent studies have underscored the presence of Bcl-6 + Tfh cells not only in secondary lymphoid organs but also within tertiary lymphoid structures at inflammatory sites, emphasizing their pivotal role in disease pathogenesis. Furthermore, Tfh cells have been found to transit between lesion sites, lymph nodes, and peripheral blood, as revealed by T cell receptor repertoire analysis. Among Tfh subsets, Tfh2 cells have emerged as central orchestrators in driving the production of IgE and IgG4 from B cells. Their critical role in diseases such as allergy, malignancy, and IgG4-related disease highlights their profound impact on balancing inflammation and immune tolerance. Our current review provides the molecular characteristics of human Tfh cells, the differentiation pathways of Tfh subsets, mechanisms by which Tfh subsets induce IgE and IgG4 production, and their clinical implications in allergy, malignancy, and IgG4-related disease."
"Object exploration is considered a driver of motor, cognitive, and social development. However, little is known about how early childhood education and care settings facilitate object exploration. This study examined if children's exploration of objects during free play was facilitated by the use of particular spatial components (floor, tables, and activity centers) and types of play (solitary, social, and parallel). Participants were 61 children (aged 11 to 48 months and 50.8% boys, socioeconomic levels representative of the Dutch population). Intraindividual variability in children's object exploration was predicted by the use of particular spatial components and the social setting, with small-to-medium effect sizes. Solitary and parallel play were positively associated with complex object exploration, especially when sitting or standing at child-height tables. During social play, object exploration was mostly absent."
"Relapse and metastasis are the major challenges that stand in the way of cancer healing and survival, mainly attributed to cancer stem cells (CSCs). Their capabilities of self-renewal and tumorigenic potential leads to treatment resistance development. CSCs function through signaling pathways such as the Wnt/β-catenin cascade. While commonly involved in embryogenesis and adult tissues homeostasis, the dysregulation of the Wnt pathway has direct correlations with tumorigenesis, metastasis, and drug resistance. The development of therapies that target CSCs and bulk tumors is both crucial and urgent. However, the extensive crosstalk present between Wnt and other signaling networks (Hedgehog and Notch) complicates the development of efficient long-term therapies with minimal side-effects on normal tissues. Despite the obstacles, the emergence of Wnt inhibitors and subsequent modulation of the signaling pathways would provide dynamic therapeutic approaches to impairing CSCs and reversing resistance mechanisms."
"This article explores the cardiovascular effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), with a particular focus on their impact on lipid profiles.

"Tendon injuries present significant medical, social, and economic challenges globally. Despite advancements in tendon injury repair techniques, outcomes remain suboptimal due to inferior tissue quality and functionality. Tissue engineering offers a promising avenue for tendon regeneration, with biocompatible scaffolds playing a crucial role. Ostrich eggshell membrane (ESM), characterized by a strong preferential orientation of calcite crystals, forms a semipermeable polymer network with excellent mechanical properties compared to membranes from other bird species, emerging as a potential natural scaffold candidate. Coupled with platelet-rich plasma (PRP), known for its regenerative properties, ESM holds promise for improving tendon repair. This study aims to evaluate the biocompatibility and efficacy of an ESM-PRP scaffold in treating Achilles tendon ruptures, employing in vitro and in vivo assessments to gauge its potential in tendon regeneration in living organisms. Ostrich ESM was prepared from pathogen-free ostrich eggs, sterilized with UV radiation and prepared in desired dimensions before implantation (1.5 × 1 cm). High-resolution scanning electron microscopy (HRSEM) was utilized to visualize the sample morphology and fiber bonding. In vitro biocompatibility was assessed using the MTT assay and DAPI staining, while in vivo biocompatibility was evaluated in a rat model. For the in vivo Achilles tendinopathy assay, rats were divided into groups and subjected to AT rupture followed by treatment with ESM, PRP, or a combination. SEM was employed to evaluate tendon morphology, and real-time PCR was conducted to analyze gene expression levels. The in vivo assay indicated that the ESM scaffold was safe for an extended period of 8 weeks, showing no signs of inflammation based on histopathological analysis. In the Achilles tendon rupture model, combining ESM with PRP enhanced tendon healing after 14 weeks post-surgery. This finding was supported by histopathological, morphological, and mechanical evaluations of tendon tissues compared to normal tendons, untreated tendinopathy, and injured tendons treated with the ESM scaffold. Gene expression analysis revealed significantly increased expression of Col1a1, Col3a1, bFGF, Scleraxis (Scx), and tenomodulin in the ESM-PRP groups. The findings of our study demonstrate that the combination of Ostrich ESM with PRP significantly enhances AT repair and is a biocompatible scaffold for the application in living organisms."
"Denoising low-dose computed tomography (CT) images is a critical task in medical image computing. Supervised deep learning-based approaches have made significant advancements in this area in recent years. However, these methods typically require pairs of low-dose and normal-dose CT images for training, which are challenging to obtain in clinical settings. Existing unsupervised deep learning-based methods often require training with a large number of low-dose CT images or rely on specially designed data acquisition processes to obtain training data."
"Iron, an essential trace element, is involved in various physiological processes; however, consumption of excessive iron possesses detrimental effects. In practical feed production, the iron content added to feeds often far exceeds the actual demand, resulting in an excess of iron in the body. The liver as a central regulator of iron homeostasis is susceptible to damage caused by disorders in iron metabolism. A model of hepatic iron overload in laying hens was developed in this study by incorporating iron into their diet, and the specific mechanisms underlying iron overload-induced hepatic injury were investigated. Firstly, this study revealed that a high-iron diet resulted in hepatic iron overload, accompanied by impaired liver function. Next, assessment of oxidative stress markers indicated a decrease in activities of T-SOD and CAT, coupled with an increase in MDA content, pointing to the iron-overloaded liver oxidative stress. Thirdly, the impact of iron overload on hepatic glycolipid and bile acid metabolism-related gene expressions were explored, including PPAR-α, GLUT2, and CYP7A1, highlighting disruptions in hepatic metabolism. Subsequently, analyses of inflammation-related genes such as iNOS and IL-1β at both protein and mRNA levels demonstrated the presence of inflammation in the liver under conditions of dietary iron overload. Overall, this study provided comprehensive evidence that dietary iron overload contributed to disorders in glycolipid and bile acid metabolism, accompanied by inflammatory responses in laying hens. Further detailing the specific pathways involved and the implications of these findings could offer valuable insights for future research and practical applications in poultry nutrition."

"The transcriptional heterogeneity of tumor microenvironment (TME) cells is a crucial factor driving the diversity of cellular response to drug treatment and resistance. Therefore, characterizing the cells associated with drug treatment and resistance will help us understand therapeutic mechanisms, discover new therapeutic targets and facilitate precision medicine. Here, we describe a database, scDrugAct (http://bio-bigdata.hrbmu.edu.cn/scDrugAct/), which aims to establish connections among drugs, genes and cells and dissect the impact of TME cellular heterogeneity on drug action and resistance at single-cell resolution. ScDrugAct is curated with drug-cell connections between 3838 223 cells across 34 cancer types and 13 857 drugs and identifies 17 274 drug perturbation/resistance-related genes and 276 559 associations between >10 000 drugs and 53 cell types. ScDrugAct also provides multiple flexible tools to retrieve and analyze connections among drugs, genes and cells; the distribution and developmental trajectories of drug-associated cells within the TME; functional features affecting the heterogeneity of cellular responses to drug perturbation and drug resistance; the cell-specific drug-related gene network; and drug-drug similarities. ScDrugAct serves as an important resource for investigating the impact of the cellular heterogeneity of the TME on drug therapies and can help researchers understand the mechanisms of action and resistance of drugs, as well as discover therapeutic targets."

"The development of multivalent nanoprobes has garnered considerable interest due to their enhanced sensitivity and precision in diagnosing and monitoring diverse diseases. Despite significant advances in nanobiotechnology, the optimal density of binding motifs to maximize the diagnostic efficacy of biosensors remains incompletely understood. Herein, we investigate the influence of multivalency in the functional performance of avidity-based biosensors. By post-translationally modifying the surface of M13 bacteriophages, we achieved multivalent displays of epidermal growth factor receptor-specific repebodies and enhanced green fluorescent proteins in a controlled configuration. Through an array of phage-based nanoprobes, our findings reveal an inverted U-shaped correlation between the degree of multivalency and biosensor sensitivity. Briefly, excessive multivalency negatively impacts analytical performance, likely due to irreversible target depletion, while fine-tuned multivalency significantly enhances antigen recognition and signal amplification. Additionally, the advantages of avidity-demonstrated as improved targeting specificity and sensing capability-are especially prominent in nanoprobes incorporating low-affinity repebodies. This work underscores the critical role of multivalency optimization in biosensor design, providing valuable insights for the development of highly sensitive and reliable diagnostic tools in clinical settings."

"Recent research has exposed a growing body of proof underscoring the importance of microRNAs (miRNAs) and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in maintaining the physical composition of neurons and influencing cognitive functioning in both standard and atypical circumstances. Extensive research has been conducted on the possible application of miRNAs and lncRNAs as biomarkers for various diseases, with a particular focus on brain disorders, as they possess remarkable durability in cell-free surroundings and can endure repeated freezing and thawing processes. It is intriguing to note that miRNAs and lncRNAs have the ability to function through paracrine mechanisms, thereby playing a role in communication between different organs. Recent research has proposed that the improvement of cognitive abilities through physical exercise in mentally healthy individuals is a valuable method for uncovering potential connections between miRNAs, or microRNAs, and lncRNAs, and human cognitive function. The process of cross-correlating data from disease models and patients with existing data will be crucial in identifying essential miRNAs and lncRNAs, which can potentially act as biomarkers or drug targets in the treatment of cognitive disorders. By combining this method with additional research in animal models, we can determine the function of these molecules and their potential impact on therapy. This article discusses the latest research about the primary miRNAs, lncRNAs, and their exosomes that are affected by physical activity in terms of human cognitive function."
"Rice bacterial blight is a devastating disease worldwide, causing significant yield losses. Understanding how plants defend against microbial infection is critical for sustainable crop production. In this study, we show that ALEX1, a previously identified pathogen-induced long noncoding RNA, localizes to the nucleus and directly binds AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 3 (ARF3). We showed that ARF3 forms the condensates in the nucleus via its intrinsically disordered middle region (MR), and that these ARF3 condensates display solid-like properties. We further revealed that ALEX1 directly binds the MR of ARF3 to regulate ARF3 condensate dynamics and promote ARF3 homodimerization. The dispersed, dimeric form of ARF3, referred to as its functional phase state, enhances its ability to transcriptionally repress the expression of downstream target genes such as JAZ13, thereby modulating the jasmonic acid signaling pathway and enhancing pathogen resistance in rice. Collectively, this study reveals the role of a long noncoding RNA in regulating protein condensation and complex assembly, thus contributing to plant pathogen resistance."

"Drought stress significantly impacts wheat productivity, but plant growth regulators may help mitigate these effects. This study examined the influence of gibberellic acid (GA3) and abscisic acid (ABA) on wheat (Triticum aestivum L., CV: Giza 171) growth and yield under different water regimes. Using a split-plot design, we tested three drought levels as main plots: normal irrigation (80% field capacity), moderate drought (60% field capacity), and severe drought (40% field capacity). Subplots consisted of GA3 and ABA treatments at 100 and 200 ppm concentrations. Results showed that 200 ppm GA3 treatment enhanced multiple growth parameters under normal irrigation, including plant height (25-30% increase), leaf area (30-35% increase), and reproductive traits (40% increase in number of number of spikes, 35% increase in grains per spike). In contrast, ABA treatment at 200 ppm resulted in reduced plant height (35% decrease) and greater leaf area reduction (40% vs. 20% in control) under drought conditions. GA3 at 200 ppm also improved physiological parameters including catalase and superoxide dismutase activities, protein content, and proline accumulation. These findings demonstrate the distinct roles of GA3 and ABA in regulating wheat growth and stress responses, providing valuable insights for drought management in wheat cultivation."
"Genomic instability is a hallmark of cancer and is a major driving force of tumorigenesis. A key manifestation of genomic instability is the formation of extrachromosomal DNAs (ecDNAs) - acentric, circular DNA molecules ranging from 50 kb to 5 Mb in size, distinct from chromosomes. Ontological studies have revealed that ecDNA serves as a carrier of oncogenes, immunoregulatory genes, and enhancers, capable of driving elevated transcription of its cargo genes and cancer heterogeneity, leading to rapid tumor evolution and therapy resistance. Although ecDNA was documented over half a century ago, the past decade has witnessed a surge in breakthrough discoveries about its biological functions. Here, we systematically review the modern biology of ecDNA uncovered over the last ten years, focusing on how discoveries during this pioneering stage have illuminated our understanding of ecDNA-driven transcription, heterogeneity, and cancer progression. Furthermore, we discuss ongoing efforts to target ecDNA as a novel approach to cancer therapy. This burgeoning field is entering a new phase, poised to reshape our knowledge of cancer biology and therapeutic strategies."
"Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by keratinocyte hyperproliferation and immune cell infiltration. Various therapies have been discovered for psoriasis, including topical treatments, phototherapy, conventional systemic agents such as methotrexate, retinoids and ciclosporine, as well as biologics. Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway inhibitors targeting Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-23 and IL-17 can be effective in psoriasis. Ruxolitinib is a US Food and Drug Administration-approved first-generation Janus kinase inhibitor for polycythemia vera, myelofibrosis, and acute graft-versus-host disease. Ruxolitinib cream has been investigated in various dermatologic diseases, including atopic dermatitis, vitiligo, psoriasis, and alopecia areata. However, there is limited data on the efficacy of oral ruxolitinib in patients with psoriasis vulgaris. Here, we report a patient diagnosed with myelofibrosis coexisting with psoriasis vulgaris, successfully treated with oral ruxolitinib."
"Sex estimation is a critical component of the biological profile, and forensic anthropologists may use a variety of sex estimation methods depending upon the degree of completeness and state of preservation of the skeletal remains being analyzed. The innominate is widely accepted to be the most sexually dimorphic skeletal element. The Diagnose Sexuelle Probabiliste (DSP) method, which uses 10 measurements of the innominate, was introduced in 2005 and updated as DSP2 in 2017. While DSP2 has been reported to have high classification accuracy rates in studies of South American and European populations, the method has not been widely tested in US samples, and few US practitioners incorporate this method into their casework. The goal of this study was to test the reliability and accuracy of DSP2 using a large, modern sample from the US (n = 174). Two observers, blinded from demographic information associated with each specimen, collected the DSP2 metrics. Intra- and interobserver error analyses showed acceptable levels of agreement for all measurements, except for IIMT. Classification accuracies exceeded 95%, with minimal sex bias, for both observers and using various measurement combinations; however, an inclusivity sex bias occurred with more males reaching the 0.95 posterior probability threshold required by DSP2 to provide a sex classification estimate. Based on its high accuracy, forensic anthropologists in the US may consider incorporating DSP2 into their casework, although we recommend excluding IIMT and using SPU with caution. Additional methods will continue to be needed when the posterior probability threshold is not reached."
"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with profound global impact. While genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed genomic variants linked to AD, their translational impact has been limited due to challenges in interpreting the identified genetic associations. To address this challenge, we have devised a novel approach termed transcription factor-wide association studies (TF-WAS). By integrating the GWAS, expression quantitative trait loci, and transcriptome analyses, we selected 30 AD single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in noncoding regions that are likely to be functional. Using human transcription factor (TF) microarrays, we have identified 90 allele-specific TF interactions with 53 unique TFs. We then focused on several interactions involving SMAD4 and further validated them using electrophoretic mobility shift assay, luciferase, and chromatin immunoprecipitation on engineered genetic backgrounds (female cells). This approach holds promise for unraveling the intricacies of not just AD, but any complex disease with available GWAS data, providing insight into underlying molecular mechanisms and clues toward potential therapeutic targets."
"Cytomegaloviruses, species-specific members of the betaherpesviruses, encode an impressive array of immune evasion strategies committed to the manipulation of the host immune system enabling these viruses to remain for life in a stand-off with host innate and adaptive immune mechanisms. Even though they are species-restricted, cytomegaloviruses are distributed across a wide range of different mammalian species in which they cause systemic infection involving many different cell types. Regulated, or programmed cell death has a recognized potential to eliminate infected cells prior to completion of viral replication and release of progeny. Cell death also naturally terminates replication during the final stages of replication. Over the past two decades, the host defense potential of known programmed cell death pathways (apoptosis, necroptosis, and pyroptosis), as well as a novel mitochondrial serine protease pathway have been defined through studies of cytomegalovirus-encoded cell death suppressors. Such virus-encoded inhibitors prevent virus-induced, cytokine-induced, and stress-induced death of infected cells while also moderating inflammation. By evading cell death and consequent inflammation as well as innate and adaptive immune clearance, cytomegaloviruses represent successful pathogens that become a critical disease threat when the host immune system is compromised. This review will discuss cell death programs acquired for mammalian host defense against cytomegaloviruses and enumerate the range of modulatory strategies this type of virus employs to balance host defense in favor of lifelong persistence."
"Amphotericin B (AmB) is one of the most effective antifungal drugs, with a strong, dose-dependent activity against most Candida and Aspergillus species responsible for life-threatening infections. However, AmB is severely toxic, which hinders its broad use. In this proof-of-concept study, we demonstrate that prodrugging AmB considerably decreases AmB toxicity without affecting its fungicidal activity. For this purpose, we modified the AmB structure by attaching a designer phosphate promoiety, thereby switching off its mode of action and preventing its toxic effects. The original fungicidal activity of AmB was then restored upon prodrug activation by host plasma enzymes. These AmB prodrugs showed a safer toxicity profile than commercial AmB deoxycholate in Candida and Aspergillus species and significantly prolonged larval survival of infected Galleria mellonella larvae. Based on these findings, prodrugging toxic antifungals may be a viable strategy for broadening the antifungal arsenal, opening up opportunities for targeted prodrug design."

Estimated continuous cardiac output (esCCO) is a novel technology that enables non-invasive and continuous monitoring of cardiac output. We compared the concordance in accuracies among esCCO measurements in the shunt limb and non-shunt limb.
"Cerebral microbleeds are associated with events that are among the highest mortality and disability events combined worldwide, as well as with hypertensive vasculopathy. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between a marker of hypertensive vasculopathy, arterial stiffness assessed by pulse wave velocity, and cerebral microbleeds. A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed using PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, according to the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) and Cochrane Collaboration Handbook statements. Data extraction, quality assessment and statistical analyses were performed following pre-established criteria. Twenty-one studies involving 18,436 participants were included. Higher levels of pulse wave velocity were associated with a higher presence of cerebral microbleeds p-OR = 1.26 (95% CI; 1.09-1.45), with considerable heterogeneity; even adjusting for potential confounding variables p-OR = 1.12 (95% CI, 1.05-1.20), with substantial heterogeneity. Only the percentage of women was related to p-OR in the adjusted model. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of our results. Adjusted models showed publication bias. Higher levels of arterial stiffness are associated with greater presence of cerebral microbleeds. This phenomenon may be caused by damage to the brain under higher blood flow loads, in turn due to age-induced reversal of the stiffness gradient between large and small vessels. As the world's population is undergoing demographic ageing, our results underline the importance of establishing pulse wave velocity as a cardiovascular marker for early screening and delaying the onset of the characteristic signs of both diseases."
"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a primary endocrine disorder affecting premenopausal women involving metabolic dysregulation. We aimed to screen serum biomarkers in PCOS patients using untargeted lipidomics and ensemble machine learning. Serum from PCOS patients and non-PCOS subjects were collected for untargeted lipidomics analysis. Through analyzing the classification of differential lipid metabolites and the association between differential lipid metabolites and clinical indexes, ensemble machine learning, data preprocessing, statistical test pre-screening, ensemble learning method secondary screening, biomarkers verification and evaluation, and diagnostic panel model construction and verification were performed on the data of untargeted lipidomics. Results indicated that different lipid metabolites not only differ between groups but also have close effects on different corresponding clinical indexes. PI (18:0/20:3)-H and PE (18:1p/22:6)-H were identified as candidate biomarkers. Three machine learning models, logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machine, showed that screened biomarkers had better classification ability and effect. In addition, the correlation of candidate biomarkers was low, indicating that the overlap between the selected biomarkers was low, and the combination of panels was more optimized. When the AUC value of the test set of the constructed diagnostic panel model was 0.815, the model's accuracy in the test set was 0.74, specificity was 0.88, and sensitivity was 0.7. This study demonstrated the applicability and robustness of machine learning algorithms to analyze lipid metabolism data for efficient and reliable biomarker screening. PI (18:0/20:3)-H and PE (18:1p/22:6)-H showed great potential in diagnosing PCOS."
"Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is a safe and effective procedure for the treatment of aortic stenosis. With the recently broadened indications, there is a larger cohort of patients likely to outlive their first transcatheter heart valve (THV). This review discusses relevant lifetime planning considerations, focusing on the utility of preprocedural computed tomography imaging to help implanters future-proof their patients who are likely to outlive their first valve. The initial priority is to optimise the index procedure by maximising THV haemodynamic function and durability. This involves maximising the effective orifice area, minimising the risk of new pacemaker implantation, reducing paravalvular regurgitation, and preventing coronary obstruction and annular rupture. In patients requiring a second valve procedure, a significant proportion will require a TAVI-in-TAVI, and implanters should consider the key priorities for a redo procedure, including the increased risks of patient-prosthesis mismatch and conduction abnormalities, promoting coronary reaccessibility, and preventing coronary obstruction and sinus sequestration. Careful planning can identify potential hurdles as well as predict the feasibility and likely outcomes of redo-TAVI, to help individualise care over the lifetime of each patient."
"Many transplant programs worldwide are likely to impose vaccine mandates for pediatric solid organ transplant candidates; some already do. Three potential benefits that advocates invoke to justify mandates are improved patient outcomes, efficient organ allocation, and contributions to community protection. We show that none of these benefits can justify mandates. The medical benefits of mandates are unlikely to outweigh the risks of denying life-saving care, mandates threaten trust and equity in organ allocation, and the impact on community protection is likely negligible, while the burden on unvaccinated children would be disproportionate. We also reject the claim that clinician burdens in dealing with vaccine refusers are good reasons for mandates, and point out, to the contrary, that the potential political backlash to mandates is a good reason for restraint. Rather, we argue that vaccine mandates for pediatric transplant candidates should be a last resort; they should only be considered after all evidence-based noncoercive measures have been exhausted, and after mandates for transplant professionals and staff are in place. Since there is little evidence that all such measures have been attempted, it is premature to consider vaccine mandates."
Artificial intelligence (AI) applications have increased dramatically across a wide range of domains. Dental students will undoubtedly be impacted by the emergence of AI in dentistry.
"To evaluate the effect of a vendor-agnostic deep learning denoising (DLD) algorithm on diagnostic image quality of non-contrast cranial computed tomography (ncCT) across five CT scanners.This retrospective single-center study included ncCT data of 150 consecutive patients (30 for each of the five scanners) who had undergone routine imaging after minor head trauma. The images were reconstructed using filtered back projection (FBP) and a vendor-agnostic DLD method. Using a 4-point Likert scale, three readers performed a subjective evaluation assessing the following quality criteria: overall diagnostic image quality, image noise, gray matter-white matter differentiation (GM-WM), artifacts, sharpness, and diagnostic confidence. Objective analysis included evaluation of noise, contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and an artifact index for the posterior fossa.In subjective image quality assessment, DLD showed constantly superior results compared to FBP in all categories and for all scanners (p<0.05) across all readers. The objective image quality analysis showed significant improvement in noise, SNR, and CNR as well as for the artifact index using DLD for all scanners (p<0.001).The vendor-agnostic deep learning denoising algorithm provided significantly superior results in the subjective as well as in the objective analysis of ncCT images of patients with minor head trauma concerning all parameters compared to the FBP reconstruction. This effect has been observed in all five included scanners. · Significant improvement of image quality for 5 scanners due to the vendor-agnostic DLD. · Subjects were patients with routine imaging after minor head trauma. · Reduction of artifacts in the posterior fossa due to the DLD. · Access to improved image quality even for older scanners from different vendors. · Kapper C, Müller L, Kronfeld A et al.

"Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common cause of cancer-related deaths in men worldwide. BRCA1/2 genes are reported altered in approximately 1% and 8% of PCa cases, respectively. To date, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues have a consolidate use in the clinical practice, but with a significant drawback related to DNA/RNA degradation during the pre-analytical process. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of detecting BRCA1/2 alterations in DNA extracted from FFPE tissues collected from PCa patients after various years of storage in seven Italian hospitals."
"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is one of the most prevalent skin diseases, but there are numerous knowledge gaps surrounding the impact this disease has on quality of life (QoL), mental health, and out-of-pocket expenses involved in the management of AD. The available scientific evidence on the multidimensional burden of AD is usually based on studies with measures reported by patients themselves."
"The primary objective of this study was to perform a psychometric evaluation of the Persian adaptation of the Assessment of Interprofessional Team Collaboration Scale (P-AITCS-II). This methodological study aimed to assess the validity and reliability of the AITCS-II for practitioners within the Iranian healthcare context. Data were collected from a sample of 230 Iranian healthcare providers between May and June 2024. Confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated good model fit indices (χ2 = 540.20, df = 224, χ2/df = 2.41, CFI = 0.917, IFI = 0.918, TLI = 0.907, PNFI = 0.768, PCFI = 0.812, and RMSEA = 0.079 [CI90% 0.070-0.087]). These results confirm the validity of the P-AITCS-II model. Additionally, the internal consistency and composite reliability of the three factors were higher than 0.7. Convergent validity was considered acceptable for the P-AITCS-II, as the Average Variance Extracted (AVE) was greater than 0.5. The Persian adaptation of the Assessment of Interprofessional Team Collaboration Scale II (P-AITC-II), consisting of 23 items within three factors-partnership, cooperation, and coordination-demonstrated good validity and reliability. However, further research is needed to confirm its robustness and usefulness for improving interprofessional team collaboration."

"Novel anthropometric indices are more closely related to metabolic abnormalities than traditional anthropometric indices. Fewer studies have been conducted based on the relationship between novel anthropometric indicators and hyperuricemia. This study was to analyze the serum uric acid (SUA) levels of adults and the relationship between hyperuricemia and these new indicators in Su-Wuxi-Chang area of China, in order to provide a theoretical basis for the management of SUA levels in patients with hyperuricemia. A total of 14,834 adults were enrolled. The information of height, weight, waist circumference, lifestyle, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), lipids, and SUA were collected. The traditional obesity indices and novel anthropometric indices were calculated by formulas. Lipid accumulation product (LAP), triglyceride glucose (TyG) and body roundness index (BRI) are independent risk factors for hyperuricemia in both men and women (P < 0.001). In males, the predictive ability of LAP and TyG to the incidence of hyperuricemia were 0.694 and 0.661 in AUC area, respectively (P < 0.001) and which were 0.767 and 0.746 respectively in females (P < 0.001). In both men and women, the LAP and TyG indices were more predictive of hyperuricemia than the other indices (P < 0.001). The capacity of LAP and TyG indexes were better than other traditional anthropometric indexes in predicting hyperuricemia in this population. The predicted hyperuricemia ablity of LAP in both male and female better than other traditional and new anthropometric indicators."

"Astrocytes are multifaceted glial cell types that perform structural, functional, metabolic, and homeostatic roles in the brain. Recent studies have revealed mechanisms underlying the diversity of bidirectional communication modes between astrocytes and neurons - the fundamental organizing principle shaping synaptic properties at tripartite synapses. These astrocyte-neuron interactions are critical for the proper functioning of synapses and neural circuits. This review focuses on molecular mechanisms that direct these interactions, highlighting the versatile roles of multiple adhesion-based paths that likely modulate them, often in a context-dependent manner. It also describes how astrocyte-mediated processes go awry in certain brain disorders and provides a timely insight on the pivotal roles of astrocyte-neuron interactions in synaptic integrity and their relevance to understanding and treating neurological disorders."
"Understanding the relationship between DNA sequences and gene expression levels is of significant biological importance. Recent advancements have demonstrated the ability of deep learning to predict gene expression levels directly from genomic data. However, traditional methods are limited by basic word encoding techniques, which fail to capture the inherent features and patterns of DNA sequences."
"Despite excellent prognosis of early breast cancer, the patients face problems related to decreased quality of life and mental health. There is a need for easily available interventions targeting modifiable factors related to these problems. The aim of this study was to test the use of a new digital supportive intervention platform for early breast cancer patients."
"The 6-min walk test (6MWT) is used to assess functional capacity in patients with COPD. A significant number of studies have shown that most patients walk further in a second 6MWT. Research on a further increase in the 6-min walk distance (6MWD) during a 3rd test performed in accordance with current guidelines has not been done. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate 1) the reproducibility of three 6MWTs in patients with COPD referred for pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) and 2) predictors of improvement on a third 6MWT."
"Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic rheumatic disease that usually appears in patients with skin psoriasis, making it a model for detection of joint disease in the pre-clinical phases in a setting where therapy for cutaneous disease may ameliorate or prevent arthritis development. Such PsA prevention appears credible due to the increasingly recognized closely shared immunopathology between the skin and joints, especially the entheses. Recently, several initiatives have explored the concept of pre-clinical PsA, and nomenclatures have been developed with the recent EULAR nomenclature proposing a simplified three stages from psoriasis to clinical PsA development, namely at risk of PsA, subclinical PsA and early PsA. A better comprehension of early PsA and the identification of individuals predisposed to its development could enable interventions to 'prevent' the appearance of PsA. Several recent retrospective observational studies have demonstrated disease interception feasibility, i.e. treatment of people with psoriasis may prevent the appearance of PsA, in particular using biologic disease-modifying drugs. However, further data are urgently required due to unexpected findings in some studies where TNF inhibition for psoriasis does not reduce the rate of PsA development. In this review we address the current challenges in early PsA, including comparisons of pre-PsA nomenclature sets, its risk factors and the potential for disease interception."
The visualization of peripheral in-stent restenosis using energy-integrating detector CT is challenging due to deficient spatial resolution and artifact formation. This study compares the first clinically available photon-counting detector CT to third-generation dual-source energy-integrating detector CT.
"The literature associating the spread of SARS-CoV-2 with the healthcare-related, geographical, and demographic characteristics of the territory is inconclusive and contrasting. We studied these relationships during winter 2021/2022 in South Tyrol, a multicultural Italian alpine province, performing an ecological study based on the 20 districts of the area. Data about incidence, hospitalization, and death between November 2021 and February 2022 were collected and associated to territorial variables via bivariate analyses and multivariate regressions. Both exposure variables and outcomes varied widely among districts. Incidence was found to be mainly predicted by vaccination coverage (negative correlation). Mortality and ICU admission rates partially followed this distribution, while the case fatality rate was inversely correlated to average salary, and hospital admission rates increased where hospitals capacity was higher, and from the southern to the northern border of the province. These findings, besides confirming the efficacy of vaccination in preventing both new and severe SARS-CoV-2 cases, highlight that several geographical and socio-demographic variables can be related to disease epidemiology. Remote areas with wage gaps and lower access to care suffered most from the pandemic. Our findings, therefore, underly the existence of health inequity issues that need to be targeted by implementing specifically tailored public health interventions."

Breast cancer (BC) is a cancer that seriously affects women's health. BC cell migration increases the mortality of BC patients. Current studies have shown that long noncoding RNAs (LncRNAs) are related to the metastasis mechanism of BC. This study aimed to explore the function and role of LncRNA OIP5-AS1 in BC. And we analyzed its regulatory mechanism and related modification process.
"The stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR) has recently gained attention as a marker for acute hyperglycemia, which has been linked to adverse clinical outcomes. However, its independent role in the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D) remains understudied. This cohort study aimed to assess the association between SHR and the incidence of T2D."
"Patients with simultaneous ruptures of the patellar tendon (PT) and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) underwent PT repair and ACL reconstruction in a single or staged surgery. However, due to the limited cases, the design of previous studies was mostly case report with varying conclusions regarding recommended surgical strategy selection, the optimal surgical strategy remains a subject of debate."
"Trust is a challenging and complex concept and takes on particular significance in the context of community engagement and communication in healthcare. For the purpose of making health services more inclusive and of tackling discrimination where it occurs, there is a need to articulate a vision for inclusion that communities of historically disadvantaged or stigmatised patients can trust. This article considers examples of diversity and inclusion 'signals' on the public websites of two large public hospitals in Melbourne, Australia. We suggest that there is value in public communications reaffirming respect for diversity and a commitment to inclusion in health services. We also make the case for interdisciplinary research into how trust-signalling strategies, that is, rhetorical strategies employed to reassure or convince, are developed by and for health services for the purposes of community engagement, and the specific effects that they may engender. Websites' framing of messages that affirm institutional commitments to fostering an inclusive environment and addressing barriers can serve as a means of explicitly encouraging patients and healthcare workers from marginalised communities to overcome potential obstacles to fuller healthcare engagement and workforce participation respectively."
"Most terrestrial plants can establish a reciprocal symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi to cope with adverse environmental stresses. The development of AM symbiosis is energetically costly and needs to be dynamically controlled by plants to maintain the association at mutual beneficial levels. Multiple components involved in the autoregulation of mycorrhiza (AOM) have been recently identified from several plant species; however, the mechanisms underlying the feedback regulation of AM symbiosis remain largely unknown. Here, we report that AM colonization promotes the flavonol biosynthesis pathway in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), and an AM-specific UDP-glucosyltransferase SlUGT132, which probably has the flavonol glycosylation activity, negatively regulates AM development. SlUGT132 was predominantly expressed in the arbuscule-containing cells, and its knockout or knockdown mutants showed increased soluble sugar content, root colonization level and arbuscule formation. Conversely, overexpression of SlUGT132 resulted in declined soluble sugar content and mycorrhization degree. Metabolomic assay revealed decreased contents of astragalin, tiliroside and cynaroside in slugt132 mycorrhizal roots, but increased accumulation of these flavonoid glycosides in SlUGT132-overexpressing plant roots. Our results highlight the presence of a novel, SlUGT132-mediated AOM mechanism, which enable plants to flexibly control the accumulation of soluble sugars and flavonoid glycosides in mycorrhizal roots and modulate colonization levels."
"Protein arginine methyltransferase 7 (PRMT7), a type III methyltransferase responsible solely for arginine mono-methylation, plays a critical role in numerous physiological and pathological processes. Recent studies have highlighted its aberrant expression or mutation in various cancers, implicating it in tumorigenesis, cancer progression, and drug resistance. Consequently, PRMT7 has emerged as a promising target for cancer diagnosis and therapeutic intervention. In this review, we present an overview of the molecular structure of PRMT7, discuss its roles and mechanisms in different cancer types, and analyze the binding modes and structure-activity relationships of reported PRMT7 inhibitors. Furthermore, we identify the challenges encountered in functional exploration and drug development targeting PRMT7, propose potential solutions to these challenges, and outline future directions for the development of PRMT7 inhibitors to inform future drug discovery efforts."
"The left internal thoracic artery (LITA) has been widely accepted as the standard for revascularizing the left anterior descending artery during coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. However, in 10-20% of cases, the LITA may lead to unsecured side branches to the chest wall, particularly the lateral costal artery (LCA), potentially resulting in postoperative chest angina."
"Tolerance to the analgesic effects of opioids and resultant dose escalation is associated with worsening of side effects and greater addiction risk. Here, we compare the development of tolerance to the conventional opioid fentanyl with a novel pH-sensitive μ-opioid receptor (MOR) agonist, (±)-N-(3-fluoro-1-phenethylpiperidine-4-yl)-N-phenyl propionamide (NFEPP) that is active only in acidic inflammatory microenvironments."
Human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive urinary tract carcinomas (UTCas) have distinct morphology and molecular features with potential treatment implications. Cytomorphologic analysis of these tumors on urine cytology specimens has not yet been reported.

"Diabetes is a long-term condition characterized by elevated blood sugar levels. It can lead to a variety of complex disorders such as stroke, renal failure, and heart attack. Diabetes requires the most machine learning help to diagnose diabetes illness at an early stage, as it cannot be treated and adds significant complications to our health-care system. The diabetes PIMA Indian dataset (PIDD) was used for classification in several studies, it includes 768 instances and 9 features; eight of the features are the predictors, and one feature is the target. Firstly, we performed the preprocessing stage that includes mean imputation and data normalization. Afterwards, we trained the extracted features using various types of Machine Learning (ML); Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), K-Nearest neighbor (KNN), Naïve Bayes (NB), Histogram Gradient Boost (HGB), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) models. To achieve the classification for the PIDD, a new model called Recursive Feature Elimination-GRU (RFE-GRU) is proposed in this paper. RFE is vital for selecting features in the training dataset that are most important in predicting the target variable. While the GRU handles the challenge of vanishing and inflating gradient of the features results from RFE. Several predictive evaluation metrics, including precision, recall, F1-score, accuracy, and Area Under the Curve (AUC) achieved 90.50%, 90.70%, 90.50%, 90.70%, 0.9278, respectively, to verify and validate the execution of the RFE-GRU model. The comparative results showed that the RFE-GRU model is better than other classification models."
"As a major contributor to neonatal death and neurological sequelae, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) lacks a viable medication for treatment. Oxidative stress induced by hypoxic-ischemic brain damage (HIBD) predisposes neurons to ferroptosis due to the fact that neonates accumulate high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids for their brain developmental needs but their antioxidant capacity is immature. Ferroptosis is a form of cell death caused by excessive accumulation of iron-dependent lipid peroxidation and is closely associated with mitochondria. Mitophagy is a type of mitochondrial quality control mechanism that degrades damaged mitochondria and maintains cellular homeostasis. In this study we employed mitophagy agonists and inhibitors to explore the mechanisms by which mitophagy exerted ferroptosis resistance in a neonatal rat HIE model. Seven-days-old neonatal rats were subjected to ligation of the right common carotid artery, followed by exposure to hypoxia for 2 h. The neonatal rats were treated with a mitophagy activator Tat-SPK2 peptide (0.5, 1 mg/kg, i.p.) 1 h before hypoxia, or in combination with mitochondrial division inhibitor-1 (Mdivi-1, 20 mg/kg, i.p.), and ferroptosis inhibitor Ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1) (2 mg/kg, i.p.) at the end of the hypoxia period. The regulation of ferroptosis by mitophagy was also investigated in primary cortical neurons or PC12 cells in vitro subjected to 4 or 6 h of OGD followed by 24 h of reperfusion. We showed that HIBD induced mitochondrial damage, ROS overproduction, intracellular iron accumulation, lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis, which were significantly reduced by the pretreatment with Tat-SPK2 peptide, and aggravated by the treatment with Mdivi-1 or BNIP3 knockdown. Ferroptosis inhibitors Fer-1 and deferoxamine B (DFO) reversed the accumulation of iron and lipid peroxides caused by Mdivi-1, hence reducing ferroptosis triggered by HI. We demonstrated that Tat-SPK2 peptide-activated BNIP3-mediated mitophagy did not alleviate neuronal ferroptosis through the GPX4-GSH pathway. BNIP3-mediated mitophagy drove the P62-KEAP1-NRF2 pathway, which conferred ferroptosis resistance by maintaining iron and redox homeostasis via the regulation of FTH1, HO-1, and DHODH/FSP1-CoQ10-NADH. This study may provide a new perspective and a therapeutic drug for the treatment of neonatal HIE."

"The histone methyltransferase ASH1L plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression across various organ systems during development, yet its role in brain development remains largely unexplored. Over 130 individuals with autism harbour heterozygous loss-of-function ASH1L variants, and population studies confirm it as a high-risk autism gene. Previous studies on Ash1l deficient mice have reported autistic-like behaviours and provided insights into the underlying neuropathophysiology. In this study, we used mice with a cre-inducible deletion of Ash1l exon 4, which results in a frame shift and premature stop codon (p.V1693Afs*2). Our investigation evaluated the impact of Ash1l loss-of-function on survival and craniofacial skeletal development. Using a tamoxifen-inducible cre strain, we targeted Ash1l knockout early in cortical development [Emx1-Cre-ERT2; embryonic Day (e) 10.5]. Immunohistochemistry was utilized to assess cortical lamination, while EdU incorporation aided in birthdating cortical neurons. Additionally, single-cell RNA sequencing was employed to compare cortical cell populations and identify genes with differential expression. At e18.5, the proportion of homozygous Ash1l germline knockout embryos appeared normal; however, no live Ash1l null pups were present at birth (e18.5: n = 77, P = 0.90; p0: n = 41, P = 0.00095). Notably, Ash1l-/- exhibited shortened nasal bones (n = 31, P = 0.017). In the cortical-specific knockout model, SATB2 neurons showed increased numbers (n = 6/genotype, P = 0.0001) and were distributed through the cortical plate. Birthdating revealed generation of ectopically placed deep layer neurons that express SATB2 (e13.5 injection: n = 4/genotype, P = 0.0126). Single cell RNA sequencing revealed significant differences in gene expression between control and mutant upper layer neurons, leading to distinct clustering. Pseudotime analysis indicated that the mutant cluster followed an altered cell differentiation trajectory. This study underscores the essential role of Ash1l in postnatal survival and normal craniofacial development. In the cortex, ASH1L exerts broad effects on gene expression and is indispensable for determining the fate of upper layer cortical neurons. These findings provide valuable insights into the potential mechanisms of ASH1L neuropathology, shedding light on its significance in neurodevelopmental disorders like autism."
"Developing a new diagnostic prediction model for osteoarthritis (OA) to assess the likelihood of individuals developing OA is crucial for the timely identification of potential populations of OA. This allows for further diagnosis and intervention, which is significant for improving patient prognosis. Based on the NHANES for the periods of 2011-2012, 2013-2014, and 2015-2016, the study involved 11,366 participants, of whom 1,434 reported a diagnosis of OA. LASSO regression, XGBoost algorithm, and RF algorithm were used to identify significant indicators, and a OA prediction nomogram was developed. The nomogram was evaluated by measuring the AUC, calibration curve, and DCA curve of training and validation sets. In this study, we identified 5 predictors from 19 variables, including age, gender, hypertension, BMI and caffeine intake, and developed an OA nomogram. In both the training and validation cohorts, the OA nomogram exhibited good diagnostic predictive performance (with AUCs of 0.804 and 0.814, respectively), good consistency and stability in calibration curve and high net benefit in DCA. The nomogram based on 5 variables demonstrates a high accuracy in predicting the diagnosis of OA, indicating that it is a convenient tool for clinicians to identify potential populations of OA."
"Iptacopan, a novel oral factor B inhibitor, recently obtained US Food and Drug Administration approval for treating paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, a rare blood disorder characterized by persistent complement-mediated hemolytic anemia. The standard-of-care (SOC) has traditionally relied on complement C5 inhibitors eculizumab and ravulizumab, which are limited by persistent anemia from extravascular hemolysis and requirement for intravenous infusion. Recent publication of phase 3 studies in this arena reinforces iptacopan as an effective anticomplement monotherapy compared with SOC. Given ongoing price negotiations and limited literature showing its cost-ineffectiveness in the anti-C5-treated population, we conducted a comprehensive cost-effectiveness analysis of iptacopan monotherapy in anti-C5-treated patients from the societal perspective, as compared with C5 inhibition. The primary outcomes were the incremental net monetary benefit across a lifetime horizon and the cost-effective maximum monthly threshold price of iptacopan monotherapy compared with the SOC. The secondary outcome was time saved for patients and nurses with the use of oral iptacopan therapy. Iptacopan monotherapy and SOC accrued 12.6 and 10.8 quality-adjusted life-years at costs of $9.52 million and $13.5 million, respectively. Iptacopan monotherapy remained cost saving across extensive sensitivity and all scenario analyses, including alternative parameterization for anemia resolution and aggregated individual-level utilities and transition probability matrix. Across all probabilistic sensitivity analyses, iptacopan monotherapy was favored over SOC in 100% of 10 000 Monte Carlo iterations. Cost-saving thresholds for iptacopan vs anti-C5 are ∼1.1, 1.4, and 1.4 in Brazil, Japan, and the United States, respectively. Iptacopan monotherapy can improve quality-adjusted life expectancy for patients while saving health care costs across jurisdictions."
"The recommended treatment for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma is surgical excision. An initial punch biopsy is often performed as an aid to diagnosis. A retrospective registry-based study was performed to assess histopathological concordance of punch biopsy of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and subsequent excision. Analysis of 737 punch biopsies and subsequent matched excisions was performed. In total, 493 (67%) lesions were confirmed as invasive cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma on excision, 76% when excluding ""scar"" as a final diagnosis. Tumour diameter > 20mm was highly predictive of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (positive predictive value 91.1%). Tumours on the scalp were significantly more likely to demonstrate a final diagnosis of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma than those on the arm (odds ratio 6.11, 95% confidence interval 3.1,12.0). There was moderate concordance between biopsy and excision in grade of histopathological differentiation. This study demonstrates that clinical high-risk features may be of more value in predicting a diagnosis of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma than partial punch biopsy. Use of clinical and dermoscopic competencies in assessment of cutaneous tumours rather than reliance on biopsies both avoids delay in patient management in the case of high-risk cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and may also minimize unnecessary surgical excisions if there is a low clinical index of suspicion of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma."
This study examined the efficacy of AST-001 for the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in children.
"Greater understanding of differences in technique between runners may allow more beneficial feedback related to improving performance and decreasing injury risk. The purpose of this study was to develop and test a support vector machine classifier, which could automatically differentiate running technique between experienced and novice participants using only wearable sensor data. Three-dimensional linear accelerations and angular velocities were collected from six wearable sensors secured to current common smart device locations. Cross-validation was used to test the classification accuracy of models trained with a variety of combinations of sensor locations, with participants running at different speeds. Average classification accuracies ranged from 71.3% to 98.4% across the sensor combinations and running speeds tested. Models trained with only a single sensor location still showed effective classification. With the models trained with only upper arm data achieving an average accuracy of 96.4% across all tested running speeds. A post-hoc comparison of biomechanical variables between the two subgroups showed significant differences in upper body biomechanics throughout the stride. Both the methodology used to perform the classifications and the biomechanical differences identified could prove useful when aiming to shift a novice runner's technique towards movement patterns more akin to those with greater experience."
"Cardiovascular diseases are one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide, with the total number of cases increasing to 523 million in 2019. Despite the advent of new drugs, cardiovascular mortality has increased at an alarming rate of 53.7 % from 12.1 million deaths in 1990. Recently, the role of gut microbiome metabolites, such as Trimethylamine N-Oxide (TMAO), in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease (CVD) has attracted significant attention. The gut microbiome is critical in various physiological processes including metabolism, immune function, and inflammation. Elevated TMAO levels are associated with atherosclerosis, heart failure, arrhythmia, and atrial fibrillation. TMAO accelerates atherosclerosis by promoting vascular inflammation and reducing reverse cholesterol transport, which leads to lipid accumulation and vessel narrowing. Previous research has indicated that a Mediterranean diet rich in fiber and phytochemicals can reduce TMAO levels by limiting precursors and fostering beneficial gut microbiota. Prebiotics and probiotics also decrease TMAO, while drugs such as meldonium, aspirin, and antibiotics have shown promise. However, recent studies have demonstrated major potential for the use of statins in reducing TMAO levels. Statin therapy can significantly reduce TMAO levels independent of their cholesterol-lowering effects. This reduction may involve direct interactions with the gut microbiome, changes in cholesterol metabolism, and changes in bile acid composition. This review aims to comprehensively evaluate the therapeutic potential of statins in reducing TMAO levels to improve CV outcomes."
"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common degenerative joint disease that significantly impacts the quality of life, especially among older adults. Testosterone, a critical hormone for musculoskeletal health, has been suggested to influence OA pathogenesis. However, the relationship between low testosterone levels and OA risk remains underexplored in large, representative populations. This study aimed to investigate the association between low testosterone levels and OA risk using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES, 2011-2016)."
"Privacy fatigue caused by privacy data disclose and the complexity of privacy control has become an important factor influencing people's privacy decision-making behavior. At present, academia mainly studies privacy fatigue as a key determinant to explain the privacy paradox problem, but there is insufficient attention to its influencing factors and specific pathway of occurrence. Exploring the antecedents of privacy fatigue is of great significance for alleviating users' subjective privacy detachment and promoting privacy protection. Based on the Stressor-Strain-Outcome (SSO) theoretical framework, this study aims to explore the antecedents of privacy fatigue through the qualitative comparative analysis method of fuzzy set (fsQCA). The results show that there are three patterns of pathways which lead to privacy fatigue, namely the rational pattern, emotional pattern, and strain pattern. This study not only provides theoretical reference for understanding the antecedents of privacy fatigue among users but also offers new practical solutions for user privacy management."
"Gene expression is regulated by chromatin architecture and epigenetic remodeling in cell homeostasis and pathologies. Histone modifications act as the key factors to modulate the chromatin accessibility. Different histone modifications are strongly associated with the localization of chromatin. Heterochromatin primarily localizes at the nuclear periphery, where it interacts with lamina proteins to suppress gene expression. In this review, we summarize the potential bridges that have regulatory functions of histone modifications in chromatin organization and transcriptional regulation at the nuclear periphery. We use lamina-associated domains (LADs) as examples to elucidate the biological roles of the interactions between histone modifications and nuclear lamina in cell differentiation and development. In the end, we highlight the technologies that are currently used to identify and visualize histone modifications and LADs, which could provide spatiotemporal information for understanding their regulatory functions in gene expression and discovering new targets for diseases."
"This meta-analysis examined the relationship between age-related hearing loss (ARHL) and depression in older adults, and further explored whether this relationship is moderated by age and gender."
"Teacher well-being has increasingly become a prominent research topic due to its significant impact on various teacher and student outcomes. This focus is particularly crucial for early career teachers, who often encounter numerous challenges at the beginning of their careers, leading to elevated levels of stress and burnout. Our study aimed to examine the relationship between social and emotional competencies and burnout of early career teachers and the potential mediating role of teacher self-efficacy in this relationship. A total of 657 Croatian subject teachers with up to 5 years of experience participated in the study. Structural equation modelling was implemented to test models of hypothesised relations for the overall burnout as a dependent variable and for each burnout dimension: exhaustion, mental distance, cognitive impairment, and emotional impairment. Tested models singled out self-management and social awareness as two social and emotional competencies that are, along with teacher self-efficacy, particularly predictive of burnout. Self-management predicted lower overall burnout and teacher self-efficacy partially mediated this relationship. Social awareness also predicted lower burnout in teachers, but this relationship was fully mediated by teacher self-efficacy. Early career teachers who are better at managing and motivating themselves, who are socially aware and behave more prosocially were feeling more efficacious as teachers and, subsequently, displayed fewer symptoms of burnout. At the level of burnout dimensions, the overall pattern of relations was mainly retained, indicating that self-management and social awareness are particularly predictive of the four burnout dimensions and that self-efficacy plays a mediating role, either partially or fully, in this relationship. Our findings are especially important in light of the knowledge about early years in teaching being a critical period for teacher career development. They suggest that new teachers could benefit from well-structured mentoring and induction programs designed to ease their transition into schools and foster their well-being in the initial years of teaching."
"Herpes zoster (HZ) among older adults has consistently been a concern. Despite the availability of vaccines, HZ vaccination remains underutilized globally. This study investigated the behavioral intention of older adults in Hong Kong to receive self-financed or fully subsidized HZ vaccines. A random telephone survey was conducted between July and October 2023, involving 673 community-dwelling individuals aged 65 years or older. Among the 636 unvaccinated participants, 7.7% intended to receive two doses of the vaccine if self-financed, while 37.3% intended to do so if the vaccine was free. After adjusting for significant background characteristics, higher perceived susceptibility, benefits, and self-efficacy related to vaccines were associated with higher intent to vaccinate in both scenarios. Concerns regarding vaccine side effects were associated with lower intent in both scenarios. Frequent exposure to information regarding higher risk of HZ among older adults and COVID-19 survivors, as well as governmental recommendations for these groups to receive the vaccine, was associated with higher intent to vaccinate. These findings highlight the need to promote HZ vaccination among older adults with similar health systems and immunization policies, even when vaccines are available for free to older adults."
"""PolynetDWTCADx"" is a sophisticated hybrid model that was developed to identify and distinguish colorectal cancer. In this study, the CKHK-22 dataset, comprising 24 classes, served as the introduction. The proposed method, which combines CNNs, DWTs, and SVMs, enhances the accuracy of feature extraction and classification. The study employs DWT to optimize and enhance two integrated CNN models before classifying them with SVM following a systematic procedure. PolynetDWTCADx was the most effective model that we evaluated. It was capable of attaining a moderate level of recall, as well as an area under the curve (AUC) and accuracy during testing. The testing accuracy was 92.3%, and the training accuracy was 95.0%. This demonstrates that the model is capable of distinguishing between noncancerous and cancerous lesions in the colon. We can also employ the semantic segmentation algorithms of the U-Net architecture to accurately identify and segment cancerous colorectal regions. We assessed the model's exceptional success in segmenting and providing precise delineation of malignant tissues using its maximal IoU value of 0.93, based on intersection over union (IoU) scores. When these techniques are added to PolynetDWTCADx, they give doctors detailed visual information that is needed for diagnosis and planning treatment. These techniques are also very good at finding and separating colorectal cancer. PolynetDWTCADx has the potential to enhance the recognition and management of colorectal cancer, as this study underscores."
"Corporate social responsibility (CSR) has been widely discussed. However, the existing literature does not delve into the theoretical mechanism to show how companies adjust their CSR in the face of minimum wage increases. This may be due to the lack of a theoretical framework that clarifies the relationship between minimum wage increases and CSR adjustments. The objectives of this study is to fill this gap by investigating the impact of minimum wage increases on CSR, employing both cost stickiness and optimal distinctiveness theories. We use the data from the CSMAR database, the Human Resources and Social Security Administration, and Hexun rating system. The subject of this study is China's A-share listed companies during 2010-2020. This study employs fixed-effects models for a panel data. The findings reveal that minimum wage increases are significantly associated with a reduction in both strategic CSR and responsive CSR. Notably, the decrease in responsive CSR outweighs that of strategic CSR. Furthermore, our results indicate that customer concentration or CSR sensitivity significantly moderates this relationship. More particularly, firms with higher customer concentration are less responsive to minimum wage increases in their CSR activities. Firms with higher sensitivity in CSR are more likely to mitigate the reducing effect of the minimum wage on CSR. By revealing how minimum wage increases affect CSR and its economic consequences, our study provides scientific recommendations for policymakers to measure the impact of minimum wage policies at the firm level."
"The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted all areas of society. The socioemotional effects of isolation, financial instability, and educational and employment uncertainty are anticipated to have a ripple effect on the mental health of parents and children, which has not yet been studied in the Puerto Rican context. To examine the impact of COVID-19 on Puerto Rican families, we used a cross-sectional, correlational research design that studied the following: (a) Adverse experiences (AE) related to the COVID-19 pandemic reported by parents; (b) Parental stress; (c) Parental psychopathology: (d) The mental health of their children. We hypothesized that AEs have direct and indirect effects on child mental health, which are mediated by parental mental health and stress. One hundred and thirty-five parents with children aged 4 to 18 years completed an anonymous online survey from March to May 2022. Results show that COVID-19 AEs have significant direct and indirect effects on child mental health, which are mediated by parental stress and parental psychopathology. We observed medium-to-large effect sizes in the associations between child mental health and COVID-19 AEs, which are mediated by parental stress and psychopathology. Children's mental health symptoms worsen as parental stress and parental psychopathology increase in the context of COVID-19 AEs."
"Serum uric acid (SUA) may play positive roles in diseases associated with oxidative stress, such as osteoporosis (OP). Nevertheless, the specific impact of SUA levels on both bone mineral density (BMD) and the risk of OP remains uncertain. Considering such information crucial for clinicians when making decisions about urate-lowering therapy (ULT), we sought to fill this gap by conducting dose-response meta-analyses."
"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of preventable morbidity and mortality globally, and retinal imaging modalities (old and new) are being explored as noninvasive tools to predict latent atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease.

"Computational methods for estimating missense variant impact suffer from inconsistent performance across genes, which poses a major challenge for their reliable use in clinical practice. While ensemble scores leverage multiple prediction methods to enhance consistency, the overrepresentation of certain genes in the training data can bias their outcomes. To address this critical limitation, we propose a gene-specific ensemble framework trained on reference computational annotations rather than on clinical or experimental data. Accordingly, we generate Meta-EA ensemble scores that achieve comparable performance to the top individual predicting method for each gene set. Incorporating the effects of splicing and the allele frequency of human polymorphisms further enhances the performance of Meta-EA, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.97 for both gene-balanced and imbalanced clinical assessments. In conclusion, this work leverages the wealth of existing variant impact prediction approaches to generate improved estimations for clinical interpretation."

This systematic review sought to understand T2DM patients' preferences and diabetes care providers' perspectives regarding SDM, and the barriers and facilitators to SDM."
"Inflammation can influence the development of CRC as well as immunotherapy and plays a key role in CRC. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the potential of inflammation-related genes in CRC risk prediction. Inflammation gene models were constructed and validated by combining transcriptomic and single-cell data from TCGA and GEO databases, and the expression of inflammation-related genes was verified by RT-qPCR. We identified two molecular subtypes and three genetic subtypes, two risk subgroups according to median risk values, constructed a prognostic model including thirteen genes (TIMP1, GDF15, UCN, KRT4, POU4F1, NXPH1, SIX2, NPC1L1, KLK12, IGFL1, FOXD1, ASPG, and CYP4F8), and validated the performance of each aspect of the model in an external database. Patients in the high-risk group had worse survival with reduced immune cell infiltration and a greater tumor mutational load. The risk score correlated strongly with the immune checkpoints PD1, PDL1, PDL2, and CTLA4, and it is possible that high-risk patients are more sensitive to treatment involving immune checkpoints. In the single-cell data, GDF15 was most significantly expressed in cancer cell populations. Therefore, we further validated their expression in cells and tissues using qPCR. In summary, we developed a prognostic marker associated with inflammatory genes to provide new directions for subsequent studies and to help clinicians assess the prognosis of CRC patients as well as to develop personalized treatment strategies."
"The olfactory system of above-ground insects is among the best described perceptual architectures. However, remarkably little is known about how below-ground insects navigate in the dark for foraging. Here, we investigated host plant preferences, olfactory sensilla and characterise olfactory proteins in below-ground larvae of the striped flea beetle (SFB) Phyllotreta striolata Fabricius (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae). Both the adults and larvae of this coleopteran pest cause serious damage to Brassicaceous crops above and below ground, respectively. To elucidate the role of olfactory system in host location of below-ground larvae, we initially demonstrated that SFB larvae distinctly favoured Brassicaceae over other plant families by two-choice behavioural bioassay. Subsequently, scanning electron microscopy of sensilla in SFB larval head showed a significant reduction in the number of olfactory sensilla in larvae compared with adults. However, essential olfactory sensilla such as sensilla basiconica are underscoring the indispensability of the larval olfactory system. We selected four larval-specific odorant binding proteins for functional validation from our previous transcriptome data. Functional studies revealed that PstrOBP23 exhibits robust binding affinity to 24 volatiles of Brassicaceae plants, including seven isothiocyanate compounds. This suggests a pivotal role of PstrOBP23 in the foraging behaviour of the larvae below the ground. Moreover, two ligands displaying strong binding capacity exhibit apparent attractive or repellent activity towards SFB larvae. Our findings provide a crucial insight into the olfactory system of below-ground larvae in SFB, highlighting the highly selective tuning of larvae specific OBP to host plant volatiles. These results offer potential avenues for developing effective pest control strategies against SFB."
"Immunotherapy resistance poses a significant challenge in oncology, necessitating novel strategies to enhance the therapeutic efficacy. Immunogenic cell death (ICD), including necroptosis, pyroptosis and ferroptosis, triggers the release of tumor-associated antigens and numerous bioactive molecules. This release can potentiate a host immune response, thereby overcoming resistance to immunotherapy. Nanoparticles (NPs) with their biocompatible and immunomodulatory properties, are emerging as promising vehicles for the delivery of ICD-inducing agents and immune-stimulatory adjuvants to enhance immune cells tumoral infiltration and augment immunotherapy efficacy. This review explores the mechanisms underlying immunotherapy resistance, and offers an in-depth examination of ICD, including its principles and diverse modalities of cell death that contribute to it. We also provide a thorough overview of how NPs are being utilized to trigger ICD and bolster antitumor immunity. Lastly, we highlight the potential of NPs in combination with immunotherapy to revolutionize cancer treatment."
Comprehensive cleft care is an important component when caring for a child with cleft palate with or without cleft lip (CP ± L). Speech-language pathologists (SLPs) serve different capacities on comprehensive cleft palate and craniofacial teams.
"A 39-year-old woman presented to the dermatology department in January 2022 with a 3-week history of a progressively enlarging and intensely pruritic erythematous annular nodule on her left hand. The lesion started as a small blister, which was initially presumed to be a flare up of her pompholyx dermatitis. On her physician's advice, she applied clobetasol propionate ointment twice daily for 5 days; however the blister continued to increase in size until it burst, revealing raw inflamed skin. As the patch continued to increase in size, she was prescribed oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice a day for 5 days; however, the constantly weeping lesion grew to around 3 cm in diameter. The associated pruritus also became intense, without any response to regular antihistamines and ice application and disturbing patient's sleep. She also applied regular povidone iodine dressings but without any effect. Apart from pompholyx dermatitis, her medical history was significant for hypermobile Ehlers Danlos syndrome type 3 (hEDS)."
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) induces an imbalance in T helper (Th) 17/regulatory T (Treg) cells that contributes to of the dysregulation of inflammation. Exercise training can modulate the immune response in healthy subjects.
"His-bundle pacing (HBP) is a pacing mode that provides near-physiological pacing and has more advantages over standard right ventricle (RV) septum pacing in positive clinical results. However, traditional HBP cannot accurately and stably place the lead tip into the His-Purkinje system. Hence, this study aimed to establish a novel strategy for HBP to strike a balance between an excellent pacing threshold and minor injuries to the conduction system."
"Peroxiredoxin 6 (PRDX6) is one of the Peroxiredoxin family members with only 1-Cys, using glutathione as the electron donor to reduce peroxides in cells. PRDX6 has been frequently studied and its expression was associated with poor prognosis in many tumors. However, the expression of PRDX6 in multiple myeloma (MM) and its relevance with MM remain unclear. In our study, we found that PRDX6 was overexpressed in MM patients. Its high expression was inversely correlated with prognosis but positively correlated with the levels of β2-microglobulin (B2M), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and International Staging System (ISS) stage of MM patients. Further, the deficiency of PRDX6 promoted MM cell lines (RPMI 8226, MM.1S, and U266) apoptosis significantly. Mechanically, PRDX6 serves as an anti-oxidative enzyme, and its deficiency led to over-accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), resulting in oxidative stress, following the activation of MAPK signaling pathway, which manifested as phosphorylation of JNK and p38. Then, the expression of BAX and Bcl2 was imbalance, and the cascade cleavage of PARP and caspase 3 was increased, ultimately triggering cell apoptosis. In addition, oxidative stress decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), reduced gene expression levels of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), and increased in the density of mitochondrial crumpling, leading to mitochondrial structural abnormalities and dysfunction. Furthermore, PRDX6 deficiency combined with bortezomib induced a robust anti-tumor effect in MM cell lines. Finally, in vivo experiments also showed that the deficiency of PRDX6 inhibited tumor growth of tumor-bearing mice. Collectively, PRDX6 protects MM cells from oxidative damage and maintains mitochondrial homeostasis. And targeting PRDX6 is an attractive strategy to enhance the anti-tumor effect of bortezomib in MM."
"Measurement-based care (MBC) research and practice, including clinical workflows and systems to support MBC, are grounded in adult-serving mental health systems. MBC research evidence is building in child and adolescent services, but MBC practice is inherently more complex due to identified client age, the family system and the need to involve multiple reporters. This paper seeks to address a gap in the literature by providing practical guidance for youth-serving clinicians implementing MBC with children and their families. We focus on MBC as a data-informed, client-centered communication process, and present three key strategies to enhance usual care child and adolescent psychotherapy via developmentally-appropriate MBC. These strategies include (1) go beyond standardized measures; (2) lean into discrepancies; and (3) get curious together. Case-based examples drawn from various child-serving settings illustrate these key strategies of MBC in child psychotherapy."
"Despite the introduction of JAK inhibitors, allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant remains the only potentially curative treatment for patients with myelofibrosis but has considerable treatment-related complications. Whether the incorporation of JAK inhibition into the transplant algorithm leads to improved outcomes is still unclear. Here, we analyzed different transplant platforms in myelofibrosis patients undergoing a first transplant, comparing immune profiles and outcomes of (1) 33 patients continuing JAK inhibition at start of conditioning until stable engraftment (PERI-group), (2) 38 patients receiving JAK inhibition prior to transplant until start of conditioning (PRE-group), and (3) 38 patients that had never received JAK inhibition (NON-group). Patients in the PERI-group showed significantly higher early B-cell recovery as well as significantly increased late recovery of gamma-delta T cells and NK cells. We observed excellent neutrophil and platelet engraftment (100% for both) in the PERI-group and no hematotoxic effects or increased rates of infections following peri-transplant JAK inhibition. Cumulative incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) grade II-IV at day 100 after transplant was 15% in the PERI-group versus 29% in the PRE-group versus 34% in the NON-group. Cumulative incidence of relapse at 1 year after transplant was 9% in the PERI-group compared with 16% in the PRE-group and 18% in the NON-group. In conclusion, peri-transplant JAK inhibition was feasible with promising engraftment and acute GvHD rates, though deserves further investigation."
"Establishing an accurate prognosis for women diagnosed with breast cancer (BC) is extremely challenging. Axillary lymph node (ALN) evaluation is considered of major prognostic value. The one-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) assay is currently used for assessing axillary sentinel lymph node (SLN) status in BC. Additionally, total tumor load (TTL) may help predict further metastatic axillary involvement beyond the SLN. The prognostic value of primary BC location remains controversial due to lack of consensus on the biological differences among tumors at various sites. Evidence suggests that tumors in the internal quadrants (INLs) have worse prognosis compared to those in the external quadrants. Furthermore, ALN involvement is believed to be mainly associated with external quadrant tumors, mainly due to the lymphatic drainage system of the breast. This pilot observational study, despite lacking a control group and having a relatively small sample size, is the first to evaluate the potential relationship between primary BC location and ALN metastasis using the OSNA assay. A sample of consecutive BC patients undergoing axillary staging with the OSNA assay were included. Tumors were categorized into three groups based on primary location: external quadrants and axillary tail (EXL), INLs, and nipple and areola location (NAL). Although not statistically significant, the INL group exhibited a higher mean TTL. Additionally, no significant differences were observed between groups concerning SLN detection techniques, SLN status, number of metastatic SLN, or mean TTL. These findings support the use of the innovative tracer superparamagnetic iron oxide regardless of tumor site. This study underscores the importance of understanding the relationship between BC location and ALN status, which may improve prognostic stratification and targeted therapies based on tumor site. If these observations are confirmed in larger, multicentric studies, the potential conclusions may shift the paradigm of INL tumor treatment, significantly impacting clinical practice and research."

"Neuropathic pain is a complex and debilitating condition resulting from nerve damage, characterized by sensations such as burning, tingling, and shooting pain. It is often associated with conditions such as multiple sclerosis (MS), Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), and diabetic polyneuropathy. Conventional pain therapies frequently provide limited relief and are accompanied by significant side effects, emphasizing the need to explore alternative treatment options. Phytochemicals, which are bioactive compounds derived from plants, have gained attention for their potential in neuropathic pain management due to their diverse pharmacological properties, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and neuroprotective effects. This review evaluates the mechanisms by which specific phytochemicals, such as curcumin, resveratrol, and capsaicin, influence neuropathic pain pathways, particularly their role in modulating inflammatory processes, reducing oxidative stress, and interacting with ion channels and signaling pathways. While curcumin and resveratrol are primarily considered dietary supplements, their roles in managing neuropathic pain require further clinical investigation to establish their efficacy and safety. In contrast, capsaicin is an active ingredient derived from chili peppers that has been developed into approved topical treatments widely used for managing neuropathic and musculoskeletal pain. However, not all phytochemicals have demonstrated consistent efficacy in managing neuropathic pain, and their effects can vary depending on the compound and the specific condition. The pathophysiology of neuropathic pain, involving maladaptive changes in the somatosensory nervous system, peripheral and central sensitization, and glial cell activation, is also outlined. Overall, this review emphasizes the need for continued high-quality clinical studies to fully establish the therapeutic potential of phytochemicals in neuropathic pain management."
"Repurposing therapeutic agents with existing clinical data is a common strategy for developing radiation countermeasures. IEPA (imidazolyl ethanamide pentandioic acid) is an orally bioavailable small molecule pseudopeptide with myeloprotective properties, a good clinical safety profile, and stable chemical characteristics facilitating stockpiling. Here, we evaluated IEPA's radiomitigative efficacy in the hematopoietic subsyndrome of acute radiation syndrome (H-ARS) using total-body irradiation (TBI) models in C57BL/6J mice and WAG/RijCmcr rats, applying various posology schemes and introducing syringe feeding of the IEPA formulation in the pudding. Additionally, we assessed IEPA in the delayed effects of acute radiation exposure (DEARE) model after partial-body irradiation (PBI) in WAG/RijCmcr rats. Endpoints included survival, body weight, hematology, and pulmonary parameters, depending on the model. Results from mouse and rat TBI models demonstrated survival improvements with repeated IEPA dosing at 10 mg/kg, with the largest benefits observed in the bi-daily (BID) treatment over the 30-day ARS phase in female rats. Survival across PBI-DEARE subsyndromes was comparable between IEPA and vehicle groups, though IEPA improved pulmonary parameters in female rats during the lung-DEARE phase. Sex-related differences in response to irradiation and IEPA were noted, with females showing a survival advantage. IEPA treatment is compatible with Neulasta® (Pegfilgrastim; PEG-G-CSF); adequately powered studies are needed to confirm the trend toward improved survival over standard care alone. IEPA is a promising development candidate as a medical countermeasure against the effects of acute radiation syndrome. Further confirmatory studies in small and large animal models should validate the robustness and translatability of preliminary rodent data on IEPA's radiomitigative efficacy."
"The hippocampal CA3 subregion is a densely connected recurrent circuit that supports memory by generating and storing sequential neuronal activity patterns that reflect recent experience. While theta phase precession is thought to be critical for generating sequential activity during memory encoding, the circuit mechanisms that support this computation across hippocampal subregions are unknown. By analyzing CA3 network activity in the absence of each of its theta-modulated external excitatory inputs, we show necessary and unique contributions of the dentate gyrus (DG) and the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) to phase precession. DG inputs are essential for preferential spiking of CA3 cells during late theta phases and for organizing the temporal order of neuronal firing, while MEC inputs sharpen the temporal precision throughout the theta cycle. A computational model that accounts for empirical findings suggests that the unique contribution of DG inputs to theta-related spike timing is supported by targeting precisely timed inhibitory oscillations. Our results thus identify a novel and unique functional role of the DG for sequence coding in the CA3 circuit."
"Recent advances in spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) have provided new opportunities for characterizing spatial structures of various tissues. Graph-based geometric deep learning has gained widespread adoption for spatial domain identification tasks. Currently, most methods define adjacency relation between cells or spots by their spatial distance in SRT data, which overlooks key biological interactions like gene expression similarities, and leads to inaccuracies in spatial domain identification. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel method, SpaGRA (https://github.com/sunxue-yy/SpaGRA), for automatic multi-relationship construction based on graph augmentation. SpaGRA uses spatial distance as prior knowledge and dynamically adjusts edge weights with multi-head graph attention networks (GATs). This helps SpaGRA to uncover diverse node relationships and enhance message passing in geometric contrastive learning. Additionally, SpaGRA uses these multi-view relationships to construct negative samples, addressing sampling bias posed by random selection. Experimental results show that SpaGRA presents superior domain identification performance on multiple datasets generated from different protocols. Using SpaGRA, we analyze the functional regions in the mouse hypothalamus, identify key genes related to heart development in mouse embryos, and observe cancer-associated fibroblasts enveloping cancer cells in the latest Visium HD data. Overall, SpaGRA can effectively characterize spatial structures across diverse SRT datasets."
"Pemphigus vulgaris is a chronic autoimmune blistering disease with significant morbidity. Rituximab, approved as its first-line treatment, effectively induces remission. However, few studies have analysed the prognostic factors for improved rituximab outcomes. Therefore, this study aimed to identify such factors in a cohort of pemphigus vulgaris patients. A total of 142 pemphigus vulgaris patients treated with rituximab at Sheba Medical Center, with data encompassing demographics, comorbidities, disease characteristics, and treatment outcomes, were retrospectively examined. Results showed that 61.9% of patients previously treated with mycophenolate mofetil achieved partial remission, whereas only 34.7% achieved complete remission. Patients with diabetes mellitus exhibited a significantly shorter median time to relapse compared with those without. Patients with a disease duration ≤ 16 months before rituximab therapy exhibited a shorter median time to relapse. Moreover, previous dapsone treatment extended time to relapse. Notably, sex, age at symptom onset and rituximab therapy, ethnicity, comorbidities, skin involvement, weight, rituximab dosing protocol, and other variables were not statistically significant between the complete remission and partial remission groups. These findings highlight the influence of specific patient characteristics and treatment histories on response to rituximab and time to relapse in pemphigus vulgaris patients. Understanding these factors can aid clinicians in predicting treatment outcomes and selecting the appropriate patient population for rituximab therapy."
"Tick-borne infectious diseases caused by the spotted fever group Rickettsia (SFGR) have continuously emerging, with many previously unidentified SFGR species reported.

"Laboratory stewardship programs are increasingly adopted to enhance test utilization and improve patient care. Despite their potential, implementation within complex healthcare systems remains challenging. Benchmarking metrics helps institutions compare their performance against peers or best practices. However, the application in laboratory stewardship is underrepresented in the literature."
"Improving congestion with diuretic therapy is crucial in the treatment of heart failure (HF). However, despite the use of loop diuretics, diuresis may be inadequate and congestion persists, which is known as diuretic resistance. Diuretic resistance and residual congestion are associated with a higher risk of rehospitalization and mortality. Causes of diuretic resistance in HF include diuretic pharmacokinetic changes, renal hemodynamic perturbations, neurohumoral activations, renal tubular remodeling, and use of nephrotoxic drugs as well as patient comorbidities. Combination diuretic therapy (CDT) has been advocated for the treatment of diuretic resistance. Thiazides, acetazolamides, tolvaptan, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, and sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors are among the candidates, but none of these treatments has yet demonstrated significant diuretic efficacy or improved prognosis. At present, it is essential to identify and treat the causes of diuretic resistance in individual patients and to use CDT based on a better understanding of the characteristics of each drug to achieve adequate diuresis. Further research is needed to effectively assess and manage diuretic resistance and ultimately improve patient outcomes."
Smoking may have a protective role in developing ulcerative colitis (UC) but have the opposite effect on Crohn's disease (CD). This study aimed to determine the risk of developing inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) according to smoking status and onset age of smoking.
"Mendelian randomization (MR) uses genetic variants associated with an exposure (eg, high blood pressure) as instrumental variables to test causal effects on an outcome (eg, atrial fibrillation [AF]). By leveraging the random assortment of genetic variants during gamete formation, MR reduces biases like confounding and reverse causation. We screened 391 papers, examining 277 that applied MR to investigate arrhythmia and, in others, cardiovascular traits, lifestyle, behavioral traits, and body composition. Our analysis focused on MR studies of arrhythmia and cardiovascular traits. Key findings highlight high systolic blood pressure, low resting heart rate, elevated cardiac troponin I levels, coronary artery disease, and heart failure as risk factors for AF, whereas AF itself increases heart failure risk. As genetic data become more accessible, MR's relevance grows. Sensitivity analyses and integrating MR with other methodologies in a triangulation framework enhance the robustness of causal inferences by navigating different biases."
"Accurate taxonomic classification in genome databases is essential for reliable biological research and effective data sharing. Mislabeling or inaccuracies in genome annotations can lead to incorrect scientific conclusions and hinder the reproducibility of research findings. Despite advances in genome analysis techniques, challenges persist in ensuring precise and reliable taxonomic assignments. Existing tools for genome verification often involve extensive computational resources or lengthy processing times, which can limit their accessibility and scalability for large-scale projects. There is a need for more efficient, user-friendly solutions that can handle diverse datasets and provide accurate results with minimal computational demands. This work aimed to address these challenges by introducing a novel tool that enhances taxonomic accuracy, offers a user-friendly interface, and supports large-scale analyses."
"Adaptive radiations are rich laboratories for exploring, testing, and understanding key theories in evolution and ecology because they offer spectacular displays of speciation and ecological adaptation. Particular challenges to the study of adaptive radiation include high levels of species richness, rapid speciation, and gene flow between species. Over the last decade, high-throughput sequencing technologies and access to population genomic data have lessened these challenges by enabling the analysis of samples from many individual organisms at whole-genome scales. Here we review how population genomic data have facilitated our knowledge of adaptive radiation in five key areas: (1) phylogenetics, (2) hybridization, (3) timing and rates of diversification, (4) the genomic basis of trait evolution, and (5) the role of genome structure in divergence. We review current knowledge in each area, highlight outstanding questions, and focus on methods that facilitate detection of complex patterns in the divergence and demography of populations through time. It is clear that population genomic data are revolutionising the ability to reconstruct evolutionary history in rapidly diversifying clades. Additionally, studies are increasingly emphasising the central role of gene flow, re-use of standing genetic variation during adaptation, and structural genomic elements as facilitators of the speciation process in adaptive radiations. We highlight hybridization-and the hypothesized processes by which it shapes diversification-and questions seeking to bridge the divide between microevolutionary and macroevolutionary processes as rich areas for future study. Overall, access to population genomic data has facilitated an exciting era in adaptive radiation research, with implications for deeper understanding of fundamental evolutionary processes across the tree of life."
This study aimed to evaluate the modifying role of dietary fiber intake in the relationship between COPD and cognitive performance.
"Endothelial cells (ECs) that line blood vessels act as gatekeepers and shape the metabolic environment of every organ system. In normal conditions, endothelial cells are relatively quiescent with organ-specific expression signatures and metabolic profiles. In cancer, ECs are metabolically reprogrammed to promote the formation of new blood vessels to fuel tumor growth and metastasis. In addition to EC's role on tumor cells, the tortuous tumor vasculature contributes to an immunosuppressive environment by limiting T lymphocyte infiltration and activity while also promoting the recruitment of other accessory pro-angiogenic immune cells. These elements aid in the metastatic spreading of cancer cells and contribute to therapeutic resistance. The concept of restoring a more stabilized vasculature in concert with cancer immunotherapy is emerging as a potential approach to overcoming barriers in cancer treatment. This review summarizes the metabolism of endothelial cells, their regulation of nutrient uptake and delivery, and their impact in shaping the tumor microenvironment and anti-tumor immunity. We highlight new therapeutic approaches that target the tumor vasculature and harness the immune response. Appreciating the integration of metabolic state and nutrient levels and the crosstalk among immune cells, tumor cells, and ECs in the TME may provide new avenues for therapeutic intervention."
"Soft-tissue defect is commonly seen in immediate maxillary posterior implantation because of tooth extraction wound and tension from bone graft. Bone graft materials exposure has a significant detrimental influence on bone augmentation. However, previous studies lack sufficient evidence to guide wound closure after immediate posterior implantation. This study aims to use 3D integration technology to evaluate the effect of porcine collagen matrix versus rotated pedicle palatal connective tissue flap (RPPCTF) on the soft-tissue closure after the immediate maxillary posterior implantation."

"Despite existing evidence of the high predictive value of natriuretic peptides (NPs) in patients with heart failure (HF), patients treated with guideline-directed therapy who have low or near-normal NP levels are unlikely to be correctly stratified for risk of clinical outcomes. The aim of this study is to detect plausible predictors for poor one-year clinical outcomes in patients with HFpEF and low NT-proBNP treated with in accordance with conventional guidelines."
"Digital health in biomedical research and its expanding list of potential clinical applications are rapidly evolving. A combination of new digital health technologies (DHTs), novel uses of existing DHTs through artificial intelligence- and machine learning-based algorithms, and improved integration and analysis of data from multiple sources has enabled broader use and delivery of these tools for research and health care purposes. The aim of this study was to assess the growth and overall trajectory of DHT funding through a National Institutes of Health (NIH)-wide grant portfolio analysis."
"The aim of this study is to describe a protocol for evaluating the effects of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) on pain following breast augmentation surgery. Fifty-four women will be randomly allocated into two groups: active TENS and placebo. Pain will be assessed at rest and during movement, before and immediately after TENS application. Secondary outcomes include pain one-hour post-treatment, respiratory muscle strength, patient satisfaction, and analgesic use in the first four hours post-surgery. The results of this clinical trial could enhance the management of post-operative pain in breast augmentation surgery using non-pharmacological interventions, potentially reducing costs and improving patient experience.Clinical Trial Registration: RBR-96h3k97."
"Despite the reported efficacy of overground robotic exoskeleton (ORE) for rehabilitation of mobility post-stroke, its effectiveness in real-world practice is still debated. We analysed prospectively collected data from Improving Mobility Via Exoskeleton (IMOVE), a multicentre clinical implementation programme of ORE enrolling participants with various neurological conditions and were given options to choose between 12 sessions of ORE or conventional therapy (control)."
"Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder diagnosed by clinicians and experts through questionnaires, observations, and interviews. Current diagnostic practices focus on social and communication impairments, which often emerge later in life. This delay in detection results in missed opportunities for early intervention. Gait, a motor behavior, has been previously shown to be aberrant in children with ASD and may be a biomarker for early detection and diagnosis of ASD. The current study assessed gait in children with ASD using a single RGB camera-based pose estimation method by MediaPipe (MP). Data from 32 children with ASD and 29 typically developing (TD) children were collected. The ASD group exhibited significantly reduced step length and right elbow° and increased right shoulder° relative to TD children. Four machine learning (ML) algorithms were employed to classify the ASD and TD children based on the statistically significant gait parameters. The binomial logistic regression (Logit) performed the best, with an accuracy of 0.82, in classifying the ASD and TD children. The present study demonstrates the use of gait analysis and ML techniques for the early detection of ASD."
"Alzheimer's disease (AD) has complex pathophysiology involving numerous cell types and brain processes. Astrocyte involvement in AD is gaining increased attention, however a complete characterisation of astrocytic changes in the AD human brain is warranted. Astrocytes perform important homeostatic functions including regulation of the extracellular microenvironment, critical for the health of all brain cells. We have investigated changes to key astrocyte proteins involved in the regulation of CNS extracellular environment in the human AD middle temporal gyrus (MTG): aquaporin-4 (AQP-4), glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1) and inwardly-rectifying potassium channel 4.1 (Kir4.1). We have used a high-throughput human brain tissue microarray platform with automated quantitative image analysis to measure protein changes in a large cohort of neurological control and AD cases. We found increased astrocytic glial acidic fibrillary protein (GFAP), AQP-4, GLT-1 and Kir4.1 expression that correlates with advancing Braak stage, increasing amyloid pathology and, to a greater extent, the degree of tau pathology. We confirmed that Kir4.1 immunostaining is predominantly found in astrocytes and revealed a novel redistribution of Kir4.1 protein expression into astrocytic processes in the AD MTG. Our study presents novel and potentially modifiable glial changes in the AD human brain that are critical to our understanding of disease pathogenesis."
"Proliferation of specific nucleotide sequences within the coding and non-coding regions of numerous genes has been implicated in approximately 40 neurodegenerative disorders. Cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy and vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS), a neurodegenerative disorder, is distinguished by a pathological triad of sensory neuropathy, bilateral vestibular areflexia and cerebellar impairments. It manifests in adults gradually and is autosomal recessive and multi-system ataxia. Predominantly, CANVAS is associated with biallelic AAGGG repeat expansions in intron 2 of the RFC1 gene. Although various motifs have been identified, only a subset induces pathological consequences, by forming stable secondary structures that disrupt gene functions both in vitro and in vivo. The pathogenesis of CANVAS remains a subject of intensive research, yet its precise mechanisms remain elusive. Herein, we aim to comprehensively review the epidemiology, clinical ramifications, molecular mechanisms, genetics, and potential therapeutics in light of the current findings, extending an overview of the most significant research on CANVAS."

"Cancer immunotherapy using immune checkpoint blockades has emerged as a promising therapeutic approach. However, immunotherapy faces challenges such as low response rates in solid tumors, necessitating strategies to remodel the immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) into an immune-activated state. One of the primary approaches to achieve this transformation is through the induction of immunogenic cell death (ICD). Herein, we discussed strategies to maximize ICD induction using nanoparticles. In particular, this review highlighted various studies integrating chemotherapy, radiation therapy (RT), photodynamic therapy (PDT), and photothermal therapy (PTT) with nanoparticle-based immunotherapy. The research covered in this review aims to provide valuable insights for future studies on nanoparticle-assisted immunotherapy."

"In the recent MONALEESA-2, MONALEESA-3, and MONALEESA-7 clinical trials, the addition of ribociclib, a CDK4/6 inhibitor, to standard endocrine therapy significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) compared with hormone therapy alone in the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic estrogen receptor-positive (ER) and HER2-negative breast cancer. However, its toxicity raises concerns when administered concomitantly with radiotherapy, leading most radiotherapists and medical oncologists to prefer to discontinue Ribociclib during radiotherapy (RT). Although there are insufficient published data on this combination, our preliminary experience with the first 2 patients treated at Institut Curie suggests promising results when using Ribociclib with Letrozole or Fulvestrant concurrently with palliative radiotherapy in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. Our study aimed to evaluate the safety of combining Ribociclib with palliative radiotherapy in patients with metastatic breast cancer, providing crucial insights for clinical decision-making."
"We study the large-time behavior of an ensemble of entities obeying replicator-like stochastic dynamics with mean-field interactions as a model for a primordial ecology. We prove the propagation-of-chaos property and establish conditions for the strong persistence of the N-replicator system and the existence of invariant distributions for a class of associated McKean-Vlasov dynamics. In particular, our results show that, unlike typical models of neutral ecology, fitness equivalence does not need to be assumed but emerges as a condition for the persistence of the system. Further, neutrality is associated with a unique Dirichlet invariant probability measure. We illustrate our findings with some simple case studies, provide numerical results, and discuss our conclusions in the light of Neutral Theory in ecology."
Remimazolam is a novel intravenous sedative/anesthetic drug that belongs to the ultra-short-acting class of benzodiazepines. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of postoperative use of remimazolam in preventing emergence agitation (EA) in adults following nasal surgery.
"The objective of the present study is to investigate nasal and oral vowel production in French-speaking children with cochlear implants (CIs) and children with typical hearing (TH). Vowel nasality relies primarily on acoustic cues that may be less effectively transmitted by the implant. The study investigates how children with CIs manage to produce these segments in French, a language with contrastive vowel nasalization."
"Emergent phenomena exhibit interesting dynamics when considered individually. The present article examines two emergent processes that could be occurring simultaneously in an intense team interaction: the emergence of leaders and the emergence of autonomic synchrony within teams making dynamic decisions. In the framework of panarchy theory and related studies on complex systems, autonomic synchrony would be a fast dynamic that is shaped or controlled by leadership emergence, which is a slower dynamic. The present study outlines three distinct statistical distributions - the swallowtail catastrophe model for phase shifts, inverse power laws that indicate fractal processes, and lognormal distributions - that are known to characterize emergent processes of different types. The objective was to determine the extent to which the two emergent processes reflected the same dynamics. Research participants were 136 undergraduates who were organized into teams of three to five members playing the computer-game Counter-Strike while wearing GSR sensors to measure autonomic arousal levels in a steady stream. After approximately two hours of interaction, team members rated each other on leadership behaviors. Autonomic synchrony was analyzed as a driver-empath process that produced individual driver scores (the total influence of one person on the rest of the group) and empath scores (the total influence of the group on one person). Results showed that leadership emergence displayed the swallowtail configuration that was consistent with prior studies. Autonomic synchrony started as a simpler process and unfolded into a swallowtail catastrophe toward the end of the experimental session. Lognormal distributions were second-best representations of all variables. Inverse power laws were least descriptive of any of the research variables. The implications of the temporal dynamics of the co-emerging processes for training and team development are discussed."

"This case report presents a complex medical scenario involving early 60s female patient with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) complicated by Evans syndrome, characterised by autoimmune haemolytic anaemia and immune thrombocytopenia. The patient had received various treatments, including steroids, rituximab, cyclosporine and acalabrutinib. The patient's neurological symptoms began around 3 years prior to presentation, with shaking of her right leg, followed by shaking of both hands, particularly the left hand. She experienced shaking during activities and at rest. Additional symptoms included voice changes, numbness in the feet, dizziness, faintness, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, headaches, walking difficulty, speech changes and back pain. Neurological examination revealed resting tremors, bradykinesia, rigidity and infrequent blinking. An MRI of the brain revealed a 28 mm enhancing intra-axial lesion in the right frontal parietal lobe, accompanied by a 7 mm nodule in the left parietal lobe, both suggestive of neoplastic aetiology. A surgical resection was performed, identifying septate branching fungal hyphae consistent with Aspergillus species, leading to the diagnosis of cerebral aspergillosis. Voriconazole was initiated and subsequently adjusted based on therapeutic drug levels. The patient's treatment course was complicated by declining platelets, diagnosed as thrombocytopenia, and a positive COVID-19 test result. She received rituximab, immunoglobulin therapy and antifungal treatment adjustments. The patient's clinical condition improved, including a reduction in tremors and regained mobility. This case underscores the challenges of managing a patient with CLL-associated immune complications, cerebral aspergillosis and a dynamic treatment plan. Clinicians must consider individualised therapeutic strategies and monitor for treatment-related complications in complex cases like this one."

This study aims to evaluate the association between WWI and the prevalence of GSD."
"Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, a type of T lymphocytes with innate-like characteristics, are crucial in bridging innate and adaptive immunity. When activated, MAIT cells release various inflammatory molecules and swiftly respond to antigens. Notably, numerous studies highlight the significant impact of MAIT cells on tumors and various immune disorders by influencing the immune microenvironment. Oral lichen planus (OLP) is an immune-mediated inflammatory condition mainly involving T lymphocytes. Previous research primarily focused on T cells alone, neglecting the broader immune environment. However, there is a current growing recognition of the complex interactions among multiple immune cells and inflammatory factors in patients with OLP. This immune microenvironment comprises T lymphocytes, fibroblasts, keratinocytes, dendritic cells, macrophages, inflammation-related cytokines, and chemokines, orchestrating intricate interactions that contribute to OLP initiation and persistence. Therefore, this review consolidates current research on the interplay between MAIT cells and other immune cells within the OLP microenvironment. We also delve into potential mechanisms through which MAIT cells regulate inflammation in patients with OLP, aiming to further explore the role of MAIT cells in these patients."
"With recent clinical adoption of online adaptive radiation therapy (oART) and the increased workload associated with adaptive radiation therapy (RT), proper staffing for medical physicists is paramount to safe clinical operation.

We aim to identify the key metabolic changes responsible for cancer cell survival from glucose limitation and elucidate its mechanism."
"Ewing sarcoma (ES) is characterized by EWS::FLI1 or EWS::ERG fusion proteins. Knowing that ion channels are involved in tumorigenesis, this work aimed to study the involvement of the KCNN1 gene, which encodes the SK1 potassium channel, in ES development. Bioinformatics analyses from databases were used to study KCNN1 expression in patients and cell lines. Molecular approaches and in vitro assays were used to study the transcriptional regulation of KCNN1 and its involvement in the regulation of ES cell proliferation. KCNN1 is overexpressed in ES patient biopsies, and its expression is inversely correlated with patient survival. EWS::FLI1, like EWS::ERG, promotes KCNN1 and SK1 expression, binding to GGAA microsatellites near the promoter of KCNN1 isoforms. KCNN1 is involved in the regulation of ES cell proliferation, with its silencing being associated with a slowing of the cell cycle, and its expression modulates membrane potential and therefore calcium flux. These results highlight that KCNN1 is a direct target of EWS::FLI1 and EWS::ERG and demonstrate that KCNN1 is involved in the regulation of intracellular calcium activity and ES cell proliferation, making it a promising therapeutic target in ES."
"The increasing demand for sustainable alternatives to conventional antifungal agents has prompted extensive research into the antifungal properties of plant essential oils (EOs). This study investigates the use of EOs mixture (Origanum vulgare, Moringa oleifera, and Cinnamomum verum) for controlling fungal deterioration in wall paintings at the archaeological Youssef Kamal Palace in Nag Hammadi, Egypt. Fungal isolates were collected from deteriorated wall paintings and identified using phenotypic and genotypic analyses. Aspergillus sp. was found to be the predominant species (50%), followed by Penicillium sp. (16.7%), Fusarium sp. (16.7%), and others. They were genetically identified to be Aspergillus oryzae, Aspergillus niger, Penicillium chrysogenum, Fusarium solani, Alternaria alternata, Botrytis cinerea, and Trichoderma viride. The antifungal activity of three individual oils (oregano, moringa and cinnamon) was evaluated against the most predominant A. niger strain. Out of the three oils, oregano oil showed the strongest antifungal effect with an inhibition zone diameter (IZD) of 4.5 cm followed by moringa (3.5 cm) and cinnamon (3.2 cm). A mixture design approach optimized the EOs combination, with the most effective composition being (44% oregano, 46% moringa, 10% cinnamon), yielding an IZD of 6.5 cm. The optimized EOs mixture demonstrated complete inhibition against all tested fungal strains. The minimal inhibitory concentration tests showed varying efficacies against different fungal strains, with MIC values ranging from 125 to 500 µg/mL. GC-MS analysis identified the major bioactive compounds: carvacrol (83.25%) in oregano, trans-13-octadecenoic acid (22.62%) in moringa, and cinnamaldehyde (24.42%) in cinnamon. Cytotoxicity testing on human skin fibroblasts (HSF) showed minimal toxicity of EOs mixture with 87.64% cell viability at 100 µg/ml. Colorimetric measurements revealed some colour changes in experimental painting samples, particularly with cinnamon oil on white pigment (ΔE = 9.64) and moringa oil on a yellow pigment (ΔE = 16.31). However, oregano oil consistently showed the least impact across all pigments. These findings demonstrate the potential of the EOs combination as an effective, eco-friendly approach to mitigating fungal deterioration in wall paintings, contributing to sustainable conservation strategies for cultural heritage preservation."
"The Joint AAPM-ESTRO TG-360 is developing a quantitative framework to evaluate treatment verification systems used for patient-specific quality assurance (PSQA). A subgroup was commissioned to determine which potential failure modes had the greatest risk to treatment quality and safety, and therefore should be evaluated as part of the PSQA verification."
"In patients with sepsis, platelets are activated and adhere to neutrophils, forming platelet-leukocyte aggregates (PLAs) that lead to the development of MODS. ARDS is one of the main manifestations of septic MODS. We designed this study to explore the effects of different anti-plate therapy drugs on platelet activation and platelet-leukocyte aggregate (PLA) formation in the early stage of septic ARDS."
"Nutrition and its associated inflammation have been acknowledged as vital factors in the etiopathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and liver fibrosis. The nutritional risk index (NRI) has been widely recognized as a valid indicator of nutritional status in several diseases, including osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease. However, the role of NRI in NAFLD and liver fibrosis remains unclear."
"Consumer demand for pasture raised, antibiotic-free poultry products has led to an increase in pastured poultry operations within the United States. Given the level of environmental interaction and the potential increase in exposure to foodborne pathogens in these settings, a greater understanding of the prevalence and diversity of Campylobacter populations inherent within pastured poultry flocks is needed."
"Polymerase delta-interacting protein 2 (Poldip2) is a novel regulator of vascular permeability that has been shown to be involved in aggravating blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption following stroke; however, the underlying mechanisms are unknown. While endothelial tight junctions (TJ) are critical mediators of BBB permeability, the effect of Poldip2 on TJ function has not been elucidated yet. Here, we aim to define the mechanism by which Poldip2 mediates BBB disruption, specifically focusing on phosphorylation and stabilization of the TJ integral protein ZO-1."
"Over the last few years, many efforts have been made to leverage historical information in clinical trials. Incorporating historical data into current trials allows for a more efficient design, smaller studies, or shorter duration and may potentially increase the relative amount of information on efficacy and safety. Despite these advantages, it is crucial to select external data sources appropriately to avoid introducing potential bias into the new study. This is where borrowing methods become useful. We illustrate and compare the latest methods of borrowing historical data in a single-arm phase II clinical trial setting, examining their impact on statistical power and type I error."
"Fewer than 5 % of soft tissue sarcomas arise in the foot and ankle. It can be difficult to distinguish between benign and malignant lesions which leads to a delay in diagnosis. Initial inappropriate procedures limit options for limb salvage and increasing rates of local recurrence. Our aim is to improve understanding of the presentation and management of these rare tumors to reduce delays in diagnosis and decrease the occurrence of inappropriate or unwarranted procedures. A prospectively maintained database of 376 new referrals to the West of Scotland regional musculoskeletal oncology service for soft tissue lesions of the foot, ankle, and lower leg over a 10-year period was analysed retrospectively. An assessment was made of patient demographics, presentation, anatomical location, diagnosis, classification, management, and outcomes for all patients. Of all new referrals, 53.5 % were diagnosed with primary benign soft tissue tumors and 16 % with primary malignant soft tissue tumors. The most common primary benign tumor in our population was schwannoma (15.9 %) and primary malignant tumor was undifferentiated sarcoma (26.7 %). In the foot alone, soft tissue sarcomas most commonly occurred in the forefoot (44.4 %). The most common presenting complaints were rest pain and focal swelling. Symptoms were present for on average 7 months prior to referral. Death from disease in sarcomas was 41.7 % over a 10 year follow up period, higher than other body areas. Soft tissue sarcomas in the foot and ankle remain a diagnostic challenge. Local biopsies should only be performed following discussion with an oncology surgeon. We have provided a management protocol in order to reduce the number of inappropriate procedures performed in this group and expedite referral to specialist centres, optimising clinical outcomes and reducing the cost of litigation to healthcare services."

"Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) is a fatal disease with poor survival. Increasing evidence show that hypoxia-induced exosomes are associated with cancer progression. Here, we aimed to investigate the function of hsa_circ_0007678 (circR3HCC1L) and hypoxic PAAD cell-derived exosomal circR3HCC1L in PAAD progression. Through the exoRBase 2.0 database, we screened for a circular RNA circR3HCC1L related to PAAD. Changes of circR3HCC1L in PAAD samples and cells were analyzed with real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Cell proliferation, migration, invasion were analyzed by colony formation, cell counting, and transwell assays. Measurements of glucose uptake and lactate production were done using corresponding kits. Several protein levels were detected by western blotting. The regulation mechanism of circR3HCC1L was verified by dual-luciferase reporter, RNA immunoprecipitation, and RNA pull-down assays. Exosomes were separated by differential ultracentrifugation. Animal experiments were used to verify the function of hypoxia-derived exosomal circR3HCC1L. CircR3HCC1L was upregulated in PAAD samples and hypoxic PAAD cells. Knockdown of circR3HCC1L decreased hypoxia-driven PAAD cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and glycolysis. Hypoxic PAAD cell-derived exosomes had higher levels of circR3HCC1L, hypoxic PAAD cell-derived exosomal circR3HCC1L promoted normoxic cancer cell malignant transformation and glycolysis in vitro and xenograft tumor growth in mouse models in vivo. Mechanistically, circR3HCC1L regulated pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) expression via sponging miR-873-5p. Also, PKM2 overexpression or miR-873-5p silencing offset circR3HCC1L knockdown-mediated effects on hypoxia-challenged PAAD cell malignant transformation and glycolysis. Hypoxic PAAD cell-derived exosomal circR3HCC1L facilitated PAAD progression through the miR-873-5p/PKM2 axis, highlighting the contribution of hypoxic PAAD cell-derived exosomal circR3HCC1L in PAAD."
"Despite advances in pharmacological therapies, migraine patients are often drug resistant. Further therapeutic options in this field are, therefore, desirable. Recent studies have highlighted the efficacy of ketogenic diet (KD) on improving migraine, but data on their long-term efficacy and safety are lacking. In this study, we retrospectively evaluated the long-term effectiveness of the modified Atkins ketogenic diet (MAD) in episodic or chronic drug-resistant migraine patients. 52 patients diagnosed with episodic or chronic drug-resistant migraine under modified Atkins ketogenic diet (MAD) were evaluated. In total, 41 patients followed the diet for 6 months and 33 for 12 months. After both 6 and 12 months, frequency, length, and intensity of migraine episodes, as well as the number of medications significantly decreased with respect to the start of the diet. Body mass index, high sensitivity PCR, diastolic blood pressure, fasting plasma insulin and HOMA index were also significantly reduced both after 6 and 12 months. No major metabolic changes were observed during MAD treatment. In conclusion, KD has been shown to be effective and safe in the long-term treatment of drug-resistant migraine. A high dropout rate still remains an important factor, which often limits its use."
"Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PPCI) is the preferred treatment for ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) patients in both PCI centers and those transferred from non-PCI centers, provided it can be performed in a timely manner. The challenges in transferring patients from non-PCI centers include not only potential delays beyond 120 min but also the risk of overwhelming the resources at the PPCI hospital. We report a novel strategy implemented within the Serdang STEMI Network involving immediate transfer of patients back to the originating hospitals within 2 h post procedure."
"The Homeotic complex (Hox) genes play a crucial role in determining segment identity and appendage morphology in bilaterian animals along the antero-posterior axis. Recent studies have expanded to agricultural pests such as fall armyworm (FAW), scientifically known as Spodoptera frugiperda J. E. Smith (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), which significantly threatens global agricultural productivity. However, the specific role of the hox gene Sfabd-B in FAW remains unexplored. This research investigates the spatial and temporal expression patterns of Sfabd-B in various tissues at different developmental stages using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Additionally, we explored the potential function of the Sfabd-B gene located in the FAW genome using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. The larval mutant phenotypes can be classified into three subgroups as compared with wild-type individuals, that is, an excess of pedis in the posterior abdomen, deficient pedis due to segmental fusion and deviations in the posterior abdominal segments. Importantly, significant differences in mutant phenotypes between male and female individuals were also evident during the pupal and adult phases. Notably, both the decapentaplegic (dpp) and cuticular protein 12 (cp 12) genes displayed a substantial marked decrease in expression levels in the copulatory organ of male mutants and the ovipositor of female mutants compared with the wild type. These findings highlight the importance of Sfabd-B in genital tract patterning, providing a potential target for improving genetic control."
"The Delphi technique is a structured, iterative group survey method utilized to reach a consensus among experts in a field regarding topics with evidence-based equipoise.

"The current research introduces a model-free ultra-local model (MFULM) controller that utilizes the multi-agent on-policy reinforcement learning (MAOPRL) technique for remotely regulating blood pressure through precise drug dosing in a closed-loop system. Within the closed-loop system, there exists a MFULM controller, an observer, and an intelligent MAOPRL algorithm. Initially, a flexible MFULM controller is created to make adjustments to blood pressure and medication dosages. Following this, an observer is incorporated into the main controller to improve performance and stability by estimating states and disturbances. The controller parameters are optimized using MAOPRL in an adaptive manner, which involves the use of an actor-critic approach in an adaptive fashion. This approach enhances the adaptability of the controller by allowing for dynamic modifications to dosage and blood pressure control parameters. In the presence of disturbances or instabilities, the critic's feedback aids the actor in adjusting actions to reduce their impact, utilizing a complementary strategy to tackle deficiencies in the primary controller. Lastly, various evaluations, including assessments under normal conditions, adaptability between patients, and stability evaluations against mixed disturbances, have been carried out to confirm the efficiency and viability of the proposed method."

"We introduce a general theory that explains the transient dynamic electrophoresis of a soft particle in an electrolyte solution when an oscillating electric field is suddenly applied. A simple approximate analytic expression is derived for the transient dynamic electrophoretic mobility of a soft particle that can be applied to practical situations. It is found that the mobility shows a damped oscillation, approaching its final value, similar to the behavior of a hard particle."
"FMS-like tyrosine receptor kinase 3 (FLT3) mutations, the most common genetic alterations found in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, have been pursued as an ideal drug discovery target for the AML therapy. Taking compound 2 as lead, a series of pyridine derivatives bearing 1,2,3-triazole moiety were rationally designed and synthesized. The bioassays confirmed that these derivatives exerted potent antileukemia effects, and compound 12y was found to be the most potent one. 12y displayed double-digital nanomolar inhibitory activities against FLT3-ITD and FLT3-ITD driven human AML MOLM-13 cells as well as high selectivity over FLT3-ITD non-addicted cell lines. In addition, kinase profiling versus over 51 kinases demonstrated that 12y was potent against FLT3-ITD and VEGFR2. Moreover, treatment of MOLM-13 cells with 12y resulted in downregulated phosphorylation levels of FLT3 and STAT5, as well as cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. With the acceptable oral bioavailability of 19.2 % in SD rats, 12y prolonged the survival rate of NSG mice dose-dependently in MOLM-13 inoculated xenograft model without obvious toxicity. Overall, this study might provide a new insight for the development of novel FLT3 inhibitors."
"The efficacy and safety of combining H1 antihistamines (AHs) for treating urticaria are currently unclear. This scoping review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of H1 AH combinations in the management of urticaria up to May 2023. The search encompassed databases such as PubMed, Web of Science, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the China Biological Medicine Database. The inclusion criteria comprised randomised controlled trials (RCTs), non-randomised trials (NRTs), case reports, and case series focusing on urticaria treatment. Initially screening 12,887 studies, this review ultimately selected 109 studies involving 11,435 patients. These studies documented 43 different combination treatments across 11 types of urticaria. In comparison to monotherapy, combination therapy exhibited superior efficacy in 94 studies that reported treatment efficacy. Regarding adverse drug reactions (ADRs), 67 studies disclosed ADR incidences, with combination therapy showing lower ADR rates in 32 studies. Additionally, 7 studies reported similar ADR rates between combination therapy and monotherapy with AHs. Common ADRs included symptoms such as drowsiness, nausea, fatigue, dry mouth, dizziness, and headache, while less frequent side effects encompassed hypotension, otitis media, polyuria, rhinorrhoea, abnormal liver function, and rash. ADR rates ranged from 0% to 21% in the treatment group, and from 0.5% to 75% in the control group. Importantly, patients generally tolerated these ADRs well, with symptoms resolving upon discontinuation of treatment. The study's findings suggest that combining AHs leads to enhanced efficacy and reduced safety risks compared to monotherapy in the context of urticaria treatment. These results advocate for considering combination therapy as a viable option in clinical practice, especially for chronic urticaria cases. Nonetheless, caution is advised, and close monitoring for potential ADRs is crucial during treatment."

"Neurophysiology has long progressed through exploratory experiments and chance discoveries. Anecdotes abound of researchers listening to spikes in real time and noticing patterns of activity related to ongoing stimuli or behaviors. With the advent of large-scale recordings, such close observation of data has become difficult. To find patterns in large-scale neural data, we developed 'Rastermap', a visualization method that displays neurons as a raster plot after sorting them along a one-dimensional axis based on their activity patterns. We benchmarked Rastermap on realistic simulations and then used it to explore recordings of tens of thousands of neurons from mouse cortex during spontaneous, stimulus-evoked and task-evoked epochs. We also applied Rastermap to whole-brain zebrafish recordings; to wide-field imaging data; to electrophysiological recordings in rat hippocampus, monkey frontal cortex and various cortical and subcortical regions in mice; and to artificial neural networks. Finally, we illustrate high-dimensional scenarios where Rastermap and similar algorithms cannot be used effectively."
"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) represents a substantial threat to global public health, complicating the treatment of common infections and leading to prolonged illness and escalated healthcare expenses. To effectively combat AMR, timely and accurate detection is crucial for AMR surveillance and individual-based therapy. Phenotypic antibiotic resistance testing (AST) has long been considered the gold standard in clinical applications, serving as the foundation for clinical AMR diagnosis and optimized therapy. It has significantly contributed to ensuring patients' health and the development of novel antimicrobials. Despite advancements in automated culture-based AST technologies, inherent limitations impede the widespread use of phenotypic AST in AMR surveillance. Genotypic AST technologies offer a promising alternative option, exhibiting advantages of rapidity, high sensitivity, and specificity. With the continuous advancement and expanding applications of genotypic AST technologies, such as microfluidics, mass spectrometry, and high-resolution melting curve analysis, new vigor has been injected into the development and clinical implementation of genotypic AST technologies. In this narrative review, we discuss the principles, applications, and advancements of emerging genotypic AST methods in clinical settings. The comprehensive review aims to highlight the significant scientific potential of emerging genotypic AST technologies in clinical AMR diagnosis, providing insights to enhance existing methods and explore novel approaches."
"After surgical repair of rotator cuff (RC) tears, the torn tendon heals unsatisfactorily to the greater tuberosity owing to limited regeneration of the bone-tendon (BT) insertion. This situation motivates the need for new interventions to enhance BT healing in the RC repair site."
"The extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK/MAPK) is a positive regulator of cell proliferation often upregulated in cancer. Its Caenorhabditis elegans ortholog MPK-1 stimulates germline stem cell (GSC) proliferation nonautonomously from the intestine or somatic gonad. How MPK-1 can perform this task from either of these two tissues however remains unclear. We reasoned that somatic MPK-1 activity could lead to the generation of proproliferative small molecules that could transfer from the intestine and/or somatic gonad to the germline. Here, in support of this hypothesis, we demonstrate that a significant fraction of the small membrane-impermeable fluorescent molecule, 5-carboxyfluorescein, transfers to the germline after its microinjection in the animal's intestine. The larger part of this transfer targets oocytes and requires the germline receptor mediated endocytosis 2 (RME-2) yolk receptor. A minor quantity of the dye is however distributed independently from RME-2 and more widely in the animal, including the distal germline, gonadal sheath, coelomocytes, and hypodermis. We further show that the intestine-to-germline transfer efficiency of this RME-2 independent fraction does not vary together with GSC proliferation rates or MPK-1 activity. Therefore, if germline proliferation was influenced by small membrane-impermeable molecules generated in the intestine, it is unlikely that proliferation would be regulated at the level of molecule transfer rate. Finally, we show that conversely, a similar fraction of germline injected 5-carboxyfluorescein transfers to the intestine, demonstrating transfer bidirectionality. Altogether, our results establish the possibility of an intestine-to-germline signaling axis mediated by small membrane-impermeable molecules that could promote GSC proliferation cell nonautonomously downstream of MPK-1 activity."
"Osteoarthritis of the scaphotrapeziotrapezoidal joint is frequent but often pain-free or well tolerated with non-surgical treatment. Surgical options are numerous and none seems to have clear evidence of superiority. In addition to well-established procedures, such as scaphotrapeziotrapezoidal joint arthrodesis, distal scaphoid resection and trapeziectomy, more recent surgical techniques have been reported. These include scaphotrapeziotrapezoidal arthroplasty and arthroscopic treatment. This article provides an overview of the procedures and their outcomes that can be proposed for isolated scaphotrapeziotrapezoidal joint osteoarthritis and when combined with symptomatic osteoarthritis of the thumb carpometacarpal joint or of the radiocarpal and midcarpal joints."

"Nursing students often experience anxiety, stress, and fear during a clinical rotation in a mental health setting due to stressors and biases toward the setting as well as lack experience in caring for patients with mental health conditions. One in four people worldwide suffers from a mental disorder; therefore, it is critical that nurses feel confident interacting with these patients to provide equitable care. Undergraduate training is a critical period for changing students' attitudes toward this population. This study's goal was twofold. First, we offered students' exposure to common behaviors and symptoms displayed by a patient with mental illness through an engaging and immersive virtual reality simulation experience before taking care of patients in a clinical setting. Second, we aimed to determine if a virtual reality simulation will change students' attitude and stigma, favorably, toward patients with mental health conditions. We used a mixed-method comparative analysis to collect information and identify themes on undergraduate students' attitudes and stigma toward patients with mental health conditions. Our findings demonstrate that virtual reality simulations enhance awareness and sensitivity to the situations of others (empathy) while improving their communication skills. The use of virtual reality in a baccalaureate curriculum deepens the understanding of health equity in behavioral health for nursing students."
"Two soybean protein isolates (SPI), one of high (GN) and one of low molecular weight (DN) were prepared. Nanoparticles (NPs) possessing a heterogeneous spatial molecular distribution were verified in both SPI solutions. Spherical GN NPs were larger, more compact, formed more stable bonds between their components, and carried more negative charges when compared with the spherical DN NPs. Upon their dilution, NPs in both solutions underwent various geometrical shape changes via simultaneous particle swelling and dissembling. Their fluorescence spectra revealed bond disruption in NPs, with tryptophan and tyrosine moving to more hydrophobic micro-environments when the solutions were diluted 10 times. All aforementioned results were further corroborated by measurements of filtered samples. The NPs property differences between the two SPIs species shed light on their distinct fates during the extrusion process. This study offers new insights in establising criteria for raw materials selection in the food industry."
"The TRAPP (TRAnsport Protein Particle) protein complex is a multi-subunit complex involved in vesicular transport between intracellular compartments. The TRAPP complex plays an important role in endoplasmic reticulum-to-Golgi and Golgi-to-plasma membrane transport, as well as autophagy. TRAPP complexes comprise a core complex, TRAPPI, and the association of peripheral protein subunits to make two complexes, known as TRAPPII and TRAPPIII, which act as Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors (GEFs) of Rab11 and Rab1, respectively. Rab1 and Rab11 are GTPases that mediate cargo selection, packaging, and delivery during pre- and post-Golgi transport in the secretory pathway. Rab1 is also required for the first step of macroautophagy, a cellular recycling pathway. Pathogenic variants in genes encoding protein subunits of the TRAPP complex are associated with a range of rare but severe neurological, skeletal, and muscular disorders, collectively called TRAPPopathies. Disease-causing variants have been identified in multiple subunits of the TRAPP complex; however, little is known about the underlying disease mechanisms. In this review, we will provide an overview of the current knowledge surrounding disease-associated variants of the TRAPP complex subunits, propose new insights into the underlying disease pathology, and suggest future research directions into the underlying disease mechanisms."

"The risk of national food supply disruptions is linked to both domestic production and food imports. But assessments of climate change risks for food systems typically focus on the impacts on domestic production, ignoring climate impacts in supplying regions. Here, we use global crop modeling data in combination with current trade flows to evaluate potential climate change impacts on national food supply, comparing impacts on domestic production alone (domestic production impacts) to impacts considering how climate change impacts production in all source regions (consumption impact). Under 2°C additional global mean warming over present day, our analysis highlights that climate impacts on national supply are aggravated for 53% high income and 56% upper medium income countries and mitigated for 60% low- and 71% low-medium income countries under consumption-based impacts compared to domestic impacts alone. We find that many countries are reliant on a few mega-exporters who mediate these climate impacts. Managing the risk of climate change for national food security requires a global perspective, considering not only how national production is affected, but also how climate change affects trading partners."
"the post-surgical management of ankle fractures is still controversial, and there is no consensus on which rehabilitation regimen should be included as the best. The objective of the study was to describe the clinical and functional results of post-surgical patients with A/B Weber ankle fracture managed with early rehabilitation through early support and immobilization with circular appliance immobilization."
"Clinical and preclinical studies suggest that early life stress can increase the risk of developing ethanol use disorder later in life. Although the endocannabinoid (eCB) system plays a role in stress-related behaviors and ethanol consumption, it remains unclear whether the eCB system is affected in response to a combination of both factors. By using male and female adolescent C57BL/6J mice subjected to a maternal separation (MS) stress paradigm from postnatal day (PND) 1 to 14, we explored (1) the consequences of early life stress experiences on ethanol consumption in adolescent mice and (2) how these events affect the eCB system and neuronal activation in brain regions associated with the reward system. In Experiment 1, we found that MS increased involuntary ethanol consumption specifically during the first exposure to the drug (during a 24 h-long trial on PND 28) and decreased the active/inactive nose poke ratio (discrimination index) specifically when mice were subjected to 1 h-sessions (PND 82-86) in an operant ethanol self-administration paradigm. In Experiment 2, during a two-bottle free choice paradigm, we found that MS increased mice preference for high ethanol concentrations (15 % and 20 %) but not lower ethanol concentrations (5 % and 10 %). Except for Mgll gene expression in the dorsal striatum (DS) in Experiment 2, no statistically significant effects of MS were observed regarding neuronal activation on the prefrontal cortex, DS, globus pallidus, and substantia nigra following a binge operant ethanol self-administration session (Experiment 1) or the eCB system molecules (Cnr1 and Faah gene expression) in the DS (Experiment 2)."

"This study evaluates the quality and readability of informed consent documents generated by AI platforms ChatGPT-4 and Bard Gemini Advanced compared to those written by a first-year oral surgery resident for common oral surgery procedures. The evaluation, conducted by 18 experienced oral and maxillofacial surgeons, assessed consents for accuracy, completeness, readability, and overall quality. ChatGPT-4 consistently outperformed both Bard and human-written consents. ChatGPT-4 consents had a median accuracy score of 4 [IQR 4-4], compared to Bard's 3 [IQR 3-4] and human's 4 [IQR 3-4]. Completeness scores were higher for ChatGPT-4 (4 [IQR 4-5]) than Bard (3 [IQR 3-4]) and human (4 [IQR 3-4]). Readability was also superior for ChatGPT-4, with a median score of 4 [IQR 4-5] compared to Bard and human consents, both at 4 [IQR 4-4] and 4 [IQR 3-4], respectively. The Gunning Fog Index for ChatGPT-4 was 17.2 [IQR 16.5-18.2], better than Bard's 23.1 [IQR 20.5-24.7] and the human consents' 20 [IQR 19.2-20.9]. Overall, ChatGPT-4's consents received the highest quality ratings, underscoring AI's potential in enhancing patient communication and the informed consent process. The study suggests AI can reduce misinformation risks and improve patient understanding, but continuous evaluation, oversight, and patient feedback integration are crucial to ensure the effectiveness and appropriateness of AI-generated content in clinical practice."
"A 46-year-old female complained of cough and dyspnea. A chest X-ray and CT scan showed a solitary subpleural pulmonary nodule in the left upper lobe. Surgical resection was performed. The frozen examination was presumptive of a benign/low grade lesion, likely a carcinoid. Definitive histology revealed uniformly sized eosinophilic cells arranged in solid nests, immunoreactive for epithelial membrane antigen and progesterone receptors. The diagnosis of grade 1 meningothelial meningioma was finally achieved. This case of a meningioma mimicking a carcinoid tumor highlights its rarity and warns diagnostic specialists of the potential for misdiagnosis and overtreatment."

"Metabolic flexibility in skeletal muscle is essential for maintaining healthy glucose and lipid metabolism, and its dysfunction is closely linked to metabolic diseases. Exercise enhances metabolic flexibility, making it an important tool for discovering mechanisms that promote metabolic health. Here we show that pantothenate kinase 4 (PanK4) is a new conserved exercise target with high abundance in muscle. Muscle-specific deletion of PanK4 impairs fatty acid oxidation which is related to higher intramuscular acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA levels. Elevated acetyl-CoA levels persist regardless of feeding state and are associated with whole-body glucose intolerance, reduced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in glycolytic muscle, and impaired glucose uptake during exercise. Conversely, increasing PanK4 levels in glycolytic muscle lowers acetyl-CoA and enhances glucose uptake. Our findings highlight PanK4 as an important regulator of acetyl-CoA levels, playing a key role in both muscle lipid and glucose metabolism."
"Drug overdose-related deaths continue to increase globally. Testing demands have likewise increased, prompting healthcare facilities to adopt a range of methods, from simple point-of-care immunoassays to comprehensive chromatographic and mass spectrometry-based techniques. Each of these testing methods has trade-offs related to cost, performance, speed, and convenience, requiring healthcare facilities to carefully determine the best options to meet their clinical needs. Unfortunately, current testing practices may result in unnecessary costs and certain methods, such as immunoassays, have significant limitations that affect their clinical utility. As such, the goal of this review is to frame the current state of drug testing and related cost-effectiveness and patient centered approaches to address this evolving public health challenge."
"Cardiac endothelial cells are essential for heart development, and disruption of this process can lead to congenital heart disease (CHD). However, how microRNAs influence cardiac endothelial cells in CHD remains unclear. This study identified elevated microRNA-187 (miR-187) expression in embryonic heart endothelial cells from CHD fetuses. Using a conditional knockin model, we showed that increased miR-187 levels in embryonic endothelial cells induce CHD in homozygous fetal mice, closely mirroring human CHD. Mechanistically, miR-187 targets NIPBL, which is responsible for recruiting the cohesin complex and facilitating chromatin accessibility. Consequently, the endothelial cell-specific upregulation of miR-187 inhibited NIPBL, leading to reduced chromatin accessibility and impaired gene expression, which hindered endothelial cell development and ultimately caused heart septal defects and reduced heart size both in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, exogenous miR-187 expression in human cardiac organoids mimicked developmental defects in the cardiac endothelial cells, and this was reversible by NIPBL replenishment. Our findings establish the miR-187/NIPBL axis as a potent regulator that inhibits cardiac endothelial cell development by attenuating the transcription of numerous endothelial genes, with our mouse and human cardiac organoid models effectively replicating severe defects from minor perturbations. This discovery suggests that targeting the miR-187/NIPBL pathway could offer a promising therapeutic approach for CHD."
"Metformin has been part of treatment algorithms for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) for decades. While it has formal approval in the U.S.A. for treatment of T2DM, it is used off-label in gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), and ovarian hyperstimulation prevention. Its role as an insulin sensitizer has made it an attractive therapeutic to address the insulin resistance seen in these syndromes. In 2022, the European Union approved metformin as the only oral antidiabetic medication for diabetes in pregnancy. While its safety and benefits for the mother are well documented, it does cross the placenta with plasma concentrations comparable between mother and child at delivery."

"Microbial culture collections play a crucial role in the collection, maintenance, and distribution of quality-assured living microbial strains, along with their associated phenotypic and omics data. To enhance the find-able, accessible, interoperable, and re-usable (FAIR) data utilization of microbial resources, the World Data Center for Microorganisms (WDCM) has developed the Global Catalogue of Microorganisms (GCM) and the Global Catalogue of Type Strains (gcType). These platforms provide interactive interfaces for cataloging the holdings of collections, along with detailed annotations of type strain genomes and curated metadata, including ecosystems, growth conditions, and collection locations. The system maximizes the scientific impact of microbial resources and culture collections through an integrated data mining tool that links strain- and species-related information from various public resources. Currently, the GCM and gcType include 574 422 strains from 154 culture collections across 51 countries and regions, along with 25 980 genomes from type species. Additionally, 2 702 655 articles and 103 337 patents are integrated with these microbial resources. The system supports microbial taxonomic research and provides evidence for implementing the Nagoya Protocol in the field of microbial resources and their digital sequence information (DSI).

"Monitoring subcellular organelle dynamics in real time and precisely assessing membrane heterogeneity in living cells are very important for studying fundamental biological mechanisms and gaining a comprehensive understanding of cellular processes. However, there remains a shortage of effective tools for these purposes. Herein, we propose a strategy to develop the exchangeable water-sensing probeAPBD for time-lapse imaging of dynamics in cellular membrane-bound organelle morphology with structured illumination microscopy at the nanoscale. In this work, our results reveal mitochondria as the first organelle to undergo morphological changes through swelling, fission, and fusion in cell necrosis, leading to the rupture of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) sheet adhered to the mitochondria. Meanwhile, the ER tubules are then reconstructed by stretching and fusion of autophagosomes. Moreover, APBD allows us to directly visualize spatially resolved distribution of biomembranes vs. water inside single mammalian cells. Our findings show that the renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) model results in the increased biomembrane to cytoplasmic water ratio in the tissue. This reveals intracellular water heterogeneity between the nucleus and the cytoplasm during the IRI process. Overall, this study presents a strategy for development of the molecular tools for cellular water heterogeneity and organelle dynamics."
"A term, healthy infant presented with respiratory distress and severe pulmonary hypertension (PH). With an unclear aetiology and the intent to decrease right ventricular afterload, pulmonary vasodilators were initiated. Follow-up imaging revealed a supravalvular mitral ring as the cause of the PH which resolved after surgical resection of the membrane. Supravalvular mitral ring is a rare left-side congenital heart disease lesion that can lead to PH usually between infancy and toddler years, but can be easily missed in the setting of a concurrent large atrial septal defect that masks the gradient across the left ventricular inflow. While bronchopulmonary dysplasia is the most common cause of PH in infancy, a thorough evaluation is critical for the diagnosis of this reversible cause of PH as a missed diagnosis may redirect care with pulmonary vasodilators in the acute setting and potentially worsen the clinical status."
"Viral capsid assembly is a complex and critical process, essential for understanding viral behavior, evolution, and the development of antiviral treatments, vaccines, and nanotechnology. Significant progress in studying viral capsid assembly has been achieved through various computational approaches, including molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, stochastic dynamics simulations, coarse-grained (CG) models, electrostatic analyses, lattice models, hybrid techniques, machine learning methods, and kinetic models. Each of these techniques offers unique advantages, and by integrating these diverse computational strategies, researchers can more accurately model the dynamic behaviors and structural features of viral capsids, deepening our understanding of the assembly process. This review provides a comprehensive overview of studies on viral capsid assembly, emphasizing their critical role in advancing our knowledge. It examines the contributions, strengths, and limitations of different computational methods, presents key computational works in the field, and analyzes milestone studies that have shaped current research."

"Loneliness is an increasingly significant social and public health issue in contemporary societies. The available evidence suggests that social support is one of the key psychosocial processes for the reduction and prevention of loneliness. This study investigated the role played by sources of social support in the experience of social and emotional loneliness, identifying seven sources of support split between family (spouse/partner, children, grandchildren, siblings) and non-family (friends, neighbours). The study population comprised people aged 65 years and over living in Spain, with a partner (without cohabiting children), alone or in a nursing home. A mixed-methods approach was used, combining data from a survey involving 887 participants (quantitative phase) and data from semi-structured interviews with 30 older adults (qualitative phase). The relationship between the various sources and loneliness was analysed using structural equation modelling (SEM) for the survey data and thematic analysis for the qualitative information. The results from both phases of the study suggest different association dynamics between sources of social support and the social and emotional dimensions of loneliness. Lower levels of emotional loneliness were related to support from the following sources: spouse, children, grandchildren, siblings and friends. Lower levels of social loneliness were related to support from the following sources: spouse, grandchildren, siblings and friends. In contrast, greater levels of emotional loneliness were related to support from neighbours and greater levels of social loneliness were related to support from children. The findings of this study contribute to a better understanding of the association between social support and loneliness and suggest that interventions aimed at reducing loneliness could be more effectively targeted by considering the specific effects of support derived from different sources."

"Legionella pneumophila utilizes the Dot/Icm type IVB secretion system to deliver hundreds of effector proteins inside eukaryotic cells to ensure intracellular replication. Our understanding of the molecular functions of the largest pathogenic arsenal known to the bacterial world remains incomplete. By leveraging advancements in 3D protein structure prediction, we provide a comprehensive structural analysis of 368 L. pneumophila effectors, representing a global atlas of predicted functional domains summarized in a database ( https://pathogens3d.org/legionella-pneumophila ). Our analysis identified 157 types of diverse functional domains in 287 effectors, including 159 effectors with no prior functional annotations. Furthermore, we identified 35 cryptic domains in 30 effector models that have no similarity with experimentally structurally characterized proteins, thus, hinting at novel functionalities. Using this analysis, we demonstrate the activity of thirteen functional domains, including three cryptic domains, predicted in L. pneumophila effectors to cause growth defects in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae model system. This illustrates an emerging strategy of exploring synergies between predictions and targeted experimental approaches in elucidating novel effector activities involved in infection."
"Cataract surgery, a common procedure for vision restoration, exhibits variable outcomes based on patient demographics. This study aimed to elucidate the effects of age and sex on risk factors, intraoperative complications, and postoperative outcomes of cataract surgery. A single-center retrospective cohort study analyzed 691 eyes from 589 individuals who underwent surgery at a tertiary referral center, using electronic medical records to assess preoperative risk factors, intraoperative complications, and best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) pre- and post-operatively, alongside demographic data. The study found that males aged 65-75 years had significantly higher rates of functional postoperative BCVA (91% for males vs. 79% for females, p = 0.007), a disparity not attributable to differences in surgical complications or risk factor prevalence. Age-specific thresholds were identified where BCVA improvements significantly declined beyond 65 years for females and 75 years for males. The likelihood of worsened BCVA post-surgery increased with age for both sexes, with a notable decline in BCVA improvement between the 55-65 years and 65-75 years age groups. These findings underscore the critical influence of sex and age on cataract surgery outcomes, advocating for the integration of these factors into preoperative evaluations to better tailor the timing and planning of cataract surgery and optimize clinical outcomes."

"Prostate cancer (PCa) is a multifactorial and heterogeneous disease, ranking among the most prevalent malignancies in men. In 2020, there were 1,414,259 new cases of PCa worldwide, accounting for 7.3% of all malignant tumors. The incidence rate of PCa ranks third, following breast cancer and lung cancer. Patients diagnosed with high-grade PCa frequently present with existing or developing metastases, complicating their treatment and resulting in poorer prognoses, particularly for those with bone metastases. Utilizing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we identified specific malignant cell subtypes that are closely linked to high-grade PCa. By investigating the mechanisms that govern interactions within the tumor microenvironment (TME), we aim to offer new theoretical insights that can enhance the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of PCa, ultimately striving to improve patient outcomes and quality of life."

"Resolvin D1 (RvD1) inhibits inflammation, reduces oxidative stress, and forecasts the risk of cardiovascular events, but relevant evidence in hemodialysis patients is lacking. This study intended to investigate the predictive value of RvD1 for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) risk in hemodialysis patients."
"Colorectal cancer (CRC), as one of the malignant tumors with the highest incidence and mortality rates worldwide in recent years, originating primarily from the mucosal tissues of the colon or rectum, and has the potential to rapidly develop into invasive cancer. Its pathogenesis is complex, involving a multitude of factors including genetic background, lifestyle, and dietary habits. Early detection and treatment are key to improving survival rates for patients with CRC. However, the pervasive problem is that patients can become severely resistant to treatment, which greatly increases the complexity and challenge of treatment. Therefore, unraveling and overcoming the resistance of CRC has become a focus of research. Mitochondria, the energy centers of the cell, play a crucial role in cellular metabolism, energy supply, and the apoptosis process. In CRC, Mitochondrial dysfunction not only impairs normal cell function but also promotes tumor resistance. Therefore, a deep understanding of the relationship between mitochondrial dysfunction and the mechanisms of CRC development, as well as the mechanisms by which it promotes resistance to chemotherapy drugs, is crucial for the development of targeted therapies, enhancing drug efficacy, and improving treatment outcomes and quality of life for patients."
"Exercise is a potent stimulus for combatting skeletal muscle ageing. To study the effects of exercise on muscle in a preclinical setting, we developed a combined endurance-resistance training stimulus for mice called progressive weighted wheel running (PoWeR). PoWeR improves molecular, biochemical, cellular and functional characteristics of skeletal muscle and promotes aspects of partial epigenetic reprogramming when performed late in life (22-24 months of age). In this investigation, we leveraged pan-mammalian DNA methylome arrays and tandem mass-spectrometry proteomics in skeletal muscle to provide detailed information on late-life PoWeR adaptations in female mice relative to age-matched sedentary controls (n = 7-10 per group). Differential CpG methylation at conserved promoter sites was related to transcriptional regulation genes as well as Nr4a3, Hes1 and Hox genes after PoWeR. Using a holistic method of -omics integration called binding and expression target analysis (BETA), methylome changes were associated with upregulated proteins related to global and mitochondrial translation after PoWeR (P = 0.03). Specifically, BETA implicated methylation control of ribosomal, mitoribosomal, and mitochondrial complex I protein abundance after training. DNA methylation may also influence LACTB, MIB1 and UBR4 protein induction with exercise - all are mechanistically linked to muscle health. Computational cistrome analysis predicted several transcription factors including MYC as regulators of the exercise trained methylome-proteome landscape, corroborating prior late-life PoWeR transcriptome data. Correlating the proteome to muscle mass and fatigue resistance revealed positive relationships with VPS13A and NPL levels, respectively. Our findings expose differential epigenetic and proteomic adaptations associated with translational regulation after PoWeR that could influence skeletal muscle mass and function in aged mice. KEY POINTS: Late-life combined endurance-resistance exercise training from 22-24 months of age in mice is shown to improve molecular, biochemical, cellular and in vivo functional characteristics of skeletal muscle and promote aspects of partial epigenetic reprogramming and epigenetic age mitigation. Integration of DNA CpG 36k methylation arrays using conserved sites (which also contain methylation ageing clock sites) with exploratory proteomics in skeletal muscle extends our prior work and reveals coordinated and widespread regulation of ribosomal, translation initiation, mitochondrial ribosomal (mitoribosomal) and complex I proteins after combined voluntary exercise training in a sizeable cohort of female mice (n = 7-10 per group and analysis). Multi-omics integration predicted epigenetic regulation of serine β-lactamase-like protein (LACTB - linked to tumour resistance in muscle), mind bomb 1 (MIB1 - linked to satellite cell and type 2 fibre maintenance) and ubiquitin protein ligase E3 component N-recognin 4 (UBR4 - linked to muscle protein quality control) after training. Computational cistrome analysis identified MYC as a regulator of the late-life training proteome, in agreement with prior transcriptional analyses. Vacuolar protein sorting 13 homolog A (VPS13A) was positively correlated to muscle mass, and the glycoprotein/glycolipid associated sialylation enzyme N-acetylneuraminate pyruvate lyase (NPL) was associated to in vivo muscle fatigue resistance."

"Echinocandin drugs are the current first-line therapy for fungal infections caused by Candida spp. Most patients require once-daily intravenous (IV) administration in a hospital or outpatient setting for treatment, which may negatively impact their quality of life and stress healthcare resources. Similar to other echinocandins, the novel FDA-, EMA-, and Medical and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency-approved echinocandin, rezafungin (CD101), exhibited strong antifungal activity against several fungal pathogens and a low drug-drug interaction liability, which are important for medically complex patients. A pharmacometric-based approach has been adopted throughout the development of rezafungin, which contrasts with older echinocandins where dosing regimens were largely derived empirically, and only recently based on pharmacometric guidance. This state-of-the-art approach used model-based simulations incorporating pre-clinical and clinical data as it became available to optimize the dosing regimen for rezafungin. The enhanced stability of the molecular structure and the safety profile of rezafungin allow for the administration of once-weekly IV doses, compared to the daily dosing requirement for other echinocandin drugs, with this distinctive pharmacokinetic profile of rezafungin resulting in a front-loaded dosing regimen with high exposures early in therapy for enhanced fungal killing. The long shelf-life of rezafungin makes this echinocandin more flexible in terms of storage and manufacturing. Demonstrated across clinical development, rezafungin may provide patients with next-generation first-line antifungal treatment for the treatment of candidaemia and invasive candidiasis."
"Sleep spindles are cortical electrical oscillations considered critical for memory consolidation and sleep stability. The timing and pattern of sleep spindles are likely to be important in driving synaptic plasticity during sleep as well as preventing disruption of sleep by sensory and internal stimuli. However, the relative importance of factors such as sleep depth, cortical up/down-state, and temporal clustering in governing sleep spindle dynamics remains poorly understood. Here, we analyze sleep data from 1,025 participants, statistically modeling the simultaneous influences of multiple factors on moment-to-moment spindle production using a point process-generalized linear model framework. Results reveal fingerprint-like timing patterns, characterized by a refractory period followed by a period of increased spindle activity, which are highly individualized yet consistent night-to-night, with increased variability with age. Strikingly, short-term (<15 s) temporal patterns of past spindle history are the main determinant of spindle timing, accounting for over 70% of the statistical deviance-surpassing the contribution of factors such as cortical up/down-state (slow oscillation phase), sleep depth, and long-term history (15 to 90 s, including ~50 s infraslow activity). Short-term history has a statistically significant influence in over 98% of the population, suggesting it is a near-universal feature of spindle activity. Short-term history and slow oscillation phase exert independent effects on spindle timing. Our results establish a robust statistical framework to examine abnormalities in sleep spindle timing observed in neurological disorders and aging, as well as the relationship between individualized sleep spindle timing, cognition, and sleep stability."
"Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is the classical hepatobiliary manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The strong association between gut and liver inflammation has driven several pathogenic hypotheses to which the intestinal microbiome is proposed to contribute. Pilot studies of faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in PSC and IBD are demonstrated to be safe and associated with increased gut bacterial diversity. However, the longevity of such changes and the impact on markers of disease activity and disease progression have not been studied. The aim of this clinical trial is to determine the effects of repeated FMT as a treatment for PSC-IBD."

"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease mainly characterized by the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins in the affected motor neurons. At present, the accurate pathogenesis of ALS remains unclear and there are still no effective treatment measures for ALS. The potential pathogenesis of ALS mainly includes the misfolding of some pathogenic proteins, the genetic variation, mitochondrial dysfunction, autophagy disorders, neuroinflammation, the misregulation of RNA, the altered axonal transport, and gut microbial dysbiosis. Exploring the pathogenesis of ALS is a critical step in searching for the effective therapeutic approaches. The current studies suggested that the genetic variation, gut microbial dysbiosis, the activation of glial cells, and the transportation disorder of extracellular vesicles may play some important roles in the pathogenesis of ALS. This review conducts a systematic review of these current potential promising topics closely related to the pathogenesis of ALS; it aims to provide some new evidences and clues for searching the novel treatment measures of ALS."

"Life history theory predicts that a trade-off may occur when an increased investment in one fitness component causes a reduced investment in another. Parasites generate changes in the optimal life history traits of organisms, causing compromises for their hosts. The objective of this research was to determine whether trematodes Clinostomum sp. and Uvulifer sp. inflict measurable damage on the males of the viviparous fish Poeciliopsis infans, generating trade-offs between somatic condition and reproductive traits (gonad mass and gonopodium length). We found (i) a negative relationship of large encysted metacercariae and non-encysted metacercariae on somatic condition. Interestingly, individuals with a higher parasite load had a worse body condition, but bigger gonads and longer gonopodium; and, (ii) a bond between small encysted metacercariae and non-encysted metacercariae with smaller gonopodia, only in fish with poorer somatic condition. The strongest correlation was given by the non-encysted metacercariae, probably due to mechanical damage during migration through the body cavity. We did not find any trade-off effects of Uvulifer sp. We consider that the statistical effects found on somatic condition can be attributed to a greater reproductive investment, generating energetic costs that compromise their defences against infection, allowing a greater parasite load."
"Rising rates of depression among youth present a growing mental health crisis. Despite growing concerns regarding the risks of air pollution exposure on youth mental and physical health, associations between ambient air pollutants and depression have been largely overlooked in youth. In this cross-sectional study, we investigated associations between ozone, particulate matter, and depressive symptoms in adolescents across 224 Colorado census tracts (average age of 14.45 years, 48.8% female, 48.9% of minority race/ethnicity). Students in participating schools reported depressive symptoms and demographic information, and school addresses were used to compute ozone and particulate matter levels per census tract. Possible confounding variables, including sociodemographic and geographic characteristics, were also addressed. Exploratory analyses examined demographic moderators of these associations. Census tracts with higher ozone concentrations had a higher percentage of adolescents experiencing depressive symptoms. Particulate matter did not emerge as a significant predictor of adolescent depressive symptoms. Secondary analyses demonstrated that associations with ozone were moderated by racial/ethnic and gender compositions of census tracts, with stronger effects in census tracts with higher percentages of individuals with marginalized racial/ethnic and gender identities. Ultimately, this project strengthens our understanding of the interplay between air pollution exposures and mental health during adolescence."
"Development of vaccines that protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis, has progressed greatly over the past decade. However, little research has been conducted to examine STI vaccine acceptance and hesitancy and how these factors may impact future uptake. This review examines literature that could provide additional insights into factors that would impact STI vaccine acceptance and hesitancy."
"This research investigated the selected properties of nanocellulose films intended to serve as protective patches on fissured surfaces of wooden artefacts. The effects of their plasticisation with glycerol and functionalisation with selected silanes ((3-Glycidyloxypropyl)trimethoxysilane, and Methyltrimethoxysilane) were also determined. The obtained pure cellulose nanopapers (CNPs) had a homogeneous and compact structure but were very brittle, stiff, and wavy. Functionalisation with silanes made their structure more packed and reduced their equilibrium moisture content by 87-96%, depending on the type and concentration of the silane. Silane functionalisation also slightly improved nanopapers' resistance to moulds. Plasticisation with glycerol provided CNPs with higher flexibility and resistance to fracture and made them flatter and smoother, reducing the wettability of their surfaces but increasing their hygroscopicity (EMC values increased 1.7-3.5 times for pure CNPs and 5-33 times for functionalised CNPs) and vulnerability to mould infestation. All prepared nanopapers can be easily glued to the wood surface and colour-matched using a nitro wood stain, oil paint or waterborne acrylic paint. The research showed that cellulose nanopapers modified with silanes and plasticised with glycerol seem to be a promising solution for protecting the cracked surface of wooden artefacts against further degradation due to external conditions."

"Coastal fish populations are threatened by multiple anthropogenic impacts, including the accumulation of industrial contaminants and the increasing frequency of hypoxia. Some populations of the Atlantic killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus), like those in New Bedford Harbor (NBH), Massachusetts, USA, have evolved a resistance to dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) that may influence their ability to cope with secondary stressors. To address this question, we compared hepatic gene expression and DNA methylation patterns in response to mild or severe hypoxia in killifish from NBH and Scorton Creek (SC), a reference population from a relatively pristine environment. We hypothesized that NBH fish would show altered responses to hypoxia due to trade-offs linked to toxicant resistance. Our results revealed substantial differences between populations. SC fish demonstrated dose-dependent changes in gene expression in response to hypoxia, while NBH fish exhibited a muted transcriptional response to severe hypoxia. Interestingly, NBH fish showed significant DNA methylation changes in response to hypoxia, while SC fish did not exhibit notable epigenetic alterations. These findings suggest that toxicant-adapted killifish may face trade-offs in their molecular response to environmental stress, potentially impacting their ability to survive severe hypoxia in coastal habitats. Further research is needed to elucidate the functional implications of these epigenetic modifications and their role in adaptive stress responses."
"Hypertension (HTN) is a leading risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and a major contributor to global morbidity and mortality. Conventional pharmacological treatments have been effective but are often accompanied by side effects and do not address all pathological aspects of the disease. Recent advances in molecular biology have identified non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), including microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), as key regulators in the pathogenesis of hypertension. These ncRNAs influence various cellular processes, such as gene expression, vascular tone, and inflammation, making them promising targets for therapeutic intervention. This review explores the potential of polyphenols, a diverse group of phytochemicals with potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, in modulating ncRNA expression and function. We discuss how polyphenols, such as epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), resveratrol, curcumin, and quercetin impact the regulation of ncRNAs, particularly focusing on their roles in reducing oxidative stress, improving endothelial function, and ameliorating vascular remodeling associated with hypertension. The review synthesizes current evidence from both in vitro and in vivo studies, highlighting significant findings and the mechanisms by which polyphenols exert their effects on ncRNA-mediated pathways. Moreover, we address the challenges of translating these findings into clinical applications, including issues related to bioavailability, dosing, and the complex interactions of polyphenols with other cellular components. Future directions for research are suggested, with an emphasis on the need for comprehensive clinical trials to establish the efficacy of polyphenol-based therapies targeting ncRNAs in hypertension management. By targeting ncRNAs, polyphenols offer a novel therapeutic strategy that could enhance the treatment landscape for hypertension and potentially other cardiovascular conditions."
"Sijilmassi et al. argue that myths serve to gain coalitional support by detailing shared histories of ancestry and cooperation. They overlook the emotional influences of stories, which include myths of human origin. We suggest that influential myths do not promote cooperation principally by signaling common ancestry, but by prompting human emotions of interdependence and connection."
"Adenoid cystic carcinoma of the breast is a rare subtype, constituting less than 3.5% of primary breast carcinomas. Despite being categorized as a type of triple-negative breast cancer, it generally has a favorable prognosis. The primary management approach typically involves breast-conserving surgery. Due to its rarity, diagnosis can be challenging, emphasizing the importance of histopathological confirmation with clinical and imaging correlation. Although this tumor often has a favorable prognosis, additional research is necessary to better understand its clinical, radiological, and pathological features."
"Conventional chemotherapy- and radiotherapy-induced cancer senescence, which is characterized by poor proliferation, drug resistance, and senescence-associated secretory phenotype, has gained attention as contributing to cancer relapse and the development of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. However, the association between cancer senescence and anti-tumor immunity is not fully understood. Here, we demonstrate that senescent cancer cells increase the level of PD-L1 by promoting its transcription and glycosylation. We identify ribophorin 1 as a key regulator of PD-L1 glycosylation during cancer senescence. Ribophorin 1 depletion reduces this elevated level of PD-L1 through the ER-lysosome-associated degradation pathway, thereby increasing the susceptibility of senescent cancer cells to T-cell-mediated killing. Consistently, ribophorin 1 depletion suppresses tumor growth by decreasing PD-L1 levels and boosting cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity in male mice. Moreover, ribophorin 1-targeted or anti-PD-1 therapy reduces the number of senescent cancer cells in irradiated tumors and suppresses cancer recurrence through the activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes. These results provide crucial insights into how senescent cancer cells can escape T-cell immunity following cancer treatment and thereby contribute to cancer recurrence. Our findings also highlight the therapeutic promise of targeting senescent cancer cells for cancer treatment."
"The emergence of antibiotic resistance has become a global health crisis, and everyone must arm themselves with wisdom to effectively combat the ""silent tsunami"" of infections that are no longer treatable with antibiotics. However, the overuse or inappropriate use of unnecessary antibiotics is still routine for administering them due to the unavailability of rapid, precise, and point-of-care assays. Here, a rapid antimicrobial-resistance point-of-care identification device (RAPIDx) is reported for the accurate and simultaneous identification of bacterial species (genotype) and target enzyme activity (phenotype). First, a contamination-free active target enzyme is extracted via the photothermal lysis of preconcentrated bacteria cells on a nanoplasmonic functional layer on-chip. Second, the rapid, precise identification of pathogens is achieved by the photonic rolling circle amplification of DNA on a chip. Third, the simultaneous identification of bacterial species (genotype) and target enzyme activity (phenotype) is demonstrated within a sample-to-answer 45 min operation via the RAPIDx. It is believed that the RAPIDx will be a valuable method for solving the bottleneck of employing on-chip nanotechnology for antibiotic-resistant bioassay and other infectious diseases."

"Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a neglected tropical disease affecting over 51 million people in 72 endemic countries. Causative agents of LF are mosquito-borne parasitic nematodes Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, and Brugia timori. The adult parasites impact the integrity of lymphatic vessels and damage valves, leading to a remodeling of the lymphatic system and lymphatic dilation. Chronic infections can develop into severe clinical manifestations, primarily lymphedema, hydrocoele, and elephantiasis. Mechanistic studies on the underlying pathology due to the parasite are necessary to better manage human filariasis. Since parasite molecules, such as microRNAs (miRNAs), can be found in secreted extracellular vesicles (EVs) and are transported between parasite and host cells, we hypothesized that these could also play a role in the development of pathology in LF. In this study, we tested two B. malayi miRNAs previously detected in vitro in the culture media of microfilarial stages of worms. While one is Brugia-specific (bma-miR-5864) and the other nematode-specific (bma-miR-86), both miRNAs are secreted in high abundance. We first examined the in vitro response by transcriptomic profiling of human lymphatic endothelial cells to treatment with these miRNAs, which allowed us to identify genes involved in maintaining the integrity of the lymphatic endothelium. We then measured the effect of these miRNAs on the regulation of proteins necessary for cell integrity, demonstrating downregulation leading to a significant increase in the permeability of the endothelium monolayer. With this study we identify parasite miRNAs involved in undermining the integrity of endothelial cells, thus potentially contributing to the development of pathology. These findings could pave the way for a novel treatment strategy where the inhibition of parasite-secreted molecules could slow the progression of LF pathology. From a broader perspective, the miRNAs secreted by filarial parasites could potentially be used in the future for diagnosing and monitoring disease progression or treatment efficacy."
"Large-scale combination drug screens are generally considered intractable due to the immense number of possible combinations. Existing approaches use ad hoc fixed experimental designs then train machine learning models to impute unobserved combinations. Here we propose BATCHIE, an orthogonal approach that conducts experiments dynamically in batches. BATCHIE uses information theory and probabilistic modeling to design each batch to be maximally informative based on the results of previous experiments. On retrospective experiments from previous large-scale screens, BATCHIE designs rapidly discover highly effective and synergistic combinations. In a prospective combination screen of a library of 206 drugs on a collection of pediatric cancer cell lines, the BATCHIE model accurately predicts unseen combinations and detects synergies after exploring only 4% of the 1.4M possible experiments. Further, the model identifies a panel of top combinations for Ewing sarcomas, which follow-up validation experiments confirm to be effective, including the rational and translatable top hit of PARP plus topoisomerase I inhibition. These results demonstrate that adaptive experiments can enable large-scale unbiased combination drug screens with a relatively small number of experiments. BATCHIE is open source and publicly available ( https://github.com/tansey-lab/batchie )."
There is scarce information in Middle-Eastern Europe regarding the prevalence of anxiety in patients with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) and its association with different clinical-demographic factors.
Multidisciplinary lung cancer screening (LCS) programs that perform shared decision-making visits (SDMV) and follow up annual low dose computed tomography (LDCT) have been emerging. We hypothesize that primary care providers (PCPs) prefer to refer patients to LCS programs instead of facilitating the screening process themselves.
"Porphyrazine and tetrakis porphyrazine are examples of organic compounds with complicated structures of rings. Physicists and chemical researchers have been interested in these structures because of their highly conjugated systems, which lead to peculiar optical and electrical characteristics. These structures are the fundamental components of molecular electronics, sensors, functional materials, and catalysis, among other scientific fields. The idea behind modeling molecules as networks is to calculate the topological index, where atoms are nodes and bonds are links. We can use multiple techniques and algorithms to calculate the topological index. We have used the reduced reverse degree-based approach for estimating the topological indices of the Porphyrazine and Tetrakis porphyrazine structures. The purpose of calculating the reduced reverse degree-based topological indices is to quantify the molecular topology of the mentioned structures. In future research, we can also use these indices in SAR/QSAR modeling of porphyrazine and tetrakis porphyrazine. These indices can also provide comparative analysis and descriptors for predicting chemical behavior, which is useful in material science applications and drug designs. In this study, we present a formula for calculating reduced reverse degree-based topological indices for porphyrazine and tetrakis porphyrazine, including the reduced reverse geometric arithmetic index, reduced reverse general Randić index, reduced reverse Balaban index, reduced reverse redefined Zagreb index, reduced reverse forgotten index, reduced reverse hyper-Zagreb index, and reduced reverse atom-bond connectivity index. Before the conclusion, there is a graph-theoretical analysis and comparison to ascertain the essential significance and validate the obtained results. This research helps to create novel materials for a variety of applications and sheds light on the structural and chemical characteristics of these molecular networks."
"BACKGROUND Dietary supplements (DS) are increasingly popular worldwide, with 78% of Polish adults reporting their use, and nearly half using them regularly. The wide availability, selection, and affordability contribute to this prevalence. However, misinformation and potential health risks from incorrect usage highlight the importance of health literacy in making informed choices about DS. This study aims to assess the knowledge and practices related to dietary supplement use among Polish patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2024 on a representative sample of 1,074 Polish adults, excluding healthcare professionals, using the computer-assisted web interview method. The questionnaire assessed respondents' understanding of DS, sources of information, purchasing habits, and consultations with healthcare professionals. RESULTS Most respondents (71.79%) believed they understood what a dietary supplement is. Women and individuals with higher education were more likely to claim understanding (p=0.001, p<0.00001). The Internet was the most common information source (38.64%), followed by mass media and healthcare professionals. Women and older respondents more often consulted doctors and pharmacists (p=0.002, p=0.004). Brick-and-mortar pharmacies were the preferred purchasing location (61.64%), with men more likely to use online pharmacies (p=0.0002). CONCLUSIONS The study indicates high awareness of dietary supplements among Polish adults, with significant differences based on gender and education. Despite the Internet being a major information source, healthcare professionals remain crucial for informed decision-making. Efforts are needed to enhance public health literacy and ensure safe DS use."
"Autologous Stem-Cell Transplantation (ASTC) has proven efficacy in several hematological malignancies. The greatest antineoplastic effect achieved with intensified chemotherapy is associated with severe myelotoxicity. The infusion of autologous hematopoietic precursors and transfusion support during the period of aplasia reduces the time and depth of cytopenias, decreasing the risk of bleeding, anemia and life-threatening infections. With the use of stimulants of the three main hematopoietic series, it has been possible to offer this treatment to patients who refuse to receive transfusions, such as Jehovah's Witnesses (JW). This article describes a local protocol to implement ASCT without transfusion support and shows our experience in four patients, two with multiple myeloma and two with relapsed/refractory lymphomas. Despite critical hemoglobin and platelet values observed, no serious complications or treatment-related mortality were observed. At the time of the report, all patients were alive and without progression of their neoplasms. Autologous stem-cell transplantation without transfusion support is feasible in centers with experience in this procedure and can benefit JW among other populations."
Preoperative differentiation of the types of mediastinal tumors is essential. Magnetic resonance (MR) elastography potentially provides a noninvasive method to assess the classification of mediastinal tumor subtypes.
"To evaluate the airway space in bilateral idiopathic condylar resorption (ICR) patients and analyse the correlation between the morphological characteristics of the condyles and airway parameters. In all, 35 female patients with bilateral ICR (mean age: 21.6 years) and 35 age-matched female controls (mean age: 21.3 years) were included. Airway parameters were measured using CBCT. Independent T-tests were used to analyse the differences between the bilateral ICR group and the control group, and then the correlation between airway parameters and condylar parameters was detected using Pearson correlation analysis. p < .05 was considered statistically significant. Patients with bilateral ICR showed a significant decrease in airway volume, minimum axial area and sagittal sectional area (p < .05). The bilateral condylar axial angle positively correlated with airway volume and sagittal sectional area (p < .05). In contrast, the bilateral condylar neck angle negatively correlated with sagittal sectional area (p < .05). None of the condylar parameters showed a correlation with minimum axial area of the airway in the bilateral ICR group (p > .05). Bilateral ICR significantly affects patients' airway space. The condylar axial angle and neck angle correlate with airway parameters."
"(Adaptive) radiations have attracted evolutionary biologists for a long time as ideal model systems to study patterns and processes of often rapid speciation. However, whereas a wealth of (sometimes already genome-scale) data is available for host radiations, very few studies target the patterns of diversification in their symbionts, even though they would be excellent models to study symbiont speciation. Our review summarizes what little is known about general patterns of symbiont diversification in often iconic adaptive host radiations and to what extent these patterns are dependent on the evolutionary trajectories of their hosts. We identify research gaps that need to be addressed in the future and discuss the potential of approaches not yet typically used in these study systems, such as epidemiological disease modeling and new omics technologies, for significantly advancing our understanding of these complex eco-evolutionary relationships."

This review aimed to identify OGD initiatives in healthcare and their possible applications."
"Alloimmunization against red blood cell (RBC) antigen is an important concern in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) patients with chronic transfusion, causing potential risk for hemolytic reaction and limited supply of compatible blood. However, there is little data addressing RBC alloimmunization in this patient cohort among the Chinese population. This study aims to evaluate the incidence, specificity of antibodies, and RBC units transfused before antibody formation and its significance in a population of patients consistently receiving RhD-matched RBC units."

"Topical steroid withdrawal (TSW) is described as an adverse reaction to topical glucocorticoids (TGCs). A pathophysiological mechanism has not been identified. There are no diagnostic criteria. The aim was to describe patient-reported characteristics of TSW in atopic dermatitis (AD). An observational cross-sectional study was performed by posting a questionnaire for participants, aged ≥18 years, reporting both AD and TSW, in a Swedish TSW-themed Facebook group during 4 weeks in 2023. The questionnaire was accessed by 98 participants, with 82 completing it. Most were female (95%), 18-39 years old (74%), self-diagnosed with TSW (84%), and reported current symptoms of AD and TSW. They defined TSW as dependency on TGCs and adverse reactions to their use. Erythema, desquamation, dryness, and oozing affecting the face, neck, and upper extremities were the most reported signs. Pruritus, sleep disturbance, and signs of anxiety and depression were the most reported symptoms. Recurring episodes of manifestations attributed to TSW were reported by 60%. The personal trigger factor was believed to be TGCs by 93%, and 33% also identified oral glucocorticoids. TGCs were currently used by 21%. Self-reported manifestations of TSW are similar to those of AD but appeared to be distinguishable for the participants and caused considerable morbidity."

Nevertheless, comparative evaluations regarding the probability of developing lung cancer and dying from the disease among diverse populations at the global, regional, and national levels are scarce."
"The continuous rise in skin cancer incidence highlights an imperative for improved skin cancer prevention. Topical calcipotriol-plus-5-fluorouracil (calcipotriol-plus-5-FU) immunotherapy effectively eliminates precancerous skin lesions and prevents squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in patients. However, its mechanism of action remains unclear. Herein, we demonstrate that calcipotriol-plus-5-FU immunotherapy induces T helper type 2 (Th2) immunity, eliminating premalignant keratinocytes in humans. CD4+ Th2 cells were required and were sufficient downstream of thymic stromal lymphopoietin cytokine induction by calcipotriol to suppress skin cancer development. Th2-associated cytokines induced IL-24 expression in cancer cells, resulting in toxic autophagy and anoikis followed by apoptosis. Calcipotriol-plus-5-FU immunotherapy was dependent on IL-24 to suppress skin carcinogenesis in vivo. Collectively, our findings establish a critical role for Th2 immunity in cancer immunoprevention and highlight the Th2/IL-24 axis as an innovative target for skin cancer prevention and therapy."
"Honokiol is a natural product with an interesting array of biological effects, including significant anti-tumor properties. However, full exploration of its therapeutic potential is hampered by its modest pharmacokinetic profile and by the lack of synthetic methods that allow to obtain specifically designed derivatives with improved properties. In addition, the specific molecular targets of honokiol remain poorly understood, a fact that limits the search of alternative hits for subsequent optimization programs. In this work we describe an optimized series of synthetic routes that allow to access to a variety of honokiol derivatives, including a set of minimalist photoaffinity probes to map potential protein targets in live cells. Chemical proteomic studies of the most potent probe revealed a defined set of proteins as the cellular targets of honokiol. Significantly, up to the 62 % of the identified proteins have described roles in cancer, highlighting their potential relationship with the antitumor effects of honokiol. Furthermore, several of the top hits have been validated as direct binding partners of honokiol by cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA). In sum, the work described herein provides the first landscape of the cellular targets of honokiol in living cells and contributes to define the specific molecular pathways affected by this natural product."
"As the number of coronavirus diseases-2019 (COVID-19) cases have decreased and measures have started to be implemented at an individual level rather than in the form of social restrictions, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) still maintains its importance and has already taken its place in the spectrum of agents investigated in multiplex molecular test panels for respiratory tract infections in routine diagnostic use. In this study, we aimed to present mutation analysis and clade distribution of whole genome sequences from randomly selected samples that tested positive with SARS-CoV-2 specific real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) test at different periods of the pandemic in our laboratory with a commercial easy-to-use kit designed for next-generation sequencing systems. A total of 84 nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swab samples of COVID-19 suspected patients which were sent for routine diagnosis to the medical microbiology laboratory and detected as SARSCoV-2 RNA positive with rRT-PCR were randomly selected from different periods for sequence analysis. Library preparation for sequencing was performed with the commerical EasySeq SARS-CoV-2 RC PCR kit (Nimagen, the Netherlands). The data generated from the Illumina MiSeq system (Illumina Inc, San Diego, CA, USA) were analysed using CLC Genomics Workbench (CLC, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Nextstrain clades detected in order of frequency were 21J (Delta) (25%, n= 21), 21L (Omicron) (23.8%, n= 20), 20B (19%, n= 16), 20A (15.5%, n= 13), 21K (Omicron) (11.9%, n= 10), 19A (3.6%, n= 3), and 22B (Omicron) (1.2%, n= 1). Excluding one patient sample which was identified as 22B (Omicron), a total of 2829 common distinct mutations (2076 missense, 551 synonymous, 192 deletions and 10 insertions) were detected. 100 mutations were observed in the non-coding 5' untranslated region (UTR). The majority of the mutations were located in the Spike gene region (1120 mutations), followed by the ORF1a (624 mutations), nucleocapside (315 mutations) and ORF1b (263 mutations) gene regions. Sampling times of the patients were March 2020 (n= 1), April 2020 (n= 11), May 2020 (n= 1), June 2020 (n= 2), July 2020 (n= 3), August 2020 (n= 1), September 2020 (n= 5), November 2020 (n= 2), December 2020 (n= 6), December 2021 (n= 19), January 2022 (n= 11), March 2022 (n= 16), April 2022 (n= 3), and June 2022 (n= 3). As a result, in this study, SARS-CoV-2 variants and mutations in the Mediterranean Region of Türkiye, Antalya province were analyzed in detail. To the best of our knowledge, no SARS-CoV-2 genome analysis study from the pandemic period has been reported in our province. When the sequences from our study were uploaded to the GISAID Instant Audacity system and the related genomes obtained from different countries in the EpiCoV database metadata were examined, the top two countries in terms of similarity and which could be associated with the main entry route of the virus into Türkiye were Germany and the United Kingdom. In today's world, where it is discussed what can be done to be prepared for possible new pandemics based on the COVID-19 pandemic, the importance of being proactive in molecular surveillance studies is indisputable. Developing countries should be supported and encouraged to research new variants and share data in addition to known variants in pandemic control. At this point, we believe that past pandemic data reported from different geographical regions will also be valuable in terms of predicting the circulation network and taking precautions in a possible new pandemic."

"The increasing rate of cesarean delivery (CD) is a significant concern in many societies worldwide. Vaginal delivery (VD) is preferred over CD for subsequent pregnancies after successful VD, for women with no specific obstetrical indications, primarily because of concerns about potential complications arising from the surgical procedure. However, the factors that influence the decision of requesting a CD have not yet been thoroughly investigated. This study aimed to examine the underlying reasons that lead mothers to choose CDs in subsequent pregnancies following a VD."

"Early immune reconstitution, particularly of natural killer (NK) cells with strong graft-versus-leukemia effects, is crucial for the prognosis of patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). This retrospective study examined 122 pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent T-cell replete allo-HSCT at the Children's Hospital of Soochow University from 2019 to 2021. Peripheral blood lymphocyte counts on days 30 and 60 post-transplant were analyzed, focusing on NK cell recovery and its impact on overall survival (OS), relapse-free survival (RFS), non-relapse mortality (NRM), relapse, graft-versus-host disease, and CMV reactivation. Patients were categorized into high and low NK cell groups by the median NK cell counts at day 30 (NK30) and day 60 (NK60) after HSCT. Patients with high NK30 and NK60 levels had significantly better 3-year OS rates compared to their respective low NK count groups (86.8% ± 4.7% versus 67.6% ± 7.0%, P = 0.046; 95.7% ± 3.0% versus 63.7% ± 8.7%, P < 0.001, respectively). NK60 was found to be an independent predictor for 3-year OS and RFS in multivariate analysis. Early NK reconstitution was also related to lower NRM rates. However, this correlation disappeared in patients with ALL and those undergoing haploidentical transplantation. In addition, A positive association between early T cell and NK cell reconstitution was found in our study. Higher NK cell counts on days 60 can predict superior OS, RFS and lower NRM in pediatric AML allo-HSCT patients."
"The development of new convenient tools for the design of multicomponent nucleic acid (NA) complexes is one of the challenges in biomedicine and NA nanotechnology. In this paper, we analyzed the formation of hybrid RNA/DNA concatemers and self-limited complexes by a pair of oligonucleotides using UV melting, circular dichroism spectroscopy, and a gel shift assay. Effects of the size of the linker between duplex-forming segments of the oligonucleotides on complexes' shape and number of subunits were compared and systematized for RNA/DNA, DNA/DNA, and RNA/RNA assemblies. The data on complex types summarized here as heat maps offer a convenient tool for the design of NA constructs. General rules found for RNA/DNA, DNA/DNA, and RNA/RNA complexes allow not only designing complexes with desired structures but also purposefully transforming their geometry. The A-form of the double helix of the studied RNA/DNA complexes was confirmed by circular dichroism analysis. Moreover, we show for the first time efficient degradation of RNA in hybrid self-limited complexes by RNase H and imidazole. The results open up new prospects for the design of supramolecular complexes as tools for nanotechnology, nanomachinery, and biomedical applications."
"Parents and typically developing (TD) youth siblings of individuals with intellectual and/or developmental disabilities (IDD) often experience greater caregiving burden, stress, and hardships in family functioning. They are at increased risk of family conflict and youth adjustment problems when TD siblings are adolescents since they need to balance caregiving responsibilities and various changes that naturally occur during adolescence. However, there is a lack of intervention research on parents and TD adolescent siblings that focuses on family conflict and family-wide participation. This study analyzed whether participating in a brief family intervention could improve families' knowledge of marital and family-wide conflict and TD adolescents' adjustment problems. We found that mothers and fathers significantly improved their knowledge of marital conflict and that TD adolescents significantly improved their knowledge of family-wide conflict. We also found that fathers reported significant reductions in internalizing and externalizing problems in TD adolescents. The findings support the impact of even brief evidence-based interventions targeting family-level improvements for families with both TD adolescent siblings and individuals with IDD. The findings also accentuate the significance of involving both mothers and fathers in family intervention research, suggesting that different caregivers may experience both shared and unique benefits from participating."

"The Asian icefish, Protosalanx chinensis, has undergone extensive colonization in various waters across China for decades due to its ecological and physiological significance as well as its economic importance in the fishery resource. Here, we decoded a telomere-to-telomere (T2T) genome for P. chinensis combining PacBio HiFi long reads and ultra-long ONT (nanopore) reads and Hi-C data. The telomere was identified in both ends of the contig/chromosome. The expanded gene associated with circadian entrainment suggests that P. chinensis may exhibit a high sensitivity to photoperiod. The contracted genes' immune-related families and DNA repair associated with positive selection in P. chinensis suggested the selection pressure during adaptive evolution. The population genetic analysis reported the genetic diversity and genomic footprints in 254 individuals from 8 different locations. The natural seawater samples can be the highest diversity and different from other freshwater and introduced populations. The divergent regions' associated genes were found to be related to the osmotic pressure system, suggesting adaptations to alkalinity and salinity. Thus, the T2T genome and genetic variation can be valuable resources for genomic footprints in P. chinensis, shedding light on its evolution, comparative genomics, and the genetic differences between natural and introduced populations."

"Enzymes capable of breaking down polymers have been identified from natural sources and developed for industrial use in plastic recycling. However, there are many potential starting points for enzyme optimization that remain unexplored. We generated a landscape of 170 lineages of 1894 polyethylene terephthalate depolymerase (PETase) candidates and performed profiling using sampling approaches with features associated with PET-degrading capabilities. We identified three promising yet unexplored PETase lineages and two potent PETases, Mipa-P and Kubu-P. An engineered variant of Kubu-P outperformed benchmarks in terms of PET depolymerization in harsh environments, such as those with high substrate load and ethylene glycol as the solvent."

"Myelomeningocele (MMC) is the most severe and disabling form of spina bifida with chronic health multisystem complications and social and economic family and health systems burden. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the genetic risk estimate for MMC in a cohort of 203 Mexican nuclear families with discordant siblings for the defect. Utilizing a custom Illumina array, we analyzed 656 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of 395 candidate genes to identify a polygenic risk profile for MMC. Through a family-based analysis employing the transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) and Bayesian analysis, we assessed risk alleles transmission and calculated conditional probabilities estimating a polygenic risk for MMC. Our findings reveal significant associations of six genes related to neural tube closure (PSMB4, ATIC, DKK2, PSEN2, C2CD3, and PLCB2), showing differences in risk allele transmission between affected and unaffected siblings. Bayesian analysis identified changes in the risk profile after initiating folic acid fortification in Mexico, showing an evident decline in the conditional risk from 1/156 to 1/304 respectively. Despite the decline, this represents a 5.84-fold increase in risk before fortification and a 2.99-fold increase post-fortification compared to the baseline risk level (1/910). Our study highlights the advantage of incorporating a Bayesian analytical methodology in families with discordant sib-pairs, offering insights into the polygenic risk estimate for MMC and, most probably, for other congenital malformations."

"The T-cell receptor (TCR)/CD3 complex plays an essential role in the immune response and is a key player in cancer immunotherapies. There are two classes of TCR/CD3 complexes, defined by their TCR chain usage (αβ or γδ). Recently reported structures have revealed the organization of the αβ TCR/CD3 complex, but similar studies regarding the γδ TCR/CD3 complex have lagged behind. Here, we report cryoelectron microscopy (cryoEM) structural analysis of two γδ TCRs, G115 (Vγ9 Vδ2) and 9C2 (Vγ5 Vδ1), in complex with CD3 subunits. Our results show that the overall subunit organization of the γδ TCR/CD3 complexes is similar to αβ TCRs. However, both γδ TCRs display highly mobile extracellular domains (ECDs), unlike αβ TCRs, which have TCR ECDs that are rigidly coupled to its transmembrane (TM) domains. We corroborate this finding in cells by demonstrating that a γδ T-cell specific antibody can bind a site that would be inaccessible in the more rigid αβ TCR/CD3 complex. Furthermore, we observed that the Vγ5 Vδ1 complex forms a TCR γ5 chain-mediated dimeric species whereby two TCR/CD3 complexes are assembled. Collectively, these data shed light on γδ TCR/CD3 complex formation and may aid the design of γδ TCR-based therapies."
"Approximately 1 in 200 newborns worldwide are affected by congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV). Most of these cases are asymptomatic due to successful control of the infection by the newborn's immune system. In this issue of the JCI, Semmes et al. characterized the cellular immune response in cord blood of neonates with CMV infection. The authors found that conventional T cells with NK-like features expanded during congenital CMV infection. To exert their antiviral function, these cells relied on Fc receptors, recognizing virus-infected cells bound by IgG. Thereby, the fetal and maternal immune system can optimally cooperate to control CMV infection: maternal IgG crossing the placenta opsonizes virus-infected cells subsequently lysed by neonatal NK-like T cells. This finding suggests that innate-like programming of conventional T cells may have evolved to combat congenital CMV infection, offering insights that could inform the development of future therapies."

"Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) is an emerging imaging modality with exciting biomedical applications, such as cell tracking, blood pool imaging, and image-guided magnetic hyperthermia. MPI is unique in that signal is generated entirely by synthetic nanoparticle tracers, motivating precise engineering of magnetic nanoparticle properties including size, shape, composition, and coating to address the needs of specific applications. However, success in many applications and in clinical transition requires development of high-sensitivity and high-resolution tracers, for which there is considerable room for improvement. This review summarizes recent advancements in MPI tracer synthesis and compares reported tracers in terms of sensitivity and resolution. In making these comparisons, we point out inconsistencies in reporting of MPI tracer properties. To overcome this challenge, we propose a list of properties to standardize characterization and reporting of new MPI tracers and improve communication within the field."

"Almost a century has passed since Plummer reported the efficacy of short-term preoperative inorganic iodine therapy for Graves' disease in the 1920s. Since there were concerns about the escape phenomenon and exacerbation with inorganic iodine, antithyroid drugs became the mainstay of pharmacotherapy for Graves' disease following their development in the 1940s. With regard to long-term inorganic iodine monotherapy, Trousseau reported a case in the 1860s, and several subsequent reports suggested its efficacy. Around 1930, Thompson et al. published a number of papers and concluded that long-term inorganic iodine monotherapy was useful if limited to mild cases under careful follow-up. From Japan, in 1970, Nagataki et al. reported that, of 12 patients treated with inorganic iodine, three remained eumetabolic for more than two years. Since 2014, some reports have also been published from Japan. A summary of these recent reports is given below. The starting dose of potassium iodide is around 50 mg/day, and candidate responders have mild disease, with FT4 <2.76 ng/dL (35.5 pmol/L), a small goiter, and are female and elderly. Response rates are relatively high, at 60-80%, and the remission rate is about 40%. In cases of insufficient response, changing therapy should be considered. Inorganic iodine can be used as a possible alternative if the patient experiences adverse events with antithyroid drugs and/or prefers conservative treatments, with an understanding of their efficacy and limitations. These recent reports have been published from Japan, where iodine is sufficient, and the dose of inorganic iodine is empirical and requires further study."
Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) is known to cause occupational allergic contact dermatitis in biotechnology laboratory workers.
"Cisplatin is a platinum-based drug that is frequently used to treat multiple tumors. The anti-tumor effect of cisplatin is closely related to the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME), which includes several immune cell types, such as the tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs), dendritic cells (DCs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), regulatory T cells (Tregs), and natural killer (NK) cells. The interaction between these immune cells can promote tumor survival and chemoresistance, and decrease the efficacy of cisplatin monotherapy. Therefore, various combination treatment strategies have been devised to enhance patient responsiveness to cisplatin therapy. Cisplatin can augment anti-tumor immune responses in combination with immune checkpoint blockers (such as PD-1/PD-L1 or CTLA4 inhibitors), lipid metabolism disruptors (like FASN inhibitors and SCD inhibitors) and nanoparticles (NPs), resulting in better outcomes. Exploring the interaction between cisplatin and the TIME will help identify potential therapeutic targets for improving the treatment outcomes in cancer patients."
"NpmA and NpmB are 16S rRNA methyltransferases that act on residue A1408 and confer high-level resistance to almost all aminoglycosides; however, these methyltransferases are rarely reported. A novel gene, npmC, was identified after analysisng all world-wide available metagenomic projects in a One Health context. This gene has a high level of similarity (91.5%) with npmA and up to 92.7% similarity at amino acidic level. The protein encoded by this gene presents the conserved motifs required for A1408 methylation. npmC was synthesized and its expression in Escherichia coli resulted in a high level of resistance to 4,5-disubstituted 2-deoxystreptamine (2-DOS) and 4-monosubstituted 2-DOS aminoglycosides, as well as moderate resistance to 4,6-disusbstituted 2-DOS aminoglycosides, including the last resort aminoglycoside, plazomicin. Methylation at residue A1408 was confirmed by mass spectrometry assays. Analysis of the npmC gene background revealed that its genetic context was associated with different insertion sequences that could mobilise the gene. Similarities in the genetic context between npmC and npmA indicate that they share a common ancestor. The immediate genetic context of this methyltransferase indicates a high relationship to the Eubacteriales order. This finding reveals the dark matter of the microbiome as a potential source of novel resistance genes, expands the list of the true pan-aminoglycoside 16S rRNA methyltransferases, which threaten the usefulness and development of next-generation aminoglycosides."

"Inflammatory cytokines cooperate to maintain normal immune homeostasis, performing both a protective and a pro-inflammatory action in different body districts. However, their excessive persistence or deregulated expression may degenerate into tissue chronic inflammatory status. Advanced therapies should be designed to deploy selective cytokine neutralizers in the affected tissues. Magnetoelectric nanoparticles (MENPs) possess unexploited potentialities, conjugating their ferromagnetic nature, which enables confinement in a specific tissue by directed positioning when subjected to low-intensity magnetic fields, with the capability to generate high electric fields with elevated spatial resolution when subjected to higher magnetic fields. This work proposes to exploit the extremely localized heat generated by Joule's effect around MENPs under an external magnetic field to denature a harmful cytokine in a hypothetical tissue site. An interdisciplinary and multiphysics in silico study was conducted to provide comprehensive modeling of the temperature distribution generated by MENPs decorated with a membrane-derived microvesicle (MV) coating designed to allocate a specific antibody to bind a target cytokine. A damage model was also implemented to provide an estimation of the influence of several design parameters on the cytokine denaturation efficacy, with the final goal of guiding the future development of effective MENPs-based therapeutic applications and strategies."
"Luminescence technology is a powerful analytical tool for biomedical research as well as for marker detection. Luminescent materials with aggregation-induced emission (AIE) properties have attracted extensive research interest, and their unique luminescence characteristics, biocompatibility, and sensitivity make them useful for the development of fluorescence-turn-on biosensors with superior sensitivity. While numerous reviews have focused on the design of AIEgens, comprehensive summaries on the strategies for biosensor preparation and application fields remain limited. In this review, we provide a concise introduction to the discovery and mechanism of the AIE phenomenon and summarize the working principles of classic AIE molecules. We discuss luminescence tuning strategies and functionalization methods for AIEgens, along with the design and preparation of AIE-based biosensors. Typical applications of AIE in biosensing and imaging are outlined, and we analyze the current limitations and future research directions of AIE technology in these fields. We hope this review will serve as a valuable reference for researchers in this rapidly developing field. The insights provided may facilitate the rational design of next-generation biosensors based on AIE technology, exhibiting promising avenues of biomedical applications and vast potential for growth."
"The aims of this study were to establish the prevalence of burnout and type A behavior pattern (TABP) among social workers in Spain and to examine their relationship with sociodemographic variables in a sample of 442 members of professional social workers' associations in Spain. The Spanish version of the Jenkins Activity Survey, form H (JASE-H) and the Maslach Burnout Inventory were used as instruments to measure TABP and burnout, respectively. Bivariate correlation test, analysis of variance, and logistic regression were carried out to analyze the data. The results showed that variables associated with TABP (competitiveness, hostility, impatience, and workload) increase the risk of burnout, with hostility and workload being identified as predictive risk factors. Gender differences impacted burnout, with women experiencing greater emotional exhaustion, while age and time in the job influenced type A behavior, with older age associated with heightened hostility and decreased workload, and longer time in the job linked to reduced competitiveness. Conducting this study was crucial to determine whether there are aspects of TABP that impact the development of burnout, in order to design interventions and prevention strategies that promote the health and well-being of affected individuals."
"The prevalence of dry mouth in the palliative care population is well documented and increases due to polypharmacy, radiotherapy and systemic conditions. Saliva as a lubricant for the mouth and throat has implications for swallowing, chewing, and speech. The literature about the experience of xerostomia (perceived feeling of dry mouth) in palliative care is scarce. Clinical evidence suggests that xerostomia has a negative impact on people's comfort, however, no recent studies explored this impact in detail. This new knowledge is paramount to adhere to the principles of palliative care."
"Cirrhosis is characterised by hyperdynamic circulation, which contributes to cirrhotic cardiomyopathy (CCM). However, the expert consensus on CCM did not initially include cardiac structure because of scant evidence. Therefore, this study investigated the associations of cardiac chamber geometry with mortality and CCM."
"The brain of adult honeybee (Apis mellifera) workers is larger than that of queens, facilitating behavioural differentiation between the castes. This brain diphenism develops during the pharate-adult stage and is driven by a caste-specific gene expression cascade in response to unique hormonal milieus. Previous molecular screening identified minibrain (mnb; DYRK1A) as a potential regulator in this process. Here, we used RNAi approach to reduce mnb transcript levels and test its role on brain diphenism development in honeybees. White-eyed unpigmented cuticle worker pupae were injected with dsRNA for mnb (Mnb-i) or gfp, and their phenotypes were assessed two and 8 days later using classic histological and transcriptomic analyses. After 2 days of the injections, Mnb-i bees showed 98% of downregulation of mnb transcripts. After 8 days, the brain of Mnb-i bees showed reduction in total volume and in the volume of the mushroom bodies (MB), antennal, and optic lobes. Additionally, signs of apoptosis were observed in the Kenyon cells region of the MB, and the cohesion of the brain tissues was affected. Our transcriptomic analyses revealed that 226 genes were affected by the knockdown of mnb transcripts, most of which allowing axonal fasciculation. These results suggest the evolutionary conserved mnb gene has been co-opted for promoting hormone-mediated developmental brain morphological plasticity generating caste diphenism in honeybees."
"Bacillus subtilis is a Gram-positive model bacterium and one of the most-studied and best understood organisms. The complex information resulting from its investigation is compiled in the database SubtiWiki (https://subtiwiki.uni-goettingen.de/v5) in an integrated and intuitive manner. To enhance the utility of SubtiWiki, we have added novel features such as a viewer to interrogate conserved genomic organization, a widget that shows mutant fitness data for all non-essential genes, and a widget showing protein structures, structure predictions and complex structures. Moreover, we have integrated metabolites as new entities. The new framework also includes a documented API, enabling programmatic access to data for computational tasks. Here we present the recent developments of SubtiWiki and the current state of the data for this organism."

"Cancers still globally endanger millions of people yearly; the incidences/mortalities of colorectal cancers are particularly increasing. The natural nanoparticles (NPs) and marine biopolymers were anticipated to provide effectual safe significances for managing cancers. The transformation of curcumin to nano-curcumin (NCur) was conducted with gum Arabic. The resulted NCur was utilized for the biosynthesis of selenium NPs (SeNPs), then bioactive nanocomposites (NC) from them with fucoidan (Fu) were fabricated and evaluated as candidates to suppress colorectal cancers (CaCo-2 and HT-29) cells. The NCur and NCur-synthesized SeNPs were effectually produced with mean diameters of 34.67 ± 4.32 and 5.17 ± 1.06 nm, respectively. The plain and NCs of Fu/NCur/SeNPs characterization, with infrared spectroscopy and electron microscopy, emphasized their interaction and conjugations. The entire agents/NCs had potent cytotoxic effects against cancers' lines; the NC of Fu/NCur/SeNPs was the most effectual with IC50 of 10.35 ± 0.83 and 19.44 ± 1.39 mg/L against CaCo-2 and HT-29 cells, respectively, which were significantly exceeded the action of standard cisplatin drug. The NCs led to vigorous DNA damages in CaCo-2 cancerous cells, as proved with comet assay. The ultrastructure imagining (scanning/transmission microscopy) of treated cells with Fu/NCur/SeNPs confirmed the capability of NCs to induce severe apoptosis and deformation signs in cancerous cells. The bio-based constituents of Fu/NCur/SeNPs and advocate their prospective applications for preventing/managing colorectal adenocarcinoma."
"Membrane fission involves a crucial step of lipid remodeling, in which the dynamin collar constricts and severs the tubulated lipid membrane at the neck of budding vesicles. Nevertheless, the difficulty in accurately determining the rotational dynamics of live endocytotic vesicles poses a limit on the elucidation of dynamin-induced membrane remodeling for endocytotic vesicle scission. Herein, we designed a DNA-modified gold homodimer (AuHD)-based anisotropic plasmonic probe with uniform surface chemistry, minimizing orientational fluctuation within vesicle encapsulation. Using AuHDs as cargos to image the dynamics of cargo-containing vesicles during endocytosis, we showed that, prior to detachment from plasma membrane, the cargo-containing vesicles underwent multiple intermittent twists of ~4° angular orientation relative to plasma membrane with a ~0.2 s dwell time. These findings suggest that the membrane torques resulting from dynamin actions in vivo constitute the pathway to membrane fission, potentially shedding light on how dynamin-mediated lipid remodeling orchestrates membrane fission."
"Imaging flow cytometry is a technology that performs microscopy image analysis of cells within flow cytometry and allows high-throughput, high-content cell analysis based on their intracellular molecular distribution and/or cellular morphology. While the technology has been available for a couple of decades, it has recently gained significant attention as technical limitations for higher throughput, sorting capability, and additional imaging dimensions have been overcome with various approaches. These evolutions have enabled imaging flow cytometry to offer a variety of solutions for life science and medicine that are not possible with conventional flow cytometry or microscopy-based screening. It is anticipated that the extent of applications will expand in the upcoming years as the technology becomes more accessible through dissemination. In this review, we will cover the technical advances that have led to this new generation of imaging flow cytometry, focusing on the advantages and limitations of each technique."
"Tramadol, an opioid analgesic, is known to induce testicular damage and impair reproductive parameters. Vitamin D3, recognized for its antioxidant and protective properties, might offer a potential protective effect against tramadol-induced testicular damage. This study observed the effects of co-administration of vitamin D3 and tramadol on serum kisspeptin levels, testicular histology, semen parameters, testosterone levels, and oxidative stress markers in male rats."
A separate tibial tubercle fragment (TF) is found in up to half of all bicondylar tibial plateau (BTP) fractures. Adequate healing of the TF is required to reconstitute the extensor mechanism of the knee. The purpose of this study was to compare outcomes after surgical fixation of BTP fractures with and without a TF.
"Single-cell lineage tracing (scLT) is a powerful technique that integrates cellular barcoding with single-cell sequencing technologies. This new approach enables the simultaneous measurement of cell fate and molecular profiles at single-cell resolution, uncovering the gene regulatory program of cell fate determination. However, a comprehensive scLT database is not yet available. Here, we present the single-cell lineage tracing database (scLTdb, https://scltdb.com) containing 109 datasets that are manually curated and analyzed through a standard pipeline. The scLTdb provides interactive analysis modules for visualizing and re-analyzing scLT datasets, especially the comprehensive cell fate analysis and lineage relationship analysis. Importantly, scLTdb also allows users to identify fate-related gene signatures. In conclusion, scLTdb provides an interactive interface of scLT data exploration and analysis, and will facilitate the understanding of cell fate decision and lineage commitment in development and diseases."
"The present research aimed to evaluate whether two sensors, optical and laser, could highlight the change in olive trees' canopy structure due to pruning. Therefore, two proximal sensors were mounted on a ground vehicle (Kubota B2420 tractor): a multispectral sensor (OptRx ACS 430 AgLeader) and a 2D LiDAR sensor (Sick TIM 561). The multispectral sensor was used to evaluate the potential effect of biomass variability before pruning on sensor response. The 2D LiDAR was used to assess its ability to discriminate volume before and after pruning. Data were collected in a traditional olive grove located in Tenute di Cesa Farm, in the east of Tuscany, Italy, characterized by a 4x6 m planting layout and by developed plants. LiDAR data were used to measure canopy volumes, height, and diameter, and the generated point cloud was studied to assess the difference in density between treatments. Ten plants were selected for the study. To validate the LiDAR results, manual measurements of the canopy height and diameter dimensions of the plants were taken. The pruning weights of the monitored plants were obtained to assess the correlation with the canopy characterization data. The results obtained showed that pruning did not affect the results of the multispectral sensor, and the potential variation in canopy density and porosity did not lead to different results with this instrument. Plant volumes, height, and diameters calculated with the LiDAR sensor correlated well with the values of manual measurements, while volume differences between before and after pruning obtained good correlations with pruning weights (Pearson correlation coefficient: 0.66-0.83). The study of point cloud density in canopy thickness and height showed different shapes before and after pruning, especially in the former case. Correlations between point cloud density obtained from LiDAR and multispectral sensor results were not statistically significant. Even if more studies are necessary, the results obtained can be of interest in pruning management."
"Proximal gastrectomy (PG) is commonly used to remove proximal gastric cancer leading to gastroesophageal reflux and requires digestive tract reconstruction. This study is to compare the performance of esophagogastrostomy (EG), jejunal interposition (JI), and double tract reconstruction (DTR) on post-PG reconstruction effectiveness."
"There is overwhelming evidence that the microbiome can be important to host physiology and fitness. As such, there is interest in and some theoretical work on understanding when hosts and microbiomes (co)evolve so that microbes benefit hosts and hosts favour beneficial microbes. However, the outcome of evolution likely depends on how microbes benefit hosts. Here, we use adaptive dynamics to investigate how host and symbiont evolution depend on whether symbionts increase host lifespan or host reproduction in a simple model of host and symbiont dynamics. In addition, we investigate 2 ways hosts release (and transmit) symbionts: by releasing symbionts steadily during their lifetime or by releasing them at reproduction, potentially increasing symbionts' chances of infecting the host's offspring. The former is strict horizontal transmission, whereas the latter is also a form of indirect or ""pseudovertical"" transmission. Our first key result is that the evolution of symbionts that benefit host fecundity requires pseudovertical transmission, while the evolution of symbionts that benefit host lifespan does not. Furthermore, our second key result is that when investing in host benefits is costly to the free-living symbiont stage, intermediate levels of pseudovertical transmission are needed for selection to favour beneficial symbionts. This is true regardless of fitness effects because release at reproduction increases the free-living symbiont population, which increases competition for hosts. Consequently, hosts could evolve away from traits that favour beneficial symbionts. Generally, our work emphasizes the importance of different forms of vertical transmission and fitness benefits in host, microbiome, and holobiont evolution as highlighted by our prediction that the evolution of fecundity-increasing symbionts requires parent-to-offspring transmission."
"Neural stem cells from the subventricular zone (SVZ) neurogenic niche provide neurons that integrate in the olfactory bulb circuitry. However, in response to cortical injuries, the neurogenic activity of the SVZ is significantly altered, leading to increased number of neuroblasts with a modified migration pattern that leads cells towards the site of injury. Despite the increased neurogenesis and migration, many newly generated neurons fail to survive or functionally integrate into the cortical circuitry. Providing the injured area with the adequate signaling molecules may improve both migration and functional integration of newly generated neurons."
Limited data are available on the outcome of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in patients with solid organ transplantation (SOT). We describe the natural history of pre-existing IBD and de novo IBD after SOT.
"Individuals who commit criminal behaviors are often thought to prioritize short-term goals rather than long-term goals (i.e., a present vs. a future time orientation). Though previous theories of crime and empirical research support a relationship among future time orientation, criminal thinking, and illegal behaviors, there is disagreement in the literature about how to operationalize the multidimensional construct of future time orientation. The primary aim of this pre-registered survey study was to measure multiple components of future time orientation to better understand the relationship with criminality-related outcomes. Participants were 248 undergraduate college students. Survey materials included a measure of impulsivity (Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-11), self-control (Brief Self-Control Scale), delay discounting (Monetary Choice Questionnaire), and Carstensen's Future Time Perspective Scale. Participants also completed two measures of criminal thinking style (the Texas Christian University Criminal Thinking Scale, the Criminogenic Cognitions Scale) and an illegal behaviors checklist. Bivariate results demonstrated a negative relationship between future time orientation (i.e., low impulsivity, high self-control, high future time perspective) and criminal thinking style. The relationship between delay discounting and criminal thinking was in the hypothesized direction but failed to reach statistical significance. Multiple regression analyses indicated that the measure of self-control had the most consistent and incrementally significant relationship with both criminal thinking style and illegal behaviors. Theoretical and practical implications of the results are discussed along with study limitations and future directions."
"Dental implant coronal surfaces designed with the primary goal of maintaining crestal bone levels may also promote bacterial adhesion, leading to soft tissue inflammation and peri-implant bone loss. Achieving an optimal surface roughness that minimizes bacterial adhesion while preserving crestal bone is crucial. It is hypothesized that a specific threshold surface roughness value may exist below which, and above which, initial bacterial adhesion does not statistically change. This study evaluated 12 commercially available and 2 custom-designed implant surfaces for their physicochemical properties and initial bacterial adhesion, as represented by Streptococcus oralis (S. oralis) the dominant initial colonizer of the successive waves of bacterial consortia that result in plaque and biofilm formation. Implants were immersed in a S. oralis suspension for 4 h, after which microbial viability was assessed. Marked differences were observed in surface roughness, chemical composition, and wettability, and S. oralis adhesion. Surfaces with Sa > 1 μm had significantly more adherent bacteria after 4 h compared to those with Sa < 1 μm, despite complexity. Adding nanotopography to dual-acid etched surfaces further reduced bacterial adhesion compared to surfaces without these features. The role of chemical composition and wettability was less influential than roughness. In conclusion, there is a cut-off threshold roughness around Sa = 1 μm, above which the adhesion of bacteria increases significantly to a plateau level; while below which, bacterial adhesion is equivalent to a machined surface despite the surface texture of the implant collar."
"Transcription factors (TFs), including steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1), T-box transcription factor (TPIT) and pituitary transcription factor-1 (PIT-1), play a pivotal role in the cytodifferentiation of adenohypophysis. However, the impact of TFs on the growth patterns of nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas (NFPAs) remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the correlation between the expression of TFs and NFPAs growth patterns. Preoperative MRI in 171 patients who underwent surgery for nonfunctioning pituitary macroadenomas were analyzed to determine tumor growth patterns. Immunohistochemical staining for transcription factors PIT-1, TPIT, and SF-1 was done on all samples. Extrasellar growth was divided into three principal directions: infrasellar, suprasellar and lateral cavernous sinus invasion (CSI). Suprasellar extension was defined as tumor extension superior to the tuberculum sellae-dorsum sellae line, inferior extension as invasion through the sellar floor into the sphenoid sinus or clivus and CSI as Knosp grading score of 3 ~ 4. Statistical analysis to compare the groups was conducted using the Fisher's exact test and t-test. TPIT-expressing tumors were more likely to exhibit combined infrasellar extension (55.17 vs 17.70%, p < 0.0001), as well as isolated infrasellar extension (18.97 vs 0%, p < 0.0001) compared to SF-1-expressing tumors. Conversely, SF-1-expressing tumors were more likely to exhibit combined suprasellar extension (92.92 vs 77.59%, p = 0.0061), as well as isolated suprasellar extension (75.22 vs 41.38%, p < 0.0001). TPIT-expressing tumors had a significantly higher CSI invasion (55.17 vs 35.40%, p = 0.0148). The mean maximal tumor diameter in TPIT and SF-1 macroadenomas was similar (28 vs 26 mm, p = 0.1213). The expression of TFs affects the extrasellar growth pattern of NFPAs. TPIT tumors exhibit a higher propensity for bone invasion and CSI, while SF-1 tumors tend to extend into the suprasellar region. Isolated infrasellar extension is specific to TPIT tumors and can serve as a radiologic sign to distinguish between TPIT tumors and SF-1 tumors."
"Chronic liver diseases, including cirrhosis and liver failure, remain formidable challenges due to their complex progression and limited therapeutic options. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy has emerged as a game-changing approach, leveraging its potent immunomodulatory, anti-fibrotic, and regenerative capabilities, along with the ability to transdifferentiate into hepatocytes. This review delves into the latest advances in MSC-based treatments for chronic and end-stage liver diseases, as highlighted in current clinical trials. MSCs derived from bone marrow and umbilical cord have shown remarkable promise in reversing liver damage, improving liver function, and providing hope for patients who do not respond to conventional therapies. When administered through hepatic, portal, or peripheral veins, MSCs have significantly improved liver histology, reduced fibrosis, and restored functional capacity. Furthermore, MSC-derived materials, such as extracellular vesicles and exosomes, are emerging as cutting-edge tools for treating liver failure and mitigating post-transplant complications. While autologous MSC-derived hepatocytes hold promise for non-fatal cirrhosis, allogeneic MSCs are being applied in more severe conditions, including liver failure and transplantation cases. Despite these promising early outcomes, larger trials and long-term studies are essential to fully harness MSCs as a transformative, off-the-shelf alternative to liver transplantation, heralding a new era in regenerative liver therapies."

"Diabetic retinopathy, a major cause of vision loss, is characterized by neurovascular changes in the retina. The lack of effective treatments to preserve vision in diabetic patients remains a significant challenge. A previous study from our laboratory demonstrated that 12-week treatment with MDL 72527, a pharmacological inhibitor of spermine oxidase (SMOX, a critical regulator of polyamine metabolism), reduced neurodegeneration in diabetic mice. Utilizing the streptozotocin-induced diabetic mouse model and MDL 72527, the current study investigated the effectiveness of SMOX inhibition on the measures of vision impairment and neuro-glial injury following 24 weeks of diabetes. Reductions in visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and inner retinal function in diabetic mice were improved by MDL 72527 treatment. Diabetes-induced changes in neuronal-specific class III tubulin (Tuj-1), synaptophysin, glutamine synthetase, and vimentin were attenuated in response to SMOX inhibition. In conclusion, our findings show that SMOX inhibition improved visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and inner retinal function and mitigated diabetes-induced neuroglial damage during long-term diabetes. Targeting SMOX signaling may provide a potential strategy for reducing retinal neuronal damage and preserving vision in diabetes."
"With the advancement of scientific research, the demand for gene-edited rabbit models is increasing. However, there are limited pregnancy and feeding management systems for gene-edited rabbits, leading to low survival rates among gene-edited rabbits prepared by many inexperienced researchers. Therefore, proper guidance is essential. This article summarizes the pregnancy and feeding practices for genetically modified rabbits developed in the author's laboratory and outlines a set of fundamental processes. These include pregnancy diagnosis, antenatal care, midwifery, assisted breastfeeding, weaning, and other procedures, along with the rescue and care of weak newborn rabbits. Compared to the traditional natural childbirth and nurturing methods used in rabbit farms, this approach involves more refined management, requiring additional time and effort but significantly increasing the survival rate of suckling rabbits. The methods described in this article are suitable for most laboratory breeding scenarios involving gene-edited or embryo-transferred rabbits and provide a straightforward and effective reference for other researchers."
"Interconnected feedback loops are prevalent across biological mechanisms, including cell fate transitions enabled by epigenetic mechanisms in carcinomas. However, the operating principles of these networks remain largely unexplored. Here, we identify numerous interconnected feedback loops implicated in cell lineage decisions, which we discover to be the hallmarks of lower- and higher-dimensional state space. We demonstrate that networks having higher centrality nodes have restricted state space while those with lower centrality nodes have higher dimensional state space. The topologically distinct networks with identical node or loop counts have different steady-state distributions, highlighting the crucial influence of network structure on emergent dynamics. Further, regardless of topology, networks with autoregulated nodes exhibit multiple steady states, thereby ""liberating"" network dynamics from absolute topological control. These findings unravel the design principles of multistable networks implicated in fate decisions and can have crucial implications in engineering or comprehending multi-fate decision circuits."
"Tinnitus is one of the most common otologic comorbidities, particularly in older patients with severe hearing loss or deafness. Cochlear implants (CI) have been used for hearing rehabilitation more and more successfully in elderly patients and CI treatment is performed in Germany without an age limit. The aim of this follow-up study was to assess the tinnitus burden in the long-term follow-up of elderly patients with hearing rehabilitation using CI."

"Neural tube defects (NTDs) are defined as an incomplete closure of the neural tube (NT), with a prevalence of 1.2 per 1000 live births around the world. Methylation of the maternally imprinted gene Insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) is one of the epigenetic mechanisms that contribute significantly to the development of NTDs. Its important functions are the fetal growth and metabolism, as well as cell division and differentiation."
"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a condition that is widely prevalent and causes joint pain and disability, with programmed cell death (PCD) playing a role in its pathogenesis. This study aimed to identify biomarkers associated with PCD in OA and explore their potential roles. Three RNA-sequencing datasets (GSE114007, GSE51588 and GSE220243) related to OA were analysed. Differential expression and weighted gene co-expression network identified key differentially expressed PCD-related genes (DE-PRMGs). Potential biomarkers were identified and validated through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, correlation analyses, gene set enrichment analysis, single-cell expression and RT-qPCR. A total of 45 DE-PRMGs were identified, affecting pathways like TNF signalling and RNA degradation. BCL3, TREM2 and NRP2 were prioritized as potential OA biomarkers, which are associated with ribosome function and immune cell infiltration and potentially linked to PCD. The functional role of one of the molecules identified, BCL3, was explored further using a cell model of inflammation induced chondrocytes. BCL3 was significantly down regulated in OA samples from the public dataset and clinical samples analysed by RT-qPCR. BCL3 overexpression reduced apoptosis in chondrocytes stimulated with inflammatory cytokines. Thus the functional studies highlighted the anti-apoptotic role of BCL3 in chondrocytes and provide new insights into OA pathogenesis with potential for future therapeutic development."

"We present the case of a patient who came to the emergency department with a significant decrease in vision and dilated pupil in the left eye. Since neurological pathologies were primarily considered, diffusion brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and brain computed tomography (CT) were requested. After the results were reported as normal, we were consulted. On examination, the anterior segment was normal but we detected shiny pearl-like formations in the anterior vitreous, condensation at the inferior of the posterior vitreous, and a scar in the macula. When we evaluated the orbital section of the current brain CT, we detected an intraocular foreign body (IOFB). On the brain MRI, we saw a large artifact that obscured the left orbit and surrounding anatomical structures. When we questioned again, we learned that he had been admitted to another emergency department two months prior due to an object hitting his left eye, where the eye was only washed with saline. Our case emphasizes that ocular siderosis caused by IOFBs should be kept in mind in the differential diagnosis of anisocoria, especially before MRI. Because metallic objects may move during MRI, undiagnosed IOFBs can cause serious ocular side effects."
"Identifying pharmacological probes for human proteins represents a key opportunity to accelerate the discovery of new therapeutics. High-content screening approaches to expand the ligandable proteome offer the potential to expedite the discovery of novel chemical probes to study protein function. Screening libraries of reactive fragments by chemoproteomics offers a compelling approach to ligand discovery, however, optimising sample throughput, proteomic depth, and data reproducibility remains a key challenge. We report a versatile, label-free quantification proteomics platform for competitive profiling of cysteine-reactive fragments against the native proteome. This high-throughput platform combines SP4 plate-based sample preparation with rapid chromatographic gradients. Data-independent acquisition performed on a Bruker timsTOF Pro 2 consistently identified ~23,000 cysteine sites per run, with a total of ~32,000 cysteine sites profiled in HEK293T and Jurkat lysate. Crucially, this depth in cysteinome coverage is met with high data completeness, enabling robust identification of liganded proteins. In this study, 80 reactive fragments were screened in two cell lines identifying >400 ligand-protein interactions. Hits were validated through concentration-response experiments and the platform was utilised for hit expansion and live cell experiments. This label-free platform represents a significant step forward in high-throughput proteomics to evaluate ligandability of cysteines across the human proteome."
"The mechanism of the base-catalyzed thiol-epoxide stage of the thiol-ene/thiol-epoxide curing process was investigated using quantum chemical tools. This study searched for conventional tertiary amines with low to medium basicity as initiators to control reaction rates and tailor industrial applications. Challenges arise from the stronger basicity of initiators, leading to an uncontrollable and short curing application period. This problem was put into quantitative data through kinetic and energetic studies for the first time. Furthermore, the base catalyst formulation of curing agents distinctively has a short pot life. More reactivity of terminal epoxy rings than internal ones was highlighted for the curing agents. It was revealed that the reactivity augments during the curing process while environmental polarity changes from higher to lower, which is one of the reasons that triggers an autocatalytic phenomenon. Electronegative atoms like fluorine on thiols significantly decrease the nucleophilicity of formed thiolate anion, enabling longer curing application."
"Improved understanding of cardiomyocyte (CM) cell cycle regulation may allow researchers to stimulate pro-regenerative effects in injured hearts or promote maturation of human stem cell-derived CMs. Gene therapies, in particular, hold promise to induce controlled proliferation of endogenous or transplanted CMs via transient activation of mitogenic processes. Methods to identify and characterize candidate cardiac mitogens in vitro can accelerate translational efforts and contribute to the understanding of the complex regulatory landscape of CM proliferation and postnatal maturation. In this study, A CRISPR knockout-based screening strategy using in vitro neonatal rat ventricular myocyte (NRVM) monolayers is established, followed by candidate mitogen validation in mature 3-D engineered cardiac tissues (ECTs). This screen identified knockout of the purine metabolism enzyme adenosine deaminase (ADA-KO) as an effective pro-mitogenic stimulus. RNA-sequencing of ECTs further reveals increased pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) activity as the primary driver of ADA-KO-induced CM cycling. Inhibition of the pathway's rate limiting enzyme, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), prevented ADA-KO induced CM cycling, while increasing PPP activity via G6PD overexpression increased CM cycling. Together, this study demonstrates the development and application of a genetic/tissue engineering platform for in vitro discovery and validation of new candidate mitogens affecting regenerative or maturation states of cardiomyocytes."
Trastuzumab-deruxtecan (T-DXd) was approved for the treatment of HER2-positive patients with advanced gastric cancer in Japan based on the results of the DESTINY-Gastric01 trial. This study aimed to collect real-world data and evaluate the effectiveness and safety of T-DXd.
"The tobacco industry (TI) has undermined tobacco control policy for decades. The WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control Article 5.3 implementation guidelines provide guidance for preventing TI interference. Government officials responsible for policy implementation must understand these guidelines to manage TI tactics. This study assessed awareness, attitudes and practices of Article 5.3 guidelines among members of District Level Coordination Committees (DLCC) in Karnataka mandated with overseeing tobacco control activity."
"Homeobox genes (HOX), the master regulators, deploy a unique set of target genes to coordinate and orchestrate the spatiotemporal development of an organism. HOX encoded transcriptional factors regulate the expression of target genes by binding to the specific sequences on the genome. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and Chromatin Immunoprecipitation with Sequencing (ChIP-Seq) are widely used to map and understand specific gene locus and global regulatory regions on the genome. ChIP is a powerful technique of cross-linking the proteins bound to the DNA, fragmenting DNA to the desired size, and pulling them down using specific antibodies to enrich and analyze the protein-bound DNA. Based on the mapping information, a differential ChIP can be performed to understand cis-regulatory modulations at a defined locus by two developmental stages. This chapter describes the differential ChIP used to identify new targets by comparing two different developmental stages simultaneously using Drosophila melanogaster."
"Defined clinically by elevated blood pressure along with either proteinuria and/or maternal organ dysfunction, representing a major cause of morbidity and mortality pregnant women and newborns. Metformin (MET), an oral antidiabetic medication, has been shown to prevent preeclampsia (PE) through various mechanisms, including reducing inflammation, improving endothelial dysfunction, improving mitochondrial function, and altering cellular homeostasis and energy metabolism. Herein, we explored the role of MET in PE and its underlying molecular mechanisms using in in vivo experiments."
"Herein, a novel dual-function paper-based biosensor using diffusion wet area as readout has been developed for simple and sensitive detection of hyaluronidase (HAase) and human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 DNA, respectively. The target-regulated-water absorption hydrogel synthesized by hyaluronic acid (HA) and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) is chosen as an ideal material for diffusion wet area generation on paper. The hydrogel can be degraded through the enzymolysis of HA by HAase or the trans-cleavage of ssDNA by HPV DNA-activated CRISPR/cas12a system. Then the diffusion wet area generated by the broken hydrogel with the free water released from the hydrogel dropped on the glass fiber filter paper can be captured by a smart-phone and calculated by the product of the pixel ratio (pixels of wet area/pixels of glass fiber filter paper) and actual area of the filter paper. The diffusion wet area has good linear relationships with HAase (0-40 U/mL) and HPV 16 DNA (0.1-1000 pM), respectively. The biosensor provides a novel signal readout mode, shows satisfactory sensitivity with the detection limits of 0.15 U/mL for HAase and 66.95 fM for HPV 16 DNA, and has been successfully used for HPV 16 DNA and HAase detection in clinical urine and cervical brush samples, which is promising for early cervical cancer screening and HPV monitoring in HPV patients."
"Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a highly heterogeneous disease group. Ibrutinib's monotherapy or combination therapy is effective in relapsed/refractory (R/R) DLBCL. However, the treatment response in R/R DLBCL varies from 15% to 90% with different regimens, and the tolerance remains controversial."
"ErbB3 is markedly overexpressed in breast cancer cells and is associated with resistance and metastasis. Additionally, ErbB3 expression levels are positively correlated with low densities of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, a marker of poor prognosis. Consequently, ErbB3 is a promising therapeutic target for cancer immunotherapy. Here, we report the generation of ErbB3-targeted chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified natural killer (NK) cells by transducing cord blood-derived primary NK cells using vsv-g envelope-pseudotyped lentiviral vectors. Transduced cells displayed stable CAR-expressing activity and increased cytotoxicity against ErbB3-positive breast cancer cell lines. Furthermore, anti-ErbB3 (aErbB3) CAR-NK cells strongly reduced the tumor burden in the SK-BR-3 xenograft mouse model without observable side effects. These findings underscore the potential of aErbB3 CAR-NK cells as targeted immunotherapy for ErbB3-positive breast cancer, suggesting a promising alternative to conventional treatments."
"In vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) is a non-invasive imaging technique used to visualize the layers of the cornea and conjunctiva in real time. In patients with atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC) and vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC), this technology can be useful in diagnosing and monitoring the disease, as well as evaluating the efficacy of treatments. IVCM can reveal subclinical abnormalities in the corneal and conjunctival epithelium such as inflammatory cell infiltrates and tissue damage, which can provide insight into the pathogenesis of AKC. In AKC, IVCM reveals changes around the conjunctival papillae, inflammatory cells around punctate defects in the corneal epithelium, changes in subbasal nerve morphology, and deteriorations in the goblet cells in the meibomian gland are observed. In VKC, alterations can be observed in the diameter, brightness and nucleus/cytoplasm ratio of the superficial epithelial cells in the cornea. The use of IVCM in AKC and VKC can therefore aid in the early detection and management of the disease, as well as contribute to a better understanding of its underlying mechanisms."

"The present study aimed to assess the anthropometric nutrition status and physical growth of Terena Indigenous children living in an urban zone of the city of Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil, in their first year of life. Children who were born between June 2017 and July 2018 (n = 42) participated in the study. In total, 4.8% of the children presented a low height for age (H/A) in the 12th month of life. According to body mass index (BMI) for age, overweight affected 15.0% of the individuals belonging to the female sex at the age of 12 months, and obesity was observed in 4.8% of the children belonging to both sexes at this same age. Terena Indigenous children's length curve failed to reach the median value recorded for the reference population. Weight and body mass index curves for age, mainly among individuals belonging to the female sex, were often above the reference median value. The Terena growth curves recorded an average linear growth of lower than expected and a weight gain of higher than the reference median. This profile is compatible with the persistence of unfavorable conditions for children's growth and nutrition, as well as with an accelerated process of food and nutritional transition, where the racial dimension of health inequities cannot be disregarded."
"The modified 5-item frailty index is a relatively new tool to assess the post-operative complication risks. In urology, there is limited literature on the impact of frailty on percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) outcomes. We aimed to compare the predictive value of the modified 5-item frailty index (mFI-5) to identify high risk patients prior to PCNL."
"Sexual dysfunctions impair the intimate relationships of up to one-third of the population. Virtual reality (VR) offers innovative treatment options for both mental and sexual disorders, such as female orgasmic disorder and erectile disorder. Sexual aversion disorder (SAD)-the anxiety, disgust, and avoidance of sexual contexts-is a chronic condition commonly treated with anxiety-reducing strategies, such as exposure-based therapy. Despite exposure's efficacy in reducing SAD symptoms, VR exposure therapy's (VRET) effectiveness remains unexplored for this condition."
"The discovery of spine anatomy followed a problem/solution pattern; it took almost 1000 years to transition from nihilism to perfectionism. Before the 16th century, the main issue was accessing and opening the spine. The level of knowledge progressed rapidly when the spinal canal was opened longitudinally during the 16th century. The 17th century was an incubation period that allowed the consolidation of the science of anatomy with the help of art, philosophy, and other sciences. In particular, the conservation of the cadaver was improved. Famous spine anatomists were close to Rembrandt, master of the chiaroscuro technique, which helped to improve the anatomical drawings significantly. Descriptions of the pathological anatomy of the spine were first published early in the 17th century, but progress was slow up to the end of the 18th century due to a lack of occasions for clinical-pathological correlations. Normal anatomy became remarkably accurate in the 18th and 19th centuries when soft tissues and connections (e.g., among the intervertebral discs) were studied in detail. The slow compressions due to underlying diseases and then the degenerative processes were subsequently described."
"Polygenic risk scores (PRS) are measures of genetic susceptibility to human health traits. With the advent of large data repositories combining genetic data and phenotypic information, PRS are providing valuable insights into the genetic architecture of complex diseases and are transforming the landscape of precision medicine."
"This study explores the 3D printing of alginate dialdehyde-gelatin (ADA-GEL) inks incorporating phytotherapeutic agents, such as ferulic acid (FA), and silicate mesoporous bioactive glass nanoparticles (MBGNs) at two different concentrations. 3D scaffolds with bioactive properties suitable for bone tissue engineering (TE) were obtained. The degradation and swelling behaviour of films and 3D printed scaffolds indicated an accelerated trend with increasing MBGN content, while FA appeared to stabilize the samples. Determination of the degree of crosslinking validated the increased stability of hydrogels due to the addition of FA and 0.1% (w/v) MBGNs. The incorporation of MBGNs not only improved the effective moduli and conferred bioactive properties through the formation of hydroxyapatite (HAp) on the surface of ADA-GEL-based samples but also enhanced VEGF-A expression of MC3T3-E1 cells. The beneficial impact of FA and low concentrations of MBGNs in ADA-GEL-based inks for 3D (bio)printing applications was corroborated through various printing experiments, resulting in higher printing resolution, as also confirmed by rheological measurements. Cytocompatibility investigations revealed enhanced MC3T3-E1 cell activity and viability. Furthermore, the presence of mineral phases, as confirmed by an in vitro biomineralization assay, and increased ALP activity after 21 days, attributed to the addition of FA and MBGNs, were demonstrated. Considering the acquired structural and biological properties, along with efficient drug delivery capability, enhanced biological activity, and improved 3D printability, the newly developed inks exhibit promising potential for biofabrication and bone TE."
"The plant master photoperiodic regulator CONSTANS (CO) interacts with Nuclear Factor-Y subunits B2 (NF-YB2) and C9 (NF-YC9) and transcriptionally activates the florigen gene FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), regulating floral transition. However, the molecular mechanism of the functional four-component complex assembly in the nucleus remains elusive. We report that co-phase separation of CO with NF-YB2/NF-YC9/FT precisely controls heterogeneous CO assembly and FT transcriptional activation. In response to light signals, CO proteins form functional percolation clusters from a diffuse distribution in a B-box-motif-dependent manner. Multivalent coassembly with NF-YC9 and NF-YB2 prevents inhibitory condensate formation and is necessary to maintain proper CO assembly and material properties. The intrinsically disordered region (IDR) of NF-YC9, containing a polyglutamine motif, fine-tunes the functional properties of CO/NF-YB/NF-YC condensates. Specific FT promoter recognition with polyelectrolyte partitioning also enables the fluidic functional properties of CO/NF-YB/NF-YC/FT condensates. Our findings offer novel insights into the tunable macromolecular condensation of the CO/NF-YB/NF-YC/FT complex in controlling flowering in the photoperiod control."
"Warm temperatures accelerate plant growth, but the underlying molecular mechanism is not fully understood. Here, we show that increasing the temperature from 22°C to 28°C rapidly activates proliferation in the apical shoot and root meristems of wild-type Arabidopsis seedlings. We found that one of the central regulators of cell proliferation, the cell cycle inhibitor RETINOBLASTOMA-RELATED (RBR), is suppressed by warm temperatures. RBR became hyper-phosphorylated at a conserved CYCLIN-DEPENDENT KINASE (CDK) site in young seedlings growing at 28°C, in parallel with the stimulation of the expressions of the regulatory CYCLIN D/A subunits of CDK(s). Interestingly, while under warm temperatures ectopic RBR slowed down the acceleration of cell proliferation, it triggered elongation growth of post-mitotic cells in the hypocotyl. In agreement, the central regulatory genes of thermomorphogenic response, including PIF4 and PIF7, as well as their downstream auxin biosynthetic YUCCA genes (YUC1-2 and YUC8-9) were all up-regulated in the ectopic RBR expressing line but down-regulated in a mutant line with reduced RBR level. We suggest that RBR has both canonical and non-canonical functions under warm temperatures to control proliferative and elongation growth, respectively."
"Preterm birth survivors are at risk for short- and long-term respiratory morbidity. This includes increased rates of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and infectious morbidity. Previous studies showed increased utilization of healthcare services throughout early childhood. However, only a few large-scale studies showed the effect on respiratory morbidity throughout the full spectrum of gestational age at birth. The aim of this study was to show the healthcare burden associated with prematurity, in a large nationwide cohort."
"One of the foremost targets in the advancement of biomaterials to engineer vascularized tissues is not only to replicate the composition of the intended tissue but also to create thicker structures incorporating a vascular network for adequate nutrients and oxygen supply. For the first time, to the best of current knowledge, a clinically relevant biomaterial is developed, demonstrating that hydrogels made from the human decellularized extracellular matrix can exhibit robust mechanical properties (in the kPa range) and angiogenic capabilities simultaneously. These properties enable the culture and organization of human umbilical vein endothelial cells into tubular structures, maintaining their integrity for 14 days in vitro without the need for additional polymers or angiogenesis-related factors. This is achieved by repurposing the placenta chorionic membrane (CM), a medical waste with an exceptional biochemical composition, into a valuable resource for bioengineering purposes. After decellularization, the CM underwent chemical modification with methacryloyl groups, giving rise to methacrylated CM (CMMA). CMMA preserved key proteins, as well as glycosaminoglycans. The resulting hydrogels rapidly photopolymerize and have enhanced strength and customizable mechanical properties. Furthermore, they demonstrate angio-vasculogenic competence in vitro and in vivo, holding significant promise as a humanized platform for the engineering of vascularized tissues."

"This work proposes a convolutional neural network (CNN) that utilizes different combinations of parametric images computed from cine cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images, to classify each slice for possible myocardial scar tissue presence. The CNN performance comparison in respect to expert interpretation of CMR with late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) images, used as ground truth (GT), was conducted on 206 patients (158 scar, 48 control) from Centro Cardiologico Monzino (Milan, Italy) at both slice- and patient-levels. Left ventricle dynamic features were extracted in non-enhanced cine images using parametric images based on both Fourier and monogenic signal analyses. The CNN, fed with cine images and Fourier-based parametric images, achieved an area under the ROC curve of 0.86 (accuracy 0.79, F1 0.81, sensitivity 0.9, specificity 0.65, and negative (NPV) and positive (PPV) predictive values 0.83 and 0.77, respectively), for individual slice classification. Remarkably, it exhibited 1.0 prediction accuracy (F1 0.98, sensitivity 1.0, specificity 0.9, NPV 1.0, and PPV 0.97) in patient classification as a control or pathologic. The proposed approach represents a first step towards scar detection in contrast-free CMR images. Patient-level results suggest its preliminary potential as a screening tool to guide decisions regarding LGE-CMR prescription, particularly in cases where indication is uncertain."
"Rak jelita grubego (RJG) jest jednym z najczęściej rozpoznawanych nowotworów złośliwych: co roku notowane jest około 1,9 miliona nowych przypadków. Pomimo opracowania metod umożliwiających jego wykrywanie na początkowym etapie choroby i wprowadzenia nowych, skuteczniejszych terapii, RJG plasuje się na drugim miejscu wśród przyczyn zgonów wywołanych nowotworami. Wyniki najnowszych badań podkreślają rolę transporterów kwasów tłuszczowych, tj. translokazy kwasów tłuszczowych/klasterowego genu różnicowania 36 (ang. fatty acid translocase/cluster of differentiation 36, FAT/CD36), białka transportującego kwasy tłuszczowe (ang. fatty acid transport proteins, FATPs) oraz białka wiążącego kwasy tłuszczowe (ang. fatty acid-binding proteins, FABPs) w patogenezie RJG.

"While epidemiological and experimental studies have demonstrated kidney-protective effects of estrogen and female sex in adulthood, some epidemiological data showed deterioration of kidney function during puberty when estrogen production increases. However, molecular mechanisms explaining these conflicting phenomena remain unknown. Here, we showed that the pubertal sex hormone surge in female mice increases susceptibility to kidney ischemia reperfusion injury partly via downregulation of insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) expression in proximal tubules. Adult mice ovariectomized pre-pubertally (at postnatal day 21) showed strong tolerance to kidney ischemia, which was partly reversed by the administration of 17β-estradiol, while adult mice ovariectomized post-pubertally (at 8 weeks of age) were vulnerable to kidney ischemia. Kidney tubular IGF-1R protein expression decreased during postnatal growth but was highly expressed in adult mice ovariectomized pre-pubertally and in infant mice, which might be partly explained by different expression of an E3 ligase (MDM2) of IGF-1R. Mice deficient of Igf-1r in proximal tubules (iIGF-1RKO mice) during postnatal kidney growth showed increased susceptibility to ischemic injury. RNA-seq and western blotting analysis using proximal tubular cells from pre-pubertally ovariectomized iIGF-1RKO and control mice revealed altered expression of cell cycle-associated molecules such as cyclin D1. These results suggest that Igf-1r deletion during postnatal growth renders proximal tubular cells susceptible to ischemia possibly via altered cell cycle regulation. Thus, our findings provide evidence that exposure to pubertal sex hormones leads to increased susceptibility to kidney ischemia, which is partly mediated by modulation of IGF-1R signaling."

"Three common strategies exist for managing the inflatable penile prosthesis reservoir during revision surgery: the original reservoir can be (a) removed, (b) deactivated and left in situ, sometimes referred to as ""drain and retain"" (DR), or (c) validated and reconnected to new cylinders, which we have termed ""reservoir recycling"" (RR)."
"Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) has evolved into a fundamental tool in the biological sciences, playing a pivotal role in predicting molecular structures and functions. With broad applications in protein and nucleic acid modeling, MSAs continue to underpin advancements across a range of disciplines. MSAs are not only foundational for traditional sequence comparison techniques but also increasingly important in the context of artificial intelligence (AI)-driven advancements. Recent breakthroughs in AI, particularly in protein and nucleic acid structure prediction, rely heavily on the accuracy and efficiency of MSAs to enhance remote homology detection and guide spatial restraints. This review traces the historical evolution of MSA, highlighting its significance in molecular structure and function prediction. We cover the methodologies used for protein monomers, protein complexes, and RNA, while also exploring emerging AI-based alternatives, such as protein language models, as complementary or replacement approaches to traditional MSAs in application tasks. By discussing the strengths, limitations, and applications of these methods, this review aims to provide researchers with valuable insights into MSA's evolving role, equipping them to make informed decisions in structural prediction research."
"Shared-decision making is crucial in today's society. Although penile prosthesis surgery has had significant improvements regarding technique and materials over the last few decades - with the highest satisfaction rate in erectile dysfunction treatment at present time -, dissatisfaction can occur because of bad preoperative counseling with the creation of unrealistic expectations. This paper includes a small narrative review regarding the most important preoperative variables to be discussed in the preoperative setting. Literature search was conducted in December 2023 using PubMed. Additionally, our own standardized flowchart for preoperative counseling was added. The most important aspects of preoperative counseling include a description of the pathophysiology of erectile dysfunction as well as alternative treatments. Information should be given about which implant categories exist. Additionally, some information about the procedure itself as well as the financial aspect should be communicated. The most frequent and most important complications should be illustrated. Last but not least, the patient's expectations should be evaluated. Our added standardized flowchart with figure acts as a practical guideline for professionals as well as for patients. Our standardized approach for preoperative counseling emphasizes reasonable postoperative expectations aiming for a well-informed patient with high postoperative satisfaction. Our general strategy is to underpromise and overdeliver."
"Head and neck cancer (HNC) represents a heterogeneous group of malignancies with increasing global incidence and notable mortality. Early detection is essential for improving survival rates and minimizing recurrence; however, existing diagnostic methods are often invasive and complex. There is a need for noninvasive and more effective approaches for early detection and real-time monitoring of HNC. Saliva contains various biomolecules that may serve as indicators of HNC. As a result, saliva-based biomarkers have emerged as a transformative approach in the diagnosis and treatment of HNC due to their ease of collection, non-invasiveness, and potential to provide details about biomolecular changes associated with cancer progression. This narrative review synthesizes the current literature on the potential of saliva as a noninvasive diagnostic tool for HNC. It highlights various biomarkers found in saliva, including cell-free DNA, RNA, proteins, and metabolites, and explores emerging technologies in saliva detection that could transform the future of HNC management. Continued research efforts and larger-scale validation studies are essential to fully realize the potential of saliva-based biopsy and help pinpoint notable biomarkers to improve patient outcomes and reduce mortality associated with HNC worldwide."
"BACKGROUND Obstructive jaundice is a common surgical issue caused by obstruction in the bile ducts, which can result from factors such as stones or cancers in the main bile duct. This study aimed to investigate the effects of carvacrol, a compound known for its strong antioxidant properties, on intestinal damage, liver damage, and bacterial translocation in an animal model of obstructive jaundice. METHODS The study utilized six groups of six Wistar Albino rats each. Obstructive jaundice was induced in the rats through a surgical procedure, resulting in the enlargement of the common bile duct. Carvacrol was administered at a dose of 100 mg/kg to evaluate its therapeutic effects. Blood samples were collected for biochemical analysis, and tissue samples were obtained from the ileum and liver for histopathological examination. Additionally, samples from the spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes were collected for microbiological analysis. RESULTS The findings revealed that carvacrol did not have a significant therapeutic effect on liver and bowel damage or on bacterial translocation in the rats with obstructive jaundice. Despite carvacrol's known antioxidant properties, it failed to show benefits in this experimental model. CONCLUSION Carvacrol, while recognized for its antioxidant effects, did not demonstrate therapeutic efficacy in treating obstructive jaundice in rats. The study suggests that further research with a larger sample size may be necessary to potentially uncover positive effects and better understand carvacrol's potential role in managing obstructive jaundice."
LYB001 is a recombinant protein COVID-19 vaccine displaying a receptor-binding domain (RBD) in a highly immunogenic array on virus-like particles (VLPs). This study assessed the immunogenicity and safety of LYB001 as a booster.
"Glucosylceramide synthase (UGCG) is a key enzyme that catalyzes the initial glycosylation step in the biosynthesis of glycosphingolipids (GSLs) derived from glucosylceramide. UGCG is closely associated with various cellular processes, including the cell cycle, angiogenesis, multidrug resistance, and pathogen invasion. In this study, a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) library designed to target key genes involved in the sphingolipid metabolic pathway was utilized to elucidate their roles in Pseudorabies Virus (PRV). Those findings confirm a significant association between sphingolipid metabolism and PRV infection. In addition, this study demonstrated that the knockdown UGCG expression or inhibition of its activity significantly suppresses PRV infection. This suppression is accompanied by reduced expression of autophagy-related proteins that are induced by PRV infection, blockade of autophagic flux, and significant activation of the STING signaling pathway induced by PRV infection. Through extensive investigation, this research revealed that inhibition of UGCG affects the expression of lysosome-associated proteins, alters the lysosomal pH, disrupts lysosomal homeostasis, and impedes autophagolysosomal degradation. Additionally, UGCG inhibition influences the conversion of light chain 3-II (LC3-II) and the formation of LC3-STING complexes, negatively regulates the autophagic degradation of STING, and ensures sustained activation of the PRV-induced STING signaling pathway, thereby achieving resistance against PRV infection. Finally, through in vivo evaluation, this study revealed that UGCG inhibitors, Eliglustat hemitartrate and Ibiglustat, hold promise as potential therapeutics for the treatment of PRV infection. In summary, this study preliminarily elucidates the impact of UGCG on PRV infection and its associated molecular mechanisms, suggesting UGCG could serve as a potential novel target for the prevention and treatment of viral diseases such as PRV."
"This study aims to address the gap in understanding condom use (CU) behavior in Flanders (the Dutch-speaking community in Belgium) by applying a mixed methods approach, integrating both quantitative and qualitative data. Utilizing a large-scale survey of over 14,000 participants and 11 in-depth interviews, the study explores key factors influencing CU, including (amongst others) relationship status, attitudes toward condoms, and STI testing. Quantitative findings highlight significant predictors such as the type of partner (casual vs. steady), STI testing behaviors, and negative attitudes toward condoms. Qualitative insights further reveal personal experiences that complicate CU decisions, such as the disruption of sexual flow and emotional dynamics within relationships. These findings underscore the complexity of CU behavior, showing that practical barriers (e.g., discomfort, fit) and personal beliefs play pivotal roles. The study concludes that targeted public health interventions could focus on improving condom accessibility and addressing both practical and emotional factors. Recommendations for sexual health education include promoting communication around CU and enhancing condom experimentation and fit. These findings contribute valuable insights into enhancing sexual health outcomes through more nuanced, contextualized approaches to condom use."
"These case studies review the treatment of patients with overactive bladder (OAB), a chronic condition presenting with urinary urgency, often occurring with frequency and nocturia, which may or may not be associated with urinary incontinence.

"Dignity therapy is a brief, structured psychotherapeutic intervention originally designed to help last-stage cancer patients maintain their dignity. It consists of a semi-structured interview encouraging patients to talk about their lives. The recorded session are transcribed and edited, after which the patient has the opportunity to make further changes to the final document. It can be shared with whom the patient likes. We cross-culturally translated dignity therapy into Dutch and explored its feasibility of applying it to Dutch cognitively capable nursing home residents."
"Parasitic helminths are a major global health threat, infecting nearly one-fifth of the human population and causing significant losses in livestock and crops. Resistance to the few anthelmintic drugs is increasing. Here, we report a set of avocado fatty alcohols/acetates (AFAs) that exhibit nematocidal activity against four veterinary parasitic nematode species: Brugia pahangi, Teladorsagia circumcincta and Heligmosomoides polygyrus, as well as a multidrug resistant strain (UGA) of Haemonchus contortus. AFA shows significant efficacy in H. polygyrus infected mice. In C. elegans, AFA exposure affects all developmental stages, causing paralysis, impaired mitochondrial respiration, increased reactive oxygen species production and mitochondrial damage. In embryos, AFAs penetrate the eggshell and induce rapid developmental arrest. Genetic and biochemical tests reveal that AFAs inhibit POD-2, encoding an acetyl CoA carboxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in lipid biosynthesis. These results uncover a new anthelmintic class affecting lipid metabolism."
"Wnt/β-catenin signaling directs animal development and tissue renewal in a tightly controlled, cell- and tissue-specific manner. In the mammalian central nervous system, the atypical ligand Norrin controls angiogenesis and maintenance of the blood-brain barrier and blood-retina barrier through the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Like Wnt, Norrin activates signaling by binding and heterodimerizing the receptors Frizzled (Fzd) and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 or 6 (LRP5/6), leading to membrane recruitment of the intracellular transducer Dishevelled (Dvl) and ultimately stabilizing the transcriptional coactivator β-catenin. Unlike Wnt, the cystine knot ligand Norrin only signals through Fzd4 and additionally requires the co-receptor Tetraspanin12 (Tspan12); however, the mechanism underlying Tspan12-mediated signal enhancement is unclear. It has been proposed that Tspan12 integrates into the Norrin-Fzd4 complex to enhance Norrin-Fzd4 affinity or otherwise allosterically modulate Fzd4 signaling. Here, we measure direct, high-affinity binding between purified Norrin and Tspan12 in a lipid environment and use AlphaFold models to interrogate this interaction interface. We find that Tspan12 and Fzd4 can simultaneously bind Norrin and that a pre-formed Tspan12/Fzd4 heterodimer, as well as cells co-expressing Tspan12 and Fzd4, more efficiently capture low concentrations of Norrin than Fzd4 alone. We also show that Tspan12 competes with both heparan sulfate proteoglycans and LRP6 for Norrin binding and that Tspan12 does not impact Fzd4-Dvl affinity in the presence or absence of Norrin. Our findings suggest that Tspan12 does not allosterically enhance Fzd4 binding to Norrin or Dvl, but instead functions to directly capture Norrin upstream of signaling."
"Link prediction in heterogeneous networks is an active research topic in the field of complex network science. Recognizing the limitations of existing methods, which often overlook the varying contributions of different local structures within these networks, this study introduces a novel algorithm named SW-Metapath2vec. This algorithm enhances the embedding learning process by assigning weights to meta-path traces generated through random walks and translates the potential connections between nodes into the cosine similarity of embedded vectors. The study was conducted using multiple real-world and synthetic datasets to validate the proposed algorithm's performance. The results indicate that SW-Metapath2vec significantly outperforms benchmark algorithms. Notably, the algorithm maintains high predictive performance even when a substantial proportion of network nodes are removed, demonstrating its resilience and potential for practical application in analyzing large-scale heterogeneous networks. These findings contribute to the advancement of link prediction techniques and offer valuable insights and tools for related research areas."
"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a debilitating disease that impacts millions of individuals and has limited therapeutic options. A significant hindrance to therapeutic discovery is the lack of in vitro OA models that translate reliably to in vivo preclinical animal models. An alternative to traditional inflammatory cytokine models is the matrikine stimulation model, in which fragments of matrix proteins naturally found in OA tissues and synovial fluid, are used to stimulate cells of the joint. The objective of this study was to determine if matrikine stimulation of equine synovial fibroblasts and chondrocytes with fibronectin fragments (FN7-10) would result in an OA phenotype. We hypothesized that FN7-10 stimulation of equine articular cells would result in an OA phenotype with gene and protein expression changes similar to those previously described for human chondrocytes stimulated with FN7-10. Synovial fibroblasts and chondrocytes isolated from four horses were stimulated in monolayer culture for 6 or 18 h with 1 µM purified recombinant 42 kD FN7-10 in serum-free media. At the conclusion of stimulation, RNA was collected for targeted gene expression analysis and media for targeted protein production analysis. Consistent with our hypothesis, FN7-10 stimulation resulted in significant alterations to many important genes that are involved in OA pathogenesis including increased expression of IL-1β, IL-4, IL-6, CCL2/MCP-1, CCL5/RANTES, CXCL6/GCP-2, MMP-1, MMP-3, and MMP13. The results of this study suggest that the equine matrikine stimulation model of OA may prove useful for in vitro experiments leading up to preclinical trials."

"Ureteral stenosis is a frequent complication after kidney transplantation, causing significant morbidity and potential graft function impairment. Treatment options include conservative management, endourological procedures, surgical interventions and percutaneous nephrostomy (PCN). While PCN effectively relieves obstruction, it comes with its own complications. This study evaluates the risk factors, incidence, complications and outcomes of PCN in this population. We conducted a retrospective case series analysis of 98 kidney transplant recipients who underwent PCN. Data on demographics, clinical characteristics and procedural outcomes were collected and analysed to assess the incidence of complications and identify associated risk factors. Among the 98 recipients, the median age at transplant was 56 years, with 52% being male. The most common comorbidities included hypertension (75.5%) and diabetes mellitus (35.7%). Complications occurred in 38.8% of patients, with infections being the most frequent (74.4%), including urinary tract infections (28.9%) and pyelonephritis (22.4%). The primary organisms identified were gram-negative bacteria (55.1%). Reconstructive surgery was required in 35.7% of cases and patient survival was 83.7% at follow-up. In conclusion, PCN in kidney transplant recipients is associated with a high rate of complications, particularly infections. Effective management necessitates the identification and addressing of associated risk factors such as diabetes, elevated BMI and specific induction therapies. While PCN is vital for preserving graft function, further research should focus on refining clinical protocols and developing targeted preventive strategies for high-risk patients."
"The microbiome is increasingly regarded as a key component of human health, and analysis of microbiome data can aid in the development of precision medicine. Due to the high cost of shotgun metagenomic sequencing (SM-seq), microbiome analyses can be done cost-effectively in two phases: Phase 1-sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA, and Phase 2-SM-seq of an informative subsample. Existing research suggests strategies to select the subsample based on biological diversity and dissimilarity metrics calculated using operational taxonomic units (OTUs). However, the microbiome field has progressed towards amplicon sequencing variants (ASVs), as they provide more precise microbe identification and sample diversity information. The aim of this work is to compare the subsampling strategies for two-phase metagenomic studies when using ASVs instead of OTUs, and to propose data driven strategies for subsample selection through dimension reduction techniques. We used 199 samples of infant-gut microbiome data from the DIABIMMUNE project to generate ASVs and OTUs, then generated subsamples based on five existing biologically driven subsampling methods and two data driven methods. Linear discriminant analysis Effect Size (LEfSe) was used to assess differential representation of taxa between the subsamples and the overall sample. The use of ASVs showed a 50-93% agreement in the subsample selection with the use of OTUs for the subsampling methods evaluated, and showed a similar bacterial representation across all methods. Although sampling using ASVs and OTUs typically lead to similar results for each subsample, ASVs had more clades that differed in expression levels between allergic and non-allergic individuals across all sample sizes compared to OTUs, and led to more biomarkers discovered at Phase 2-SM-seq level."
"Optimal therapy following breast-conserving surgery in older adults with low-risk, early-stage breast cancer remains uncertain. The EUROPA trial aims to compare the effects of radiotherapy and endocrine therapy as single-modality treatments on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and ipsilateral breast tumour recurrence (IBTR) outcomes in this population."
To evaluate real-world glycaemic outcomes in children with type 1 diabetes (T1D) commencing advanced hybrid closed loop therapy (AHCL) and to explore these outcomes based on the cohort's clinical and socioeconomic characteristics.
"To exclusively evaluate, in vitro, the efficacy of five intracanal medicaments against Candida albicans and Enterococcus faecalis in infected single-rooted primary teeth. Forty-three teeth were selected, out of which 42 were simultaneously contaminated with C. albicans and E. faecalis, verified by measuring the initial quantification (IQ), whereas one tooth was used as sterile control. Forty-two teeth were then randomly assigned to six groups (n = 7 teeth in each); one was the control group, while the others received calcium hydroxide (CH), camphorated paramonochlorophenol (CMCP), CH/CMCP, chlorhexidine (CHX), or iodoform paste (IP). Two samples from each group were then randomly selected and evaluated under a scanning electron microscope along with the sterile control (n = 1) for qualitative analyses (n = 13). The remaining samples (n = 30) were collected after 7 days of intracanal medicaments (final quantification - FQ) and 7 days after medicament removal (residual quantification - RQ). ANOVA and Tukey's and c2 tests (p £ 0.05) were performed for the statistical analysis. All the medicaments, except CMCP, significantly reduced the levels of C. albicans from IQ to FQ (p = 0.046). Only CHX (p = 0.000) and IP (p = 0.007) showed a significant reduction from IQ to FQ against E. faecalis. The 2% CHX and IP demonstrated a favorable performance as an intracanal medicament, with a good antimicrobial activity against C. albicans and E. faecalis."
"Combining probiotics and prebiotics in synbiotics may present a synergistic approach to improve type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM); however, further evidence is required to establish the comparative efficacy of synbiotics versus probiotics. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis MN-Gup (MN-Gup) and a synbiotic mixture of MN-Gup and galactooligosaccharide (MN-Gup-GOS) on glycemic control in T2DM patients and explore possible mechanisms."
"Chronic illness requires a web of actors, both professional and familiar, who constitute the support network of the chronically ill. This article aims to analyse how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted on the delicate balance of these supports. Qualitative research was conducted among people with four types of chronic diseases in France: cystic fibrosis, kidney disease, haemophilia and mental disorders. Data on social support was collected using an innovative methodology combining semi-directive interviews (n = 54) and drawings (n = 32). During the first French lockdown (March-May 2020), the chronically ill were mainly supported by the usual support actors of their primary network: spouse and/or family. However, the COVID-19 health crisis has led to several changes in their support network; health-care professionals diversified their support roles and new supporting actors emerged, especially non-human entities and patient organisations. The chronically ill have received an interweaving of emotional, instrumental and informational, formal and informal and human and non-human support. Our study highlights the multiple and dynamic ties between these types of support and argues in favour of a comprehensive approach to social support of the chronically ill, both in social science theory and in practice of care."
"Recent studies have used comorbidity indexes to stratify postsurgical complication risk across multiple surgical fields, including plastic surgery. However, such studies are lacking in implant-based breast reconstruction (IBBR). Understanding how comorbidity scores affect postsurgical outcomes in IBBR can help identify patients who may require additional medical surveillance after surgery."
"There is a recognised association between white coat hypertension (WCH) and adverse cardiovascular outcomes in older adults. However, there is no consensus on the management of WCH in this group. The objective of the Hypertension in the Very Elderly Trial (HYVET-2) study was to assess the feasibility of randomising 100 patients > 75years with WCH from General Practice in the UK to treatment or usual care. The study did not randomise any patients. In this follow-up study, we sought to explore the reasons for not recruiting."
"In 2019, 77% of women and 82% of men with hypertension had uncontrolled hypertension worldwide. Uncontrolled hypertension can cause stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure, renal failure, dementia, blindness, and death. However, most of the studies used the previous seventh joint national committee classification to classify hypertensive patients as either controlled or uncontrolled. This study aimed to assess the prevalence and associated factors of uncontrolled hypertension among adult hypertensive patients at public hospitals in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia."
"Camera traps offer enormous new opportunities in ecological studies, but current automated image analysis methods often lack the contextual richness needed to support impactful conservation outcomes. Integrating vision-language models into these workflows could address this gap by providing enhanced contextual understanding and enabling advanced queries across temporal and spatial dimensions. Here, we present an integrated approach that combines deep learning-based vision and language models to improve ecological reporting using data from camera traps. We introduce a two-stage system: YOLOv10-X to localise and classify species (mammals and birds) within images and a Phi-3.5-vision-instruct model to read YOLOv10-X bounding box labels to identify species, overcoming its limitation with hard-to-classify objects in images. Additionally, Phi-3.5 detects broader variables, such as vegetation type and time of day, providing rich ecological and environmental context to YOLO's species detection output. When combined, this output is processed by the model's natural language system to answer complex queries, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is employed to enrich responses with external information, like species weight and IUCN status (information that cannot be obtained through direct visual analysis). Combined, this information is used to automatically generate structured reports, providing biodiversity stakeholders with deeper insights into, for example, species abundance, distribution, animal behaviour, and habitat selection. Our approach delivers contextually rich narratives that aid in wildlife management decisions. By providing contextually rich insights, our approach not only reduces manual effort but also supports timely decision making in conservation, potentially shifting efforts from reactive to proactive."
"Explicit and implicit anti-fat biases are widespread among healthcare providers, leading to significant negative consequences for pregnant people, including poorer health outcomes. Fear of childbirth (FOC) can affect the length of labor, increase the risk of cesarean delivery, and negatively influence a new parent's perception of infant bonding. This study investigated the impact of perceived anti-fat bias on FOC among pregnant people. Data were gathered from 329 pregnant people recruited from three large academic prenatal centers in the United States and via social media. Participants completed a survey that included validated instruments measuring perceptions of anti-fat bias and FOC. Participants perceiving anti-fat bias reported higher FOC. Black participants perceiving anti-fat bias reported higher FOC. These findings suggest that perceived anti-fat bias from providers is associated with FOC for pregnant people, particularly those who identify as Black. Interventions to educate providers on these important concepts could help improve pregnant people's experience within the healthcare system."
"The NOD‑like receptor protein domain associated protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is critical in inflammatory responses and may be a valuable prognostic biomarker in acute coronary syndrome (ACS). We aimed to investigate the association between NLRP3 inflammasome levels and short-term outcomes in patients with ACS. We enrolled 295 patients with ACS who were monitored for 6 months for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs). The NLRP3 inflammasome was quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, with the Gensini score used to assess disease severity. A Cox regression model evaluated whether NLRP3 inflammasome levels were independent predictors of MACEs. Spearman correlation analysis demonstrated a significant positive correlation between NLRP3 inflammasome levels and the Gensini score (r = 0.55, p < 0.001). Plasma NLRP3 inflammasome levels were significantly higher in the MACEs group (8.48 ng/mL) compared with the no-MACEs group (3.48 ng/mL) (p < 0.001). Multivariate Cox regression identified NLRP3 inflammasome content as an independent risk factor for MACEs (hazard ratio 1.104, p = 0.001; area under the curve: 0.780 [95% confidence interval 0.721-0.840], p < 0.001). Elevated plasma NLRP3 inflammasome levels correlated with ACS severity and were associated with poorer short-term outcomes in patients with ACS."
The objective of this study was to evaluate renal function and pathologic injury in chronic kidney disease (CKD) using T1 mapping.
"The population has increased in recent decades, and as a result, the increase in urban wastewater has led to many environmental problems. In this study, the environmental impacts of the Southern Tehran treatment plant were assessed via life cycle assessment (LCA) (SimaPro 9.4.0.2). The information needed for the LCA to be input to the system from the studied treatment plant for 12 months during the year 2022 was gathered from the database and analyzed using the Recepie method. The results of the final effects group showed that in both scenarios, damage to human health, the ecosystem and resource destruction were the most sensitive. A comparison of the final effects of the first and second scenarios revealed that reusing wastewater for irrigation on the Varamin Plain was a more environmentally friendly method, and discharging treated wastewater into receiving water was the worst. Although the use of treated wastewater and digested sludge for agricultural land may save a significant amount of water, it has significant adverse effects on carcinogenic and noncarcinogenic toxicity in humans due to the presence of heavy metals and has a negative effect on global warming."
"Primary small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the prostate is extremely rare, highly aggressive, and has a very poor prognosis, with an overall survival typically not exceeding one year. Standard treatment is generally based on the regimen for small cell lung cancer (SCLC), with guidelines recommending etoposide combined with cisplatin (EP regimen) as the first-line treatment. However, their therapeutic effects are limited. For primary small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the prostate that has failed the EP regimen treatment, there is currently a lack of relevant treatment methods. Here, we report a case of small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the prostate with multiple metastases, whose disease rapidly progressed despite receiving EP and second-line systemic chemotherapy. The patient was then administered a combination of anlotinib and tislelizumab. After treatment, the patient's symptoms were controlled, tumor marker levels decreased, and imaging showed significant improvement. The patient had a progression-free survival time of more than 22 months and continued to receive treatment. This is the first report of the use of anlotinib combined with tislelizumab for the treatment of primary small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the prostate, providing a new therapeutic option for patients with this disease."
"Research has shown significant differences and inequalities in the health of women and men who care for older dependent family members, with women having poorer health and suffering more from overload. Women internalize a cultural model of caregiving involving social norms whereby caring becomes a central dimension of gender-female identity, cutting across other aspects of life. This study takes a biopsychosocial approach, understanding gender as a determinant of health, in order to investigate the processes of subjectivation (and ""technologies of the self"") that mediate between the social organization of care and the health of women. A reflexive thematic analysis was undertaken in this qualitative study, following in-depth interviews with nineteen women caring for family members. The results show that women's biopsychosocial health is affected by the subjective positions they adopt in order to submit to or resist gender-based social norms about caring in three dimensions: their relationship to their own health problems, their experience of vulnerability, and the place of love and morality in relation to being a caregiver. Those (inter)subjective processes reflect the neoliberal update of the gendered social organization of care and the way its social discourses, such as free choice and unstinting performance, relate to female caregivers' biopsychosocial health. It is necessary to deconstruct this traditional model and the self-regulated processes as recast by the neoliberal order for the sake of women's health, to relieve them of this burden. It is essential to commit to sociopolitical articulations aimed at shared responsibility in care."
"The number of reported malaria cases transmitted by Anopheles mosquitoes in the Republic of Korea (ROK) increased from 420 in 2022 to 746 in 2023, a 77.6% increase. Eight Anopheles species are currently reported in the ROK, including six species belonging to the Anopheles Hyrcanus Group and one species each belonging to the Barbirostris Group and Lindesayi Group. However, studies on insecticide resistance in the ROK has predominantly concentrated on Anopheles sinensis or more broadly, members of the Hyrcanus Group. Reported differences in vector competence and ecological characteristics of mosquito species in the ROK highlight the importance for conducting accurate evaluations of insecticide resistance for each of the Anopheles species for informing the potential efficacy of vector control to reduce malaria transmission. All eight species of Anopheles mosquitoes were collected in/near the demilitarized zone (DMZ), a malaria high-risk region in the ROK. Additional specimens were collected in Seoul [Yongsan US Army Garrison (USAG)] and Pyeongtaek (Humphreys USAG) where malaria risks are much lower. Anopheles mosquitoes were identified to species using a multiplex PCR method and then evaluated for the presence of acetylcholinesterase-1 (ace-1) and voltage-gated sodium channel (vgsc) regions to identify mutations linked to insecticide resistance. Analysis of the ace-1 region identified insecticide resistance alleles in four species of the Hyrcanus Group (An. sinensis, An. kleini, An. belenrae, and An. pullus), while ace-1 resistance alleles were not observed in the other four species. The screening of the vgsc gene fragment confirmed the presence of resistant alleles only in An. sinensis (considered a poor malaria vector) and An. kleini (a primary malaria vector) in the ROK. This study represents a preliminary investigation of insecticide resistance mutations across all Anopheles species in the ROK. These findings are crucial in advancing mosquito control strategies to mitigate future malaria infections."
"ChIP-Seq is used to study DNA-protein interactions, unraveling chromatin states and gene regulatory properties of transcription factors. ChIP-Seq involves immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing using Next-Generation sequencing approaches. The ENCODE consortium provides extensive guidelines for ChIP-Seq analysis. Meanwhile, appropriate QC metrics and knowledge to interpret outcomes are essential for a good ChIP-Seq experiment. This chapter outlines the various QC metrics and analytical tools for ChIP-Seq analysis to provide a better understanding of the results."
"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are lipid bilayer nanoparticles released from all known cells and are involved in cell-to-cell communication via their molecular content. EVs have been found in all tissues and body fluids, carrying a variety of biomolecules, including DNA, RNA, proteins, metabolites, and lipids, offering insights into cellular and pathophysiological conditions. Despite the emergence of EVs and their molecular contents as important biological indicators, it remains difficult to explore EV-mediated biological processes due to their small size and heterogeneity and the technical challenges in characterizing their molecular content. EV-associated small RNAs, especially microRNAs, have been extensively studied. However, other less characterized RNAs, including protein-coding mRNAs, long noncoding RNAs, circular RNAs, and tRNAs, have also been found in EVs. Furthermore, the EV-associated proteins can be used to distinguish different types of EVs. The spectrum of EV-associated RNAs, as well as proteins, may be associated with different pathophysiological conditions. Therefore, the ability to comprehensively characterize EVs' molecular content is critical for understanding their biological function and potential applications in disease diagnosis. Here, we set out to provide an overview of EV-associated RNAs and proteins as well as approaches currently being used to characterize them."
"AAPM Task Group Report 135.B covers new technology components that have been added to an established radiosurgery platform and updates the components that were not well covered in the previous report. Considering the current state of the platform, this task group (TG) is a combination of a foundational task group to establish the basis for new processes/technology and an educational task group updating guidelines on the established components of the platform. Because the technology discussed in this document has a relatively small user base compared to C-arm isocentric linacs, the authors chose to emphasize the educational components to assist medical physicists who are new to the technology and have not had the opportunity to receive in-depth vendor training at the time of reading this report. The TG has developed codes of practice, introduced QA, and developed guidelines which are generally expected to become enduring practice. This report makes prescriptive recommendations as there has not been enough longitudinal experience with some of the new technical components to develop a data-based risk analysis."
"Black women experience more frequent and severe intimate partner violence (IPV), but there are mixed findings on their posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom severity. This may be explained by cultural-salient factors which are associated with fewer posttraumatic cognitions. We hypothesized an indirect effect of race on PTSD symptoms via social support, empowerment, and posttraumatic cognitions, serially. Path analysis revealed Black women reported increased social support, which was associated with higher levels of empowerment, which was associated with lower levels of posttraumatic cognitions. Decreased posttraumatic cognitions were associated with less severe PTSD symptoms. Results increase understanding of culturally-salient factors that may impact PTSD symptoms in Black women."
"In this study, we synthesized a series of 3-hydroxy-4-pyridinone (3,4-HPO) chelators with varying lipophilicity by modifying the length of their alkyl chains. To investigate their interaction with lipid membranes, we employed differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy using dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) and palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC) liposomes as membrane model systems. DSC experiments on DMPC liposomes revealed that hexyl-substituted chelators significantly altered the thermotropic phase behavior of the lipid bilayer, indicating their potential as membrane property modulators. EPR studies on DMPC and POPC liposomes provided detailed insights into the depth-dependent effects of chelators on membrane fluidity. Our findings highlight the crucial role of alkyl chain length in determining the interaction of 3,4-HPO chelators with lipid membranes and offer valuable insights for the design of lipid-interacting therapeutic agents based on this scaffold."
"Periprosthetic joint infections (PJIs) following total knee arthroplasty (TKA) are associated with high patient morbidity, mortality, and health care costs. Methods to reduce the burden of PJI have been shown to be efficacious on a small scale. On a national scale, it is unknown whether these methods have reduced PJI rates."
"Malnutrition is highly prevalent in those with cancer and more so in those with incurable cancer. In incurable cancer, it is widely agreed that optimal nutritional care has the potential to positively impact patient and caregiver distress and oncological outcomes. The aim of this systematic review was to describe the diversity and frequency of nutritional interventions, whether given in isolation or as part of a multimodal intervention in those with incurable cancer, in randomised controlled trials. The secondary aims were to describe adherence and their efficacy."

"In this study, a sensitive and selective spectrofluorimetric method was developed for the determination of the antidiabetic drug nateglinide based on its reaction with the xanthene dye acid red 87 (AR87). A fluorescence quenching process was observed for the AR87 at 545 nm upon the addition of nateglinide, which was exploited for the quantitative analysis. The reaction mechanism was investigated using quantum mechanical calculations suggesting a transfer between the electron-rich AR87 and the electron-deficient nateglinide. Additionally, the stoichiometry of the interaction was determined through Job's method revealing a 1:1 nateglinide-AR87 complex formation. The experimental parameters were optimized using a Box-Behnken design of experiments, including pH, reagent concentration, and buffer volume. The optimized method was validated according to ICH guidelines, demonstrating excellent linearity in the range of 0.1-3.0 μg/mL, with a detection limit of 0.0320 μg/mL and a quantitation limit of 0.0961 μg/mL. Furthermore, the greenness and blueness of the method were assessed using the AGREE and BAGI indices, indicating an environmentally friendly procedure. The developed method was successfully applied for the determination of nateglinide in pharmaceutical dosage forms and spiked human plasma samples posing a promising analytical tool for clinical and quality control applications."
"Golden camellia species are endangered species with great ecological significance and economic value in the section Chrysantha of the genus Camellia of the family Theaceae. Literature shows that more than 50 species of golden camellia have been found all over the world, but the exact number remains undetermined due to the complex phylogenetic background, the non-uniform classification criteria, and the presence of various synonyms and homonyms; and phylogenetic relationships among golden camellia species at the gene level are yet to be disclosed. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the divergence time and phylogenetic relationships between all golden camellia species at the gene level to improve their classification system and achieve accurate identification of them. Phenotypic data and transcriptomic sequences of 20 golden camellia species commonly found in Guangxi, China were obtained. PCA and OPLS-DA analyses were conducted based on phenotypic data, and agglomerative clustering was performed to generate the clustering tree of the 20 golden camellia species. Single-copy homologous genes were used to generate phylogenetic trees using Neighbor-Joining, Maximum Likelihood, and Bayesian Inference methods, and the results obtained with these three methods were compared. Then the molecular dating analysis was performed to reveal the divergence time and evolutionary relationships. Rhododendron griersonianum, Diospyros lotus, and Impatiens glandulifera were used as outgroups. The phylogenetic tree based on single-copy homologous genes showed that golden camellia species with shorter geographical distances were closer phylogenetically. Phylogenetic relationships based on phenotypic traits and those based on single-copy homologous genes were inconsistent, suggesting that species with a close genetic evolutionary relationship may show high variation in phenotypic traits and thus the analysis of evolutionary relationships based on phenotypic traits may result in inaccurate outcomes. Among three phylogenetic trees constructed by the three methods, the evolutionary sequences were different, but evolutionary relationships between most species were consistent. For 6 species, the divergence time estimated by Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian Inference varied much, that estimated by Bayesian Inference later than that estimated by Maximum Likelihood. Using these two methods, the resulting divergence time of 14 species was 3.452 Mya. The divergence time predicted in our study is later than that in the literature. In the present study phylogenetic relationships among 20 golden camellia species were analyzed at the transcriptome level to provide a supplement to the phylogenetic classification and evolutionary relationships explored using morphological traits and some molecular markers. Our findings show that the 20 golden camellia species diverged at a later time than other known species in the genus Camellia. Since our analyses were based on the failed molecular clock hypothesis, our conclusions are tentative. Further research using more systematic analyses and more methods should be conducted to confirm the phylogenetic relationships among golden camellia species."
"Empirically supported suicide risk assessment and conceptualization is a central aim of the Zero Suicide model. The Suicide Status Form (SSF) is the essential document and scaffolding of the Collaborative Assessment and Management of Suicidality-Brief Intervention (CAMS-BI) and is hypothesized as an example of a psychological assessment as therapeutic intervention (PATI). However, this hypothesis has never been directly tested."
"Astrocytes respond to neurotransmitters by increasing their intracellular Ca2+ concentration (Ca2+ signals). While glutamate released by neurons trigger Ca2+ signals through IP3- and glutamate transporter-dependent mechanisms, dopamine released in distant sites activates astrocytes via dopaminergic receptors. However, little is known about the modulatory effects of dopamine on glutamate-evoked astrocytic activity. To investigate this question, we developed multi-compartment, conductance-based astrocyte models with three distinct morphologies: unipolar; bipolar; and bifurcated-terminal. Glutamate induced localized responses, while dopamine activated all compartments. In the unipolar model, global dopaminergic stimulation reduced the threshold frequency of glutamatergic stimulation required to activate Ca2+ signals. Phase-plane analysis of a simplified version of this model revealed that Ca2+ signals are influenced by compartment radius and neurotransmitter type. Morphology significantly influenced glutamate-dopamine interactions. In the bipolar model, glutamatergic stimulation in one process minimally affected the other. Conversely, in the bifurcated-terminal model, where a single process bifurcates into two secondary processes, high-frequency glutamatergic stimulation in one secondary process evoked Ca2+ signals in the other. Dopamine further facilitated this latter cross-process interaction by lowering the glutamatergic stimulation frequency needed to elicit Ca2+ signals in the adjacent secondary process. These findings suggest that dopamine enhances the initiation and propagation of glutamate-evoked Ca2+ signals, with the extent of propagation depending on astrocytic morphology and the spatial distribution of glutamatergic inputs."

"Oxidative stress, associated with excessive production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS, RNS), contributes to the development and progression of many ailments, such as aging, cardiovascular diseases, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, diabetes, cancer, preeclampsia or multiple sclerosis. While phenols and polyphenols are the most studied antioxidants structurally similar compounds such as anilines or thiophenols are sporadically analyzed despite their radical scavenging potential. This work assesses the impact of structural features of phenols and thiophenols on their antioxidant activity. Seventeen pairs of phenol/thiophenol analogues, possessing both electron-donating and withdrawing groups were selected for this study. Several physicochemical properties of the compounds were determined by density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the (U)B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) level of theory for gas phase calculations and at the (U)B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) scrf = (smd, solvent = water) level for the solvated ones. Correlations between calculated properties and experimental radical scavenging activities were investigated to identify the pivotal physical characteristics contributing to antioxidant efficiency. These include S-H and O-H bond distances and bond dissociation enthalpies (BDE), dipole moments, logP values, highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) orbital energies, and the HOMO-LUMO gap energies that were calculated at the M06-2X/6-311++G(d,p) level of theory, and Fukui functions. The experimental activity was evaluated using the 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) and 2,2-diphenyl-1picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging assays. Several compounds exhibited superior scavenging abilities, surpassing that of the reference antioxidant Trolox. The extensive DFT calculations revealed that in the gas phase, lower BDE values, compared to IP and PA, suggested that the HAT mechanism predominates in case of these compound groups. In contrast, in water, significant reductions in PA due to solvent effects suggested that the SPLET mechanism is dominant under aqueous conditions."
"Lotmaria passim is a ubiquitous trypanosomatid parasite of honey bees nestled within the medically important subfamily Leishmaniinae. Although this parasite is associated with honey bee colony losses, the original draft genome-which was completed before its differentiation from the closely related Crithidia mellificae-has remained the reference for this species despite lacking improvements from newer methodologies. Here, we report the updated sequencing, assembly, and annotation of the BRL-type (Bee Research Laboratory) strain (ATCC PRA-422) of Lotmaria passim. The nuclear genome assembly has been resolved into 31 complete chromosomes and is paired with an assembled kinetoplast genome consisting of a maxicircle and 30 minicircle sequences. The assembly spans 33.7 Mb and contains very little repetitive content, from which our annotation of both the nuclear assembly and kinetoplast predicted 10,288 protein-coding genes. Analyses of the assembly revealed evidence of a recent chromosomal duplication event within chromosomes 5 and 6 and provided evidence for a high level of aneuploidy in this species, mirroring the genomic flexibility employed by other trypanosomatids as a means of adaptation to different environments. This high-quality reference can therefore provide insights into adaptations of trypanosomatids to the thermally regulated, acidic, and phytochemically rich honey bee hindgut niche, which offers parallels to the challenges faced by other Leishmaniinae during the challenges they undergo within insect vectors, during infection of mammals, and exposure to antiparasitic drugs throughout their multi-host life cycles. This reference will also facilitate investigations of strain-specific genomic polymorphisms, their role in pathogenicity, and the development of treatments for pollinator infection."
"Nowadays, optimal patient care should be based on data-driven decisions. In the course of digitization, hospitals, in particular, are becoming complex organizations with an enormously high density of digital information. Ensuring information security is, therefore, essential and has become a major challenge. Researchers have shown that-in addition to technological and regulatory measures-it is also necessary for all employees to follow security policies and consciously use information technology (compliance), because noncompliance can lead to security breaches with far-reaching consequences for the organization. There is little empirical research on information security-related behavior in hospitals and its organizational antecedents."
"The editorial, ""Clinical and translational mode of single-cell measurements: An artificial intelligent single-cell,"" introduces the innovative clinical artificial intelligence single-cell (caiSC) system, which merges AI with single-cell informatics to advance real-time diagnostics, disease monitoring, and treatment prediction. By combining clinical data and multimodal molecular inputs, caiSC facilitates personalized medicine, promising enhanced diagnostic precision and tailored therapeutic approaches. Despite its potential, caiSC lacks comprehensive data coverage across cell types and diseases, presenting challenges in data quality and model robustness. The article explores development strategies such as data expansion, machine learning advancements, and interpretability improvements. Future applications of caiSC could include digital cell twins, offering in-depth simulations of cellular behavior to support drug discovery and personalized treatments. Regulatory considerations are discussed, underscoring the need for SaMD/AIaMD certifications for clinical use. Ultimately, with further refinement, caiSC could transform clinical decision-making, driving personalized, precision medicine, and improved patient outcomes. KEY POINTS: Integration of AI with Single-Cell Informatics for Precision Medicine: The caiSC system combines artificial intelligence and single-cell data to improve diagnostics, treatment predictions, and personalized medical decision-making. Challenges in Data Coverage and Model Robustness: caiSC currently faces limitations due to incomplete data across cell types, diseases, and organs, as well as challenges in data quality and high computational demands, which affect model accuracy and clinical applicability. Future Potential and Regulatory Needs: The caiSC framework's development could lead to innovations such as digital cell twins, enabling personalized simulations of cellular responses for better treatment planning, though regulatory certification is essential for safe clinical use."
"Neuropeptide FF (NPFF) is an endogenous octapeptide that was originally isolated from the bovine brain. It belongs to the RFamide family of peptides that has a wide range of physiological functions and pathophysiological effects. NPFF and its receptors, NPFFR1 and NPFFR2, abundantly expressed in rodent and human brains, participate in cardiovascular regulation. However, the expressions of NPFF and its receptors are not restricted within the central nervous system but are also found in peripheral organs, including the kidneys. Both NPFFR1 and NPFFR2 mainly couple to Gαi/o, which inhibits cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production. NPFF also weakly binds to other RFamide receptors and the Mas receptor. Relevant published articles were searched in PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Scopus. Herein, we review evidence for the role of NPFF in the regulation of blood pressure, in the central nervous system, particularly within the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus and the brainstem, and the kidneys. NPFF is a potential target in the treatment of hypertension."
"Of all new cases of colorectal cancer, Lynch syndrome (LS) accounts for approximately 3%. This syndrome is the most common hereditary cancer syndrome and is caused by pathogenic variants in the genes responsible for DNA mismatch repair. Although the relationship between colorectal cancer risk and diet is well established, little is known regarding the influence of diet and nutritional characteristics on LS's clinical evolution. There is some evidence suggesting that individuals living with LS should follow general guidelines for diet and alcohol restriction/moderation, so as to achieve and maintain a favorable weight status and overall health and quality of life. However, more research is needed, preferentially from clinical studies of a prospective nature with robust designs, to better inform diet and behavioral patterns targeting cancer prevention in LS."
"This study investigated muscle activation, shocks, and vibrations of the upper extremities during tennis serves between junior and adult tennis players. Thirty-five well-trained tennis players (15 juniors and 20 adults) performed 10 maximal successful tennis serves. Two triaxial accelerometers recorded the shock and vibration on the racket and the hand on the dominant side. Eight surface EMG electrodes were also used to measure the arm muscles' activities. Linear mixed models were used to test the fixed effect of age on muscular activation and vibration. Statistical non-Parametric Mapping was employed to make statistical inferences on the EMG and accelerometer data obtained from the continuous wavelet transform. Comparing EMG parameters between junior and adult players reveals similar upper limb intermuscular coordination. The junior players experienced lower racket and hand vibration amplitudes, which were partially explained by a lower ball velocity. This study revealed that young players showed no difference in EMG parameters in the tennis serve but were as exposed to shocks and vibrations as adults when compared based on a given speed and a given handgrip force. These vibrations apply to an immature skeleton, which can increase the risk of injuries caused by overuse. In addition, differences in the racket vibration frequency provide original knowledge to engineers who need to develop innovative sports equipment for tennis."
"Decoction residues (DR) of Roselle are a waste with high polyphenol content. The remaining polyphenols are resistant to thermal treatments and have antioxidant properties. An alternative for the use of the DR is the extrusion with wall material that can preserve the antioxidant capacity of the polyphenols. The present study aimed to produce a functional ingredient with the Roselle DR by extrusion with different commercial starchy wall materials (Capsul, N-Lok, and Globe). The extrudates were analyzed for morphology, bioaccessibility of polyphenols, antioxidant capacity (AC), and starch digestion rate. The confocal microscopy showed the presence of fiber with polyphenols. The extruded with Capsul and Globe showed the highest slowly digestible starch (SDS) and resistant starch (RS) content. The bioaccessibility of polyphenols was higher in the Capsul and Globe extrudates indicating gradual release during the intestinal digestion. Capsul and Globe showed the best results in protecting the polyphenols."
"Outcomes of patients with opioid use disorder undergoing elective procedures have been well studied, but research is lacking in the orthopaedic trauma population."
"Pharmacogenomics (PGx) is focused on the relationship between an individual's genetic makeup and their response to medications, with the overarching aim of guiding prescribing decisions to improve drug efficacy and reduce adverse events. The PGx and genomic medicine communities have worked independently for over 2 decades, developing separate standards and terminology, making implementation of PGx across all areas of genomic medicine difficult. To address this issue, the Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) Pharmacogenomics Working Group (PGxWG) was established by the National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded ClinGen to initially create frameworks for evaluating gene-drug response clinical validity and actionability aligned with the ClinGen frameworks for evaluating monogenic gene-disease relationships, and a framework for classifying germline PGx variants similar to the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) and Association of Molecular Pathology (AMP) system for interpretation of disease-causing variants. These frameworks will leverage decades of work from well-established PGx resources facilitating buy-in among PGx stakeholders. In this report, we describe the background and major activities of the ClinGen PGxWG, and how this initiative will facilitate the critical inclusion of PGx into the larger context of genomic medicine."
"Carer burden is common in younger-onset dementia (YOD), often due to the difficulty of navigating services often designed for older people with dementia. Compared to Alzheimer's disease (AD), the burden is reported to be higher in behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). However, there is little literature comparing carer burden specifically in YOD. This study hypothesized that carer burden in bvFTD would be higher than in AD."
"Infants with complete heart block (CHB) require epicardial pacemaker (PM) insertion. Prior studies described epicardial pacing outcomes in infants and children, although they were limited by small or heterogeneous populations."
"The effects of rosmarinic acid (RA) and kaempferol (KMP) on the pro-oxidant capacity of grass carp hemoglobin (Hb) and their interaction mechanisms were explored. Results revealed that in the 0.05-0.2 mg/mL range, RA exhibited superior inhibition of free iron release from Hb. Moreover, the fluorescence mechanism of Hb by RA/KMP was static quenching, and thermodynamic parameters inferred that Hb and RA/KMP spontaneously formed relatively stable complexes facilitated by hydrogen bonding and van der Waals forces. The structural analysis indicated that the interaction of RA/KMP changed the secondary structure of Hb. Besides, molecular docking illustrated that the lowest binding affinity of Hb-RA (-8.799 kcal/mol) > Hb-KMP (-8.626 kcal/mol) exhibited a stronger interaction between Hb and RA. Molecular dynamic simulations further demonstrated that adding RA was more favorable for complex formation. Overall, the interaction between Hb and polyphenols provided valuable insights for selecting antioxidants in freshwater fish preservation."
The current study sought to characterize the relationship of the N400 (N4) effect event-related potential to Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers and broader cognition in older adults on the late-life cognitive continuum.
"The motion accuracy, compliance, and control smoothness for the surgical robot are of great importance to improve the safety of human-robot interaction. However, the end effector that interacts with soft tissue during surgery affects the dynamics of the robot. The control performance of the controller may be decreased if the changing dynamics are not identified and updated in time. This paper proposes a robust impedance controller for the redundant remote center of motion manipulator influenced by external disturbances, including external torque, uncertainties, and unmodeled terms in the dynamics. To achieve the desired impedance, a continuously switching sliding manifold is proposed. When the sliding manifold is driven to zero, the motion error will converge to a bounded region. This can overcome the adverse effects of external disturbances while guaranteeing motion accuracy and compliance. Chattering of the sliding mode control is alleviated through the formulated continuously switching sliding manifold and integrated nonlinear disturbance observer. Simulations and experiments demonstrate that the proposed controller has excellent motion accuracy, compliance, and control smoothness. This provides potential application prospects for the redundant surgical robot to guarantee safe human-robot interaction."
"Dental imaging comprises a wide range of techniques and modalities, each with different diagnostic features influenced by numerous parameters, all of which contribute to the precision and effectiveness of dental evaluations and treatments. This study examined the dimensional reproducibility of arch measurements from CBCT scans with different voxel sizes and exposure parameters compared to a reference model from Extra-oral scanners (EOS) and how these parameters affected digital matching and diagnostic image quality."
"To confirm a previously reported association of TRPV1 rs8065080 with the risk of transformation from episodic (EM) to chronic migraine (CM) and to extend knowledge about the role of other TRPV1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), we first investigated the impact of three TRPV1 SNPs (rs8065080, rs222747 and rs222749) on the risk of migraine chronification in a case-control study. A systematic review and meta-analysis were then conducted to summarize the accumulated findings."
The aim of the study is to verify whether the electronic nose system - an array of 17 gas sensors with a signal analysis system - is a useful tool for the classification and preliminary assessment of the quality of drainage water.
"Freeze-thaw-induced embolism, a key limiting factor for perennial plants results from the formation of gas bubbles during freezing and their expansion during thawing. However, the ice volumetric increase generates local pressures, which can affect the formation of bubbles. To characterize local dynamics of pressure tension and the physical state of the sap during freeze-thaw cycles, we simultaneously used ultrasonic acoustic emission analysis and synchrotron-based high-resolution computed tomography on the diffuse-porous species Betula pendula. Visualization of individual air-filled vessels and the distribution of gas bubbles in frozen xylem were performed.. Ultrasonic emissions occurred after ice formation, together with bubble formation, whereas the development of embolism took place after thawing. The pictures of frozen tissues indicated that the positive pressure induced by the volumetric increase of ice can provoke inward flow from the cell wall toward the lumen of the vessels. We found no evidence that wider vessels within a tissue were more prone to embolism, although the occurrence of gas bubbles in larger conduits would make them prone to earlier embolism. These results highlight the need to monitor local pressure as well as ice and air distribution during xylem freezing to understand the mechanism leading to frost-induced embolism."
Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are at increased risk of infection. The aim of this study was to assess the cumulative incidence and risk of infection in patients with IBD treated with interleukin (IL)-targeting agents.
"In crime investigations, the unambiguous identification of biological traces can be decisive for framing the events. In this study, we applied proteomics to analyze scant amounts of biological residues in the context of an alleged rape case, focusing on the detection of traces of vomit. We used high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) and two distinct proteomic workflows to identify proteins and possible proteolytic peptides in biological residues from clothing, bedding, and car upholstery from the alleged crime scene. Specifically, a fragment of pillowcase contained a protein pattern indicative of human saliva and a complex panel of peptides resulting from extensive hydrolysis of salivary proteins. The presence of partly digested proteins from bovine meat, wheat, and eggs, along with salivary and gastric enzymes, demonstrated the presence of vomit on the alleged victim's trousers, also providing insights into the recently consumed meal. A drop of cow's milk on the seat of the suspect's car was likely irrelevant to the criminal act. Other fabric samples showed only common contaminants, excluding significant biological traces or food-derived proteins. These findings support the judicial decision regarding consent to sexual intercourse, for which DNA individualization lacks evidentiary power, and establish a reference for annotating saliva and vomit traces in forensic investigations."
"Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) is a non-coding RNA longer than 200 nucleotides, crucial for functions like cell cycle regulation and gene transcription. Accurate localization prediction from sequence information is vital for understanding lncRNA's biological roles. Computational methods offer an effective alternative to traditional experimental methods for annotating lncRNA subcellular positions. Existing machine learning-based methods are limited and often overlook regions with coding potential that affect the function of lncRNA. Therefore, we propose a new model called LncSL. For feature encoding, both lncRNA sequences and amino acid sequences from open reading frames (ORFs) are employed. And we selected the most suitable features by CatBoost and integrated them into a new feature set. Additionally, a voting process with seven feature selection algorithms identified the higher contributive features for training our final stacked model. Additionally, an automatic model selection strategy is constructed to find a better performance meta-model for assembling LncSL. This study specifically focuses on predicting the subcellular localization of lncRNA in the nucleus and cytoplasm. On two benchmark datasets called S1 and S2 datasets, LncSL outperformed existing methods by 6.3% to 12.3% in the Matthew's correlation coefficient on a balanced test dataset. On an unbalanced independent test dataset sourced from S1, LncSL improved by 4.7% to 18.6% in the Matthew's correlation coefficient, which further demonstrates that LncSL is superior to other compared methods. In all, this study presents an effective method for predicting lncRNA subcellular localization through enhancing sequence information, which is always overlooked by traditional methods, and addressing contributive meta-model selection problems, which can offer new insights for other bioinformatics problems."
"Earthquakes cause great destruction due to their suddenness and intensity. Although all people are affected by earthquakes, children are among those most affected. Every year, millions of children and young people are exposed to many natural disasters and are affected differently. Earthquakes can cause physical, mental, and sleep disorders in children. The aim of this study is to investigate the post-traumatic response and its effects on sleep on child and adolescent earthquake survivors living in the earthquake zone in Turkey."
"Previous studies suggest the relationship between activation time (AT) and action potential duration (APD) in the heart is dependent on electrotonic coupling, but this has not been directly tested. This study assessed whether acute changes in electrical coupling, or other determinants of conduction or repolarization, modulate APD heterogeneity."
"MicroRNA (miR: small noncoding RNA)-150 is evolutionarily conserved and is downregulated in patients with diverse forms of heart failure (HF) and in multiple mouse models of HF. Moreover, miR-150 is markedly correlated with the outcome of patients with HF. We previously reported that systemic or cardiomyocyte-derived miR-150 in mice elicited myocardial protection through the inhibition of cardiomyocyte death, without affecting neovascularization and T cell infiltration. Our mechanistic studies also showed that the protective roles of miR-150 in ischemic mouse hearts and human cardiac fibroblasts were, in part, attributed to the inhibition of fibroblast activation via the repression of multiple profibrotic genes. However, the extent to which miR-150 expression in adult myofibroblasts (MFs) modulates the response to myocardial infarction (MI) remains unknown. Here, we develop a novel 4-hydroxytamoxifen-inducible MF-specific miR-150 conditional knockout mouse model and demonstrate that the mouse line exhibits worse cardiac dysfunction after MI. Our studies further reveal that miR-150 ablation selectively in adult MFs exacerbates cardiac damage and apoptosis after chronic MI. Lastly, MF-specific miR-150 deletion in adult mice promotes the expression of proinflammatory and profibrotic genes as well as cardiac fibrosis following chronic MI. Our findings indicate a key protective role for MF-derived miR-150 in modulating post-MI responses."
"Microbial environmental DNA and RNA (collectively 'eNA') originate from a diverse and abundant array of microbes present in environmental samples. These eNA signals, largely representing whole organisms, serve as a powerful complement to signals derived from fragments or remnants of larger organisms. Integrating microbial data into the toolbox of ecosystem assessments and biotic indices therefore has the potential to transform how we use eNA data to understand biodiversity dynamics and ecosystem functions, and to inform the next generation of environmental monitoring. Incorporating holobiont and Tree of Life approaches into eNA analyses offers further holistic insight into the range of ecological interactions between microbes and other organisms, paving the way for advancing our understanding of, and ultimately manipulating ecosystem properties pertinent to environmental management, conservation, wildlife health, and food production."

"The relationship of insulin resistance with bone mineral density (BMD) remains unclear, offering an opportunity for novel indices to shed light on the matter. The aim of this review was to evaluate the association between surrogate indices of insulin resistance and BMD."
The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to explore the effects of different pulmonary rehabilitation on respiratory function in mechanically ventilated patients and to determine the optimal type of intervention.
"Hypercoagulation is central to the pathogenesis of acute and post-acute COVID-19. This prospective observational study explored whether rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM), a method that unveils coagulation status, predicts outcomes of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. We investigated 62 patients using ROTEM that was conducted at enrollment, clinical deterioration, discharge and follow-up visits 1 and 3 months post-discharge. A hypercoagulable ROTEM was more common at clinical deterioration than at enrollment and the levels of hypercoagulable ROTEM indices correlated with the clinical severity score. Hypercoagulable ROTEM at enrollment was not associated with in-hospital death. Patients with hypercoagulable ROTEM at enrollment, discharge and 1 month post-discharge had an increased risk of persistent symptoms 1 and 3 months after discharge. Patients with hypercoagulable ROTEM at enrollment, discharge, and 1 month after discharge were more likely to have lung diffusion capacity (DLco) impairment 3 months after discharge. High levels of hypercoagulable ROTEM indices were associated with the increased risk of persistent symptoms at later stages of the disease. In a multivariate analysis, (i) hypercoagulable ROTEM at discharge and female gender were linked to the presence of symptoms at one month post-discharge, (ii) hypercoagulable ROTEM at one month after discharge was linked to the presence of symptoms at three months post-discharge, (iii) hypercoagulable ROTEM at enrollment and at discharge and female gender were linked to the presence of impaired DLco at three months post-discharge. Excessive coagulation may contribute to long-COVID pathogenesis and ROTEM findings during hospitalization may predict post-acute-COVID-19 sequelae in patients with COVID-19-related pneumonia."
The surgical management of craniosynostosis varies without consensus on technique or standard outcomes reporting. The authors of this study aimed to investigate current surgical management of craniosynostosis in the United States.
"Psychotic disorders are characterised by abnormalities in the synchronisation of neuronal responses. A 40 Hz gamma band deficit during auditory steady-state response (ASSR) measured by electroencephalogram (EEG) is a robust observation in psychosis and is associated with symptoms and functional deficits. However, the majority of ASSR studies focus on specific electrode sites, while whole scalp analysis using all channels, and the association with clinical symptoms, are rare."
"The presence of pharmaceuticals in nature systems poses a threat to the environment, plants, animals, and, last but not least, human health. Their transport in soils, waters, and sediments plays important roles in the toxicity and bioavailability of pharmaceuticals. The mobility of pharmaceuticals can be affected by their interactions with organic matter and other soil and water constituents. In this study, a model agarose hydrogel enriched by humic acid as a representative of organic matter is used as a transport medium for pharmaceuticals. Sulphapyridine (as a representative of sulphonamide antibiotics) and diclofenac (as a representative of widely used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) were chosen for experiments in diffusion cells. Pharmaceuticals were passed through the hydrogel from the donor solution to the acceptor compartment and could interact with humic acids incorporated in the hydrogel. The lag time was prolonged if the hydrogel was enriched by humic acids from 134 to 390 s for sulphapyridine and from 323 to 606 s for diclofenac. Similarly, the incorporation of humic acids in the hydrogel resulted in a decrease in the determined diffusion coefficients. The decrease was stronger in the first stage of the experiment when diffusing particles could interact with vacant binding sites."
"Asthma has been increasingly recognized as a heterogeneous disease; however, many patients with asthma have allergic asthma (AA). Inhaled corticosteroids and other inhalers have been integral in treating many symptoms of asthma, but these medications do not completely address the disease's underlying mechanism. Pediatric asthma imposes a substantial burden on patients and the health care system. Omalizumab is consistently recognized as an important consideration for add-on therapy in pediatric patients with AA in published guidelines from multiple international societies such as the Global Initiative for Asthma. Since our last report in 2017, the amount of information available regarding the safety and effectiveness of omalizumab in pediatric patients with AA has continued to accumulate and is supported by several observational and real-world data studies. A number of studies including real-world effectiveness studies, post hoc analyses of clinical trial data, and systematic literature reviews and meta-analyses have since expanded the published data on the efficacy and safety of omalizumab in pediatric patients. In this article, we present an updated review of this literature focused on omalizumab therapy in children with AA."
"Invasive alien species negatively impact ecosystems, biodiversity, human societies, and economies. To prevent future invasions, it is crucial to understand both the ecological and the human and social factors determining whether a species is picked up, transported, and introduced beyond their native range. However, we often have little or no information on key human and social factors. Here, we explore how alien species introductions are shaped by a combination of ecological and human and social factors and highlight the potential of the emerging fields of conservation culturomics and iEcology for disentangling their relative importance. We argue that quantifying and assessing the relative importance of the human and social dimensions of alien species introductions can substantially improve our understanding of the invasion process."
Rapid recognition of pediatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (POHCA) is a critical component to prompt initiation of bystander interventions. We aimed to investigate barriers for responding to POHCA during emergency medical calls.

"Intracranial calcifications, particularly within the falx cerebri, serve as crucial diagnostic markers ranging from benign accumulations to signs of severe pathologies. The falx cerebri, a dural fold that separates the cerebral hemispheres, presents challenges in visualization due to its low contrast in standard imaging techniques. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in machine learning and deep learning, have significantly transformed radiological diagnostics. This study aims to explore the application of AI in the segmentation and detection of falx cerebri calcifications using Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) images through a comprehensive literature review and a detailed case report. The case report presents a 59-year-old patient diagnosed with falx cerebri calcifications whose CBCT images were analyzed using a cloud-based AI platform, demonstrating effectiveness in segmenting these calcifications, although challenges persist in distinguishing these from other cranial structures. A specific search strategy was employed to search electronic databases, yielding four studies exploring AI-based segmentation of the falx cerebri. The review detailed various AI models and their accuracy across different imaging modalities in identifying and segmenting falx cerebri calcifications, also highlighting the gap in publications in this area. In conclusion, further research is needed to improve AI-driven methods for accurately identifying and measuring intracranial calcifications. Advancing AI applications in radiology, particularly for detecting falx cerebri calcifications, could significantly enhance diagnostic precision, support disease monitoring, and inform treatment planning."
"The COVID-19 pandemic caused a significant strain on world health care systems. The lack of trained and experienced staff was a complicated issue during the pandemic. To overcome insufficient staffing problems, the intrahospital transfer (IHT) strategy was implemented at Milad Hospital in Tehran during COVID-19. We evaluated the effectiveness of the IHT strategy in order to determine whether the strategy should be continued post-COVID."
"Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) exhibit a wide range of biomedical applications majorly used as antiinflammatory, anti-cancer, anti-diabetic, and anti-microbial activity and other biomedical applications because they show less toxicity and are very compatible. Zinc metal is an inorganic and essential element in the human body at the trace level. ZnO NPs are also GRAS substances (Generally Recognized As Safe). This study's main objective is synthesizing zinc oxide nanoparticles using red tea & clove mediated herbal formulation and screening for its antimicrobial, and anti-diabetic properties."
"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is usually diagnosed many years after diabetes onset. Indeed, an early diagnosis of DR remains a notable challenge, and, thus, developing novel approaches for earlier disease detection is of utmost importance. We aim to explore the potential of texture analysis of optical coherence tomography (OCT) retinal images in detecting retinal changes in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic animals at ""silent"" disease stages when early retinal molecular and cellular changes that cannot be clinically detectable are already occurring."
"Emerging evidence indicates that oral microbes are closely related to gastric microbes and gastric lesions, including gastric atrophy, intestinal metaplasia and gastric cancer (GC). Helicobacter pylori is a key pathogen involved in GC. However, the increasing prevalence of H. pylori-negative GC and gastric dysbiosis in GC patients emphasize the potential role of other microbial factors. In this review, we discussed the current evidence about the relationship between the oral-gastric microbial axis and oral and gastric health. Epidemiologic evidence indicates that poor oral hygiene is related to greater GC risk. Multiple oral-associated microbes are enriched in the stomach of GC patients. Once colonizing the stomach, oral-associated microbes Streptococcus anginosus and Prevotella melaninogenica, are involved in gastric inflammation or carcinogenesis. Microbial metabolites such as lactate, nitrite, and acetaldehyde promote malignant transformation. The stomach, as a checkpoint of microbial transmission in the digestive tract, is of great importance since the link between oral microbes and intestinal diseases has been emphasized. Still, new technologies and standardized metrics are necessary to identify potential pathogenetic microbes for GC and the core microbiota, interactions, richness, colonization, location and effect (CIRCLE). In the future, oral microbes could be candidates for noninvasive indicators to predict gastric diseases."
"Sex differences in the outcomes of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and the profiles of tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIICs) remain unclear. We retrospectively evaluated data from 563 patients with RCC receiving systemic therapy, including first-line dual ICI combinations (i.e., immunotherapy [IO]-IO), combinations of ICIs with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) (i.e., IO-TKI), TKI monotherapy, and subsequent nivolumab monotherapy. Survival and tumor response were compared between the sexes in each treatment group, and TIIC profiles were compared using 116 RCC tumor samples analyzed by flow cytometry. Progression-free survival (PFS) was shorter in female than in male patients in the IO-IO (p = 0.0227) and nivolumab monotherapy (p = 0.0478) groups. Furthermore, sex remained an independent factor for shorter PFS after adjusting for covariates in the IO-IO (p = 0.0340) and nivolumab monotherapy (p = 0.0322) groups. In contrast, PFS was not significantly different between sexes in the IO-TKI or TKI monotherapy groups (p > 0.05). Overall survival and objective response rates were not significantly different between the sexes in any of the treatment groups (p > 0.05). Some TIIC populations, including that of CD8 + T cells (p = 0.0096), decreased to a greater extent in female than in male patients in the advanced-stage population. In conclusion, the effectiveness of ICIs on PFS was lower in female patients than in male patients, potentially because of the different profiles of the immune microenvironment, particularly the decreased number of CD8 + T cells in females."
"Exposure to adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) is associated with a range of poor long-term health outcomes, including multimorbidity and chronic pain. Epidemiological evidence underpins much of this relationship; however, psychophysical testing methods, such as quantitative sensory testing (QST), may provide valuable insights into potential mechanisms. Previous studies have shown inconsistent links between ACEs and QST, but the QST profiles of people with multimorbidity have not been reported. We hypothesise that exposure to ACEs is associated with lowered QST thresholds (ie, experience of pain with milder stimuli) and that this association is stronger in adults with multimorbidity and/or chronic pain. The ACE-MAP study is a cross-sectional feasibility study with the primary aim of assessing the feasibility and acceptability of the proposed study procedures. The secondary aim is to generate preliminary data to understand the impact of ACEs on QST thresholds."
Remote monitoring using electronic patient-reported outcomes (ePROs) may help identify immune-related adverse events (irAEs) and direct self-management. There is no consensus regarding thresholds to alert providers about potentially severe irAEs or when to instigate evidence-based self-management. We aimed to develop consensus around alert thresholds and self-management advice for side-effects suggestive of an irAE which can be deployed as part of remote monitoring systems.
"Lateral band snapping syndrome can be a debilitating condition involving the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint of the fingers. Although rare, it is thought to occur due to disruption of the finger extensor mechanism allowing inappropriate subluxation of the lateral bands over the PIP joint, leading to mechanical and painful symptoms.Here, we describe a woman in her early 40s with a painful, snapping PIP joint secondary to a work-related injury. On examination, there was radial lateral band subluxation with joint motion.The dorsal aspect of the small finger was explored, and the radial lateral band was found to be subluxated during the active range of motion. The injured retinacular ligament along with the pathological lateral band was excised. Postoperatively, the patient was allowed to have unrestricted range of motion. At the latest follow-up, there was no active or passive triggering/snapping symptoms, as well as full range of motion of the affected digit."
Emoji are digital images or icons used to express an idea or emotion in electronic communication. The purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate the psychometric properties of two patient-reported scales that incorporate emoji.
"Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is underutilized due to various barriers, despite its known benefits in decreasing 5-year mortality after cardiac surgery. The authors initiated a quality improvement project to identify barriers and enhance CR referral rates and participation. The team conducted a retrospective review of cardiac surgery patients from 2015 to 2022 at the Detroit Veterans Affairs. Phase 1 covered 2015-2017 (preintervention), phase 2 was the intervention period, and phase 3 covered 2018-2022 (postintervention). Appropriate CR referral was defined as within 6 months postevent. Referral rates and 1-year post-op hospitalization were assessed. Group 1 (2015-2017) had 54 male patients, 44% Black, 89% hypertensive, with a 22% CR referral rate. Group 2 (2018-2022) had 98 male patients, 64% Caucasian, mean age 73 years, with a 36% CR referral rate postintervention ( P = 0.0018). One-year hospitalization decreased from 26% to 13% ( P = 0.20). CR is still an underutilized tool. Provider education and complete funding of CR can improve referral rates and participation."
"Biofilms are ubiquitous surface-associated bacterial communities embedded in an extracellular matrix. It is commonly assumed that biofilm cells are glued together by the matrix; however, how the specific biochemistry of matrix components affects the cell-matrix interactions and how these interactions vary during biofilm growth remain unclear. Here, we investigate cell-matrix interactions in Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of cholera. We combine genetics, microscopy, simulations, and biochemical analyses to show that V. cholerae cells are not attracted to the main matrix component (Vibrio polysaccharide, VPS), but can be attached to each other and to the VPS network through surface-associated VPS and crosslinks formed by the protein Bap1. Downregulation of VPS production and surface trimming by the polysaccharide lyase RbmB cause surface remodeling as biofilms age, shifting the nature of cell-matrix interactions from attractive to repulsive and facilitating cell dispersal as aggregated groups. Our results shed light on the dynamics of diverse cell-matrix interactions as drivers of biofilm development."
"The Genomes OnLine Database (GOLD; https://gold.jgi.doe.gov/) at the Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute is a comprehensive online metadata repository designed to catalog and manage information related to (meta)genomic sequence projects. GOLD provides a centralized platform where researchers can access a wide array of metadata from its four organization levels namely Study, Organism/Biosample, Sequencing Project and Analysis Project. GOLD continues to serve as a valuable resource and has seen significant growth and expansion since its inception in 1997. With its expanded role as a collaborative platform, it not only actively imports data from other primary repositories like National Center for Biotechnology Information but also supports contributions from researchers worldwide. This collaborative approach has enriched the database with diverse datasets, creating a more integrated resource to enhance scientific insights. As genomic research becomes increasingly integral to various scientific disciplines, more researchers and institutions are turning to GOLD for their metadata needs. To meet this growing demand, GOLD has expanded by adding diverse metadata fields, intuitive features, advanced search capabilities and enhanced data visualization tools, making it easier for users to find and interpret relevant information. This manuscript provides an update and highlights the new features introduced over the last 2 years."

"Rimegepant, a novel oral calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist, has been recently approved for the acute migraine treatment. While its efficacy was confirmed in randomized clinical trials, no data is available regarding real-life effectiveness and tolerability. GAINER, a prospective, multicentric study, aimed to evaluate rimegepant effectiveness and tolerability in the real-world setting."
"Companion animals, like household dogs, are an overlooked transmission point for zoonotic pathogens such as nontyphoidal Salmonella (NTS). Given the proximity of dogs to humans and the use of critically important antibiotics in companion animal medicine, household dogs represent a risk for the spread of antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) Salmonella."
"Aspergillus cristatus is a dominant fungus formed during the ""flowering"" process of Fuzhuan brick tea. Previous research has established that the sporulation of Aspergillus nidulans, a model organism of filamentous fungi, is regulated by light. However, the sporulation of A. cristatus is dependent on osmotic stress. In a previous study, we used pull-down and mass spectrometry to identify proteins that interacted with AcHog1 in A. cristatus when cultured under different conditions of osmotic stress. In the present study, we analyzed the proteins we identified previously to investigate their functional role. The AA1E3BER4 protein was located downstream of Hog1 in the HOG branch pathway and was identified that was regulated by AcHog1. Furthermore, yeast two-hybrid analysis showed that AA1E3BER4 interacted with AcHog1. In addition, we knocked out and complemented the Acsko1 gene encoding the AA1E3BER4 protein. We found that the number of sexual and asexual spores were downregulated by 3.81- and 4.57-fold, respectively, in the ΔAcsko1 strain. The sensitivity of the ΔAcsko1 strain to sorbitol and sucrose, as regulators of osmotic stress, increased, and the sensitivity to high sucrose was higher than that of sorbitol. Acsko1 also regulated the response of A. cristatus to oxidative stress, Congo red, and SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate). In addition, the deletion of Acsko1 significantly increased the pigment of the ΔAcsko1 strain. This is the first study to report the role of the sko1 gene in oxidative stress, stress-induced damage to the cell wall, and pigment in Aspergillus cristatus."
"Critical illness during pregnancy poses significant challenges driven by complex interactions between physiological changes, pre-existing conditions, and healthcare disparities. In high-income countries, increasing maternal age and comorbidities complicate obstetric care by triggering an unprecedented rise in cardiac disease during pregnancy, while infections like influenza and COVID-19 are important causes of maternal adult respiratory distress syndrome. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) gained prominence as a vital intervention, providing respiratory and/or cardiac support, for varying indications between antenatal and postpartum periods. The physiological changes of pregnancy demand close attention and adjustment of ECMO parameters, along with multidisciplinary collaboration. While potential complications such as bleeding and thromboembolism require vigilant management and optimal management of ECMO support in pregnancy still needs to be elucidated, ECMO nevertheless yields favorable maternal and fetal outcomes."
"The significant rise in the prevalence of mental health disorders among school children and adolescents in Lebanon and conflict zones necessitate immediate interventions. Despite this elevated prevalence, such communities currently lack effective programs which clearly identify the concepts of mental health promotion and prevention among school children. Addressing this gap, our paper aims to propose a contextual model and framework for educators, researchers and policy-makers. The proposed model includes 3-levels comprising set of actions and interventions. Interventions adopted at each level should be fine-tuned to produce a caring and supportive learning environment that effectively incorporates the three essential domains of student's mental health: promoting mental health protective factors, notably social and emotional learning (SEL) and resilience, as well as preventing mental health disorders (MHD). Interventions set at each level are elaborated in the framework and linked to the corresponding segments present in the school environment to include teachers, family, community, media, and policymakers. The framework also extends these interventions to encompass the core competencies of SEL, resilience, as well as the prevention of the most prevalent mental health disorders in conflict zones."
"Americans experiencing homelessness are uniquely vulnerable to traumatic injuries and morbidity. Despite a high and increasing number of persons experiencing homelessness (PEH), American researchers have not comprehensively described the impact of this social problem on trauma patients in recent years."
"The Sec61 translocon mediates the translocation of numerous, newly synthesized precursor proteins into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum or their integration into its membrane. Recently, structural biology revealed conformations of idle or substrate-engaged Sec61, and likewise its interactions with the accessory membrane proteins Sec62, Sec63, and TRAP, respectively. Several natural and synthetic small molecules have been shown to block Sec61-mediated protein translocation. Since this is a key step in protein biogenesis, broad inhibition is generally cytotoxic, which may be problematic for a putative drug target. Interestingly, several compounds exhibit client-selective modes of action, such that only translocation of certain precursor proteins was affected. Here, we discuss recent advances of structural biology, molecular modelling, and molecular screening that aim to use Sec61 as feasible drug target."
"Influenza D virus (IDV) is a newly emerged zoonotic virus increasingly reported worldwide. Cattle are considered the main reservoir of IDV, although it was first isolated from pigs. IDV infects multiple animal species and contributes to the bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC). To date, there has been no report on the presence and frequency of IDV among cattle herds in Pakistan. In this study, we collected nasal swabs from cattle and performed virological surveillance of IDV via qRT-PCR. Among 376 swab samples, IDV was detected in 9 samples (2.4%). Four dairy cattle farms were positive for IDV; two IDV-positive samples (two/nine, 22.2%) belonged to asymptomatic cattle, while seven IDV-positive samples (seven/nine, 77.8%) were from cattle showing respiratory clinical signs, including two with a recent history of abortion and mastitis. Partial sequences of the hemagglutinin-esterase-fusion gene of IDV were obtained from nine qRT-PCR-positive samples. Notably, all IDV strains in this study clustered within the D/OK lineages in phylogenetic analysis. A 98.8-99.6% genetic identity to its European and US counterparts indicates that the IDVs are closely related. The D/OK lineage of IDV was previously unreported in Pakistan. This is the first report of IDV in Pakistan. We confirmed that IDV is circulating among cattle herds in Pakistan. This study underscores the importance of virological surveillance to monitor the ecology of IDV for better animal and public health. The continued spread of IDV and its adaptation to various hosts necessitate further epidemiological studies."
"Canine superficial pyoderma is a common bacterial skin infection of dogs, generally caused by Staphylococcus pseudintermedius. The C4 strain of Staphylococcus felis was recently discovered to have strong antimicrobial activity against S. pseudintermedius in mice."
"Acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD) and Gaucher disease type 1 (GD1) are rare inherited sphingolipid disorders with multisystemic manifestations, including liver disease and dyslipidemia. Despite effective treatments, insufficient disease awareness frequently results in diagnostic delays during which irreversible complications occur. We delineated the shared and distinctive features of hepatic, splenic, and lipoprotein phenotypes in ASMD and GD1."
"Pregnancy is a unique stage of the life course characterized by trade-offs between the nutritional, immune, and metabolic needs of the mother and fetus. The Camden Study was originally initiated to examine nutritional status, growth, and birth outcomes in adolescent pregnancies and expanded to study dietary and molecular predictors of pregnancy complications and birth outcomes in young women."
"Mosaic variegated aneuploidy (MVA) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by mosaic aneuploidies, predominantly trisomies, involving multiple different chromosomes and tissues. The proportion of aneuploid cells varies, and most patients present with intrauterine growth delay, microcephaly, and a broad spectrum of congenital abnormalities. We report a patient with a distinctive type of MVA discovered in bone marrow (BM) when she was 3-month-old due to neutropenia and hypocellular bone marrow. She was followed up for more than 20 years, and different trisomic cells were repeatedly discovered in different tissues, whereas her clinical picture has never been severe. The main sign remained intermittent neutropenia, not cyclic and often not too severe, occasionally with anemia and thrombocytopenia. Retromicrognathia was the only dysmorphic sign. Unlike other patients with MVA, the trisomies in all tissues involved almost invariably chromosomes 18 and 19. Therefore, the peculiarities of our patient were the clinical and the atypical cytogenetic pictures. Nevertheless, we looked for mutations in the seven causative genes of the known types of MVA, but the results were negative. Then, we analyzed the entire exome to find out other possible causing mutations, but also this attempt failed to discover a possible cause of this distinctive form of MVA."
"This study aimed to identify low- and high-risk diabetes groups within prediabetes populations using data from the Taiwan Biobank (TWB) and UK Biobank (UKB) through a clustering-based Unsupervised Learning (UL) approach, to inform targeted type 2 diabetes (T2D) interventions."

"As virality has become increasingly central in shaping information sources' strategies, it raises concerns about its consequences for society, particularly when referring to the impact of viral news on the public discourse. Nonetheless, there has been little consideration of whether these viral events genuinely boost the attention received by the source. To address this gap, we analyze content timelines from over 1000 European news outlets from 2018 to 2023 on Facebook and YouTube, employing a Bayesian structural time series model to evaluate the impact of viral posts. Our results show that most viral events do not significantly increase engagement and rarely lead to sustained growth. We identify two primary types of viral effects corresponding to different mechanisms of collective attention response. A 'loaded-type' virality manifests after a sustained growth phase, representing its final burst, followed by a decline in attention. A 'sudden-type' virality, with news emerging unexpectedly, reactivates the collective response process. Moreover, quick viral effects fade faster, while slower processes lead to more persistent growth. These findings highlight the transient nature of viral events and underscore the importance of consistent, steady attention-building strategies to establish a solid connection with the user base rather than relying on sudden visibility spikes."
There is limited literature available regarding the knowledge and use of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) among men who have sex with men (MSM) with sexually transmitted infections (STIs).
"This retrospective cohort study aimed to evaluate the association between pre-existing heart failure and both mortality and the recurrence of sepsis. A total of 16,092 sepsis patients without a history of heart failure and 841 sepsis patients with pre-existing heart failure were identified from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care version IV (MIMIC-IV ) database. All patients were adults admitted to intensive care units, and no specific interventions were applied. After matching, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed significantly poorer long-term survival rates in patients with heart failure, both in the original (p < 0.0001) and the matched cohort (p = 0.00059). Mortality rates were tracked over different time periods, revealing that the mortality disparity became evident after the first year (p = 0.029). Besides, the cumulative incidence of sepsis recurrence was substantially higher in patients with a history of heart failure (p < 0.001) when deaths without recurrence were treated as competing events. Moreover, there was no statistically significant difference observed in the deaths without recurrence between the two groups (p = 0.251). In conclusion, pre-existing heart failure is associated with an increased risk of long-term mortality, which may be partly explained by a higher incidence of recurrent sepsis in this population."
"The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial properties and profile of bioactive compounds from mesocarp, peel and leaves of four autochthonous apple cultivars against human pathogens, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis and the apple pathogen Erwinia amylovora by direct detection on HPTLC plates and subsequent chemometric analysis. UHPLC Q-ToF MS was used for detailed characterization of the bioactive compounds with antimicrobial properties. Leaf extracts showed the highest antibacterial activity against all bacterial strains, followed by peel extracts, while the mesocarp extracts showed only weak and selective inhibition zones for E. coli and B. subtillis. The apple cultivars, 'Kadumana' and 'Kopaoničanka' showed the best antimicrobial properties. The active compounds were triterpenoids, coumaroylquinic acid and caffeoylquinic acid isomers and methyl derivatives, naringenin, kaempferol and quercetin aglycones and glycosides, phloretin and its glycosides and acylated derivatives that detected for the first time in the apple leaves and fruits."
"Drug-induced thrombocytopenia has been reported for numerous drugs. Vancomycin-induced thrombocytopenia (VIT) is infrequently and often under-recognized. VIT can lead to the serious consequences of some life-threatening bleeding, especially in high-risk population. However, few studies have focused on VIT. This study aimed to describe the occurrence and manifestation of VIT and evaluate its risk factors in real-world settings."
"Laser-irradiation-assisted cell gene transfection is sterile and nontoxic, but the low transfection efficiency cannot meet the application requirements. To improve the efficiency, a temporal and spatial shaping method of a femtosecond laser is proposed. Using the time shaping method, we can segment the pulse into subpulses of varying energies and with a defined delay, thereby influencing the interaction between electrons and photons, ultimately enhancing transfection efficiency. The transfection efficiency is further improved by spatially shaping the laser pulse to extend the focusing beam's working distance and reduce the cell's sensitivity to the focal position. Through the characterization of the viability and transfection efficiency of HEK-293T cells, the method achieved efficient and active transfection, with a maximum transfection efficiency of 45.1% and a cell survival rate of 93.6%. This method provides key technical support for femtosecond laser transfection and promotes its further application in clinical practice."
"The papers were searched in databases including PubMed, Scopus, Web of science, Embase, Science Direct until 21 September 2023 and meta-analysis of concentration of PTEs in honey was performed using random effects model based on country subgroups. The non-carcinogenic risk and carcinogenic risk were calculated by Target Hazard Quotient (THQ) and Cancer Risk (CR), respectively. The sort of PTEs in honey based on pooled concentration was Cu (1.10E + 02 µg/kg) > Ni (1.80E + 01 µg/kg) > Pb (2.60E + 00 µg/kg) > Hg (1.50E + 00 µg/kg) > Cd (5.10E-01 µg/kg) > As (4.80E-01 µg/kg). The concentration of PTEs in the countries of Ethiopia (As), Jordan (Cd and Pb), Thailand (Ni), Brazil (Cu and MeHg) was observed to be higher than other countries. The non-carcinogenic risk was less than 1, hence, the consumption of honey does not have non-carcinogenic risk. Except children in Nigeria, CR due to iAs in honey was acceptable for the both adults and children in the other countries, Therefore, the consumption of honey does not have carcinogenic risk."
"Inhibin, β, which is also known as INHBA, encodes a protein that belongs to the Transforming Growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily, which plays a pivotal role in cancer. Gastrointestinal tract (GI tract) cancer refers to the cancers that develop in the colon, liver, esophagus, stomach, rectum, pancreas, and bile ducts of the digestive system. The role of INHBA in all GI tract cancers remains understudied. By utilizing GEPIA2, which uses transcriptomic data from TCGA, we examined the expression of INHBA across different GI tract cancers. The results revealed consistent upregulation of INHBA in all TCGA GI tract cancers, except for liver hepatocellular carcinoma, where it showed downregulation compared to normal tissues, along with GTEx normal samples. Significant differences in INHBA expression were noted in adenocarcinomas of the colon, pancreas, rectum, and stomach, while no such differences were observed in cholangiocarcinoma and liver cancer. Moreover, a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis has been done to demonstrate that the differences in expression levels are significantly related to pathological tumor stages and prognosis in different GI tract cancers. Mucinous adenocarcinoma, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and stomach adenocarcinoma show a higher frequency of INHBA alteration and are primarily linked to mutations and amplifications. DNA methylation, immune infiltration, functional enrichment analysis, the genes associated with INHBA, and survival analysis in all TCGA GI tract cancers have been extensively analyzed. In colon and stomach cancers, increased INHBA expression significantly correlates with poorer overall survival (OS). However, in colon and pancreatic adenocarcinoma, higher expression is significantly associated with worse disease-free survival (DFS). Additionally, INHBA expression exhibited a positive correlation with cancer-associated fibroblasts across all gastrointestinal (GI) tract cancers. The KEGG pathway analysis revealed that INHBA and its interacting proteins are involved in several pathways, including TGF-beta signaling, Signalling pathways regulating pluripotency of stem cells, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, AGE-RAGE signaling, and so on as major pathways. These findings demonstrate that INHBA could serve as a potential biomarker therapeutic target for GI tract cancer."

"Since 2014, the health sector in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has been undergoing reforms aimed at strengthening the Provincial Health Administration (PHA) to better support health district development through technical support to district health management teams (DHMTs). However, there is limited understanding of how, for whom, and under what conditions this support works. Using a realist evaluation approach, this study aimed to test an initial program theory of technical support to DHMTs by PHA staff in Kasai Central Province. Data were collected from document reviews, interviews, questionnaires, and routine health information systems. After thematically analysing the implementation, context, actors, mechanisms, and outcomes, we applied retroductive reasoning to connect these elements using the Intervention-Context-Actors-Mechanisms-Outcomes configurations (ICAMOcs) heuristic. We identified nine ICAMOcs showing how resource constraints and political and organisational challenges hindered the effective delivery of technical support. These challenges triggered disabling mechanisms, such as low motivation, self-efficacy, a sense of accountability, psychological safety, reflexivity, the perceived relevance of support, the perceived credibility of PHA staff, and perceived autonomy, resulting in mixed outcomes. The performance-based financing scheme helped mitigate some issues by providing resources and boosting extrinsic motivation, but concerns persist about its sustainability due to reliance on external funding. These findings highlight the need for strong political commitment and coordinated efforts to address these challenges."
The aim of this article is to present the Nursing Educational Framework (NEF) as an opportunity to integrate core elements of a humanistic person/family-centered view and as guidance in structuring a relationship-based curriculum.
"Cardiac MRI (CMR) is an important imaging modality in the evaluation of cardiovascular diseases. CMR image acquisition is technically challenging, which in some circumstances is associated with artifacts, both general as well as sequence specific. Recognizing imaging artifacts, understanding their causes, and applying effective approaches for artifact mitigation are critical for successful CMR. Balanced steady-state free precession (bSSFP), the most common CMR sequence, is associated with band and flow artifacts, which are amplified at 3-T imaging. This can be mitigated by targeted shimming, by short repetition time, or by using a frequency-scout sequence. In patients with cardiac arrhythmias or poor breath hold, the quality of cine imaging can be improved with a non-electrocardiographically gated free-breathing real-time sequence. Motion artifacts on late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) images can be mitigated by using single-shot technique with motion compensation and signal averaging. LGE images are also prone to partial-volume averaging and incomplete myocardial nulling. In phase-contrast imaging, aliasing artifact is seen when the velocity of blood is higher than the encoded velocity. Aliasing can be mitigated by increasing the encoded velocity or using postprocessing software. In first-pass perfusion imaging, a dark rim artifact due to Gibbs ringing can be distinguished from a true perfusion defect based on earlier appearance and fading after a few cardiac cycles. With implanted cardiac devices, artifactual high signal intensity mimicking scar is seen on LGE images, which can be mitigated using a wide-band sequence. With devices and metallic artifacts, traditional gradient-recalled echo sequence has fewer artifacts than bSSFP. CMR at 3 T requires adaptation of sequences to minimize artifacts."
"Preterm birth poses a major public health challenge, with significant and heterogeneous developmental impacts. Latent profile analysis was applied to the National Institutes of Health Toolbox performance of 1891 healthy prematurely born children from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development study (970 boys, 921 girls; 10.00 ± 0.61 years; 1.3% Asian, 13.7% Black, 17.5% Hispanic, 57.0% White, 10.4% Other). Three distinct neurocognitive profiles emerged: consistently performing above the norm (19.7%), mixed scores (41.0%), and consistently performing below the norm (39.3%). These profiles were associated with lasting cognitive, neural, behavioral, and academic differences. These findings underscore the importance of recognizing diverse developmental trajectories in prematurely born children, advocating for personalized diagnosis and intervention to enhance care strategies and long-term outcomes for this heterogeneous population."

"Preformed metal crowns (PMCs) and zirconia crowns (ZCs) are commonly used for the treatment of primary molar caries. However, there have been no reports on factors influencing parental awareness, willingness to use these treatments, and the associated discomfort after crown placement in children.This study is the first to report factors influencing preformed crowns, providing a reference for the prevention and treatment of deciduous carious teeth."
"Chronic allodynia stemming from peripheral stump neuromas can persist for extended periods, significantly compromising patients' quality of life. Conventional managements for nerve stumps have demonstrated limited effectiveness in ensuring their orderly termination. In this study, we present a spatially confined conduit strategy, designed to enhance the self-organization of regenerating nerves after truncation. This innovative approach elegantly enables the autonomous slowing of axonal outgrowth in response to the gradually constricting space, concurrently suppressing neuroinflammation through YAP-mediated mechanotransduction activation. Meanwhile, the decelerating axons exhibit excellent alignment and remyelination, thereby helping to prevent failure modes in nerve self-organization, such as axonal twisting in congested regions and overgrowth beyond the conduit's capacity. Additionally, proteins associated with mechanical allodynia, including TRPA1 and CGRP, exhibit a gradual reduction in expression as spatial constraints tighten, a trend inversely validated by the administration of the YAP-targeted inhibitor Verteporfin. This spatially confined conduit strategy significantly alleviates allodynia, thus preventing autotomy behavior and reducing pain-induced gait alterations."
"Cardiomyopathies, often caused by mutations in genes encoding muscle proteins, are traditionally treated by phenotyping hearts and addressing symptoms post irreversible damage. With advancements in genotyping, early diagnosis is now possible, potentially introducing earlier treatment. However, the intricate structure of muscle and its myriad proteins make treatment predictions challenging. Here, we approach the problem of estimating therapeutic targets for a mutation in mouse muscle using a spatially explicit half sarcomere muscle model. We selected nine rate parameters in our model linked to both small molecules and cardiomyopathy-causing mutations. We then randomly varied these rate parameters and simulated an isometric twitch for each combination to generate a large training data set. We used this data set to train a conditional variational autoencoder, a technique used in Bayesian parameter estimation. Given simulated or experimental isometric twitches, this machine learning model is able to then predict the set of rate parameters that are most likely to yield that result. We then predict the set of rate parameters associated with twitches from control mice with the cardiac troponin C (cTnC) I61Q variant and control twitches treated with the myosin activator Danicamtiv, as well as model parameters that recover the abnormal I61Q cTnC twitches."
Siglec-E is an immune checkpoint inhibitory molecule. Expression of Siglec-E on the immune cells has been shown to promote tumor regression.

"Real-world data on treatment outcomes or the quality of large-scale chronic hepatitis B (CHB) treatment programs in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is extremely difficult to obtain. In this study, we aimed to provide data on the prevalence and incidence of mortality, loss to follow-up (LFTU), and their associated factors in patients with CHB in three treatment centres in Eritrea. Additional information includes baseline clinical profiles of CHB patients initiated on nucleos(t)ide analogue (NUCs) along with a comparison of treatment with Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) vs. TDF + Lamuvudine (LAM) using specific biochemical, haematological and virologic parameters. A multicenter retrospective cohort study was conducted on CHB patients in Asmara, Eritrea (2018-2021). Demographic, clinical, and laboratory information was collected from medical records using a structured checklist. Relevant parametric and nonparametric statistics were employed to explore treatment outcomes and to evaluate differences between groups. Where appropriate, Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves and univariate and multivariate Cox regression models were implemented. A two-sided p-value < 0.05 was considered significant. A total of 413 patients with HBV (median age (IQR) at diagnosis: 39 (IQR: 28-50 years; females: 118(28.6%); followed for a total of 22,921 person days) were studied. HBV/HIV co-infection was observed in 15(3.6%) and baseline ALT and AST were elevated in 99(31.2%) and 101(32.8%), respectively. The Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index estimates suggested that cirrhosis was highly likely in 33 (14%) patients with 49 (20.8%) patients in the indeterminate FIB-4 score category. During the follow-up period, 4.6% (95% CI: 2.5-6.6%) died, while 23.9% (95% CI: 19.8-28%) were LTFU. In the adjusted Cox proportional hazards model, LTFU were independently associated with baseline serum HBV DNA (IU/mL) (aHR = 1.3, 95% CI 1.04-1.7; p-value = 0.02); Not initiated on NUC (aHR = 3.9, 95% CI: 1.1-13.7, p-value = 0.02); and FIB-4 Score (aHR = 1.05, 95% CI: 1-1.1; p-value = 0.01). Of the 413 patients enrolled in the study, 98 cases (23.73%) were initiated on treatment. In the head-to-head comparison of the results in TDF and TDF + LAM after 12 weeks of treatment, VR was observed in 14(45.2%) vs. 17(54.8%), respectively, translating into an overall VR of 60.7% (95% CI 46.9-74.6). Furthermore, VR in TDF vs. TDF + LAM were similar, 14(45.2%) vs. 17(54.4%) respectively, p-value = 0.3). This study uncovered multiple systems- and patient-centered gaps in the three HBV treatment programs in Asmara, Eritrea. These include late presentation, high incidence of LTFU, inconsistencies in routine data, and poor data management. Interventions should target improvements in laboratory infrastructure, adherence to patient monitoring guidelines, HBV literacy, better tracking of patients, and documentation of patient's information."
"Iron overload increases fasting blood glucose level in mice, leading to insulin insensitivity. However, no such relationship has been shown in the population. The relationship between whole blood iron levels and fasting blood glucose levels remained unclear. This study aimed to determine whether whole blood iron levels were associated with fasting blood glucose levels in community-dwelling older adults. This cross-sectional study was based on a community population and analyzed the distribution of whole blood iron and fasting blood glucose in a community population. A sample of 1560 community residents had their fasting blood glucose, gender, and age measured during the study. Covariates were assessed using correlation analysis, partial correlation analysis, and Student's t-test. To further investigate the impact of confounding factors in this study, we compared variations in whole blood iron levels between genders. Pearson correlation analysis showed no correlation between whole blood iron and fasting blood glucose. After adjusting for age and gender, no correlation was found between whole blood iron and fasting blood glucose as well. However, Pearson correlation analysis showed a correlation between whole blood iron and age(P<0.05, r=-0.181). whole blood iron concentrations gradually decreased with age. At the same time, mean whole blood iron concentrations were lower 420 mg/l among women and men in the community. And the mean levels of whole blood iron were higher in men(504.08 mg/l ± 45.98 mg/l) than in women(453.80 mg/l ± 38.13 mg/l). Our study indicated no association between whole blood iron. Age was a covariate, but fasting blood glucose was not, and fasting blood glucose was independently associated with whole blood iron concentrations, suggesting that older women in this community need adequate iron supplementation."

"This article aims to reconceptualize the replication crisis as not merely a problem of flawed methods, lack of scientific rigor, or questionable researcher conduct, but as a fundamentally epistemological and philosophical issue. While improved methodologies and scientific practices are necessary, they must be considered through the lens of the underlying epistemologies. Toward this end, a new paradigm for psychological research and practice, grounded in second-order cybernetics and transactional causality, is proposed as instrumental. Second-order cybernetics, as introduced by Heinz von Foerster, challenges traditional scientific methodologies that assume a strict separation between the observer and the observed. The core idea is that the observer, through the very act of observing, inevitably becomes part of the system they study, leading to a shift from linear to transactional causality. This epistemological shift has profound implications for the research practice and the responsibility of the psychology practitioner. Foerster's ethical imperative -act always so as to increase the number of choices- combined with the aesthetic imperative -If you desire to see, learn how to act- illuminates an alternative methodological landscape for the clinical practice. The replication crisis in psychology is examined in light of these theoretical shifts, allowing for a new constructive vision which integrates basic research with applied psychological practice. Second-order cybernetics encourages a participatory approach to research, emphasizing the catalyzing role of the observing practitioner. The article concludes by advocating for an epistemological superposition, where psychologists navigate multiple perspectives to enhance the integrity and applicability of their findings in the real world."
"Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) rank in the top 5 disease categories for which adults in developing countries seek healthcare services. Community pharmacies offer clients convenience, proximity, extended opening hours, privacy, and efficiency, which could make them desirable locations for HIV and STI screening and treatment. We examined the feasibility of using point-of-care (POC) STI tests for screening HIV and other STIs at community pharmacies."
"The placenta is a temporary organ that forms during pregnancy and is essential for fetal development and maternal health. As an endocrine organ, proper placental function requires continual production, folding, and transport of proteins and lipids. Central to these processes is the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a dynamic organelle responsible for maintaining cellular protein and lipid synthesis and processing. ER stress occurs when there is an accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins, which triggers the activation of cellular pathways collectively called the unfolded protein response. Unfolded protein response pathways act to alleviate the misfolded protein burden and restore ER homeostasis, or if unresolved, initiate cell death. While prolonged ER stress has been linked to deficient placental function and adverse pregnancy outcomes, basal activation of unfolded protein response pathways is required for placental development and function. This review explores the importance of ER homeostasis in placental development and function, examining how disruptions in ER stress responses may contribute to adverse pregnancy outcomes."
"Plasma biomarkers have great potential in the screening, diagnosis, and monitoring of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, findings on their associations with cerebral perfusion and structural changes are inconclusive. We examined both cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between plasma biomarkers and cerebral blood flow (CBF), gray matter (GM) volume, and white matter (WM) integrity. Forty-eight AD patients whose diagnosis was supported by amyloid-β (Aβ) PET received measurement of plasma biomarkers with a single molecular array, including Aβ42, phosphorylated tau 181 (P-tau181), neurofilament light (NfL), total tau (T-tau), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and both baseline and one-year follow-up magnetic resonance imaging, including pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling, T1-weighted imaging, and diffusion tensor imaging. Correlations were found between regional CBF and several plasma biomarkers, with Aβ42 showing the strongest correlation with CBF in the left inferior temporal gyrus (r = 0.507, p = 0.001). Plasma P-tau181 and GFAP levels were correlated with GM volume in the posterior cingulate gyrus and the bilateral hippocampus and right middle temporal gyrus, respectively. Decreased CBF and GM volume in regions vulnerable to AD, such as the posterior cingulate gyrus, inferior parietal lobule and hippocampus, could be predicted by the levels of specific plasma biomarkers. Most biomarkers, except Aβ42, showed extensive correlations with longitudinal WM disruption. Plasma biomarkers exhibited varied correlations with brain perfusion, GM volume, and WM integrity and predicted their longitudinal changes in AD patients, suggesting their potential to reflect functional and structural changes and to monitor pathophysiological progression in the brain."
"Until now, the thyroid cancer case number has increased, and it is not entirely possible to attribute this continuous growth to more meticulous thyroid nodule selection and more accurate diagnostic techniques. While there is currently no conclusive evidence linking dietary factors to thyroid cancer, certain dietary patterns seem to have an impact on the development of the disease. There are interesting connections among diet, environment, metabolism and thyroid carcinogenesis; a deeper comprehension of the underlying mechanisms should help the identification of modifiable risk factors for thyroid cancer. This protocol aims to guide a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature to search for an association between dietary pattern and risk of thyroid cancer."
"This study investigated the antioxidant and antimicrobial properties, as well as the volatile compounds, of Lactobacillus bulgaricus (L. bulgaricus) postbiotics (at concentration of 150 and 300 mg/L) and their combination with chitosan coatings (0.5% and 1%) on sausage quality (with 100 ppm nitrite) during 40 days of cold storage. The results were compared to a control group, as well as to sausages containing commercial formulation (120 ppm) and reduced (100 ppm) levels of nitrite. To further assess the antimicrobial effects, it also inoculated E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus into the sausages in order to examine how the postbiotics and chitosan coatings impacted the growth of these foodborne pathogens during the 40-day cold storage period. The reults indicated that those containing 300 mg/L postbiotic and 1% chitosan generally met the desired condition for pH, moisture, fat, and total volatile base-nitrogen. These samples also showed the strongest inhibition of mesophilic and psychrophilic bacteria, mold and yeast. Notably, no E. coli or S. aureus were detected in any of the samples, indicating that the postbiotic and chitosan combination effectively inhibited the growth of these pathogens in sausages. The findings suggest that using chitosan coatings and L. bulgaricus postbiotic can enhance the quality of sausages, ultimately lowering the risk of contamination by harmful bacteria and improving overall food safety."
"Ortholog prediction, essential for various genomic research areas, faces growing inconsistencies amidst the expanding array of ortholog databases. The common strategy of computing consensus orthologs introduces additional arbitrariness, emphasizing the need to examine the causes of such inconsistencies and identify proteins susceptible to prediction errors."
"Bone metastasis (BM) is a mortality-related event of late-stage cancer, with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) being a common origin for BM. However, the detailed molecular profiling of the metastatic bone ecosystem is not fully understood, hindering the development of effective therapies for advanced patients. In this study, we examined the cellular heterogeneity between primary tumours and BM from tissues and peripheral blood by single-cell transcriptomic analysis, which was verified using multiplex immunofluorescence staining and public datasets. Our results demonstrate a senescent microenvironment in BM tissues of NSCLC. BM has a significantly higher infiltration of malignant cells with senescent characteristics relative to primary tumours, accompanied by aggravated metastatic properties. The endothelial-mesenchymal transition involved with SOX18 activation is related to the cellular senescence of vascular endothelial cells from BM. CD4Tstr cells, with pronounced stress and senescence states, are preferentially infiltrated in BM, indicating stress-related dysfunction contributing to the immunocompromised environment during tumour metastasis to bone. Moreover, we identify the SPP1 pathway-induced cellular crosstalk among T cells, vascular ECs and malignant cells in BM, which activates SOX18 and deteriorates patient survival. Our findings highlight the roles of cellular senescence in modulating the microenvironment of BM and implicate anti-senescence therapy for advanced NSCLC patients."
"An accurate assessment of p53's functional statuses is critical for cancer genomic medicine. However, there is a significant challenge in identifying tumors with non-mutational p53 inactivation which is not detectable through DNA sequencing. These undetected cases are often misclassified as p53-normal, leading to inaccurate prognosis and downstream association analyses. To address this issue, we built the support vector machine (SVM) models to systematically reassess p53's functional statuses in TP53 wild-type (TP53WT) tumors from multiple The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohorts. Cross-validation demonstrated the good performance of the SVM models with a mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.9822, precision of 0.9747, and recall of 0.9784. Our study revealed that a significant proportion (87%-99%) of TP53WT tumors actually had compromised p53 function. Additional analyses uncovered that these genetically intact but functionally impaired (termed as predictively reduced function of p53 or TP53WT-pRF) tumors exhibited genomic and pathophysiologic features akin to TP53-mutant tumors: heightened genomic instability and elevated levels of hypoxia. Clinically, patients with TP53WT-pRF tumors experienced significantly shortened overall survival or progression-free survival compared to those with predictively normal function of p53 (TP53WT-pN) tumors, and these patients also displayed increased sensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapy and radiation therapy."
"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of cognitive impairment and dementia worldwide with rising prevalence, incidence and mortality. Despite many decades of research, there remains an unmet need for disease-modifying treatment that can significantly alter the progression of disease. Recently, with United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) drug approvals, there have been tremendous advances in this area, with agents demonstrating effects on cognition and biomarkers. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays an instrumental role in these trials. This review article aims to outline how MRI is used for screening eligibility, monitoring safety and measuring efficacy in clinical trials, leaning on the landscape of past and recent AD clinical trials that have used MRI as examples; further, insight on promising MRI biomarkers for future trials is provided. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 1. TECHNICAL EFFICACY: Stage 4."
"Mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR) with microsatellite instability (MSI) is frequent in cancer, particularly in gastrointestinal and endometrial malignancies. The increased tumor mutational burden renders dMMR/MSI tumors suitable targets for immune checkpoint inhibitors-provided the regulatory genetic defect can be detected. dMMR and MSI are considered equally effective predictors of the efficacy of ICIs; however, while dMMR testing is based on detection of missing MMR proteins in immunohistochemistry (IHC), MSI polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing focuses on the consequences of dMMR at the genomic level."
"Although evidence has accumulated regarding the association between various stressors and depression, few studies have considered the context in which multiple stressors coexist simultaneously. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the relative importance of seven major life stressors on depressive symptoms: workplace stress, family relationships, interpersonal conflicts, health problems, financial strains, traumatic events, and mannerisms, and analyzed its variation in subgroups."

"Chemotherapy is an effective way to improve the prognosis of colorectal cancer patients, but patient resistance to chemotherapeutic agents is becoming a major obstacle to treatment. Nucleotide metabolism correlates with the progression of colorectal cancer and chemotherapy resistance, but the mechanisms involved need to be further investigated. We calculated the half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) in colorectal cancer patients using the ""oncopredict"" package, screened nucleotide metabolism-related drug resistance genes, and constructed a risk score model. According to the Kaplan-Meier(KM) analysis, the overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (PFS) of the high-risk group were significantly lower than those of the low-risk group. In addition, the nomogram we constructed had good performance in predicting OS in colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) patients. We validated NDUFA4L2 by cellular functionality experiments, animal tumorigenesis experiments and drug resistance experiments. It was demonstrated that NDUFA4L2 promoted the proliferation and migration of colon cancer cells, while the abnormal regulation of NDUFA4L2 affected the 5-FU resistance of colon cancer cells. In conclusion, we found that NDUFA4L2 promotes the progression and metastasis of colon cancer, as well as resistance to 5-FU chemotherapy."
"The HIV-1 epidemic in Brazil is predominantly characterized by subtype B, except in the southern states, where subtype C (HIV-1C) is more prevalent. Continuous monitoring of this profile is essential to maintain an accurate understanding of the molecular landscape of the HIV epidemic in Brazil. In this study, we isolated and sequenced seven new HIV-1C strains from the state of Bahia, located in the Northeast region of Brazil. To reconstruct the phylogenetic history of HIV-1C in the Northeast and investigate its connections with other regions of the country and globally, we first compiled a dataset of 3631 HIV-1C sequences from Brazil, Africa, and Europe. As expected, most of the new HIV-1C sequences from Bahia (n = 6) clustered within the well-known Brazilian clade. However, one sequence from Bahia clustered within the African clade, suggesting a possible new introduction of HIV-1C into Brazil. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the HIV-1C cases in Bahia likely originated from southern states, particularly Santa Catarina. This study provides valuable insights into the molecular profile of the HIV epidemic in Brazil, expanding our understanding of HIV-1C beyond the Southern region."
The optimal timing for surgical treatment of open distal radius fractures remains an area of debate. The purpose of this study was to examine the outcomes of open distal radius fractures treated surgically before or after 24 hours.
"Prior studies testing the association between insulin resistance (IR) and prostate cancer (PC) risk are inconsistent. We examined the association between Homeostatic Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR; calculated from fasting baseline insulin and glucose) and PC in REDUCE, a 4-year randomized trial of dutasteride vs. placebo for PC prevention."
Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a prevalent artery and is strongly correlated with age. The role of CD4+ Memory T cells in giant cell arteritis has not been elucidated.
"Management of quadrilateral plate fractures is technically demanding and requires specific fixation techniques. Infra-pectineal plating is the gold standard method of fixation. However, we recorded a high incidence of medial wall displacement and reoperations. Therefore, the aim of our study was to identify whether supra-pectineal quadrilateral buttress plating provides much more rigid fixation with a better functional and radiological outcome or not."
"Genomic sequencing has the potential to revolutionise newborn screening (NBS) programmes. In 2024, Genomics England began to recruit for the Generation Study (GS), which uses whole genome sequencing (WGS) to detect genetic changes in 500 genes in more than 200 rare conditions. Ultimately, its purpose is to facilitate the earlier identification of rare conditions and thereby improve health-related outcomes for individuals. The adoption of rare conditions into the GS was guided by four criteria: (1) the gene causing the condition can be reliably detected; (2) if undiagnosed, the rare condition would have a serious impact; (3) early or presymptomatic testing would substantially improve outcomes; and (4) interventions for conditions screened are accessible to all. Rett syndrome (RTT, OMIM 312750), a paediatric neurodevelopment disorder, was not included in the list of rare conditions in the GS. In this opinion article, we revisit the GS and discuss RTT from the perspective of these four criteria. We begin with an introduction to the GS and then summarise key points about the four principles, presenting challenges and opportunities for individuals with RTT. We provide insight into how data could be collected during the presymptomatic phase, which could facilitate early diagnosis and improve our understanding of the prodromal stage of RTT. Although many features of RTT present a departure from criteria adopted by the GS, advances in RTT research, combined with advocacy from parent-based organisations, could facilitate its entry into future newborn screening programmes."
"Hospitalized patients with acute decompensation (AD) of cirrhosis are at risk of progressing to acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF), significantly increasing their mortality. The aim of this study was to identify key predictors and patient trajectories predisposing to ACLF."

"The choice between primary arthrodesis (PA) and open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) for acute Lisfranc injuries remains contentious. Apart from primary treatment, arthrodesis is often used for treating chronic Lisfranc injuries, including patients in whom initial ORIF or nonoperative treatment failed. The aim of this study was to compare PA and secondary arthrodesis (SA) in terms of complications and functional outcome."
"The formation of natural gas hydrates presents significant economic and safety challenges to the petroleum and gas industry, necessitating the development of effective prevention strategies. This study investigates an environmentally sustainable Tenebrio molitor antifreeze protein (TmAFP) modified to be a potential kinetic hydrate inhibitor. The aim of this study was to enhance the inhibitory activity of TmAFP by systematically substituting threonine (Thr) residues with glycine (Gly), alanine (Ala), or serine (Ser) at positions 29, 39, and 53. The Ala mutant demonstrated superior inhibition of hydrate formation, attributed to its optimized spatial conformation and enhanced hydrophobic interactions, followed by the Gly and Ser mutants. The wild-type TmAFP showed limited efficacy. The radial distribution function (RDF) analysis indicated that the mutations facilitated a better accommodation of adjacent residues within the hydrate crystal structure by adjusting the distance between Thri and Thri+2 to closely match the second peak in the RDF of methane molecules at 6.4 Å. The potential of mean force (PMF) calculations revealed that the Ala and Ser mutants exhibited enhanced interactions with hydrate cages, with PMF values of -0.73 and -0.71 kJ/mol, respectively, compared to the Gly mutant, which had a PMF value of 1.46 kJ/mol. By identifying the optimal mutation combination (T29 39 53A) to significantly increase the potency of TmAFP, this study provides a fundamental basis for the further development of hydrate inhibition strategies."

"Intravenous (IV) injection is widely recognized as the most effective and commonly utilized method for achieving systemic delivery of substances in mammalian research models. However, its application in adult zebrafish for drug delivery, stem cell transplantation, and regenerative and cancer studies has been limited due to the challenges posed by their small body size and intricate blood vessels. To overcome these limitations, alternative injection techniques such as intracardiac and retro-orbital (RO) injection have been explored in the past for stem cell transplantation in adult zebrafish. However, these techniques have their drawbacks, including the need for meticulous injection techniques or increased risk of mortality. In this study, we have developed a refined and optimized IV injection procedure specifically tailored to adult zebrafish, addressing the challenges associated with their unique anatomy. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique, we performed successful IV injections of whole kidney marrow cells from Tg(mpo: EGFP) fish and FITC-dextran dye into adult Casper fish. The subsequent visualization of injected cells and dyes using a fluorescence microscope confirmed their successful delivery and engraftment within the zebrafish. Furthermore, we demonstrated that compared with the intracardiac and RO injections, the IV injection resulted in improved survival rates and engraftment efficiency in treated zebrafish. This approach enables precise delivery and localization of substances and holds great potential for large-scale drug and chemical screening using adult zebrafish. Additionally, the ability to visually track the injected cells and dyes provides invaluable insights into their engraftment, migration, and interactions with host tissues, enabling a more comprehensive evaluation of therapeutic effects and biological processes in zebrafish models."
"The systemic inflammatory response index (SIRI), a straightforward and easily accessible measure of inflammation and prognosis, has drawn more attention lately. It is unknown, however, if SIRI is important for IgA nephropathy (IgAN) patients' outcomes. To better clarify these concerns, we conducted this investigation."
"The aim of this study was to investigate the role of platelet indicators in the susceptibility of ABO blood groups to lung adenocarcinoma. This was a multicenter retrospective cohort analysis. The study included 528 patients diagnosed with primary lung adenocarcinoma and 528 randomly selected control group patients who were admitted to the Chengdu Fifth People's Hospital from January 2021 to September 2023. Additionally, it included 1452 patients diagnosed with primary lung adenocarcinoma and 1452 control group patients who were admitted to the Sichuan Cancer Hospital from November 2013 to May 2021. Platelet indicators were studied using an automated blood counter. ABO blood groups were determined by the gel column method using agglutination techniques. Statistical analysis was performed using Chi-square tests, independent-samples T-tests, ANOVA, and logistic regression. Chi-square analysis showed that there was a difference in ABO blood group composition between the lung adenocarcinoma group and the control group (p < 0.001). Independent-samples T-tests showed that MPV was significantly higher in lung adenocarcinoma than in control group (p = 0.025). The ANOVA of ABO blood groups and platelet indicators in lung adenocarcinoma showed that the average platelet count (PLT) of O group blood was higher than that of B group blood (p = 0.037), while the mean platelet volume (MPV) was significantly lower than that of A group, B group and AB group blood (p = 0.009). After adjusting for gender and age, logistic regression analysis showed that the risk of lung adenocarcinoma in blood groups O and B was higher than that in blood group A (p < 0.05 for each) and blood group AB (p < 0.05 for each), regardless of whether platelet indicators were added. Meanwhile, logistic regression showed that high platelet volume (MPV) was a risk factor for lung adenocarcinoma (p = 0.029). Our findings suggest that platelet indicators are respectively associated with ABO blood groups and lung adenocarcinoma. However, platelet indicators may not influence the ABO blood groups related susceptibility to Lung Adenocarcinoma."
"Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a severe gastrointestinal condition with an increasing incidence of hyperlipidemic etiology. The investigation employed a two-sample, bidirectional Mendelian randomization method to investigate potential causal relationship between lipidome profiles, inflammatory mediators, and AP. Exploration of genetic variants across the genome in a study population of 10,630 AP cases and 844,679 non-AP individuals revealed multiple lipidome entities significantly associated with AP risk. The study identified 23 lipid species with unidirectional causal effects on AP after accounting for heterogeneity, pleiotropy, and potential reverse causation. Additionally, five inflammatory factors (CD5, IL-13, MMP-1, STAMBP, TNFRSF9) showed significant potential causal relationship with AP. Further analysis elucidated the intricate interplay between specific lipid species and inflammatory mediators in influencing AP incidence. Notably, Sterol ester (27:1/20:4) and several phosphatidylcholine species, including PC (17:0_20:4), PC (18:0_20:4), PC (18:0_20:5), and PC (O-18:2_20:4), were negatively associated with AP risk. This protective effect was partially mediated through decreased levels of inflammatory markers, particularly STAMBP and MMP-1. The study found that these phosphatidylcholines and sterol esters significantly reduced the levels of these pro-inflammatory factors, thereby potentially mitigating AP risk. Conversely, Phosphatidylinositol (16:0_18:1) demonstrated a positive association with AP risk. This detrimental effect was partially mediated by increased levels of MMP-1 and STAMBP, suggesting a pro-inflammatory mechanism. The study provides evidence that this specific phosphatidylinositol species may exacerbate AP risk by promoting inflammatory pathways. These findings elucidate the complex interplay between lipid metabolites, inflammation, and AP pathogenesis, potentially informing novel therapeutic strategies. The study highlights the utility of Mendelian randomization in uncovering potential causal relationship in AP. It underscores the requirement for further study into the molecular mechanisms underlying lipid-mediated inflammation in AP, particularly the roles of phosphatidylcholines and sterol esters in modulating inflammatory responses. Further studies are warranted to confirm our observations in laboratory models and assess their translational value in developing AP preventive and therapeutic strategies."

"Obtaining gold nanorods (AuNRs) through biosynthesis is an alternative that replaces the traditional use of ascorbic acid with chemical compounds such as polyphenols, owing to their notable antioxidant properties. Therefore, we developed an AuNR biosynthesis method using an aqueous extract of sour guava (Psidium araca). Initially, a study was conducted to determine the antioxidant capacity of different parts of the fruit (pulp and peel) over 14 days. Four colorimetric techniques were used: total phenol, ABTS (2,2-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid), FRAP (ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), and DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl). Subsequently, in stage 2, the selected aqueous extract was used, and two response surface designs were performed. The objective of this study was to find a model equation that would indicate the optimal parameters for obtaining AuNRs with a surface plasmon band at 808 nm, with possible applications in the health field. The results of the antioxidant capacity experiments were analyzed in Minitab® using a multilevel factorial design, and the peel exhibited the highest antioxidant capacity. Subsequently, the biosynthesis of AuNRs proceeded using a 5-factor response surface experimental design as input variables (concentration in mM of gold, silver, extract, NaBH4, and reaction time in hours) and longitudinal plasmon (LSPR) as output variables. The AuNRs were approximately 30 nm in size with an LSPR between 700 and 800 nm. Statistical model evaluation revealed a dependence between gold and time and gold-silver factors. Finally, antioxidant capacity was used to select the part (peel or pulp) of sour guava that could be used as a weak reducing agent. Moreover, the utility of surface-response methodology was explored to optimize the synthesis of AuNRs using green agents."

"Most kidney transplant patients who undergo biopsies are classified as having no rejection based on consensus thresholds. However, we hypothesized that because these patients have normal adaptive immune systems, T cell-mediated rejection (TCMR) and antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR) may exist as subthreshold activity in some transplants currently classified as no rejection. To examine this question, we studied genome-wide microarray results from 5086 kidney transplant biopsies (from 4170 patients). An updated molecular archetypal analysis designated 56% of biopsies as no rejection. Subthreshold molecular TCMR and/or ABMR activity molecular activity was detectable as elevated classifier scores in many biopsies classified as no rejection, with ABMR activity in many TCMR biopsies and TCMR activity in many ABMR biopsies. In biopsies classified as no rejection histologically and molecularly, molecular TCMR classifier scores correlated with increases in histologic TCMR features and molecular injury, lower estimated glomerular filtration rate, and higher risk of graft loss, and molecular ABMR activity correlated with increased glomerulitis and donor-specific antibody. No rejection biopsies with high subthreshold TCMR or ABMR activity had a higher probability of having TCMR or ABMR, respectively, diagnosed in a future biopsy. We conclude that many kidney transplant recipients have unrecognized subthreshold TCMR or ABMR activity, with significant implications for future problems."

"The transcription factor p63 is expressed in many different isoforms as a result of differential promoter use and splicing. Some of these isoforms have very specific physiological functions in the development and maintenance of epithelial tissues and surveillance of genetic integrity in oocytes. The ASPP family of proteins is involved in modulating the transcriptional activity of the p53 protein family members, including p63. In particular, iASPP plays an important role in the development and differentiation of epithelial tissues. Here we characterize the interaction of iASPP with p63 and show that it binds to the linker region between the DNA binding domain and the oligomerization domain. We further demonstrate that this binding site is removed in a splice variant of p63 where a stretch of five amino acids is replaced with a single alanine residue. This stretch contains a degenerate class II SH3 domain binding motif that is responsible for interaction with iASPP, as well as two positively charged amino acids. Moreover, the concomitant loss of the charged amino acids in the alternatively spliced version decreases the affinity of p63 to its cognate DNA element two- to threefold. mRNAs encoding full-length p63, as well as its alternatively spliced version, are present in all tissues that we investigated, albeit in differing ratios. We speculate that, through the formation of hetero-complexes of both isoforms, the affinity to DNA, as well as the interaction with iASPP, can be fine-tuned in a tissue-specific manner."
"Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) increases inflammasome-linked atherosclerosis, but the mechanisms by which CH mutant cells transmit inflammatory signals to nonmutant cells are largely unknown. To address this question, we transplanted 1.5% Jak2V617F (Jak2VF) bone marrow (BM) cells with 98.5% WT BM cells into hyperlipidemic Ldlr-/- mice. Low-allele-burden (LAB) mice showed accelerated atherosclerosis with increased features of plaque instability, decreased levels of the macrophage phagocytic receptors c-Mer tyrosine kinase (MERTK) and triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), and increased neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). These changes were reversed when Jak2VF BM was transplanted with Il1r1-/- BM. LAB mice with noncleavable MERTK in WT BM showed improvements in necrotic core and fibrous cap formation and reduced NETs. An agonistic TREM2 antibody (4D9) markedly increased fibrous caps in both control and LAB mice, eliminating the difference between the groups. Mechanistically, 4D9 increased TREM2+PDGFB+ macrophages and PDGF receptor-α+ fibroblast-like cells in the cap region. TREM2 and PDGFB mRNA levels were positively correlated in human carotid plaques and coexpressed in macrophages. In summary, low frequencies of Jak2VF mutations promoted atherosclerosis via IL-1 signaling from Jak2VF to WT macrophages and neutrophils, promoting cleavage of phagocytic receptors and features of plaque instability. Therapeutic approaches that stabilize MERTK or TREM2 could promote plaque stabilization, especially in CH- and inflammasome-driven atherosclerosis."
"Obesity is related to liver fibrosis, a condition marked by the collection of scar tissue in the liver due to the development of a profibrotic environment, which includes increased hepatocellular death and elevated reactive oxygen species production. The aim of study is to evaluate the effect of bariatric surgery on the association between liver fibrosis indices and obesity. This is a retrospective cohort, evaluating 1205 individuals diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and living with obesity, who experienced bariatric surgery. These patients living with T2D and obesity were monitored after bariatric surgery for two years. The trajectory of biochemical markers and liver fibrosis indices were evaluated at five visits. These liver indices were Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to platelet ratio index, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) fibrosis score. FIB-4 index demonstrated notable trends based on its values. It showed an initial increase observed at the three-months visit, followed by a decline up to one year with a slight increase at the last follow-up (P-trend < 0.001). It should be mentioned that, mean FIB-4 in patients with FIB-4 ≥ 1.3 (pre-operation) did not exceed the value of 2.00, which is lower than the cut-off value of high risk for liver cirrhosis (FIB-4 ≥ 2.67). In addition, the NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS) demonstrated a substantial decline from - 0.32 ± 1.32 pre-operation to -0.86 ± 1.15 at the two-year mark (P-trend < 0.001). Finally, the AST to platelet ratio index (APRI) decreased from 0.27 ± 0.20 pre-operation to 0.23 ± 0.12 at the 12-month follow-up. Bariatric surgery significantly improves NFS and cause alterations in APRI and Fib-4 index levels without increasing the risk of liver cirrhosis development among patients with T2D and obesity."
"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) gene encodes dystrophin, a large multidomain protein. Its nonfunctionality leads to dystrophinopathies like DMD and Becker muscular dystrophy, for which no cure is yet available. A few therapies targeted towards specific mutations can extend the lifespan of patients, although with limited efficacy and high costs, emphasizing the need for more general treatments. Dystrophin's complex structure with poorly understood domains and the presence of multiple isoforms with varied expression patterns in different tissues pose challenges in therapeutic development. The C-terminal (CT) domain of dystrophin is less understood in terms of its structure-function, although it has been shown to perform important functional roles by interacting with another cytosolic protein, dystrobrevin. Dystrophin and dystrobrevin stabilize the sarcolemma membrane by forming a multiprotein complex called dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex that is destabilized in DMD. Dystrobrevin has two major isoforms, alpha and beta, with tissue-specific expression patterns. Here, we characterize the CT domain of dystrophin and its interactions with the two dystrobrevin isoforms. We show that the CT domain is nonglobular and shows reversible urea denaturation as well as thermal denaturation. It interacts with dystrobrevin isoforms differentially, with differences in binding affinity and the mode of interaction. We further show that the amino acid differences in the CT region of dystrobrevin isoforms contribute to these differences. These results have implications for the stability of dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex in different tissues and explain the differing symptoms associated with DMD patients affecting organs beyond the skeletal muscles."
"The success of radial head arthroplasty (RHA) relies on the design of the implant and precision of the surgical technique, with preoperative planning potentially playing a crucial role. The accurate establishment of a patient-specific anatomical coordinate system (ACS) is essential for this planning process. This study tested the hypothesis that an innovative automated method would be an accurate, reliable, and efficient framework to determine the ACS of the proximal radius, which would be a step toward improving the precision of RHA planning. We used advanced computational techniques to analyze 50 forearm CT scans, comparing the accuracy, reproducibility, reliability, and efficiency of the automated method with manually derived ACS using expert observers as benchmarks. The results showed that the automated approach was more accurate in identifying anatomical landmarks, with smaller mean distance discrepancies (0.6 mm) than manual observers (1 mm). Its reproducibility was also superior, with narrower reproducibility limits, particularly for ulnar notch landmarks (0.6 to 0.8 mm compared to manual selection 1.2 to 1.4 mm) (p = .01). In addition, the limits of agreement and the mean absolute rotational and translational differences of the axes were narrower for the automated method, which also reduced the construction time to an average of 46 s compared to 150 s manually (p < .001). These findings suggest that the automated method has the potential to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of preoperative and postoperative computer-assisted procedures for RHA. Further research is needed to fully understand the utility of this automated system for enhancing RHA computer-assisted surgical planning."
This study investigated impulsivity and working memory among CD inpatients across treatment and compared to controls.
"A search in Scopus within ""Article title, Abstract, Keywords"" unveils 2,444 documents focused on the biomechanics of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA), mostly on AAA wall stress. Only 24 documents investigated AAA kinematics, an important topic that could potentially offer significant insights into the biomechanics of AAA. In this paper, we present an image-based approach for patient-specific, in vivo, and non-invasive AAA kinematic analysis using patient's time-resolved 3D computed tomography angiography (4D-CTA) images, with an objective to measure wall displacement and strain during the cardiac cycle. Our approach relies on regularized deformable image registration for estimating wall displacement, estimation of the local wall strain as the ratio of its normal displacement to its local radius of curvature, and local surface fitting with non-deterministic outlier detection for estimating the wall radius of curvature. We verified our approach against synthetic ground truth image data created by warping a 3D-CTA image of AAA using a realistic displacement field obtained from a finite element biomechanical model. We applied our approach to assess AAA wall displacements and strains in ten patients. Our kinematic analysis results indicated that the 99th percentile of circumferential wall strain, among all patients, ranged from 2.62% to 5.54%, with an average of 4.45% and a standard deviation of 0.87%. We also observed that AAA wall strains are significantly lower than those of a healthy aorta. Our work demonstrates that the registration-based measurement of AAA wall displacements in the direction normal to the wall is sufficiently accurate to reliably estimate strain from these displacements."
"Our previous studies revealed the existence of a Universal Receptive System that regulates interactions between cells and their environment. This system is composed of DNA- and RNA-based Teazeled receptors (TezRs) found on the surface of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, as well as integrases and recombinases. In the current study, we aimed to provide further insight into the regulatory role of TezR and its loss in Staphylococcus aureus gene transcription. To this end, transcriptomic analysis of S. aureus MSSA VT209 was performed following the destruction of TezRs. Bacterial RNA samples were extracted from nuclease-treated and untreated S. aureus MSSA VT209. After destruction of the DNA-based-, RNA-, or combined DNA- and RNA-based TezRs of S. aureus, 103, 150, and 93 genes were significantly differently expressed, respectively. The analysis revealed differential clustering of gene expression following the loss of different TezRs, highlighting individual cellular responses following the loss of DNA- and RNA-based TezRs. KEGG pathway gene enrichment analysis revealed that the most upregulated pathways following TezR inactivation included those related to energy metabolism, cell wall metabolism, and secretion systems. Some of the genetic pathways were related to the inhibition of biofilm formation and increased antibiotic resistance, and we confirmed this at the phenotypic level using in vitro studies. The results of this study add another line of evidence that the Universal Receptive System plays an important role in cell regulation, including cell responses to the environmental factors of clinically important pathogens, and that nucleic acid-based TezRs are functionally active parts of the extrabiome."
"We aimed to identify and validate factors related to uncontrolled hypertension. Participants treated with at least one antihypertensive drug from the prospective contemporaneous CoLaus|PsyCoLaus study were enrolled. We investigated the association between hypertension status (uncontrolled, defined as systolic blood pressure [SBP] ≥ 140 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure [DBP] ≥ 90 mm Hg, versus controlled hypertension [SBP/DBP < 140/90 mm Hg]) and potential risk factors. Additionally, the prospective association of uncontrolled hypertension with cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality was evaluated. 1040 participants recruited between 2003 and 2006 with a mean follow-up of 12.3 years (SD ± 3.4) were included in the analyses. Heavy alcohol consumption, increased BMI, increased ferritin and albuminuria were positively associated with uncontrolled hypertension. Factors inversely associated with uncontrolled hypertension were university degree, current smoker, and high potassium urinary excretion. Uncontrolled hypertension status was not associated with incident ASCVD nor all-cause mortality in our study. In conclusion, uncontrolled hypertension was associated with modifiable factors, such as heavy drinking, obesity and level of education. Further studies should investigate whether including biological markers in clinical practice, such as potassium excretion, ferritin levels, or albuminuria, would help identify individuals who may develop uncontrolled hypertension."
"Introduced in 2010, the subdiscipline of gerontologic biostatistics was conceptualized to address the specific challenges of analyzing data from clinical research studies involving older adults. Since then, the evolving technological landscape has led to a proliferation of advancements in biostatistics and other data sciences that have significantly influenced the practice of gerontologic research, including studies beyond the clinic. Data science is the field at the intersection of statistics and computer science, and although the term ""data science"" was not widely used in 2010, the field has quickly made palpable effects on gerontologic research. In this Review in Depth, we describe multiple advancements of biostatistics and data science that have been particularly impactful. Moreover, we propose the subdiscipline of ""gerontologic biostatistics and data science,"" which subsumes gerontologic biostatistics into a more encompassing practice. Prominent gerontologic biostatistics and data science advancements that we discuss herein include cutting-edge methods in experimental design and causal inference, adaptations of machine learning, the rigorous quantification of deep phenotypic measurement, and analysis of high-dimensional -omics data. We additionally describe the need for integration of information from multiple studies and propose strategies to foster reproducibility, replicability, and open science. Lastly, we provide information on software resources for gerontologic biostatistics and data science practitioners to apply these approaches to their own work and propose areas where further advancement is needed. The methodological topics reviewed here aim to enhance data-rich research on aging and foster the next generation of gerontologic researchers."

"Increased focus on renovating and maintaining the existing building stock is an integral part of the circular economy, however this might pose challenges to workers health. The aim of this study was to assess the renovation workers' exposure to inhalable dust, thoracic dust, respirable dust, and respirable crystalline silica (RCS). Personal aerosol samples were collected as full shift samples from 92 workers to a total of 407 samples. Fourteen locations around Oslo, Norway was visited for multiple days with repeated measurements of the same individual. Particulate matter from 3 aerosol fractions, respirable, thoracic, and inhalable, were analyzed gravimetrically, and the respirable fraction was analyzed for RCS by NIOSH 7500 method for X-ray diffraction (XRD) with low temperature plasma ashing sample preparation. The total measured concentrations of respirable dust (n = 192) had a geometric mean (GM) of 0.88 mg/m3, RCS concentrations (n = 182) had a GM of 0.040 mg/m3, thoracic dust (n = 131) had GM 2.4 mg/m3, and inhalable dust (n = 84) had a GM of 8.5 mg/m3. The maximum measured concentrations were 29 mg/m3, 3.2 mg/m3, 65 mg/m3, and 163 mg/m3, respectively. Workdays involving tasks such as mechanical demolition and clearing out demolished materials led to the highest exposure levels of both dust and RCS. However, other workers at the renovation sites were indirectly exposed to a considerable amount of RCS. This study revealed substantial exposure to both RCS and dust during renovation, and protective measures are warranted to reduce exposure levels in the industry."
"Toxoplasma gondii, the causative agent of toxoplasmosis, infects cells and replicates inside via the secretion of factors stored in specialized organelles (rhoptries, micronemes, and dense granules) and the capture of host materials. The genesis of the secretory organelles and the processes of secretion and endocytosis depend on vesicular trafficking events whose molecular bases remain poorly known. Notably, there is no characterization of the BAR (Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs) domain-containing proteins expressed by T. gondii and other apicomplexans, although such proteins are known to play critical roles in vesicular trafficking in other eukaryotes. Here, by combining structural analyses with in vitro assays and cellular observations, we have characterized TgREMIND (regulators of membrane interacting domains), involved in the genesis of rhoptries and dense granules, and TgBAR2 found at the parasite cortex. We establish that TgREMIND comprises an F-BAR domain that can bind curved neutral membranes with no strict phosphoinositide requirement and exert a membrane remodeling activity. Next, we establish that TgREMIND contains a new structural domain called REMIND, which negatively regulates the membrane-binding capacities of the F-BAR domain. In parallel, we report that TgBAR2 contains a BAR domain with an extremely basic membrane-binding interface able to deform anionic membranes into very narrow tubules. Our data show that T. gondii codes for two atypical BAR domain-containing proteins with very contrasting membrane-binding properties, allowing them to function in two distinct regions of the parasite trafficking system."

"Whether adolescents' life satisfaction varies with gender is unclear. In a recently published study, Brisson et al. found unadjusted mean scores of life satisfaction to be higher in boys than in girls in Luxembourg, a country ranking high in gender-equality indexes. However, gender was no longer predictive of life satisfaction when well-identified predictors of life satisfaction were included in the model. The present work aimed to replicate Brisson et al.'s study in Kazakhstan, a less gender-equal country than Luxembourg, and test the gender-equality-paradox hypothesis."

"Isolated limb infusion and perfusion (ILI/ILP) has been a mainstay treatment for unresectable melanoma in-transit metastases (ITM), but increased use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) and intralesional therapy (talimogene laherparepvec [TVEC]) introduced several different management options. This study compares first-line ILI/ILP, ICI, and TVEC."
"Previous research shows that a single session of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) can improve the accuracy of episodic memory retrieval, but stimulation effects are not always found and may be moderated by time of day. Here, we report the results from a rigorous clinical trial (NCT03723850) designed to replicate these tDCS findings in younger adults and extend them to cognitively normal older adults. We conducted the largest double-blind, between-subjects tDCS study on memory retrieval in younger and older adults to date. 150 younger adults and 91 older adults received anodal tDCS or sham stimulation to the left dlPFC prior to episodic memory retrieval and working memory tasks. We also manipulated when tDCS was administered (time of day: morning vs. afternoon), task difficulty (easy vs. hard), and stimulus format (verbal vs. visual/pictorial) to test the extent that these variables are important for identifying tDCS effects. Contrary to our preregistered predictions, we did not find any effect of tDCS or time of day on younger or older adults' episodic or working memory performance. This outcome was not due to insensitivity of our cognitive tasks, given that we found expected effects of task difficulty and age-related effects on our memory measures. Based on these and prior tDCS results, we conclude that a single dose of tDCS using the typical and often recommended parameters does not reliably improve episodic memory retrieval in either age group."
"Females typically live longer than males but, paradoxically, spend a greater number of later years in poorer health. The neuromuscular system is a critical component of the progression to frailty, and motor unit (MU) characteristics differ by sex in healthy young individuals and may adapt to ageing in a sex-specific manner due to divergent hormonal profiles. The purpose of this study was to investigate sex differences in vastus lateralis (VL) MU structure and function in early to late elderly humans. Intramuscular electromyography signals from 50 healthy older adults (M/F: 26/24) were collected from VL during standardized submaximal contractions and decomposed to quantify MU characteristics. Muscle size and neuromuscular performance were also measured. Females had higher MU firing rate (FR) than males (P = 0.025), with no difference in MU structure or neuromuscular junction transmission (NMJ) instability. All MU characteristics increased from low- to mid-level contractions (P < 0.05) without sex × level interactions. Females had smaller cross-sectional area of VL, lower strength and poorer force steadiness (P < 0.05). From early to late elderly, both sexes showed decreased neuromuscular function (P < 0.05) without sex-specific patterns. Higher VL MUFRs at normalized contraction levels previously observed in young are also apparent in old individuals, with no sex-based difference of estimates of MU structure or NMJ transmission instability. From early to late elderly, the deterioration of neuromuscular function and MU characteristics did not differ between sexes, yet function was consistently greater in males. These parallel trajectories underscore the lower initial level for older females and may offer insights into identifying critical intervention periods. KEY POINTS: Females generally exhibit an extended lifespan when compared to males, yet this is accompanied by a poorer healthspan and higher rates of frailty. In healthy young people, motor unit firing rate (MUFR) at normalized contraction intensities is widely reported to be higher in females than in age-matched males. Here we show in 50 people that older females have higher MUFR than older males with little difference in other MU parameters. The trajectory of decline from early to late elderly does not differ between sexes, yet function is consistently lower in females. These findings highlight distinguishable sex disparities in some MU characteristics and neuromuscular function, and suggest early interventions are needed for females to prevent functional deterioration to reduce the ageing health-sex paradox."
"Higher blood pressure has been proven to be associated with poorer functional outcomes after successful reperfusion by EVT. However, the effect of intensive blood pressure-lowering regimens in these patients remains controversial and ambiguous in clinical practice. We propose further analysis aimed at determining the effect of an intensive blood pressure-lowering regimen after EVT in AIS."
The presence of low-grade inflammation has been reported in people with type 2 diabetes and related to the development of (macro)vascular complications. Whether systemic inflammation is present in type 1 diabetes and linked to long-term complications remains unknown. We used a targeted proteomics approach to compare inflammation in people with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes with control subjects and linked these proteins to diabetes related characteristics and complications.

"Antigen presentation plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of immune-mediated disorders. This study aimed to investigate the effects of IFN-γ and a cytokine mix (5MIX: IL-1α, IL-17A, IL-22, OsM, and TNF-α) on the antigen-presenting capabilities of keratinocytes, with a specific focus on immune-mediated dermatological conditions such as psoriasis (Ps). To achieve this, keratinocytes were treated with IFN-γ and 5MIX, and their impact on the expression of key antigen-presentation molecules, HLA-DRα and CD74, was assessed. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that IFN-γ alone altered the expression of 254 genes, highlighting its central role in modulating immune responses, including the recruitment of immune cells and regulation of inflammation. Temporal experiments further demonstrated that IFN-γ and 5MIX enhanced early endocytic activity and lysosomal degradation pathways, both essential for effective antigen presentation and T-cell activation. To extend these findings to a clinical context, a co-culture model using keratinocytes derived from psoriatic patients was established. This model revealed increased cytokine production following antigen stimulation, indicating robust and consistent CD4+ and naïve T-cell responses. These results elucidate the complex dynamics of cytokine signaling and antigen presentation in keratinocytes, providing insights into potential therapeutic strategies for immune-mediated skin disorders like Ps."
"A correlation between UA levels and the development of hypertension has been demonstrated. However, the relationship between UA and all-cause mortality in patients with hypertension remains underexplored. A nonlinear association between UA and all-cause mortality across sexes was observed through smoothed curve fitting. The correlation between UA and all-cause mortality was calculated by threshold and saturation effect analysis, along with Cox regression models. The stability of the results in the presence of different comorbidities was verified through stratified analysis for interaction testing. Smoothed curve fitting was also used to examine the association between UA and various diseases. The association between UA and all-cause mortality in patients with hypertension exhibited a U-shaped curve, with inconsistent inflection points between the sexes. In male patients with hypertension, all-cause mortality gradually decreased with increasing UA levels when UA levels were ≤ 7.2 mg/dL (HR  0.975; 95% CI 0.929-1.024) and gradually increased with increasing UA levels when UA levels were > 7.2 mg/dL (HR  1.204; 95% CI 1.120-1.294). Similar findings were observed in female patients with hypertension, with UA as a protective factor when UA levels were ≤ 5.1 mg/dL (HR 0.902; 95% CI 0.820-0.991) and a risk factor when UA levels were > 5.1 mg/dL (HR 1.120; 95% CI 1.072-1.169). The association between UA and all-cause mortality in patients with hypertension exhibits a U-shaped curve. All-cause mortality tends to decrease and then increase with increasing UA levels, with the inflection point varying between sexes."
"Cartilage repair remains a significant challenge in tissue engineering. The Sodium alginate/Chitosan hydrogel scaffold, fabricated from natural polymers, has the potential to promote tissue regeneration. However, its poor mechanical performance limits its application. Research has shown that integrating nanomaterials into three-dimensional network materials can significantly enhance mechanical properties, which is particularly important for osteochondral replacement scaffolds. In this study, biodegradable polylactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer/polycaprolactone/gelatin (PLGA/PCL/GEL) nanofibers were prepared via electrospinning and integrated as a reinforcing phase. This enhancement significantly improved the mechanical performance of the sodium alginate/chitosan hydrogel, achieving a maximum compressive modulus of 665 kPa and compressive stress of 342 kPa. Moreover, the inherent biocompatibility of the composite scaffold remained high. This work demonstrates the potential of nanofiber/hydrogel scaffolds, contributing to the development of safe and multifunctional materials for clinical application."

"Recent advancements in Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies have revolutionized genomic research, presenting unprecedented opportunities for personalized medicine and population genetics. However, issues such as data silos, privacy concerns, and regulatory challenges hinder large-scale data integration and collaboration. Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a transformative solution, enabling decentralized data analysis while preserving privacy and complying with regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This review explores the potential use of FL in genomics, detailing its methodology, including local model training, secure aggregation, and iterative improvement. Key challenges, such as heterogeneous data integration and cybersecurity risks, are examined alongside regulations like GDPR. In conclusion, successful implementations of FL in global and national initiatives demonstrate its scalability and role in supporting collaborative research. Finally, we discuss future directions, including AI integration and the necessity of education and training, to fully harness the potential of FL in advancing precision medicine and global health initiatives."
"Theoretical work suggests that reinforcement can cause the strengthening of prezygotic isolation in sympatry by mitigating the costs of maladaptive hybridization. However, only a handful of studies have simultaneously tested multiple predictions of this theory in natural populations. We investigated reinforcement in a mottled hybrid zone between the damselflies Ischnura elegans and Ischnura graellsii, which are characterized by incomplete and asymmetric reproductive isolation and exhibit reproductive character displacement in mating-related structures. We tested the conditions for reinforcement by quantifying whether hybridization was costly and prezygotic isolation stronger in sympatry compared with allopatry. Additionally, we investigated two specific predictions of reinforcement: (a) greater premating asymmetries in sympatry; and (b) weaker postzygotic isolation in sympatry than in allopatry. Our findings indicate the presence of maladaptive hybrids, which suggests Bateson-Dobzhansky-Müller incompatibilities in allopatry. We also found that reinforcement has strengthened mechanical isolation, at least in one direction in sympatry. We observed evidence for greater premating asymmetries in sympatry than in allopatry, which is consistent with reinforcement. However, fully testing the prediction of weaker postzygotic isolation in sympatry compared to allopatry was hindered by the highly asymmetrical levels of reproductive isolation between the two reciprocal cross directions. Our study highlights a case where reinforcement and heterospecific gene flow exert opposite effects on reproductive isolation between reciprocal crosses, where reinforcement increases reproductive isolation in one direction while gene flow weakens it in the opposite direction."
"Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are intricate compounds that pose significant challenges in bioanalytical characterization. Therefore, multiple bioanalytical methods are required to comprehensively elucidate their pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles. In this study, we investigated DS001, an ADC consisting of a humanized monoclonal antibody (hRS7), a cleavable chemical linker, and the microtubule inhibitor monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), with a drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) of 8. This study established a rapid and sensitive hybrid immunoaffinity liquid-chromatography-tandem-mass-spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) approach for the simultaneous quantification of the total antibody and the enzymatically cleavable conjugated payload of DS001. This method is capable of monitoring fluctuations in average DAR values during PK assessments. The sample preparation procedure involved immunocapture, denaturation, trypsin digestion, papain digestion, and termination, all completed within a total processing time of less than 4 h. The method demonstrated linearity for the total antibody in the range of 100 ng/mL (lower-limit-of-quantification, LLOQ) to 100,000 ng/mL, and for the conjugated payload from 3.495 ng/mL (LLOQ) to 3495 ng/mL in rat serum. Both analytes exhibited standard curve correlation coefficients (r) greater than 0.990 within their respective linear ranges. The precision and accuracy of the method were within ± 15% (± 20% for LLOQ). The verified LC-MS/MS approach was successfully employed in the PK analysis following intravenous administration of 0.2 mg/kg DS001 in rats via tail vein injection."

"Human muscle activity contains rich information that can reflect human movement patterns and conditions of diseases or physical abnormalities. Flexible pressure sensors enable the assessment of muscle tremors in Parkinson's disease (PD) through Force Myography (FMG). Here, an easily fabricated, ultra-sensitive, and stretchable piezoelectret pressure sensor is presented. Utilizing an effective integration of Kirigami structure and piezoelectret air gap, the sensor achieved a dynamic sensitivity of ≈725 pC/N (@5 Hz), measurement repeatability of <2.5%, measurement hysteresis of <1%, a pressure detection limit of <15 Pa, a response time of ≈2.5 ms, stable output within ±3% over 40 000 cycles, and output decay of <2.5% after 1000 cycles of complex deformation, meeting non-distorted measurement conditions up to 20 Hz. Successful monitoring and assessment of hand muscle tremors are demonstrated. Furthermore, using a 1×3 sensor array enabled tremor localization, achieving a high accuracy rate of 99.5% with machine learning algorithms. Additionally, the sensor facilitated the experimental quantification and assisted scoring of the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS), with an accuracy of ≈85%. The sensor demonstrates potential for assisting in the diagnosis and rehabilitation monitoring of Parkinson's disease."
"Multi-species tests in bioassays offer a holistic view of the ecosystem's response to toxicity, as different species display varying sensitivities to pollutants. This research aimed to assess the ability of toxicity tests' to distinguish contamination levels, examine site-specific effects, and investigate seasonal variability. Using a multispecies approach (Nannochloropsis oceanica, Artemia franciscana, and Arbacia nigra), bioassays evaluated marine water quality from Callao Bay in Peru across four sampling areas (Naval School: PA1, Peruvian Marine Institute: PA2, Callao Pier: PA3, and San Lorenzo Island: PA4). These species, with varying sizes and morphologies, are relevant to marine systems and ideal for multispecies toxicity testing, contributing to broader environmental impact discussions. To conduct toxicity bioassays, seasonal evaluations were performed in fall, winter, spring, and summer. Brine shrimp displayed seasonal variations in toxicity values, with notable mortality rates during winter. Nannochloropsis oceanica was the most sensitive species, showing moderate toxicity across seasons. Areas impacted by pollution sources, such as wastewater and maritime traffic, exhibited the highest toxicity levels (PA3 and PA4). These fluctuations underscore the need to consider seasonal and local conditions when assessing organism sensitivity to seawater contaminants. Additionally, they reveal the complex interplay between environmental factors, water quality, and organism responses in marine ecosystems."
"Mobility tasks like the Timed Up and Go test (TUG), cognitive TUG (cogTUG), and walking with turns provide insights into the impact of Parkinson's disease (PD) on motor control, balance, and cognitive function. We assess the test-retest reliability of these tasks in 262 PD participants and 50 controls by evaluating machine learning models based on wearable-sensor-derived measures and statistical metrics. This evaluation examines total duration, subtask duration, and other quantitative measures across two trials. We show that the diagnostic accuracy for distinguishing PD from controls decreases by a mean of 1.8% between the first and the second trial, suggesting that task repetition may not be necessary for accurate diagnosis. Although the total duration remains relatively consistent between trials (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.62 to 0.95), greater variability is seen in subtask duration and sensor-derived measures, reflected in machine learning performance and statistical differences. Our findings also show that this variability differs not only between controls and PD participants but also among groups with varying levels of PD severity, indicating the need to consider population characteristics. Relying solely on total task duration and conventional statistical metrics to gauge the reliability of mobility tasks may fail to reveal nuanced variations in movement."
"Ringworm is highly prevalent in our setting and is frequently observed in our routine clinical practice. Diagnostic confirmation depends on techniques that are not always accessible (PCR), with highly variable sensitivity depending on the observer (direct microscopy) or delayed results (culture, histopathology). Recently, an immunochromatography-based rapid test (Diafactory®) for the antigenic detection of dermatophytes has been developed. This diagnostic tool can help diagnose ringworm, allowing early initiation of treatment and fewer consultation visits."
"Highly spatiotemporal-resolved photomodulation demonstrates promise for investigating key biological events in vivo and in vitro, such as cell signaling pathways, neuromodulation, and tumor treatment without side effects. However, enhancing the performance of photomodulation tools remains challenging due to the limitations of the physicochemical properties of the photoactive molecules. Here, a compact, stable intramolecular π-π stacking conformation forming between the target molecule (naproxen) and the perylene-based photoremovable protecting group is discovered to confine the motion of the photolabile bond and then enhance the photocleavage quantum yield. In conjunction with a red-absorbing photosensitizer, the photocleavage wavelength is extended to the red region via triplet-triplet annihilation. In particular, the triplet lifetime of the prodrug can be extended via the linked steric hindrance to improve the conversion yield via TTA. Using the new photomodulation tool, it is precisely photoreleased cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors for tumor vascular growth suppression in vivo. In combination with cisplatin, over 90% efficient inhibition of malignant breast tumors is observed via the synergistic tumor treatment strategy. These findings provide a new concept for the rational design of efficient photocleavage and have implications for photomodulating cell signaling pathways in tumor therapy, as well as laying a solid foundation for the development of phototherapeutic approaches."
"Exosomes are a member of extracellular vesicles. However, their biological characteristics differ from those of other vesicles, and recently, their powerful functions as information molecules, biomarkers, and carriers have been demonstrated. Malignancies are the leading cause of high morbidity and mortality worldwide. The cure rate of malignancies can be improved by improving early screening rates and therapy. Moreover, a close correlation between exosomes and malignancies has been observed. An in-depth study of exosomes can provide new methods for diagnosing and treating tumors. Therefore, this study aimed to review, sort, and summarize such achievements, and present ideas and opinions on the application of exosomes in tumor treatment."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic and progressive interstitial lung disease with limited therapeutic options. In this study, we identified Complement Factor H (CFH) as a critical regulator in the pathogenesis of IPF, contributing to fibrotic progression through autocrine regulation of complement component C3 and suppression of macrophage phagocytosis. Transcriptomic analysis of IPF lung tissues revealed upregulation of CFH and enrichment of pro-fibrotic pathways, including M2 macrophage infiltration. Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) and machine learning further validated CFH as a key gene associated with macrophage polarization and fibrotic remodeling. Functional studies demonstrated that CFH deficiency in mouse models attenuated bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, as evidenced by reduced collagen deposition, improved lung function, and decreased macrophage infiltration. Mechanistically, CFH deficiency enhanced macrophage efferocytosis and autophagy, reducing macrophage-mediated inflammation and fibrosis. Moreover, siRNA-loaded liposomes targeting CFH mitigated pulmonary fibrosis in vivo, further supporting the therapeutic potential of CFH modulation. These findings highlight CFH as a promising therapeutic target for IPF and underscore the importance of complement regulation in macrophage-driven fibrosis."
"Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is one of the most important food crops globally and is especially vulnerable to heat stress. However, substantial knowledge gaps remain in our understanding of the developmental mechanisms associated with tuber responses to heat stress. This study used whole-plant physiology, transcriptomics, and phytohormone profiling to elucidate how heat stress affects potato tuber development. When plants were grown in projected future elevated temperature conditions, abscisic acid (ABA) levels decreased in leaf and tuber tissues, whereas rates of leaf carbon assimilation and stomatal conductance were not significantly affected compared to those plants grown in historical temperature conditions. While plants grown in projected future elevated temperature conditions initiated more tubers per plant on average, there was a 66% decrease in mature tubers at the final harvest compared to those plants grown in historical temperature conditions. We hypothesize that reduced tuber yields at elevated temperatures are not due to reduced tuber initiation, but due to impaired tuber filling. Transcriptomic analysis detected significant changes in the expression of genes related to ABA response, heat stress, and starch biosynthesis. The tuberization repressor genes SELF-PRUNING 5G (StSP5G) and CONSTANS-LIKE1 (StCOL1) were differentially expressed in tubers grown in elevated temperatures. Two additional known tuberization genes, IDENTITY OF TUBER 1 (StIT1) and TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION 1 (StTOC1), displayed distinct expression patterns under elevated temperatures compared to historical temperature conditions but were not differentially expressed. This work highlights potential gene targets and key developmental stages associated with tuberization to develop potatoes with greater heat tolerance."

"Soybeans are a critical crop that provides both protein and oil. In response to environmental stresses, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MPKs) play a key role in transmitting stress signals to the nucleus to initiate stress-responsive actions. Drought stress reduces plant development and productivity but the specific MPK responsible for drought stress responses has not been previously identified. In this study, we demonstrate that GmMPK6, a soybean MPK, responds to drought stress and enhances drought tolerance. GmMPK6 is activated in drought conditions through post-translational modifications. Inhibition of GmMPK6 activity leads to reduced drought resistance and a decrease in GmRD19A expression. Additionally, GmMPK6 activation is modulated by calcium signaling, highlighting GmMPK6 as a positive regulator of drought stress resistance in soybean. This study presents the first report of an MPK conferring drought tolerance in soybean."
"The long-term hypercortisolemia of Cushing disease (CD) may lead to hemodynamic disorders by increasing subclinical cardiac and vascular dysfunction. The purpose of this observational cohort study was to assess the relationship between hemodynamic parameters evaluated via impedance cardiography (ICG) and echocardiographic parameters reflecting left ventricular function in 54 patients newly diagnosed with CD. The parameters assessed via ICG included stroke volume index (SI), cardiac index (CI), acceleration index (ACI), velocity index (VI), systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI), total artery compliance index (TACI). The echocardiographic parameters included left ventricular mass index (LVMI) and left ventricular systolic and diastolic parameters. Higher LVMI values were associated with lower SI (p = 0.003), CI (p = 0.001), VI (p = 0.048), TACI (p < 0.001), and with higher SVRI (p < 0.001). Poorer parameters of left ventricular diastolic function corresponded to the parameters assessed via ICG: (1) lower ratio E/A was associated with lower SI (p = 0.002), VI (p = 0.001), ACI (p = 0.01), TACI (p = 0.001); (2) lower average e' was associated with lower SI (p = 0.017), CI (p = 0.009), VI (p = 0.004), TACI (p = 0.001), and with higher SVRI (p = 0.002); (3) higher ratio E/e' corresponded to lower TACI (p = 0.01). Decreased global longitudinal strain corresponded to lower TACI (p = 0.046). CD is associated with impaired pumping function of the heart and higher afterload."
"Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most common B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma rarely presents with circulating lymphoma cells (CL) at diagnosis. Previous studies were limited by small sample size precluding robust analysis. Hence, we evaluated the prognostic relevance of CL cells in newly diagnosed DLBCL patients. Based on peripheral blood (PB) immunophenotyping, patients were grouped into CL + and CL-. CL was defined as detectable clonally restricted B-cells that matched the actual or expected B-cell immunophenotype of DLBCL. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), and secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS) and diagnosis-to-treatment interval (DTI). Among the 1266 patients with DLBCL, 621 had PB flow at diagnosis, and after excluding patients not meeting eligibility criteria, 588 cases remained. Among these, 85 (15%) were CL + and 503 were CL- (85%). Patients in CL + group were younger (67 vs. 70 years, p = 0.03) with a higher proportion of non-bulky disease (85% vs. 56%, p < 0.0001), normal albumin (79% vs. 54%, p < 0.0001), and MYC/BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements (18% vs. 7%, p = 0.003) compared to the CL - group. Patients with CL at diagnosis had significantly inferior PFS and OS compared with those without CL. After adjusting for factors associated with inferior PFS and OS in univariable analysis, presence of CL remained significantly associated with inferior PFS (HR = 2.04, 95%CI = 1.47-2.84, p < 0.0001) and OS (HR = 1.61, 95%CI = 1.1-2.36, p = 0.01), respectively. There was no significant difference in DTI between the two groups. Given the prognostic relevance associated with presence of CL, clinicians should consider checking PB flow at diagnosis in all newly diagnosed DLBCL patients."
"The complex dynamics of protein expression in plasma during hyperacute HIV-1 infection and its relation to acute retroviral syndrome, viral control, and disease progression are largely unknown. Here, we quantify 1293 blood plasma proteins from 157 longitudinally linked plasma samples collected before, during, and after hyperacute HIV-1 infection of 54 participants from four sub-Saharan African countries. Six distinct longitudinal expression profiles are identified, of which four demonstrate a consistent decrease in protein levels following HIV-1 infection. Proteins involved in inflammatory responses, immune regulation, and cell motility are significantly altered during the transition from pre-infection to one month post-infection. Specifically, decreased ZYX and SCGB1A1 levels, and increased LILRA3 levels are associated with increased risk of acute retroviral syndrome; increased NAPA and RAN levels, and decreased ITIH4 levels with viral control; and increased HPN, PRKCB, and ITGB3 levels with increased risk of disease progression. Overall, this study provides insight into early host responses in hyperacute HIV-1 infection, and present potential biomarkers and mechanisms linked to HIV-1 disease progression and viral load."
"Biomechanical analysis of gait encompasses the measurement of spatiotemporal (STVs), kinematics, and kinetics variables.

It emphasizes the potential of using genetically modified plants for its production, describing the primary plant species involved in these processes and the most common genetic modifications. Additionally, the paper explores the potential applications of biobased polymers, highlighting their key advantages and disadvantages in specific context."
"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is one of the most prevalent skin diseases, but there are numerous knowledge gaps surrounding the impact this disease has on quality of life (QoL), mental health, and out-of-pocket expenses involved in the management of AD. The available scientific evidence on the multidimensional burden of AD is usually based on studies with measures reported by patients themselves."
"The impact of resource allocation on the dynamics of epidemic spreading is an important topic. In real-life scenarios, individuals usually prioritize their own safety, and this self-protection consciousness will lead to delays in resource allocation. However, there is a lack of systematic research on the impact of resource allocation delay on epidemic spreading. To this end, a coupled model for resource allocation and epidemic spreading is proposed, which considers both the allocation decisions and delay behavior of individuals with limited resources. Through theoretical analysis, the influence mechanism of resource allocation delay on epidemic spreading is deduced, and the relationship among epidemic threshold, delay time, and the fraction of cautious individuals is obtained, and finally, the stability of the solution under different conditions is proven. Furthermore, the dynamic characteristics of epidemic spreading under the influence of the two factors are systematically studied by combining numerical simulation and theoretical analysis. The results show that the impact of delay behavior exhibits nonlinear characteristics, namely, appropriate delay can enhance control effectiveness, while excessive delay results in insufficient resource allocation and consequently increases infection risk. Particularly, an optimal delay that maximizes the epidemic threshold is identified. In addition, an increase in the proportion of cautious individuals can significantly increase the epidemic threshold, but an excessively high proportion can severely constrain resource allocation, which reduces the control effectiveness. The results of this study provide scientific evidence for developing more effective epidemic control strategies, particularly in optimizing resource allocation and improving control outcomes."
"Amoebic liver abscess (ALA) is a significant public health concern in tropical countries. Traditional diagnostic methods, such as microscopy, have low sensitivity, and nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR) has lengthy turnaround times. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) assay for detecting Entamoeba histolytica in amoebic liver pus samples. The assay was tested on 150 clinical pus samples collected from suspected ALA patients in the emergency department of a tertiary care center located in Chandigarh, northern India. For comparison with RPA, nPCR was also performed on these samples. Of 150 samples, 79 (53%) tested positive for E. histolytica using the RPA assay, and similar (79; 53%) number of samples tested positive with nested PCR. In addition, sequences obtained through Sanger sequencing showed high similarity with other sequences in the National Center for Biotechnology Information database and were submitted to the database. Our findings highlight the potential of RPA as a valuable tool for the accurate diagnosis of ALA."
"N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation plays a key role in tumor progression. However, the significance of methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3) in biological processes of soft tissue sarcoma (STS) patients, and the relationship between METTL3 and STS are unclear."
"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease with complex clinical manifestations and no current cure. Alternative splicing (AS) plays a key role in SLE by regulating immune-related genes, but its genome-wide regulatory mechanisms remain unclear. To investigate the involvement of abnormal splicing regulators and AS events in the immune regulation of SLE. Transcriptome data from the SLE dataset GSE162828 were analyzed for differential gene expression and AS events using bioinformatics tools. Immune infiltration analysis was conducted with CIBERSORT, and co-expression of key splicing factors (SFs) and AS events was assessed using SUVA software. A total of 5144 differentially expressed genes and 73 SFs were identified. Significant immune cell differences were observed between SLE and controls, highlighting SFs such as HNRNPDL, RBM47, TIA1, SSB, and DHX15. Eighty-three AS events were identified, with IRF9 and PTPRC emerging as key regulatory events linked to SLE. Dysregulated SFs influence AS in immune-related genes, affecting immune cell composition and SLE progression. These findings offer potential new therapeutic targets for modulating the immune microenvironment in SLE."

"Worldwide, attempted suicide and suicide death are one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality. Women in South-East Asia are especially vulnerable, as almost 50% of all global female suicides occur in the 11 countries of the WHO South-East Asia Region. This scoping literature analysis aimed to identify and analyze the predictors or risk factors for attempted suicide and suicide death among South-East Asian women. A scoping literature review was conducted. Five databases-PubMed, MEDLINE, EBSCOhost, PsycINFO, and EMBASE-were searched. Forty studies and twelve literature reviews were eligible for inclusion. Women in South-East Asia, particularly those who are young and married, living in poverty, with low or no education, living in rural areas, with no employment outside the home, with lower socioeconomic position, and living within joint families are highly vulnerable to suicidality. This review identified gender disadvantage, infertility, domestic abuse, intimate partner violence, family conflicts, husband's alcohol misuse, child marriage, forced marriages, and dowry disputes as the most significant predictors of attempted suicide and suicide death among South-East Asian women. A better understanding of the phenomenon is essential to develop effective gender-specific and culturally appropriate suicide prevention strategies or interventions."
"The emergence of β-lactamase-producing bacteria has led to the use of β-lactam (BL) antibiotic and β-lactamase inhibitor (BLI) drug combinations. Despite therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) being endorsed for BLs, the impact of TDM on BLIs remains unclear."
"Myocardial infarction (MI) remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide, posing a significant challenge to healthcare systems. The limited regenerative capacity of cardiac tissue following MI results in chronic cardiac dysfunction, highlighting the urgent need for innovative therapeutic strategies. In this study, we explored the application of a multidimensional nanofibrous hydrogel for myocardial regeneration. We developed a composite hydrogel system by integrating fibrin, polycaprolactone (PCL), and alginate. In this system, fibrin supported cell proliferation and significantly enhanced angiogenesis when combined with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). PCL contributed to the alignment of encapsulated cells, improving their organization within the scaffold. Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) were encapsulated within the hydrogel for their versatile regenerative potential, while C2C12 cells were incorporated for their ability to form muscle tissue. Additionally, the inclusion of alginate not only enhanced the mechanical properties of the hydrogel to better match the biomechanical demands of cardiac tissue but also played a critical role in reducing the immune response, thereby improving the system's biocompatibility. This study presents an advanced platform for myocardial regeneration using a nanofibrous hydrogel system designed to meet the dual requirements of mechanical robustness and cellular compatibility essential for cardiac tissue engineering. The triculture system, consisting of ADSCs, C2C12 cells, and HUVECs, harnesses the regenerative capabilities of each cell type, promoting both angiogenesis and tissue regeneration. This comprehensive approach addresses the immediate needs for cellular survival and integration while effectively overcoming long-term mechanical and immunological challenges."

"The tumor suppressor p53 regulates metabolic homeostasis. Recently, Tsaousidou et al. reported that selective activation of p53 via downregulation of Tudor interacting repair regulator (TIRR) confers protection against cancer despite obesity and insulin resistance, providing new insights into the role of p53 at the intersection of oncogenesis and systemic metabolism."
"Carcinoid heart disease is an important complication of neuroendocrine tumors that may lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Right-sided heart valve involvement with consequent valve dysfunction is one of the common manifestations. Patients often have multiple, significant comorbidities with advanced metastatic disease and, as such, may not be suitable for surgical valve replacement due to excessive risk. Transcatheter valve replacement using balloon-expandable valves has been the mainstay of management for these patients, particularly with stenotic lesions but there is limited experience in patients with pulmonary regurgitation and dilated pulmonary arteries outside the dimensions that would be suitable for these valves. We report three successful cases of percutaneous pulmonary valve implantation with the VenusP-valve, a large self-expanding valve platform, and highlight the technical aspects and challenges specific to treatment of pulmonary regurgitation in patients with carcinoid heart disease. Percutaneous pulmonary valve implantation, using the VenusP-valve, may be considered an effective treatment in this patient group."
"Canonical autophagy captures within specialized double-membrane organelles, termed autophagosomes, an array of cytoplasmic components destined for lysosomal degradation. An autophagosome is completed when the growing phagophore undergoes ESCRT-dependent membrane closure, a prerequisite for its subsequent fusion with endolysosomal organelles and degradation of the sequestered cargo. ATG9A, a key integral membrane protein of the autophagy pathway, is best known for its role in the formation and expansion of phagophores. Here, we report a hitherto unappreciated function of mammalian ATG9A in directing autophagosome closure. ATG9A partners with IQGAP1 and key ESCRT-III component CHMP2A to facilitate this final stage in autophagosome formation. Thus, ATG9A is a central hub governing all major aspects of autophagosome membrane biogenesis, from phagophore formation to its closure, and is a unique ATG factor with progressive functionalities affecting the physiological outputs of autophagy."
"Macroautophagy deploys a wealth of autophagy-related proteins to synthesize the double-membrane autophagosome, in order to engulf cytosolic components for lysosome-dependent degradation. The recruitment of the ATG12~ATG5-ATG16L1 complex by WIPI family proteins is a crucial step in autophagosome formation. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanism by which WIPI3 facilitates the recruitment of the ATG12~ATG5-ATG16L1 complex remains largely unknown. Here, we uncover that WIPI3 can directly interact with the coiled-coil domain of ATG16L1. By determining the crystal structure of WIPI3 in complex with ATG16L1 coiled-coil, we elucidate the molecular basis underpinning the specific recruitment of the ATG12~ATG5-ATG16L1 complex by WIPI3. Moreover, we demonstrate that WIPI2 and WIPI3 are competitive for interacting with ATG16L1 coiled-coil, and ATG16L1 and ATG2 are mutually exclusive in binding to WIPI3. In all, our findings provide mechanistic insights into the WIPI3/ATG16L1 interaction, and are valuable for further understanding the activation mechanism of the ATG12~ATG5-ATG16L1 complex as well as the working mode of WIPI3 in autophagy."
"Maintaining the dynamic structure of chromatin is critical for regulating the cellular processes that require access to the DNA template, such as DNA damage repair, transcription, and replication. Histone chaperones and ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factors facilitate transitions in chromatin structure by assembling and positioning nucleosomes through a variety of enzymatic activities. SMARCAD1 is a unique chromatin remodeler that combines the ATP-dependent ability to exchange histones, with the chaperone-like activity of nucleosome deposition. We have shown previously that phosphorylated SMARCAD1 exhibits reduced binding to nucleosomes. However, it is unknown how phosphorylation affects SMARCAD1's ability to perform its various enzymatic activities. Here we use mutational analysis, activity assays, and mass spectrometry, to probe SMARCAD1 regulation and to investigate the role of its flexible N-terminal region. We show that phosphorylation affects SMARCAD1 binding to nucleosomes, DNA, and histones H2A-H2B, as well as ATP hydrolysis and histone exchange. Conversely, we report only a marginal effect of phosphorylation for histone H3-H4 binding and nucleosome assembly. In addition, the SMARCAD1 N-terminal region is revealed to be critical for nucleosome assembly and histone exchange. Together, this work examines the intricacies of how phosphorylation governs SMARCAD1 activity and provides insight into its complex regulation and diverse activities."
"Lipid serve as a crucial energy source during prolonged endurance exercise, and whey protein isolate (WPI) is commonly applied in food emulsions to modulate lipid digestibility. Herein, we prepared WPI short fibrils, <400 nm in length, to stabilize emulsion and increase lipid digestion and absorption rates. Specifically, a 2 % (w/v) WPI solution was adjusted to pH 2 and heated at 90 °C for 6 h to produce long fibrils, followed by 168 h of shear force treatment to obtain short fibrils. Compared to native WPI and long fibrils, short fibrils exhibited smaller molecular weight and higher surface hydrophobicity. Both short and long fibrils showed no cytotoxic effects on BRL and HEK-293 cells. Emulsions stabilized by short fibrils displayed excellent emulsifying capacity and stability, along with favorable dispersion during in vitro digestion. Importantly, the short fibrils emulsion improved in vitro digestion rate of lipids and promoted the rapid lipid absorption in vivo. These findings suggest that modifying protein fibrils around oil droplets can modulate lipid digestibility, with short fibrils offering potential to improve lipid absorption in functional foods tailored for personalized nutrition in extreme endurance exercise."
"Currently, optimal treatment strategy for resectable primary small cell carcinoma of the esophagus (PSmCCE) remains controversial. To address this, we conducted a multicenter study to evaluate treatment patterns and long-term survival of PSmCCE patients who underwent radical resection."
"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations like the common L858R and exon 19 deletions are well studied, but rarer mutations like exon 19 insertions have received less attention. This case report describes a patient with this uncommon EGFR exon 19 insertion mutation in metastatic lung adenocarcinoma. A 51-year-old male nonsmoker with metastatic lung adenocarcinoma and a rare EGFR exon 19 insertion mutation experienced disease progression on initial carboplatin-pemetrexed chemotherapy. However, treatment with the second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor afatinib led to a partial response, with significant regression of the primary tumor and bone metastases. This case highlights the favorable clinical response to afatinib treatment in a patient with metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer harboring a rare EGFR exon 19 insertion mutation."
"In this study, we clarified that the cBAF subcomplex is deficient in the SWI/SNF complex, resulting in dependency on the CBP/p300 paralog pair. Simultaneous inhibitors of the CBP/p300 paralog pair show promise for cBAF-deficient lung cancer, as well as rare cancers such as malignant rhabdoid tumors, epithelioid sarcomas, and synovial sarcomas."
"Kidney Stone Disease (KSD) is a prevalent urological condition, while abdominal obesity is on the rise globally. The conicity index, measuring body fat distribution, is crucial but under-researched in its relation to KSD and all-cause mortality. This study, using data from 59,842 participants in the NHANES (2007-2018), calculated the conicity index from waist circumference, height, and weight. Logistic regression and Cox models revealed a significant positive correlation: each 0.1 unit increase in the conicity index was linked to a 23% rise in KSD odds (OR: 1.23, 95% CI: 1.14, 1.35) and higher predictive ability compared to traditional measures (AUC = 0.619). In KSD patients, this increase corresponded to a 44% higher risk of all-cause mortality (HR: 1.44, 95% CI: 1.14, 1.82), and in non-KSD patients, a 53% increase (HR: 1.53, 95% CI: 1.37, 1.70). Serum albumin and Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW) partially mediated these relationships. Addressing central obesity could significantly lower the risks of KSD and mortality."
"The healthcare sector faces a growing threat from the rise of highly resistant microorganisms, particularly Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDR P. aeruginosa). Facing the challenge of antibiotic resistance, nanoparticles have surfaced as promising substitutes for antimicrobial therapy. Recent studies showcase the effectiveness of various fungi species in nanoparticle synthesis. Mycosynthesized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) using Aspergillus carneus MAK 259 has been investigated and demonstrate antibacterial, antibiofilm and synergistic activities against (MRSA) and (MDR P. aeruginosa)."
"Studying the microbial communities within the gastrointestinal tract of vertebrate species can provide insights into biodiversity, disease ecology, and conservation. Currently, we have very limited understanding of the composition of endogenous microbiota in wildlife, particularly in high biodiversity tropical areas. Knowledge is limited by the logistical and ethical challenges of obtaining samples for free-living animals. Roadkill carcasses offer a largely untapped source for biological material, including endogenous gut microbiota. These animals that have died on roads due to collisions with vehicles are suitable for accessible, opportunistic sampling. Here, we used metabarcoding for the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene in gut samples of nine roadkill samples collected from a road in Ecuador representing two vertebrate species: the speckled worm lizard (Amphisbaena bassleri) and the smooth-billed ani (Crotophaga ani). We successfully identify microbial phyla in both samples including Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria for A. bassleri, and Firmicutes and Actinobacteria for C. ani. Our study provides the first description of the gut microbiota for these two vertebrates, and demonstrates the feasibility of studying endogenous microbial communities from roadkill material that can be opportunistically collected and preserved in biobanks."
"The identification of genital injuries during a medical-forensic examination may impact the investigation and prosecution of sexual assault. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to compare prevalence of genital lacerations (or tears) in persons reporting consensual versus non-consensual vaginal penetration. We hypothesized there would be greater prevalence of genital injuries in the non-consensual group. We searched PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, and gray literature for relevant observational case-control studies. Relative risk (RR) ratios using Mantel-Haenszel method were calculated to compare prevalence of genital lacerations between patients reporting consensual versus non-consensual penetration. Mantel-Haenszel chi-square tested significance and Cochran's Q determined between-study heterogeneity. In all studies, genital injuries were observed in both groups. The overall RR of 1.26 indicated a 26% greater risk of genital lacerations in the non-consensual group compared to the consensual group (p = 0.003). Study heterogeneity was 54% (p = 0.05). Findings suggest a greater likelihood of observing genital lacerations in persons reporting non-consensual vaginal penetration. High heterogeneity reflects variations between studies regarding provider education and training, visualization techniques, patient characteristics, time between assault and examination, and documentation practices. A major limitation is the lack of observer blinding creating potential bias. Findings support the need to standardize genital visualization techniques and documentation in sexual assault medical forensic examinations. Healthcare providers conducting medical forensic examinations must understand the limitations of studies comparing non-consensual and consensual injury findings if asked to provide information or testimony on this topic."
"Regulatory T cell (Tregs) predominantly maintain the immune balance and prevent autoimmunity via their immunosuppressive functions. However, tumor-infiltrating Tregs (TI-Tregs) may mediate tumor immune tolerance in complex tumor microenvironments, resulting in poor prognosis. Distinguishing specific TI-Treg subpopulations from peripheral Tregs and intratumoral conventional T cells (Tconvs) has recently emerged as an important topic in antitumor therapy. In this review, we summarize novel therapeutic approaches targeting both the metabolic pathways and hallmarks of TI-Tregs in preclinical and clinical studies. Although the phenotypic and functional diversity of TI-Tregs remains unclear, our review provides new insights into TI-Treg-based therapies and facilitates precision medicine for tumor treatment."

"Under the current Medicare Advantage (MA) risk-adjustment system, plans are incentivized to report diagnosis codes on enrollees' medical claims reflecting additional and more severe health conditions to increase enrollees' risk scores and corresponding plan payments. To improve the integrity of risk adjustment, researchers have proposed four alternative methods to construct risk scores: calculate Hierarchical Condition Categories (HCC) scores excluding diagnosis codes from health risk assessments and chart reviews, calculate HCC scores excluding diagnosis codes most subject to score inflation, use pharmaceutical claims alone, and use self-reported survey responses alone or in combination with diagnosis codes. Using 2016-19 medical and pharmaceutical claims linked to Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems survey responses from 151,432 MA enrollees, we compared the predictive accuracy of each alternative strategy with the standard HCC approach. Relative to the standard HCC model, models combining HCC scores with survey responses were more predictive of health care use, explaining 5.8-6.0 percent of individual variation in total price-standardized MA utilization, compared with 5.1 percent. These findings suggest that survey responses can be used in tandem with diagnosis codes to strengthen MA risk adjustment."

"Oral reading fluency (ORF) assessments are commonly used to screen at-risk readers and evaluate interventions' effectiveness as curriculum-based measurements. Similar to the standard practice in item response theory (IRT), calibrated passage parameter estimates are currently used as if they were population values in model-based ORF scoring. However, calibration errors that are unaccounted for may bias ORF score estimates and, in particular, lead to underestimated standard errors (SEs) of ORF scores. Therefore, we consider an approach that incorporates the calibration errors in latent variable scores. We further derive the SEs of ORF scores based on the delta method to incorporate the calibration uncertainty. We conduct a simulation study to evaluate the recovery of point estimates and SEs of latent variable scores and ORF scores in various simulated conditions. Results suggest that ignoring calibration errors leads to underestimated latent variable score SEs and ORF score SEs, especially when the calibration sample is small."

"The rapid urbanization has led to the loss of natural spaces and a subsequent disconnection between humans and nature, negatively affecting residents' well-being and environmental awareness. There is a a growing interest in leveraging technology to address this gap in Human-Computer Interaction. This article introduces GoChirp, an AI-powered wearable device for enhancing nature relatedness within urban landscapes. By utilizing machine learning algorithms, GoChirp recognizes bird sounds in the environment and provides haptic feedback that mimics the bird flapping, directing users' attention to avian life and fostering a heightened awareness and connection to nature. To evaluate GoChirp, we conducted a week-long field study with 36 urban participants divided into two groups: an experimental group using GoChirp and a control group using a dummy device. We used pre- and post-study questionnaires to assess changes in participants' nature relatedness. Additional questionnaires and semi-structured interviews were employed to evaluate the device's usability and user experience. The results suggest that AI-powered wearables like GoChirp, have the potential to augment individual's sensory and cognitive capabilities, enabling a deeper connection with the natural environment. This could further enhance users' well-being and potentially foster a greater sense of responsibility towards the natural environment, leading to mutual benefits between humans and nature."
"Small cell neuroendocrine cervical carcinoma is a highly aggressive tumor characterized by early metastasis, a high recurrence rate, and poor prognosis. This study represents the first instance of single-cell sequencing conducted on small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the cervix worldwide. Analysis of gene expression regulatory networks revealed that the transcription factor TFF3 drived up-regulation of ELF3. Furthermore, our findings indicated that the neuroendocrine marker genes and gene regulatory networks associated with small cell neuroendocrine cervical carcinoma differed from those observed in lung, small intestine, and liver neuroendocrine carcinoma within the GEO database, suggesting tissue-specific origins for these malignancies. Overall, this study addresses a significant research in understanding small cell neuroendocrine cervical carcinoma in vivo and provides valuable insights for guiding radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy."
"Gender-affirming care is a highly politicized topic in the United States. Trans+ individuals do not control the narratives about their access to care, quality of life, and decision-making. Trans+ people are othered, marginalized, and abused by medical systems. The author of this poem accessed life-changing, gender-affirming care partly due to educational, racial, and geographic privilege. In 2023, 220 (and counting) state legislative bills targeting trans and non-binary people were filed. Many of these bills target transgender youth, but some states have even considered limiting adult care. Gender-expansive people face misinformation, microaggressions, and ridicule due to oppressive political narratives. From the family of origin to Twitter, trans people have to make themselves palatable. Even in the best situations, trans+ people face well-intentioned healthcare providers' intrusions, ignorance, or infantilization. Allies who have not unpacked their transphobia may cause harm, even in seemingly innocuous interactions. Public health can benefit from the irreverence of gender euphoria. This poem is me living a vibrant, queer life in academia and at my family's kitchen table, resisting moral panic one stanza at a time. To view the original version of this poem, see the supplemental material section of this article online."
"The Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Liviidae), is a major pest of global citriculture. In the Americas and in Asia, D. citri vectors the phloem-limited bacterium, Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (CLas), which causes the fatal citrus disease huanglongbing, or citrus greening. Cell lines derived from D. citri can provide insight into both the basic biology of this pest and D. citri-associated pathogens including CLas. We previously identified CLG#2 as the optimal medium for long-term growth of D. citri primary cell cultures. Here we report on the establishment and characterization of three continuous D. citri cell lines, Dici1, Dici3, and Dici5, that have been passaged for > 40 times. Based on morphological and transcriptomic data, the Dici1 and Dici3 cell lines include undifferentiated and neurogenic progenitor cells. Dici1 and Dici5 are infected with Wolbachia. Both Dici1 and Dici5 are infected with D. citri reovirus, and Dici5 is also infected with D. citri-associated C virus. Dici3 is free of both Wolbachia and virus infection. These cell lines provide an ideal platform for the study of inter-microbial relationships as well as microbe interaction with host insect cells."
"Various Indigenous communities in Mexico establish their regulatory system according to their customs and traditions. In Chiapas, 27% of the population is Indigenous and has a high adolescent fertility rate. This study analyzes how customs and traditions influence unions and early pregnancies in specific contexts of rural and Indigenous communities. A descriptive qualitative research was conducted by means of semi-structured interviews with key informants who interact directly with the adolescent population. An inductive process determined analytical categories and emerging codes, forming matrices by type of informant. We interviewed 45 people (16 school staff members, 15 healthcare professionals and 14 civil society organizations leaders). The customs and traditions that characterizes these communities are linked to a traditional perception of gender relations, leading to the acceptance and promotion of unions and pregnancies at an early age. The analysis identified three situations that encourage early unions and pregnancy: clandestine dating and voluntary cohabitation without parental approval; clandestine dating and forced marital union/cohabitation agreed upon by the parents; structural and sexual violence (sale, exchange of daughters for merchandise or animals and/or rape). Adolescent pregnancy prevention strategies must address both the individual and the social and cultural context for a successful implementation."
Computer vision and artificial intelligence (AI) offer the opportunity to rapidly and accurately interpret standardized x-rays.

"There is a complex association between postoperative pain and postoperative delirium, which highlights the need for a more balanced approach to pain management that considers various risk factors. We emphasise the importance of comprehensive documentation and standardised monitoring to improve detection and management of postoperative delirium, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes. We advocate for a precision anaesthesia approach, which tailors care to individual patient profiles, as a potential solution to address these challenges."
"Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is a rare complication of ear, nose and throat (ENT) infections. Although recent guidelines recommend the systematic use of anti-coagulation therapy (ACT) in the treatment of these CVT, literature data are scarce. The present study's objective was to determine the value of ACT in achieving recanalisation after thrombosis and its effect on patient outcomes."
"This study aimed to introduce a modified Byars staged procedure and investigate its application value in patients with severe hypospadias. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of patients with severe hypospadias admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University (Guangzhou, China) between October 2012 and October 2022. In total, 31 patients underwent the conventional Byars procedure (conventional group), and 45 patients underwent the modified Byars staged procedure (modified group). Our modified strategy was built upon the standard Byars procedure by incorporating glansplasty during the first stage and employing a Y-shaped flap in conjunction with a glandular tunnel for urethroplasty during the second stage. Notably, there were no statistically significant differences in the preoperative baseline characteristics, duration of surgery, amount of blood loss, or occurrence of postoperative complications, including urethral fistula, stricture and diverticulum, or penile curvature, between the conventional and modified groups. However, there was a significantly lower incidence of coronal sulcus fistula (0 vs 16.1%, P = 0.02) and glans dehiscence (0 vs 12.9%, P = 0.02) in the surgical group than that in the conventional group. In addition, the modified group exhibited a notably greater rate of normotopic urethral opening (100.0% vs 83.9%, P = 0.01) and a higher mean score on the Hypospadias Objective Penile Evaluation (HOPE; mean ± standard error of mean: 8.6 ± 0.2 vs 7.9 ± 0.3, P = 0.02) than did the conventional group. In conclusion, the modified Byars staged procedure significantly reduced the risks of glans dehiscence and coronal sulcus fistula. Consequently, it offers a promising approach for achieving favorable penile esthetics, thereby providing a reliable therapeutic option for severe hypospadias."
The Health Literacy Questionnaire (HLQ) is an increasingly used health literacy instrument that has been translated into many languages.

"Cerebrovascular accidents are known as a great cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Although there are known risk factors for ischemic stroke, the cases that cannot be justified with these risk factors are increasing. Toxic metals as a potential risk factor for other diseases in humans are assessed in this study in the CVA group and compared to controls."
"Older adults are vulnerable to glucocorticoid-induced muscle atrophy and weakness, with sex potentially influencing their susceptibility to those effects. Aerobic exercise can reduce glucocorticoid-induced muscle atrophy in young rodents. However, it is unknown whether aerobic exercise can prevent glucocorticoid myopathy in aged muscle. The objectives of this study were to define the extent to which sex influences the development of glucocorticoid myopathy in aged muscle, and to determine the extent to which aerobic exercise training protects against myopathy development. Twenty-four-month-old female (n = 30) and male (n = 33) mice were randomized to either sedentary or aerobic exercise groups. Within their respective groups, mice were randomized to either daily treatment with dexamethasone (DEX) or saline. Upon completing treatments, the contractile properties of the triceps surae complex were assessed in situ. DEX marginally lowered muscle mass and soluble protein content in both sexes, which was attenuated by aerobic exercise only in females. DEX increased sub-tetanic force and rate of force development only in females, which was not influenced by aerobic exercise. Muscle fatigue was higher in both sexes following DEX, but aerobic exercise prevented fatigue induction only in females. The sex-specific differences to muscle function in response to DEX treatment coincided with sex-specific changes to the content of proteins related to calcium handling, mitochondrial quality control, reactive oxygen species production, and glucocorticoid receptor in muscle. These findings define several important sexually dimorphic changes to aged skeletal muscle physiology in response to glucocorticoid treatment and define the capacity of short-term aerobic exercise to protect against those changes. KEY POINTS: There are sexually dimorphic effects of glucocorticoids on aged skeletal muscle physiology. Glucocorticoid-induced changes to aged muscle contractile properties coincide with sex-specific differences in the content of calcium handling proteins. Aerobic exercise prevents glucocorticoid-induced fatigue only in aged females and coincides with differences in the content of mitochondrial quality control proteins and glucocorticoid receptors."
"Protein phosphorylation signaling networks have a central role in how cells sense and respond to their environment. We engineered artificial phosphorylation networks in which reversible enzymatic phosphorylation cycles were assembled from modular protein domain parts and wired together to create synthetic phosphorylation circuits in human cells. Our design scheme enabled model-guided tuning of circuit function and the ability to make diverse network connections; synthetic phosphorylation circuits can be coupled to upstream cell surface receptors to enable fast-timescale sensing of extracellular ligands, and downstream connections can regulate gene expression. We engineered cell-based cytokine controllers that dynamically sense and suppress activated T cells. Our work introduces a generalizable approach that allows the design of signaling circuits that enable user-defined sense-and-respond function for diverse biosensing and therapeutic applications."

"The presence of high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) contributes to the development of cervical lesions and cervical cancer. Recent studies suggest that an imbalance in the cervicovaginal microbiota might be a factor in the persistence of HR-HPV infections. In this study, we collected 156 cervicovaginal fluid (CVF) of women with HR-HPV infection, which were divided into three groups (negative for intraepithelial lesions = 78, low/high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions = 52/26). We performed metabolomics and 16 S rRNA sequencing to identify changes in metabolites and cervicovaginal microbiota among patients with HR-HPV infection and varying grades of cervical lesions. We detected 164 metabolites and 389 flora types in the three groups. Ten CVF metabolites-N-methylalanine, phenylacetaldehyde, succinic acid, 2-3-dihydroxypyridine, DL-p-hydroxylphenyllactic acid, gluconic acid lactone, guanine, glucose-6-phosphate, erythrose, and sucrose showed significant associations with disease severity and distinct separation patterns in HR-HPV-infected patients with LSIL and HSIL, with an area under the curve of 0.928. The most abundant microbial communities in the CVF were Gardnerella. Gardnerella was found to be associated with increased levels of succinic acid, thereby highlighting distinct metabolic profiles. These findings suggest that the development of cervical lesions resulting from persistent HR-HPV infection is associated with significant alterations in systemic metabolism and shifts in the cervicovaginal microbiota, providing valuable insights into the metabolic and microbiota changes linked to disease severity."
"Cord blood (CB) is widely used in treating haematologic disorders due to its broad availability, tolerance to significant histocompatibility antigen disparities, and low incidence of chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD). The cord blood transplantation (CBT) with anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG)-containing conditioning regimens shows promise in this regard."
"While MRI has become the imaging modality of choice for intracranial meningiomas, no radiologic reporting guidance exists to date that relies on a systematic collection of information relevant to the core medical disciplines involved in the management of these patients. To address this issue, a nationwide expert survey was conducted in Germany. A literature-based catalog of potential reporting elements for MRI examinations of meningioma patients was developed interdisciplinarily. Subsequently, all board-certified members of the German Societies of Neuroradiology, Neurosurgery and Radiation Oncology with expertise in managing meningioma patients were invited to vote on the relevance of the suggested items via online survey. A total of 150 experts participated in the study (104 neurosurgeons/radiation oncologists, 46 neuroradiologists). The reporting elements of tumor location, extent, growth pattern, contrast uptake, associated cysts, and impact on adjacent anatomic structures received widespread approval (> 75.0% of all participants). In addition, a vast majority (> 75.0%) supported reference to perifocal edema, signs of mass effect, and hydrocephalus. Postoperative imaging is particularly requested to describe the extent of resection (94.0%) and treatment-related changes (89.3%). Advanced methods (diffusion, perfusion, proton spectroscopy) and meningioma-specific classifications (Nauta, Zee, Sindou) were judged to be less relevant (< 50.0% agreement) to MRI reporting. To serve as a vital clinical communication tool and enable an optimal contribution to the care of meningioma patients, the radiological report should focus on the fundamental information requirements of the neuro-oncology treatment team encompassing primarily tumor location, extent, tissue imaging characteristics, and potential impairment of neighboring anatomical structures."
"Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) is one of the most important toxicities of antiresorptive therapy, which is standard practice for patients with breast cancer and bone metastases. However, the population-based incidence of MRONJ is not well established. We therefore performed a retrospective multicenter study to assess the incidence for a whole Austrian federal state (Tyrol)."
"Adolescents face numerous challenges that influence their sexual behaviors. Among these, bullying victimization is a critical yet understudied factor that may impact engagement in unprotected sex. This study investigated the correlates of condom use among school-going Thai adolescents, with a main focus on bullying victimization."
"Thyroidectomy with only limited examination of lymph nodes is considered to pose potential risk for harboring occult nodal disease in patients with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). However, the optimal number of examined lymph nodes (ELNs) in patients with PTC with clinically lateral lymph node metastasis (cN1b) remains unclear."
"While widely viewed as inhibitory receptors that drive efferocytosis and immune resolution on myeloid cells, TAM family members, particularly Mertk, have emerged as promising targets in immune-oncology to help stimulate host antitumor immunity. A recent study shows that Mertk expressed on human T cells, including CD8+ T cells and differentiated central memory T cells, has a co-stimulatory function for the T Cell Receptor. These new findings reveal the complexity and diversification of Mertk in immune regulation and its implications to cancer therapeutics."
"The escalating diabetes prevalence has heightened interest in innovative therapeutic strategies for this disease and its complications. Human amniotic epithelial stem cells (HAESCs), originate from the innermost layer of the placenta closest to the fetus and express stem cell markers in the amniotic membrane's umbilical cord attachment area, which have garnered significant attention. This article critically examines emerging research advancements and potential application values of hAESCs in treating diabetes and its complications. Initially, we will discuss the characteristics, origin, and advantages of hAESCs in differentiating into insulin-secreting cells. Subsequently, we will focus on the potential applications of hAESCs in treating diabetes complications such as diabetic retinopathy, diabetic nephropathy, and diabetic neuropathy, etc. We will scrutinize the progress of relevant clinical studies and trials involving hAESC therapy. In conclusion, as an emerging diabetes treatment method, hAESCs exhibit immense potential and application value. Despite numerous challenges in practical application, we are confident that with scientific advancement and technological progress, hAESCs will play a pivotal role in treating diabetes and its related complications."
"Thyroid disorders can manifest in several forms, including follicular cell hyperplasia (goitre), follicular cell adenoma and follicular cell carcinoma. Following the detection of large and gradually increasing tumour-like masses in the gular region of wild fourlined terapons (Pelates quadrilineatus) housed in various tanks in a public aquarium in June 2022, September 2022 and October 2023, several fish displaying clinical signs were transported to the Ornamental Fish Clinic at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Tehran. Upon clinical inspection, the fish had prominent tumour-like masses in the gular area, located beneath the operculum. Upon histological examination of the first series, the masses revealed thyroid well-differentiated hyperplastic follicles that contained colloid and were lined by cuboidal epithelial cells. There were no signs of cellular atypia or mitotic figures. The study of the second series also revealed the existence of cellular atypia, but still no mitotic figures. In the examination of the third series, apart from the earlier lesions, there was evidence of neoplastic cell invasion into adjacent structures such as the adipose tissue and subepithelial layer. In addition, there was moderate cellular pleomorphism and a limited number of mitotic figures. Although the termination of water ozonation and the addition of potassium iodide to the feed were effective in treating thyroid hyperplasia, the treatment for thyroid neoplasia was not successful. The present study provides the evidence of clinical and histopathological findings of follicular cell hyperplasia, adenoma and adenocarcinoma of the thyroid gland in fourlined terapon."
"Altruism is beneficial to society as it promotes mental and physical health alongside economic and societal growth. Previous studies have indicated, however, that people tend not to engage in altruistic behaviors toward strangers. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate the factors that motivate individuals to participate in altruistic actions. This study explores the dynamic interplay of media and social factors that enhance altruistic behavior in adults, utilizing the General Learning Model (GLM) and Norm Activation Theory (NAT). To achieve this, the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) approach, coupled with Structural Equation Modelling (SEM), is applied. The research comprehensively examines the direct and indirect influence of media elements (such as prosocial media content and persuasive communication) and social factors (including religiosity and social norms) on altruistic behavior. Empathy, moral elevation, and compassion serve as mediators in this process. The DEMATEL approach involves a panel of 20 experts, while SEM analyzes data from a significant sample of 1296 participants drawn from the general public in Taiwan. DEMATEL results shed light on causal factors shaping altruistic behavior, highlighting the roles of religiosity, empathy, and compassion. Shifting to the SEM results, most direct relationships between variables are statistically significant, affirming their importance. However, the findings also reveal unexpected negative associations, challenging the initial hypotheses. Notably, compassion and persuasive communication were found to have negative correlations with altruistic behavior, contrary to expectations."
"Malignant melanoma is the most severe skin cancer with a rising incidence rate. Several noninvasive image techniques and computer-aided diagnosis systems have been developed to help find melanoma in its early stages. However, most previous research utilized dermoscopic images to build a diagnosis model, and only a few used prospective datasets. This study develops and evaluates a convolutional neural network (CNN) for melanoma identification and risk prediction using optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging of mice skin. Longitudinal tests are performed on four animal models: melanoma mice, dysplastic nevus mice, and their respective controls. The CNN classifies melanoma and healthy tissues with high sensitivity (0.99) and specificity (0.98) and also assigns a risk score to each image based on the probability of melanoma presence, which may facilitate early diagnosis and management of melanoma in clinical settings."
"Cutaneous neurocristic hamartoma (CNH) is a rare lesion composed of neural crest derivatives, thought to arise from aberrant migration and differentiation of neural crest cells. Recognition of CNH may be difficult, as they may resemble giant congenital nevus, and development of proliferative nodules (PNs) may raise concern for malignant transformation. Assessment of gene expression in CNH and PNs derived from CNH may offer insight into pathogenesis and suggest clinically useful biomarkers to identify these entities. This study investigates gene expression patterns in a congenital CNH and three separate PNs derived from that CNH with giant congenital nevus and malignant melanoma as comparator groups. Comparison of PN to CNH demonstrates downregulation of WIF1, which encodes as a tumor suppressor, and loss of WIF1 expression might explain the progression from CNH to PN. Comparison of gene expression in PN and CNH with giant congenital nevus and malignant melanoma shows relative overexpression of IGF2 and H19 in CNH and PN, suggesting that abnormal imprinting and IGF2 overexpression may have integral functions in the foundation of CNH."
"Reports indicate that children of mothers who received docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) or egg yolk supplements during pregnancy have improved performance on cognitive tasks and brain growth; their combination has recently been demonstrated to modulate functional neuronal network connectivity in the human-relevant piglet brain. To expand upon this functional connectivity analysis, neurochemical evaluation to determine how dietary supplementation with one or both of these nutrients during the last trimester of pregnancy alters monoamine homeostasis in selected brain regions of piglets was done."
Contralateral axillary lymph node metastasis (CAM) is a rare clinical condition in patients with breast cancer (BC). CAM can be either a locoregional event or a distant metastasis. Molecular application for clonal evolution in BC has not been reported in CAM cases.
"Proteins cooperate, regulate and bind each other to achieve their functions. Understanding the complex network of their interactions is essential for a systems-level description of cellular processes. The STRING database compiles, scores and integrates protein-protein association information drawn from experimental assays, computational predictions and prior knowledge. Its goal is to create comprehensive and objective global networks that encompass both physical and functional interactions. Additionally, STRING provides supplementary tools such as network clustering and pathway enrichment analysis. The latest version, STRING 12.5, introduces a new 'regulatory network', for which it gathers evidence on the type and directionality of interactions using curated pathway databases and a fine-tuned language model parsing the literature. This update enables users to visualize and access three distinct network types-functional, physical and regulatory-separately, each applicable to distinct research needs. In addition, the pathway enrichment detection functionality has been updated, with better false discovery rate corrections, redundancy filtering and improved visual displays. The resource now also offers improved annotations of clustered networks and provides users with downloadable network embeddings, which facilitate the use of STRING networks in machine learning and allow cross-species transfer of protein information. The STRING database is available online at https://string-db.org/."
"Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a common cerebrovascular disease that can lead to severe neurological dysfunction in surviving patients, resulting in a heavy burden on patients and their families. When ICH occurs, the blood‒brain barrier is disrupted, thereby promoting immune cell migration into damaged brain tissue. As important immunosuppressive T cells, regulatory T (Treg) cells are involved in the maintenance of immune homeostasis and the suppression of immune responses after ICH. Treg cells mitigate brain tissue damage after ICH in a variety of ways, such as inhibiting the neuroinflammatory response, protecting against blood‒brain barrier damage, reducing oxidative stress damage and promoting nerve repair. In this review, we discuss the changes in Treg cells in ICH clinical patients and experimental animals, the mechanisms by which Treg cells regulate ICH and treatments targeting Treg cells in ICH, aiming to support new therapeutic strategies for clinical treatment."
"This study aims to evaluate whether laparoscopic surgery enhances health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in endometriosis patients, utilizing the Endometriosis Health Profile-30 (EHP-30) questionnaire. The study also explores the correlations between disease severity, preoperative scores, and the subsequent changes following surgical intervention. This is a prospective observational study. Seventy women undergoing laparoscopic surgery for endometriosis at Fujian Maternity and Child Health Hospital were prospectively recruited. Each participant was assessed using the EHP-30 questionnaire both 4 weeks prior to and 3 months post-surgery to obtain preoperative and postoperative subscale scores. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was applied to determine the statistical significance of changes in these scores. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was employed to explore the relationships between preoperative EHP-30 scores, serum CA125 levels, and intraoperative revised American Society for Reproductive Medicine (rASRM) scores. Statistically significant correlations were further examined using multivariate linear regression analysis to adjust for potential confounders. Laparoscopic surgery resulted in a significant reduction in EHP-30 subscale scores (P ≤ 0.002), indicating a marked improvement in HRQoL among endometriosis patients. Spearman correlation analysis revealed positive correlations between preoperative serum CA125 levels (P = 0.005) and intraoperative rASRM scores with preoperative pain (P = 0.035) and sexual intercourse scores (P = 0.046). Additionally, multivariate linear regression analyses demonstrated that changes in pain scores (ΔPain), control and powerlessness (ΔControl and Powerlessness), and work life (ΔWork Life) were significantly interrelated (P < 0.01). Emotional well-being (ΔEmotional Well-being), control and powerlessness (ΔControl and Powerlessness), and work life (ΔWork Life) also exhibited significant mutual influences (P < 0.01). Furthermore, changes in social support (ΔSocial Support), self-image (ΔSelf-image), and treatment perception (ΔTreatment) were positively correlated (P < 0.01), as were changes in sexual intercourse (ΔSexual Intercourse) and concern about infertility (ΔConcern on Infertility) (P < 0.01). Laparoscopic surgery for endometriosis significantly improves HRQoL by alleviating pain and positively influencing daily functioning and emotional well-being. These findings highlight the critical role of laparoscopic surgery as an effective intervention for enhancing the quality of life in endometriosis patients."
"While renal replacement therapy (RRT) allows for precise fluid management as well as addressing electrolyte imbalances and the removal of other necessary compounds, its early initiation has not shown benefit in the general critically ill population. Moreover, the effects of early RRT initiation specifically in patients on venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) also remain unclear. This retrospective study investigated adult patients who underwent VA-ECMO between April 2018 and March 2022 and used the clone-censor-weight method to emulate a hypothetical target trial and compare two groups: patients who initiated RRT within 2 days of VA-ECMO initiation (Early) and those who did not (Late). The primary outcomes were 28-day and 90-day hospital mortality analyzed by Cox proportional hazards models and the secondary outcome was 90-day RRT dependence by pooled logistic regression models. Inverse probability censoring weights were applied to adjust the models. A total of 2,513 VA-ECMO patients were cloned into both groups. The 28-day and 90-day mortalities were lower in the Early group (HR 0.59 [95% CI 0.53-0.68] and 0.67 [0.61-0.75]). However, the early group experienced greater RRT dependence at 90 days than the late group (OR 2.58 [1.94-3.46]). In conclusion, early initiation of RRT (within 2 days of VA-ECMO) was associated with lower hospital mortality but with a higher likelihood of 90-day RRT dependence in adult patients on VA-ECMO."
"Genetics plays a significant role in Multiple Sclerosis (MS), with approximately 12.6% of cases occurring in familial form. While previous studies have demonstrated differences in disease progression and MRI findings between familial and sporadic MS, there has been no comparison of cognitive impairment between them. In this study, we evaluated cognitive performance among patients with sporadic and familial MS, along with a healthy control group. A total of 130 individuals, matched for age, sex, and education, were recruited for each group. The mean age of participants was 37.8 ± 9.8 years, and 77.6% of them were female. Cognitive performance was assessed using the Brief International Cognitive Assessment for MS (BICAMS) across the three groups. Both familial and sporadic MS patients showed poorer cognitive performance in the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) (Familial: 46.96 ± 12.59, Sporadic: 45.88 ± 14.13, Normal: 56.48 ± 11.89), California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT) (Familial: 66.90 ± 14.01, Sporadic: 68.19 ± 16.49, Normal: 75.18 ± 13.02), and the Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised (BVMT-R) (Familial: 24 (12), Sporadic: 24 (12), Normal: 35 (4)) compared to healthy controls. Meanwhile, no significant differences in cognitive impairment were observed between the familial and sporadic MS groups in the SDMT (p = 1.000), CVLT (p = 0.775), and BVMT-R (p = 0.733). Furthermore, this study found significant relationships between education, depression, age, and sex with different aspects of cognitive performance in MS. Overall, both familial and sporadic MS patients demonstrated similar levels of cognitive impairment."
Small bowel capsule endoscopy (SBCE) has an established role in patients with non-responsive celiac disease (CeD). A non-invasive method to quantify small bowel atrophy is still lacking.
"In the United States, often only tertiary centers offer cytoreductive surgery and heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy (CRS+HIPEC) for peritoneal metastases in advanced lower gastrointestinal malignancies. Growing evidence shows that Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010 enhanced healthcare access and outcomes."
"Hyperinsulinemia connects obesity, and a poor lipid profile, with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Here, we investigated consequences of insulin exposure for T cell function in the canonical autoimmunity of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We observed that insulin levels correlated with the glycolytic index of CD4+ cells but suppressed transcription of insulin receptor substrates, which was inversely related to insulin sensitivity. This connection between insulin levels and the glycolytic index was not seen in CD4+ cells of healthy controls. Exposure of CD4+ cells to insulin induced a senescent state recognized by cell cycle arrest and DNA content enrichment measured by flow cytometry. It also resulted in accumulation of DNA damage marker γH2AX. Insulin suppressed IFNγ production and induced the senescence-associated secretome in CD4+ cell cultures and in patients with hyperinsulinemia. Inhibition of JAK-STAT signaling (JAKi) improved insulin signaling, which activated the glycolytic index and facilitated senescence in CD4+ cell cultures. Treatment with JAKi was associated with an abundance of naïve and recent thymic emigrant T cells in the circulation of RA patients. Thus, we concluded that insulin exerts immunosuppressive ability by inducing senescence and inhibiting IFNγ production in CD4+ cells. JAKi promotes insulin effects and supports elimination of the pathogenic CD4+ cell in RA patients."
"Existing emotion-driven music generation models heavily rely on labeled data and lack interpretability and controllability of emotions. To address these limitations, a semi-supervised emotion-driven music generation model based on category-dispersed Gaussian mixture variational autoencoders is proposed. Initially, a controllable music generation model is introduced, which disentangles and manipulates rhythm and tonal features, enabling controlled music generation. Building on this, a semi-supervised model is developed, leveraging a category-dispersed Gaussian mixture variational autoencoder to infer emotions from the latent representations of rhythm and tonal features. Finally, the objective loss function is optimized to enhance the separation of distinct emotional clusters. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method effectively separates music with different emotions in the latent space, thereby strengthening the association between music and emotions. Additionally, the model successfully disentangles and separates various musical features, facilitating more accurate emotion-driven music generation and emotion transitions through feature manipulation."
"This study investigated the clinical outcomes of gastric conduits for esophageal reconstruction in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients who had previously undergone endoscopic resection of the stomach. From January 2006 to April 2023, a total of 1964 patients underwent surgery for esophageal cancer at our institution. After initially excluding 125 of these cases due to a histology other than ESCC, we identified 147 patients in the remaining population who had previously undergone a gastric endoscopic resection, among which 56 patients (67.0 ± 6.5 years) were included in the present study cohort. A gastric conduit event was defined as any new lesions at the gastric conduit. The diagnoses of a previous gastric lesion included early gastric cancer (EGC) in 32 patients (57.1%), adenoma in 23 patients (41.1%), and dysplasia in 1 (1.8%) patient. The endoscopic procedures involved an endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) in 36 patients (64.3%) and an endoscopic mucosal resection in 20 patients (35.7%). The 10-year event-free survival rate for the gastric conduit was 43.7%. Five patients were diagnosed with metachronous gastric neoplasm (EGC in two and adenoma in three patients). Endoscopic procedures were available for all five cases, but one patient with a metachronous EGC required a colon interposition with a total gastrectomy. In ESCC patients who have undergone an endoscopic resection of their gastric lesions, subsequent esophageal reconstruction with a gastric conduit could be a viable option if followed by regular endoscopic surveillance for the early detection and endoscopic curability of any lesions."
"This study aimed to evaluate the potential use of artificial dermal grafts in the lower eyelid following surgical resection of basal cell carcinoma (BCC), focusing on the degree of scar contracture. Postoperative changes were assessed using four quantitative and two qualitative parameters. Anthropometric analysis revealed no statistically significant differences across the four quantitative measures. Furthermore, no new cases of ectropion or scleral show were observed after grafting. These findings suggest that artificial dermal grafting may be a viable option following surgical excision of BCCs on the lower eyelids, without inducing significant eyelid retraction."
"Respiratory drive is frequently deranged in the ICU, being associated with adverse clinical outcomes. Monitoring and modulating respiratory drive to prevent potentially injurious consequences merits attention. This review gives a general overview of the available monitoring tools and interventions to modulate drive."
"T cells are indispensable for the therapeutic efficacy of cancer immunotherapies, including immune checkpoint blockade. However, prolonged antigen exposure also drives T cells into exhaustion, which is characterized by upregulated inhibitory molecules, impaired effector functions, reduced cytotoxicity, altered metabolism, etc. Noninvasive monitoring of T cell exhaustion allows a timely identification of cancer patients that are most likely to benefit from immunotherapies. In this Review, we briefly explain the biological cascades underlying the modulation of inhibitory molecules, present a concise update on the nuclear molecular imaging tracers of T cell exhaustion, and then discuss the potential opportunities for future development."
"The cancer-immunity cycle is a fundamental framework for understanding how the immune system interacts with cancer cells, balancing T cell recognition and elimination of tumors while avoiding autoimmune reactions. Despite advancements in immunotherapy, there remains a critical need to dissect each phase of the cycle, particularly the interactions among the tumor, vasculature, and immune system within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Innovative platforms such as organ-on-a-chip, organoids, and bioprinting within microphysiological systems (MPS) are increasingly utilized to enhance the understanding of these interactions. These systems meticulously replicate crucial aspects of the TME and immune responses, providing robust platforms to study cancer progression, immune evasion, and therapeutic interventions with greater physiological relevance. This review explores the latest advancements in MPS technologies for modeling various stages of the cancer-immune cycle, critically evaluating their applications and limitations in advancing the understanding of cancer-immune dynamics and guiding the development of next-generation immunotherapeutic strategies."
"Fibrotic focus is a pivotal morphofunctional unit in developing fibrosis in various tissues. For most fibrotic diseases, including progressive forms, the foci are considered unable to remodel and contribute to the worsening of prognosis. Unfortunately, the dynamics of the fibrotic focus formation and resolution remains understudied. A number of data suggest that the key cell type for focus formation are activated stromal cells marked by fibroblast activated protein alpha (FAPα) due to their high capacity for extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. We evaluated the dynamics of fibrotic focus formation and the contribution of the main cell types, including FAPα+ cells, in this process using a murine model of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis. We revealed the very early appearance of FAPα+ cells in lungs after injury and assumed their important involvement to the myofibroblast pool formation. During the first month after bleomycin administration, FAPα+ cells colocalize with CD206+ M2 macrophages. Interestingly, during the reversion stage, we unexpectedly observed the specific structured foci formed by CD90+FAPα+ cells, which we suggested calling ""remodeling foci"". Our findings highlight the crucial role of activated stromal cells in fibrosis initiation, progression, and reversion and provide emerging issues regarding the novel targets for antifibrotic therapy."
"Macrophage polarization is vital to mounting a host defense or repairing tissue in various liver diseases. Excessive activation of the NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is related to the orchestration of inflammation and alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) pathology. Rab GTPases play critical roles in regulating vesicular transport. In this study we investigated the role of Rab11b in ALD, aiming to identify effective therapeutic targets. Here, we first demonstrated a decreased expression of Rab11b in macrophages from ALD mice. Knockdown of Rab11b by macrophage-specific adeno-associated virus can alleviate alcohol induced liver inflammation, injury and steatosis. We found that LPS and alcohol stimulation promoted Rab11b transferring from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) cells. Rab11b specifically activated the NLRP3 inflammasome in BMDMs and RAW264.7 cells to induce M1 macrophage polarization. Rab11b overexpression in BMDMs inhibited autophagic flux, leading to the suppression of LC3B-mediated NLRP3 degradation. We conclude that impaired Rab11b could alleviate alcohol-induced liver injury via autophagy-mediated NLRP3 degradation."
"Mechanical ventilation may have adverse effects on diaphragm and lung function. Lung- and diaphragm-protective ventilation is an approach that challenges the clinician to facilitate physiological respiratory efforts, while maintaining minimal lung stress and strain. Here, we discuss the latest advances in monitoring and interventions to achieve lung- and diaphragm protective ventilation."
"High dielectric constants with less dielectric loss composites is highly demandable for technological advancements across various fields, including energy storage, sensing, and telecommunications. Their significance lies in their ability to enhance the performance and efficiency of a wide range of devices and systems. In this work, the dielectric performance of graphene oxide (GO) reinforced plasticized starch (PS) nanocomposites (PS/GO) for different concentrations of GO nanofiller was studied. The surface morphology, and chemical and structural properties of the PS/GO nanocomposites were investigated by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), Fourier-transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR), and X-ray diffractometer (XRD). The FESEM study showed a uniform dispersion of the GO nanofiller in the nanocomposites. The XRD analysis showed a reduction in d-space due to the incorporation of GO nanofiller in the nanocomposites. The FTIR data exhibits the formation of hydrogen bonds among PS and GO nanofillers, suggesting the presence of strong interaction between them. The dielectric properties of the nanocomposites were studied at room temperature in the frequency range 100 Hz‒1 MHz. The dielectric constant was found to improve due to the incorporation of GO. This composite nanomaterial also provides low dielectric loss at low frequency. Moreover, an increasing trend is observed for the AC conductivity of the composites. From the complex impedance study, the changes in various impedances with low to high-frequency ranges have been calculated and explained in the equivalent circuit diagram. The complex impedance spectra analysis shows the change in resistance and constant phase element (CPE): grain boundary resistance, R2 decreases from 4.3 KΩ to 1.9 KΩ, and CPE increases from 0.59 μF to 0.72 μF for PS/GO (0.5%) nanocomposite. This study will provide a potential route for the fabrication of biocompatible dielectric device fabrication."
"Alternative splicing (AS) is a key element of eukaryotic gene expression that increases transcript and proteome diversity in cells, thereby altering their responses to external stimuli and stresses. While AS has been intensively researched in plants and animals, its frequency, conservation, and putative impact on virulence, are relatively still understudied in plant pathogenic fungi. Here, we profiled the AS events occurring in genes of Cladosporium fulvum isolates Race 5 and Race 4, during nearly a complete compatible infection cycle on their tomato host. Our studies revealed extensive heterogeneity in the transcript isoforms assembled from different isolates, infections, and infection timepoints, as over 80% of the transcript isoforms were singletons that were detected in only a single sample. Despite that, nearly 40% of the protein-coding genes in each isolate were predicted to be recurrently AS across the disparate infection timepoints, infections, and the two isolates. Of these, 37.5% were common to both isolates and 59% resulted in multiple protein isoforms, thereby putatively increasing proteome diversity in the pathogen by 31% during infections. An enrichment analysis showed that AS mostly affected genes likely to be involved in the transport of nutrients, regulation of gene expression, and monooxygenase activity, suggesting a role for AS in finetuning adaptation of C. fulvum on its tomato host during infections. Tracing the location of the AS genes on the fungal chromosomes showed that they were mostly located in repeat-rich regions of the core chromosomes, indicating a causal connection between gene location on the genome and propensity to AS. Finally, multiple cases of differential isoform usage in AS genes of C. fulvum were identified, suggesting that modulation of AS at different infection stages may be another way by which pathogens refine infections on their hosts."
"An 80-year-old patient, previously implanted for idiopathic sustained ventricular tachycardia with a Rivacor VR-T DX implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD Biotronik, Berlin, Germany), came to our pacemaker clinic for palpitations. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus bradycardia with interpolated ventricular ectopic beats. A ventricular-paced event occurred with a coupling interval shorter than the expected one suggesting ventricular undersensing. The phenomenon can be explained by the default ICD sensitivity setting proposed by the manufacturer."
The burden of esophageal cancer varies across different regions of the world. The aim of this study is to analyze the current burden of esophageal cancer in 185 countries in 2022 and to project the trends up to the year 2050.
"Self-rated health is related to the reduction of the burden of diseases and health outcomes. Various factors affect self-rated health. This study aimed to investigate the mediating role of life style in the relationship between health literacy and self-rated health. In 2023, 495 people aged 18-65 participated in this cross-sectional study. Montazeri et al.'s health literacy questionnaire, Eshaghi et al.'s healthy life style assessment questionnaire, and the self-rated health (SRH) questionnaire developed by the World Health Organization were used. The structural equation modeling (SEM) was used. Statistical analysis of data was performed using Stata version 14.2 software. Based on the results, a significant total effect of health literacy on self-rated health (β = - 0.27,p = 0.001), was identified. Life style (β = - 0.20) had a direct effect on self-rated health (p < 0.001). The result from SEM indicated that health literacy exhibited a direct effect on life style (β  = 0.72). In addition, the principal hypothesis of this research posits the mediating function of lifestyle within the interrelationship between the two constructs of health literacy and self-rated health. Considering the mediating role of life style in the relationship between health literacy and self-rated health, to improve self-rated health, in addition to paying attention to the role of health literacy, it is necessary to take effective measures to positively change people's lifestyle."
"Trends of stoma creation at index surgery for Crohn's disease (CD) in the biologics era has not been thoroughly investigated. This study aimed to assess the impact of increasing biologics use on stoma rates at index surgery of CD, as well as identifying risk factors for the creation and nonreversal of CD-related stoma."
"The increasingly widespread application of next-generation sequencing (NGS) in clinical diagnostics and epidemiological research has generated a demand for robust, fast, automated, and user-friendly bioinformatics workflows. To guide the choice of tools for the assembly of full-length viral genomes from NGS datasets, we assessed the performance and applicability of four open-source bioinformatics pipelines (shiver-for which we created a user-friendly Dockerized version, referred to as dshiver; SmaltAlign; viral-ngs; and V-pipe) using both simulated and real-world HIV-1 paired-end short-read datasets and default settings. All four pipelines produced consensus genome assemblies with high quality metrics (genome fraction recovery, mismatch and indel rates, variant calling F1 scores) when the reference sequence used for assembly had high similarity to the analyzed sample. The shiver and SmaltAlign pipelines (but not viral-ngs and V-Pipe) also showed robust performance with more divergent samples (non-matching subtypes). With empirical datasets, SmaltAlign and viral-ngs exhibited an order of magnitude shorter runtime compared to V-Pipe and shiver. In terms of applicability, V-Pipe provides the broadest functionalities, SmaltAlign and dshiver combine user-friendliness with robustness, while the use of viral-ngs requires less computational resources compared to other pipelines. In conclusion, if a closely matched reference sequence is available, all pipelines can reliably reconstruct viral consensus genomes; therefore, differences in user-friendliness and runtime may guide the choice of the pipeline in a particular setting. If a matched reference sequence cannot be selected, we recommend shiver or SmaltAlign for robust performance. The new Dockerized version of shiver offers ease of use in addition to the accuracy and robustness of the original pipeline."
"During acquisition and reconstruction, medical images may become noisy and lose diagnostic quality. In the case of CT scans, obtaining less noisy images results in a higher radiation dose being administered to the patient. Filtering techniques can be utilized to reduce radiation without losing diagnosis capabilities. The objective in this work is to obtain an implementation of a filter capable of processing medical images in real-time. To achieve this we have developed several filter methods based on fuzzy logic, and their GPU implementations, to reduce mixed Gaussian-impulsive noise. These filters have been developed to work in attenuation coefficients so as to not lose any information from the CT scans. The testing volumes come from the Mayo clinic database and consist of CT volumes at full and at simulated low dose. The GPU parallelizations reach speedups of over 2700 and take less than 0.1 seconds to filter more than 300 slices. In terms of quality the filter is competitive with other state of the art algorithmic and AI filters. The proposed method obtains good performance in terms of quality and the parallelization results in real-time filtering."
"Estimating how the human body moves in space and time-body kinematics-has important applications for industry, healthcare, and several research fields. Gold-standard methodologies capturing body kinematics are expensive and impractical for naturalistic recordings as they rely on infrared-reflective wearables and bulky instrumentation. To overcome these limitations, several algorithms have been developed to extract body kinematics from plain video recordings. This comes with a drop in accuracy, which however has not been clearly quantified. To fill this knowledge gap, we analysed a dataset comprising 46 human participants exhibiting spontaneous movements of varying amplitude. Body kinematics were estimated using OpenPose (video-based) and Vicon (infrared-based) motion capture systems simultaneously. OpenPose accuracy was assessed using Vicon estimates as ground truth. We report that OpenPose accuracy is overall moderate and varies substantially across participants and body parts. This is explained by variability in movement amplitude. OpenPose estimates are weak for low-amplitude movements. Conversely, large-amplitude movements (i.e., > ~ 10 cm) yield highly accurate estimates. The relationship between accuracy and movement amplitude is not linear (but mostly exponential or power) and relatively robust to camera-body distance. Together, these results dissect the limits of video-based motion capture and provide useful guidelines for future studies."
"Hox genes have been investigated in various Arthropod species, resulting in the identification of ten Hox genes, organized in a colinear arrangement within the genome. Among arthropods, crustaceans exhibit a remarkable diversity of body shapes, which are associated with a variety of egg types, embryonic development patterns, and importantly, with the modulation of Hox genes to specify the identity of body segments along the antero-posterior axis of the embryo. Although there are more than 52,000 species of crustaceans described, their genomic resources are relatively limited, making it challenging to employ several molecular tools for studying embryonic development. In this regard, we present a protocol for identifying Hox genes in a freshwater prawn using degenerate primers and transcriptome analysis. This method enables the study of specific functions of Hox genes, thereby contributing to the evolutionary understanding of the diversity of body shapes in crustaceans."
"Self-control is essential for individual health and well-being. The relationship between mindfulness and self-control has recently become a central focus of research. However, the dynamics of this relationship in deaf and hearing individuals remain underexplored. This study, based on the Cognitive Behavioral Theory, developed a moderated mediation model to examine the mediating role of inner peace and the moderating role of group type in the mindfulness-self-control relationship."
"Genetic predisposition plays a role in the etiology of metabolic syndrome (MetS), an important health problem worldwide. Leptin (LEP), produced by adipose tissue, plays a crucial role in the development of MetS. In this study, we evaluated the effects of LEP and LEP receptor (LEPR) variants on clinical findings and risk of developing MetS in the Turkish population."
"Tween 20 is frequently added to particle suspensions for reducing the particle-wall adhesion and particle-particle aggregation in microfluidic devices. However, the influences of Tween 20 on the fluid and particle behaviors have been largely ignored. We present in this work the first experimental study of the effects of Tween 20 addition on the electrokinetic transport of fluids and particles in a polydimethylsiloxane microchannel. We find that adding 0.1% v/v Tween 20 to a buffer solution can significantly reduce the electroosmotic mobility as well as the electrokinetic and electrophoretic mobilities of polystyrene particles and yeast cells. Further increasing the Tween 20 concentration within the range typically used in microfluidic applications continues reducing these mobility values, but at a smaller rate. Our finding suggests that Tween 20 should be used with care in electrokinetic microdevices when the flow rate or particle/cell throughput is an important parameter."
"Pregnancies complicated by uterine prolapse are rare, occurring in 1 in 10 000 to 15 000 deliveries. We report a case of uterine prolapse at 36 weeks of gestation that resulted in vaginal delivery by placement of a colpeurynter (intravaginal balloon). The patient was a 33-year-old pregnant woman with a history of uterine prolapse during her previous pregnancy. At 36 weeks and 4 days of gestation, she presented to her previous physician with uterine prolapse and genital bleeding. Due to severe edema of the uterine cervix, she was referred to our hospital for specialized care. The cervix was manually repositioned into the vagina and the patient was discharged. Concerned about recurrence of uterine prolapse and cervical incarceration at delivery, labor was induced at 39 weeks and 5 days of gestation by oral prostaglandin preparations with concurrent placement of a colpeurynter, resulting in vaginal delivery. Colpeurynter placement is a simple procedure and may be useful in preventing uterine prolapse at delivery."
"Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation (BiFC) is a powerful molecular imaging method used to visualize protein-protein interactions (PPIs) in living cells or organisms. BiFC is based on the reassociation of hemi-fragments of a monomeric fluorescent protein upon spatial proximity. It is compatible with conventional light microscopy, providing a resolution that is constrained by the diffraction of light to around 250 nm. PAmCherry1, a fluorescent protein compatible for BiFC and Photoactivated Localization Microscopy (PALM), allows the analysis of PPIs with nanometer spatial resolution and single molecule sensitivity. To date, this so-called BiFC-PALM approach has only been described in human cell culture. Here, we present a protocol for performing BiFC-PALM in Drosophila larval salivary glands, using the interaction between the Hox protein Ultrabithorax (Ubx) and the generic Hox cofactor Extradenticle (Exd) as a model system."
"Neurons form predefined connections and innervate target tissues through elongating axons, which are crucial for the development, maturation, and function of these tissues. However, innervation is often overlooked in tissue engineering (TE) applications. Here, multimaterial 3D bioprinting is used to develop a novel 3D axonal guidance structure in vitro. The approach uses the stiffness difference of acellular hyaluronic acid-based bioink printed as two alternating, parallel-aligned filaments. The structure has soft passages incorporated with guidance cues for axonal elongation while the stiff bioink acts as a structural support and contact guidance. The mechanical properties and viscosity differences of the bioinks are confirmed. Additionally, human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) -derived neurons form a 3D neuronal network in the softer bioink supplemented with guidance cues whereas the stiffer restricts the network formation. Successful 3D multimaterial bioprinting of the axonal structure enables complete innervation by peripheral neurons via soft passages within 14 days of culture. This model provides a novel, stable, and long-term platform for studies of 3D innervation and axonal dynamics in health and disease."
"The purpose of the study was to evaluate Verb Network Strengthening Treatment (VNeST) paired with the transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the left inferior frontal gyrus, which was compared to VNeST paired with a sham stimulation in primary progressive aphasia (PPA)."
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the clinical outcomes of fractional flow reserve (FFR)-guided and angiography-guided revascularization in patients with coronary artery disease yielded inconsistent results.
"This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to assess the effects of movement representation techniques (MRT) on pain, range of motion, functional outcomes, and pain-related fear in patients with non-specific shoulder pain (NSSP). A literature search conducted in PubMed, PEDro, EBSCO, Scopus, Cochrane Library, ScienceDirect, and gray literature on April 31, 2023. We selected seven randomized controlled trials based on the PICOS framework. Incomplete data or non-NSSP excluded. Study quality was assessed using the PEDro scale (mean score = 6.43), and certainty of evidence was evaluated with the GRADE approach. MRT demonstrated a large effect size for pain reduction (high heterogeneity, I2 = 85.2%, Hedges'g = 1.324, 95% CI = 0.388-2.260, P = 0.006), functional improvement (moderate heterogeneity, I2 = 70.82%, Hedges'g = 1.263, 95% CI = 0.622-1.904, P < 0.001), and reduction of pain-related fear (moderate heterogeneity, I2 = 70.86%, Hedges'g = 0.968, 95% CI = 0.221-1.716, P < 0.001). MRT also showed significant benefits for range of motion, particularly in flexion (low heterogeneity, I2 = 26.38%, Hedges'g = 0.683), abduction (low heterogeneity, I2 = 33.27%, Hedges'g = 0.756), and external rotation (low heterogeneity, I2 = 48.33%, Hedges'g = 0.542) (P < 0.001 for all), while no significant effect was found for internal rotation (P > 0.05). No publication bias was detected. While limited evidence and methodological concerns necessitate further research, MRT appears to positively impact pain, range of motion, functional outcomes, and pain-related fear in NSSP patients."
"The hydrodynamic performance of a Savonius type turbine (S-type turbine) in wave field is studied. The method of combining numerical simulation with physical experiment is adopted.Based on linear wave theory and turbulence model, Star CCM+numerical simulation software is used for digital modeling, and overlapping grid technology is used for grid modeling. Dynamic Fluid Body Interaction (DFBI) model is called to control the movement of S-type turbine, and second-order time discretization is adopted to establish a two-dimensional wave field model and conduct numerical simulation. At the same time, the physical test system of S-type turbine was developed for physical experiment verification, and the rotating performance of S-type turbine under different wave heights and pe-riods was measured, and the results of numerical simulation and physical experiment were com-prehensively evaluated. The results show that in wave field, the inverted S-shape arrangement of horizontal axis is better than the positive S-shape arrangement of horizontal axis and the vertical axis arrangement, and the captured energy is more than 3 times. At the same time, the fluctuating rotation speed of S-type turbine in wave field needs to be close to the wave frequency to capture more wave energy, which has guiding significance for practical engineering."
"Oral treatment with the exogenous ketone body 3-hydroxybutyrate improves cardiac function in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, but ketosis is limited to 3 to 4 hours. Treatment with (R)-1,3-butanediol (BD) provides prolonged ketosis in healthy controls, but the hemodynamic and metabolic profile is unexplored in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction."
"Changes in amyloid beta (Aβ) and phosphorylated tau brain levels are known to affect brain network organization but very little is known about how plasma markers can relate to these measures. We aimed to address the relationship between centrality network changes and two plasma pathology markers: phosphorylated tau at threonine 231 (p-tau231), a proxy for early Aβ change, and neurofilament light chain (Nfl), a marker of axonal degeneration."
"Treatment plan quality is a crucial component for a successful outcome of radiation therapy treatments. As the complexity of radiation therapy planning and delivery techniques increases, the role of the medical physicist in assessing treatment plan quality becomes more critical. Integrating plan quality review throughout the treatment planning process allows improvements without delaying treatment or rushing to produce changes at the last minute. In this work, we aim to provide practical check items for physicists to reference when assessing treatment plan quality with a critical eye, asking questions such as ""is this the best dose distribution feasible for this patient?,"" ""could we change any planning parameters to improve plan quality?,"" and ""could we change the planning strategy for this particular patient or for future patients?""; and to work with planners and physicians to create a multidisciplinary collaborative culture that achieves the best plan feasible for every patient. We tabulate the features that affect plan quality in each process step and check details for individual items. This report is aimed at medical physicists, planners, radiation oncologists, and other professionals who are involved in treatment planning."
"CATH (https://www.cathdb.info) is a structural classification database that assigns domains to the structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and AlphaFold Protein Structure Database (AFDB) and adds layers of biological information, including homology and functional annotation. This article covers developments in the CATH classification since 2021. We report the significant expansion of structural information (180-fold) for CATH superfamilies through classification of PDB domains and predicted domain structures from the Encyclopedia of Domains (TED) resource. TED provides information on predicted domains in AFDB. CATH v4.4 represents an expansion of ∼64 844 experimentally determined domain structures from PDB. We also present a mapping of ∼90 million predicted domains from TED to CATH superfamilies. New PDB and TED data increases the number of superfamilies from 5841 to 6573, folds from 1349 to 2078 and architectures from 41 to 77. TED data comprises predicted structures, so these new folds and architectures remain hypothetical until experimentally confirmed. CATH also classifies domains into functional families (FunFams) within a superfamily. We have updated sequences in FunFams by scanning FunFam-HMMs against UniProt release 2024_02, giving a 276% increase in FunFams coverage. The mapping of TED structural domains has resulted in a 4-fold increase in FunFams with structural information."
"Anthropogenic pressures such as hunting are increasingly driving the localised functional extinctions of large- and medium-sized wildlife in tropical forests, a phenomenon broadly termed 'defaunation'. Concurrently in these areas, smaller-bodied species benefit from factors such as competitive release and increase in numbers. This transformation of the wildlife community can impact species interactions and ecosystem services such as seed dispersal and seed-mediated geneflow with far-reaching consequences. Evidence for negative genetic effects following defaunation is well-documented in large-seeded plants that require large frugivores for long-distance seed dispersal. However, how defaunation affects plants with small or medium-small seeds (< 1.5 cm), which tend to be consumed and dispersed by frugivorous mutualists of a range of body sizes and responses to anthropogenic threats, is not well understood. To better understand defaunation's impacts on tropical plant communities, we investigated spatial and genetic patterns in a hyperabundant medium-to-small-seeded palm, Euterpe precatoria in three sites with different defaunation levels. Results indicate that defaunation is associated with higher fine-scale spatial genetic structure among seedlings and increased spatial clustering within seedling cohorts and between seedlings and conspecific adults, as well as a reduction in nearest-neighbour distances between seedlings and conspecific adults. There were no clear effects on inbreeding or genetic diversity. However, we caution these trends may indicate that defaunation reduces seed dispersal services for species previously presumed to be robust to deleterious effects of losing large frugivores by virtue of having smaller seeds and broad suites of dispersal agents, and negative downstream effects on genetic diversity could occur."
"Interventionist training and on-going guidance by the research team are essential in psychosocial interventional research to ensure fidelity. Consistency in delivering an intervention requires recruiting interventionists with well-aligned clinical experience, developing a replicable training process, and reassessing ongoing intervention fidelity using an assessment tool of observable behaviors that are essential to the intervention. This paper describes one research team's experience of hiring and training nurse interventionists to deliver a theory-based, telehealth psychosocial intervention for a single-arm pilot study. The training methods used to foster the nurses' integration of theory into intervention delivery are discussed, along with approaches adopted to optimize and measure fidelity. The research team and interventionist trainees in this pilot study overcame learning challenges through establishing mutual trust and promoting effective communication throughout the training process. Fostering connections between cognitive and affective learning during the nurse interventionists' training was critical to establishing and maintaining intervention fidelity."
"Hepatoid adenocarcinoma of the stomach (HAS), a subtype of gastric cancer (GC), includes multiple tumor components, such as enteroblastic and tubular adenocarcinoma components. However, which component mostly contributes to the aggressive behavior of HAS remains unclear. Moreover, the role of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) has not been explored in HAS. This study evaluated the clinical significance of the proportion of the hepatoid component within the tumor, CD163 + macrophages, and macrophage colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) in HAS."
The mortality impact of peritoneal dialysis (PD) and hemodialysis (HD) in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) remains uncertain.
"Colonic tuberculosis (TB) is a rare form of extrapulmonary TB with nonspecific clinical presentations such as weight loss, abdominal pain and fever. It is often misdiagnosed, as the presentations mimic other more common diseases such as colon cancer and inflammatory bowel diseases, especially in those countries with low TB incidence. Although a combination of CT imaging, colonoscopy and histopathology forms the essential part of the diagnostic assessment, the high variability and low specificity of each investigation may delay or overlook the diagnosis. Without treatment, colonic TB could potentially lead to severe malnutrition, bowel obstruction and mortality. We report the case of a man in his 60s presenting with significant weight loss, malnutrition and an abdominal mass for an initial workup of colorectal malignancy. This case highlights the diagnostic pitfall and dynamic management of colonic TB and aims to raise awareness among clinicians to broaden differential diagnoses when encountered with unspecific presentations."
"Midlife baseline prostate-specific antigen (MB PSA), defined as a single PSA value measured between 40-59 years of age, has been proposed as a tool that can limit potential harms of PSA screening. This study aimed to examine the ability of MB PSA versus PSA doubling time (PSADT) and PSA velocity (PSAV) in assessing the likelihood of developing of lethal prostate cancer (PCa) in a diverse and contemporary North American population."
"Evidence has shown that the incidence of bacillary dysentery (BD) is associated with climatic factors. However, the lagged effects of climatic factors on BD are still unclear, especially lacking research evidence from arid and semi-arid regions. Therefore, this study aims to add new insights into this research field."
This study aimed to evaluate the dental and skeletal stability one year after Miniscrew-Assisted Rapid Palatal Expansion (MARPE) by using 3D image data.
"Sea stars are a group of marine invertebrates suitable for studying the hormonal regulation of reproduction and spawning. In spite of substantial progress in understanding how various substances such as 1-methyladenine act in their gonads, there are still many gaps concerning the fine details of their action. One such gap is how the gonadal wall contraction is induced. Recent literature data suggest that, upon 1-methyladenine stimulation, some cells within the gonadal lumen produce non-neuronal acetylcholine that, upon contact with the gonadal wall, induces contraction of myoepithelial cells. Our ultrastructural study of the gonads in the sea star Patiria pectinifera has shown, for the first time, that there are sites where the basal laminae bordering the hemal sinus directly contact one another and appear at this contact site as a single entity. These contact sites are often associated with hemidesmosome-like junctions that anchor male accessory cells or female follicle cells on one side of the site and myoepithelial cells on the opposite. We suggest that contraction-inducing substance is secreted from an accessory or follicle cell, passes through a basal lamina contact site, and on the opposite side of the contact site acts on a myoepithelial cell to induce its contraction."
"Long-axis positron emission tomography (PET) has emerged as one of the recent research directions in PET due to its ability to significantly enhance sensitivity and counting performance for low-dose imaging, rapid imaging, and whole-body dynamic imaging."
"Very limited evidence is available on the long-term health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) treated with arsenic trioxide (ATO). We performed an extended follow-up of the APL0406 randomized controlled trial to investigate HRQoL of patients treated with either ATO or chemotherapy. A secondary objective was to describe the prevalence of clinically important problems and symptoms of these patients by type of treatment. Overall, 117 patients were included in this analysis after a median follow-up of 10 years (IQR 8-11) since diagnosis. Of these, 60 (51.3%) were treated with ATO, and 57 (48.7%) with chemotherapy. A statistically significant and clinically relevant difference, favoring patients treated with ATO, was found in 2 of the 3 main prespecified EORTC QLQ-C30 scales, that is, cognitive functioning (∆ = 7.7; 95% CI 0.5 to 14.9; p = 0.036) and fatigue (∆ = -9.4; 95% CI -17.9 to -0.8; p = 0.031). The prevalence of clinically important problems and symptoms tended to be slightly higher in patients treated with chemotherapy. These findings suggest that previously observed HRQoL advantages of ATO therapy of patients included in the APL0406 trial are sustained over the long-term period. This study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03096496)."
"Photovoltaic (PV) modules may encounter nonuniform situations that reduce their useable power volume, causing ineffective maximum power point tracking (MPPT). Moreover, due to the incorporation of bypass diodes, power-voltage (P-V) graph has multi-peaks when each component of the module receives different solar irradiation. This paper proposes a solution to this problem using an arithmetic optimization algorithm (AOA) for MPPT in PV systems operating in nonuniform situations. The non-operational regions associated with the voltage are excluded using a single-ended primary inductance converter (SEPIC) with voltage step-up and step-down capability. The AOA-MPPT algorithm gets current and voltage as inputs from the PV modules. It computes the converter's duty cycle and regulates the operational point to keep MPP under all working conditions. The proposed AOA-MPPT's efficacy under different insolation patterns has been validated using three nonuniform conditions in terms of convergence, tracking speed, steady state oscillations, and tracking efficiency. In simulations, the proposed AOA-MPPT method and SEPIC converter demonstrated quick response and excellent steady-state performance. The tracking efficiency of the AOA-MPPT is above 99% and settling time is 200 to 300ms for all three non-uniform conditions."
"Facial transplantation (FT) provides advanced solutions for severe facial defects by incorporating complex tissues such as bone, skin, oral mucosa and nerves. Oral health plays a critical role in FT, impacting both functional outcomes and transplant prognosis. Despite its importance, literature on oral health in FT recipients remains sparse."
"For patients with osteoporosis, bisphosphonate therapy can reduce the risk of fractures, but its effect on reducing mortality remains unclear. Previous studies on this topic have produced conflicting results and generally have been too small to definitively answer the question of whether bisphosphonate therapy reduces mortality. Therefore, a meta-analysis may help us arrive at a more conclusive answer."
Pharmacogenomic testing can optimize drug efficacy and minimize adverse effects. CYP3A5 polymorphisms affect the metabolism of tacrolimus. We sought to estimate the budget impact of preemptive pharmacogenomic testing for CYP3A5 in pediatric heart transplantation patients from an institutional perspective.
"Patients with asthma and opioid use disorder (OUD) experience higher rates of acute exacerbation, but the effects of OUD on asthma hospitalizations have been poorly described."
"The infections of bacterial origin represent a significant problem to the public healthcare worldwide both in clinical and community settings. Recent decade was marked by limiting treatment options for bacterial infections due to growing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) acquired and transferred by various bacterial species, especially the ones causing healthcare-associated infections, which has become a dangerous issue noticed by the World Health Organization. Numerous reports shown that the spread of AMR is often driven by several species-specific lineages usually called the 'global clones of high risk'. Thus, it is essential to track the isolates belonging to such clones and investigate the mechanisms of their pathogenicity and AMR acquisition. Currently, the whole genome-based analysis is more and more often used for these purposes, including the epidemiological surveillance and analysis of mobile elements involved in resistance transfer. However, in spite of the exponential growth of available bacterial genomes, their representation usually lack uniformity and availability of supporting metadata, which creates a bottleneck for such investigations."
"Recent studies suggest a connection between immunoglobulin light chains (IgLCs) and coronary heart disease (CHD). However, current diagnostic methods using peripheral blood IgLCs levels or subtype ratios show limited accuracy for CHD, lacking comprehensive assessment and posing challenges in early detection and precise disease severity evaluation. We aim to develop and validate a Coronary Health Index (CHI) incorporating total IgLCs levels and their distribution. Additionally, we aim to evaluate its effectiveness by integrating patient data and using machine learning models through diagnostic trial."

"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with t (9;11) (p22; q23) presents as a varied hematological malignancy. The t (9;11) (p22; q23) translocation is the most common among 11q23/KMT2A rearrangements in AML. This research aimed to develop a nomogram for precise prediction of overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) in AML with the t (9;11) (p22; q23) translocation. We utilized the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database to identify patients diagnosed with t (9;11) (p22; q23) AML from 2000 to 2021. Prognostic factors for this AML subtype were determined using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, which guided the creation of prognostic nomograms. To evaluate the model's discrimination, accuracy, and effectiveness, we employed the concordance index (C-index), calibration charts, receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC), area under the curve (AUC), and decision-curve analysis (DCA). The research was meticulously planned, executed, and documented in full adherence to the TRIPOD guidelines. The nomogram was developed using key variables including age, race, first primary tumor, and chemotherapy. The concordance indices (C-indices) were 0.704 for OS and for 0.686 for CSS. Patients were classified into high-risk and low-risk groups based on nomogram scores, with significant differences in OS and CSS between these groups (P < 0.001). This study developed innovative nomograms that combine clinical and treatment factors to predict 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates for patients with t (9;11) (p22; q23) AML."
"The Food and Drug Administration and the Federal Trade Commission influence the contact lens (CL) market, with the Food and Drug Administration regulating CLs as medical devices and the Federal Trade Commission dictating how they are prescribed and sold. Legislative oversight came to the forefront in 2004, when the Contact Lens Rule was introduced, drastically changing how CLs are prescribed and distributed. This article examines the evolution of CL regulations over the past two decades and discusses how regulation, such as allowing passive verification, has shaped the current and evolving CL market. We also explore how related products (decorative CLs, artificial tears) are regulated and compare US regulations with those abroad. Finally, we discuss how future technological advancements, including artificial intelligence, promise to change the CL industry and its regulation worldwide."
"We discuss the outcomes of our 16th horizon scan of issues that are novel or represent a considerable step-change and have the potential to substantially affect conservation of biological diversity in the coming decade. From an initial 96 topics, our international panel of 32 scientists and practitioners prioritised 15 issues. Technological advances are prominent, including metal and non-metal organic frameworks, deriving rare earth elements from macroalgae, synthetic gene drives in plants, and low-emission cement. We include new insights into accelerated impacts of changes to Antarctic ice masses and air and water quality. We hope that anticipating and mitigating negative impacts, and making best use of new opportunities related to these issues, will contribute to better outcomes for biological diversity."
"Hip fractures in elderly individuals are associated with high mortality rates, even with advanced treatment options. Identifying factors correlated with mortality could guide potential preventive strategies. Elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, as well as the AST/ALT ratio (AAR), have been associated with mortality in various diseases, but their association with hip fracture mortality remains underexplored. This study investigates the correlation between AST, ALT, AAR, and routine laboratory parameters with 1-year mortality in elderly patients undergoing partial hip arthroplasty for femoral neck fractures."
"Migraine is associated with cervical artery dissection (CeAD). Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a multifunctional neuropeptide with vasodilatory effects. The use of anti-CGRP monoclonal antibodies (CGRP mAb) may affect cerebrovascular disease risk; however, no reports have associated CGRP mAb with CeAD."
"Medicare Advantage (MA) plans report diagnoses more completely than they are reported in traditional Medicare. As a result, payment to MA plans is greater than it would be if coding patterns were identical in the two sectors. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission estimates that the overpayment to MA attributable to differential coding was $50 billion in 2024. We analyzed potential changes aimed at reducing MA plan overpayments that occur as a result of differential diagnostic coding between MA and traditional Medicare-specifically, changes that would reduce payments to MA contracts that code most intensely. The contract-level equity and efficiency problems created by differential MA coding could be solved almost completely if the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services excluded ten diagnosis groups from the payment model. With these groups excluded, the average MA risk score would be similar to that of traditional Medicare, and there would be very little relationship between contract-level coding intensity and risk scores. However, this change would increase incentives for risk selection and reduce incentives to provide high-quality care to beneficiaries with diagnoses in the excluded groups. Policy makers will need to balance the ability to improve equity and efficiency in the MA payment system against concerns about increasing incentives for risk selection."
"The spatial and spectral properties of the light environment underpin many aspects of animal behaviour, ecology and evolution, and quantifying this information is crucial in fields ranging from optical physics, agriculture/plant sciences, human psychophysics, food science, architecture and materials sciences. The escalating threat of artificial light at night (ALAN) presents unique challenges for measuring the visual impact of light pollution, requiring measurement at low light levels across the human-visible and ultraviolet ranges, across all viewing angles, and often with high within-scene contrast."
Triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) peripheral tears with persistent wrist pain can be treated with arthroscopic surgical repair owing to vascularization of the peripheral region. The safety and efficacy of all-inside repair has been shown in prior case series. The purpose of this study was to compare two methods of arthroscopic peripheral TFCC repair: all-inside vertical mattress and outside-in horizontal mattress.

"The number of older adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) is increasing. Use of automated insulin delivery (AID) may influence nutrition and eating behaviors. We explored how three eating styles (restrained, external, emotional) differ between older adults with T1D who use and do not use AID."
"Sepsis is a condition capable of causing systemic inflammation and metabolic reprogramming. Previous studies have shown that sinomenine (SIN) can mitigate sepsis by reducing inflammation, while the effect on metabolic reprogramming is unclear. The aim of this study is to investigate the function of SIN in metabolic reprogramming in sepsis."
"Ovulation, the female reproductive process whereby fertilizable oocytes are released from a mature ovarian follicle, is widely seen in all animals that sexually reproduce. This paper reveals that, despite the remarkably diverse styles of ovulation among animal taxa, most ovulate via follicle rupture and suggests that the rupture process may operate via similar cellular mechanisms across animals."
"Chronic pain is widespread and carries a heavy disease burden, and there is a lack of effective outpatient pain management. As an emerging internet medical platform in China, internet hospitals have been successfully applied for the management of chronic diseases. There are also a certain number of patients with chronic pain that use internet hospitals for pain management. However, no studies have investigated the effectiveness of pain management via internet hospitals."
"Parkinson's disease (PD) involves both the central nervous system (CNS) and enteric nervous system (ENS), and their interaction is important for understanding both the clinical manifestations of the disease and the underlying disease pathophysiology. Although the neuroanatomical distribution of pathology strongly suggests that the ENS is involved in disease pathophysiology, there are significant gaps in knowledge about the underlying mechanisms. In this article, we review the clinical presentation and management of gastrointestinal dysfunction in PD. In addition, we discuss the current understanding of disease pathophysiology in the gut, including controversies about early involvement of the gut in disease pathogenesis. We also review current knowledge about gut α-synuclein and the microbiome, discuss experimental models of PD-linked gastrointestinal pathophysiology, and highlight areas for further research. Finally, we discuss opportunities to use the gut-brain axis for the development of biomarkers and disease-modifying treatments."
"The significance of multiplication rate variation in malaria parasites needs to be determined, particularly for Plasmodium falciparum, the species that causes most virulent infections. To investigate this, parasites from cases presenting to hospital in The Gambia and from local community infections were culture-established and then tested under exponential growth conditions in a standardised six-day multiplication rate assay. The multiplication rate distribution was lower than seen previously in clinical isolates from another area in West Africa where infection is more highly endemic. Multiplication rates were higher in cultured isolates derived from hospital cases (N = 23, mean = 2.9-fold per 48 h) than in those from community infections (N = 11, mean = 1.8-fold)(Mann-Whitney P < 0.001). There was a positive correlation between levels of parasitaemia in peripheral blood of sampled individuals and multiplication rates of the isolates in culture (Spearman's rho = 0.45, P = 0.017). There was no significant difference between isolates containing single parasite genotypes or multiple genotypes at the time of assay, suggesting that parasites do not modify their multiplication rates in response to the presence of different genotypes. It will be important to uncover the mechanisms of this intrinsic multiplication rate variation, and to also investigate the epidemiological distribution and potential associations with infection phenotypes in other populations."
"This study aimed to investigate the diagnostic value of 7-tumor associated autoantibodies (7-TAAB) and to evaluate the relationship between 7-TAAB and clinical features in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), which can be used to guide clinical diagnosis and treatment and achieve its clinical value."
"Pulmonary perfusion defects have been observed in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Currently, there is a need for further data on non-contrast-enhanced MRI in COVID patients. The early identification of heterogeneity in pulmonary perfusion defects among COVID-19 patients is beneficial for their timely clinical intervention and management."
"In the past decade, a variety of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are currently approved for lung cancer in the world. As a new therapeutic approach, ICIs have shown significant clinical benefits in the first-line or second-line treatment for advanced lung cancer, improving the survival and quality of life of patients. Patients need to take multiple drugs in the meantime due to their own disease or side effects during treatment. In view of drug interactions, concomitant medications have a positive or negative impact on the prognosis of lung cancer patients. In this review, we reviewed the effects of multiple drugs on the prognosis of patients with lung cancer taking ICIs. Several studies indicate that antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), corticosteroids, and opioid analgesics can decrease the efficacy of ICIs. Aspirin and bone-targeting drugs can enhance the efficacy of ICIs and improve the survival rate. The effects of metformin (MET), renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (RASI), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAIDS) (except aspirin), and statins on ICIs are controversial. Future research should further explore the effects of these concomitant medications on ICIs and develop personalized prescriptions based on the specific needs of patients."
"A data transmission delay compensation algorithm for an interactive communication network of an offshore oil field operation scene in severe weather is proposed. To solve the problem of unstable microwave signals and a large amount of noise in the communication network caused by bad weather, the communication network signal denoising method based on Lagrange multiplier symplectic singular value mode decomposition is adopted, and the communication network data denoising process is realized through five steps; phase space reconstruction, symplectic geometric similarity transformation, grouping, diagonal averaging, and adaptive reconstruction. Simultaneously, the weak communication signal is compensated after being captured, that is, the characteristics of the weak signal are enhanced. On this basis, the communication network signals are collected to obtain delay information, and the data transmission delay of the communication network is predicted using the neural network algorithm based on long-term and short-term memory; Based on the prediction result of transmission delay, the PID controller is used to calculate the transmission delay compensation amount of the communication network, and the calculation result of the compensation amount is input into the delay compensator to realize transmission delay compensation. The experimental results show that the algorithm can effectively improve the quality of data transmission in the communication network and has a good delay compensation effect to ensure real-time communication."
"Despite progress in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) treatment, challenges persist in medication adherence due to side effects and costs. Precision nutrition, particularly adjusting fatty acid intake, offers a cost-effective strategy for enhancing SLE management. Prior research, including our own, indicates that increased consumption of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) correlates with improved outcomes in SLE patients. Here we build upon these findings by investigating associations between serum fatty acids-grouped as PUFAs, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), and saturated fatty acids (SFAs)-and lupus activity, pain, and sleep disturbance."
"Bovine viral diarrhea (BVD) is a highly infectious disease affecting cattle, leading to significant economic losses in many countries engaged in cattle production. From February 2022 to October 2022, a study was conducted to determine the seroprevalence and associated risk factors of Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus (BVDV) in the Sebeta subcity area of Sheger city, Ethiopia. The study utilized a semi-structured questionnaire to gather information on herd management practices from dairy farm owners. Serum samples from 170 individual cattle across 34 herds were collected and tested for BVDV antibodies using the indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The prevalence of BVD antibodies at both the animal and herd levels was analyzed, and potential risk factors were identified using Chi-square analysis and logistic regression. The study found that 19.41% of individual cattle (33 out of 170) and 44.12% of herds were positive for BVDV antibodies. Multiple logistic regression analysis identified several significant risk factors associated with BVDV infection. Multiparous dairy cows were found to be 2.3 times more likely to be seropositive compared to primiparous and nulliparous cows. Crossbreed dairy cattle had double the odds of being seropositive compared to pure breeds. Additionally, cattle from larger herds were 5.01 times more likely to be seropositive than those from smaller herds. Farms that introduced new animals had triple the odds of seropositivity compared to those that did not. The study indicates a high exposure rate of cattle to BVDV infection in and around Sebeta sub-city. Further research is recommended to explore the molecular epidemiology of BVDV in the region."
"The incidence and mortality rates of cervical cancer are increasing among young Japanese women. In November 2021, the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare reinstated the active recommendation of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, after it had been suspended in June 2013 due to reports of adverse reactions. However, vaccine hesitancy is prevalent in the younger generation in Japan. To identify obstacles to vaccine uptake, we conducted a randomized study using different methods to provide educational content to improve health literacy regarding cervical cancer and HPV vaccination among Japanese female students. We surveyed 188 Japanese female students, divided into three groups according to the intervention: no intervention, print-based intervention, and social networking service-based intervention. Twenty questionnaires and the Communicative and Critical Health Literacy scales were used as health literacy scales. Participants' knowledge and health literacy improved regardless of the method of education. In fact, participants acquired proper knowledge when given the opportunity to learn about the importance of the disease and its prevention. Therefore, medical professionals in Japan must provide accurate scientific knowledge regarding routine HPV vaccination and the risk of cervical cancer in young women to improve their health literacy and subsequently increase HPV vaccination rates in Japan, which may lead to cervical cancer elimination. Trial registration number: UMIN000036636."
"Numerical modeling offers a valuable alternative to analytical solutions for pumping test analysis. However, little is known about how discretization impacts results accuracy and runtime. This study presents a systematic method for defining the spatiotemporal discretization of pumping test numerical models based on dimensionless parameters. Two types of analysis are considered: one where observations are made in the pumping well, and another one where observations are made in different wells. The influence of the discretization parameters on results accuracy and runtime is investigated and an optimal set of parameters is determined that minimizes runtime while maintaining the maximum error under 1% for an ""average"" aquifer. Lower runtimes are achieved when the analysis focuses on the pumping well, which is attributed to the steady-state analytical solution approximating drawdown in the well in the numerical scheme employed. Additional tests demonstrate the robustness of the derived set of parameters in different configurations."
"Deep language models (DLMs) have exhibited remarkable language understanding and generation capabilities, prompting researchers to explore the similarities between their internal mechanisms and human language cognitive processing. This study investigated the representational similarity (RS) between the abstractive summarization (ABS) models and the human brain and its correlation to the performance of ABS tasks. Specifically, representational similarity analysis (RSA) was used to measure the similarity between the representational patterns (RPs) of the BART, PEGASUS, and T5 models' hidden layers and the human brain's language RPs under different spatiotemporal conditions. Layer-wise ablation manipulation, including attention ablation and noise addition was employed to examine the hidden layers' effect on model performance. The results demonstrate that as the depth of hidden layers increases, the models' text encoding becomes increasingly similar to the human brain's language RPs. Manipulating deeper layers leads to more substantial decline in summarization performance compared to shallower layers, highlighting the crucial role of deeper layers in integrating essential information. Notably, the study confirms the hypothesis that the hidden layers exhibiting higher similarity to human brain activity play a more critical role in model performance, with their correlations reaching statistical significance even after controlling for perplexity. These findings deepen our understanding of the cognitive mechanisms underlying language representations in DLMs and their neural correlates, potentially providing insights for optimizing and improving language models by aligning them with the human brain's language-processing mechanisms."
"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by chronic bronchitis and emphysema, and current drug treatments is limited to symptomatic therapy. Thus, there is an urgent need for development of new treatments to repair alveolar destruction. To regenerate the destroyed alveoli, we focused on the differentiation of alveolar epithelial progenitor cells into type I or type II alveolar epithelial cells that constitute the alveoli. Our concept of alveolar regeneration therapy is based on developing a drug delivery system (DDS) and dry powder inhalation that can efficiently deliver new alveolar regeneration drugs, which were discovered using human alveolar epithelial progenitor cells, to stem cells present on the surface of the alveoli of COPD patients, thereby inducing alveolar regeneration. This review article summarizes our data on the discovery of the synthetic retinoid Am80 as a candidate drug for alveolar regeneration, the construction of a DDS that utilizes a biological mechanism that enhances its effect on alveolar regeneration, and the formulation design of a dry powder inhalation."
"Measurement feedback systems (MFS) can help guide treatment and improve clinical outcomes. Studies of MFS are heterogeneous both in execution and results, and the effects of MFS seem restricted by limited attention to process and implementation elements and by limited adoption by health professionals. The current systematic review mapped the use of process and implementation elements in MFS studies. An overview of therapists' use of and attitudes toward MFS is provided. Three-level meta-analyses were used to test theoretically informed process and implementation elements as moderators of the effects of MFS. Hypotheses and general propositions from Clinical Performance Feedback Intervention Theory (CP-FIT) were used to organize the elements of the studies and were used as moderator variables. Previous studies on MFS interventions have had a limited focus on implementation efforts and process elements that may increase the effects of MFS and their use among therapists. Efforts have sparsely been made to reduce barriers to MFS use, and several studies have reported limited engagement with MFS among therapists. Therapists' attitudes toward MFS, feedback, or standardized measures were heterogeneously reported, making data synthesis challenging. Identified process and implementation elements were not significantly associated with effect sizes in the studies and the results did not support the propositions of CP-FIT. The lack of statistically significant associations may be due to limited reporting of details about process and implementation aspects. More research designed to test hypotheses regarding process and implementation elements is needed to improve the use and effects of MFS. Future studies should aspire to report findings in a manner that allows for an understanding of the implementation process and therapists' adoption of these systems."
This research explored arousal levels as a motivating factor for solitude-seeking. We hypothesized that solitude becomes more desirable when high-arousal emotions were heightened and individual differences in extraversion and neuroticism would moderate this pattern.
"Skeletal muscle regeneration upon injury requires timely activation of inflammatory, myogenic, fibrotic, apoptotic and anabolic systems. Optimization of these features might improve the recovery process. Whereas recent data indicate that the endocannabinoid system, and more particularly cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) antagonism, is involved in the regulation of inflammatory, myogenic, fibrotic, apoptotic and anabolic pathways, it was never studied whether CB1 antagonism can improve muscle regeneration. The present study investigated the effect of the CB1 antagonist Rimonabant (10 mg/kg/d) on functional (5 days post-cardiotoxin injury; 5DPI) and molecular muscle responses (3DPI and 7DPI) in mice. Rimonabant prevented cardiotoxin-induced muscle strength loss 5DPI, increased myofiber growth (7DPI) and improved the muscle molecular profile 3DPI and 7DPI. In general, inflammation (e.g. p-p65NF-κB, CD80) and apoptosis (e.g. cleaved caspase-3, cleaved PARP) were downregulated by Rimonabant, whereas it upregulated the expression of Pax7 but other myogenic factors remained unaffected by rimonabant. In addition, Rimonabant restored the injury-induced (inflammatory) lipid profile to a large extent, including oxygenated fatty acids, unsaturated fatty acids and endocannabinoids such as 2-arachidonoyl glycerol and palmitoylethanolamide. Altogether, these data show that the endocannabinoid system might be a novel therapeutic target to improve muscle regeneration, which is relevant for age- and disease-related muscle degeneration."
"Treatment of severely injured patients represents a major challenge, in part due to the unpredictable risk of major adverse events, including death. Preemptive personalized treatment aimed at preventing these events is a crucial objective of patient management; however, the currently available scoring systems provide only moderate guidance. Biomarkers from proteomics/peptidomics studies hold promise for improving the current situation, ultimately enabling precision medicine based on individual molecular profiles. To test the hypothesis that peptide biomarkers could predict patient outcomes in severely injured patients, we initiated a pilot study involving consecutive urine sampling (on days 0, 2, 5, 10, and 14) and subsequent peptidome analysis using capillary electrophoresis coupled to mass spectrometry (CE-MS) of 14 severely injured patients and two additional intensive care unit patients. The urine peptidomes of these patients were compared to those of age- and sex-matched controls. Moreover, previously established urinary peptide-based classifiers, CKD273, AKI204, and Cov50, were applied to the obtained peptidome data, and the association of the classifier's scores with a combined endpoint (death and/or kidney failure and/or respiratory insufficiency) was investigated. CE-MS peptidome analysis identified 191 significantly altered peptides in severely injured patients. A consistent increase in the abundance of peptides from A1AT, AHSG, and HBA1 was observed, while peptides derived from PIGR and UROM were consistently decreased. Most of the significant peptides (adjusted p < 0.05) were from COL1A1, and most were reduced in abundance. Two of the previously defined and validated peptidomic classifiers, CKD273 and AKI204, showed significant associations with the combined endpoint, which was not observed for the routine scores generally applied in the clinics. This prospective pilot study confirmed the hypothesis that urinary peptides provide information on patient outcomes and may guide personalized interventions in severely injured patients based on individual molecular changes. The results obtained allow the planning of a well-powered prospective trial investigating the value of urinary peptides in this context in more detail."
Anti-phage defense systems are widespread in bacteria due to the latter continuous adaptation to infection by bacteriophages (phages).
"Marine microbial communities colonizing the skin of invertebrates constitute the primary barrier between host and environment, potentially exerting beneficial, neutral, or detrimental effects on host fitness. To evaluate the potential contribution of epibiotic bacteria to the survival of early developmental stages of Octopus mimus, bacterial isolates were obtained from eggs, paralarvae, and adults. Their enzymatic activities were determined, and antibacterial properties were assessed against common marine pathogens. The isolates belonged to the phyla Proteobacteria, Actinomycetota, Bacteroidota, and Bacillota, represented by 21 genera and 27 species. Specific taxa were associated with each developmental stage, with only three species shared among different stages: Bacillus pumilus, B. megaterium, and Shewanella algae, which also inhibited the growth of all assayed pathogens. Organic extracts from Bacillus megaterium M8-1 were obtained, and UHPLC-MS analysis detected seventeen putative compounds, including two phenolic acids, three indole derivatives, and twelve oxylipins. Our findings provide novel data on cultivable bacterial representatives isolated from Octopus mimus capable of synthesizing chemical compounds with bioactive properties. These results contribute to a better understanding of the role of microbial communities in the survival of this invertebrate species during critical early life stages."
"In laser safety eyewear, due to the lack of complete blocking of ultraviolet and infrared rays, we proposed a structure based on one-dimensional multilayer composed of several layers of silicon dioxide and zirconium dioxide materials alternately behind polycarbonate lens. It is find out that the acceptance angle range to the photonic crystal is 0 to 39°. This incident angle range corresponds to the band gap of the photonic crystal. In the transverse electric polarization, with increasing incident angle, the width of the gap rises, while in the transverse magnetic polarization decreases. Our results show that in the transverse electric mode, the optical density gradually increases with increasing angle while it decreases in the transverse magnetic one. The higher optical density, the higher eye protection at specified wavelength. If the incident wavelength is placed in the band gap region, the field intensity gradually decays. Therefore, the proposed structure for laser safety eyewear can provide the maximum reflection on the surface of the lens. Our supposed structure for safety eyewear can be used in infrared lasers."
"Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived biological pacemakers have emerged as an alternative to traditional electronic pacemakers for managing cardiac arrhythmias. While effective, electronic pacemakers face challenges such as device failure, lead complications, and surgical risks, particularly in children. iPSC-derived pacemakers offer a promising solution by mimicking the sinoatrial node's natural pacemaking function, providing a more physiological approach to rhythm control. These cells can differentiate into cardiomyocytes capable of autonomous electrical activity, integrating into heart tissue. However, challenges such as achieving cellular maturity, long-term functionality, and immune response remain significant barriers to clinical translation. Future research should focus on refining gene-editing techniques, optimizing differentiation, and developing scalable production processes to enhance the safety and effectiveness of these biological pacemakers. With further advancements, iPSC-derived pacemakers could offer a patient-specific, durable alternative for cardiac rhythm management. This review discusses key advancements in differentiation protocols and preclinical studies, demonstrating their potential in treating dysrhythmias."

"Prior mental healthcare utilisation presents an important window of opportunity for providing suicide prevention interventions. To date, no reviews have consolidated the help-seeking needs of individuals in contact with mental health services. This warrants further attention given this group may have different needs for interventions compared with the general population who have not sought help previously."
"In response to iron deficiency and other environmental stressors, cyanobacteria producing siderophores can help in ameliorating plant stress and enhancing growth physiological and biochemical processes. The objective of this work was to screen the potential of Arthrospira platensis, Pseudanabaena limnetica, Nostoc carneum, and Synechococcus mundulus for siderophore production to select the most promising isolate, then to examine the potentiality of the isolated siderophore in promoting Zea mays seedling growth in an iron-limited environment."
"Eosinophilic pneumonia is a known side effect of dupilumab; however, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage has not yet been reported in association with dupilumab. We herein report a case of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage caused by dupilumab. A 57-year-old man with severe asthma was unable to discontinue oral steroids and thus was prescribed dupilumab. The patient was admitted to the hospital four weeks after treatment because of suspected eosinophilic pneumonia. Bronchoscopy revealed diffuse alveolar hemorrhage characterized by hemosiderin-phagocytic macrophages in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid without eosinophils. The steroid dosage improved the respiratory status and resolved the infiltrate shadow. Dupilumab may thus cause diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, which can be differentiated using bronchoscopy."
"Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurobiological condition that affects both children and adults. Microstate (MS) analyses, a data-driven approach that identifies stable patterns in EEG signals, offer valuable insights into the neurophysiological characteristics of ADHD. This review summarizes findings from 13 studies that applied MS analyses to resting-state and task-based brain activity in individuals with ADHD. Relevant research articles were retrieved from electronic databases, including PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, PsychInfo, and Scopus. The reviewed studies applied MS analyses to explore brain activity differences in ADHD populations. Resting-state studies consistently reported alterations in MS organization, with increased duration (MS-D) and changes in temporal dynamics (MS-C), potentially reflecting executive dysfunctions and delayed maturation of the default mode network. Additionally, MS B demonstrated promise in distinguishing between ADHD subtypes based on differences in visual network function. Task-based and event-related potential (ERP) studies, using paradigms like the continuous performance task (CPT) or Go-NoGo Task, identified MS abnormalities (i.e., N2, P2, P3, CNV) linked to inhibition and attentional resource allocation. Preliminary evidence suggests that MS analyses hold potential for distinguishing individuals with ADHD from control groups. The integration of machine learning techniques holds promise for improving diagnostic accuracy and identifying ADHD subtypes, while MS analyses may also help monitor the effects of stimulant medications like methylphenidate by tracking neurophysiological changes. However, this review highlights the need for more standardized methodologies to enhance the generalizability and replicability of findings. These efforts will ultimately contribute to a deeper understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms that underlie ADHD."

"Gram-negative (G-) microflora dysbiosis occurs in multiple digestive tumors and is found to be the dominant microflora in the esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) microenvironment. The continuous stimulation of G- bacterium metabolites may cause tumorigenesis and reshape the microimmune environment in ESCC. However, the mechanism of G- bacilli causing immune evasion in ESCC remains underexplored. We identified CC chemokine receptor 1 (CCR1) as a tumor-indicating gene in ESCC. Interestingly, expression levels of CCR1 and PD-L1 were mutually upregulated after G- bacilli metabolite lipopolysaccharide stimulation. First, we found that CCR1 high expression levels were associated with poor overall survival in ESCC. Importantly, we found that high levels of CCR1 expression upregulated PD-L1 expression by activating MAPK phosphorylation in ESCC and induced tumor malignant behavior. Finally, we found that T-cell exhaustion and cytotoxicity suppression were associated with CCR1 expression in ESCC, which were decreased after CCR1 inhibiting. Our work identifies CCR1 as a potential immune check point regulator of PD-L1 and may cause T-cell exhaustion and cytotoxicity suppression in ESCC microenvironment and highlights the potential value of CCR1 as a therapeutic target of immunotherapy. Implications: The esophageal microbial environment and its metabolites significantly affect the outcome of immunotherapy for ESCC."

"The concept of using diet as therapy in inflammatory bowel disease is of interest to clinicians and patients. Once considered to play a minor role, diet is now known to not only affect disease onset but may also serve as a therapeutic tool for inducing and maintaining remission and improving surgical outcomes. Further research is needed to fully elucidate how, when, and in whom diet therapies may be best applied to improve clinical and disease outcomes. The aim of this review was to summarize current research findings and serve as a tool to help facilitate patient-clinician conversations."
"Chemical fungicides have been used to control fungal diseases like Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. These fungicides must be restricted because of their toxicity and the development of resistance strains. Therefore, utilizing natural nanoscale materials in agricultural production is a potential alternative. This work aimed to investigate the antifungal properties of a nanocomposite (nano-chitosan-coated, green-synthesized selenium nanoparticles) against the plant pathogenic fungus S. sclerotiorum. Chemical reduction was used to produce selenium nanoparticles from citrus peel extracts, and ionotropic gelation was used to produce chitosan nanoparticles. The nanocomposite has been produced using selenium nanoparticles stabilized by chitosan and cross-linked with sodium tripolyphosphate. Transmission electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering, X-ray diffraction, UV-VIS spectroscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy were used to characterize all produced nanostructures. The in vitro antifungal activity and minimum inhibitory concentration of all bulk and nanostructures are investigated at (0.5, 1, 5, 10, 50, 100) ppm concentrations. Scanning electron microscopy was used to detect structural deformations in the fungal mycelium. The findings support the successful synthesis and characterization of all nanoparticles. Lemon peel extract produced smaller, more stable, and distributed selenium nanoparticles (42.28 ± 18.5 nm) than orange peel extract (85.7 ± 140.22 nm). Nanostructures, particularly nanocomposite, have shown a considerable increase in antifungal efficacy compared to bulk structures. At a minimum inhibitory concentration of 0.5 ppm, the nanocomposite exhibited 100% inhibitory activity. The nanocomposite with a concentration of 0.5 ppm exhibited the lowest average fungal biomass (0.32 ± 0.05 g) among all tested nanostructures. Fungal hyphae treated with 0.5 ppm of nanocomposite within 18 h of treatment revealed substantial damage and deformation. These results provide new insights into the nanocomposite as an eco-friendly and promising antifungal agent against other plant pathogenic fungi."

"The collections of human remains within our university laboratories and classrooms are considered by many to be integral to teaching osteology. However, as an outgrowth of the Western scientific tradition of mind/body dualism, human remains within skeletal teaching collections are often regarded differently than those in museums or applied contexts. From processing to storage, the personhood of each individual becomes abstracted as we purchase, ""inherit,"" handle, organize, and digitally scan their bones for teaching purposes. In this way, skeletons within teaching collections are ontologically transformed from people to objects. The objectification of human bodies is rooted in Enlightenment era scientific practices that are directly connected to colonialism and white supremacy. Here, we argue that the anonymization of the skeletons of people in academic institutions, and the maintenance of non-consent-based skeletal collections, perpetuates structural violence on the deceased and their descendant communities. We critically examine the origins and ethics of non-consent-based anatomical teaching collections and discuss the violence within these assemblages. Finally, we develop practical steps toward a more humanistic and ethical osteological classroom and pedagogy. Suggested strategies include ceasing the use of skeletal individuals for whom consent is unknown or non-existent and instead using only skeletal or replica skeletal materials from those who have donated or willed their bodies and engaging with critical pedagogical perspectives to challenge norms in our field."

"Surgical planning for anterior shoulder instability (ASI) necessitates accurate measurements of glenoid bone defects, but current methods are either challenging or too complex for practical use. This underscores the need for a simplified, but precise, assessment technique for anterior glenoid bone defects."
"Cenobamate is a novel anti-seizure medication (ASM) with unusually high responder rates even in patients with refractory epilepsy. Due to its enzyme-inducing properties, cenobamate could negatively affect bone metabolism, similar to other ASMs; however, effects of long-term cenobamate treatment on bone health have not yet been investigated. The aim of this longitudinal observational study was to assess the effects of 1 year of continuous, adjunctive cenobamate treatment on bone health in patients with drug-resistant, focal epilepsy."
"R-spondin3 (RSPO3), a mammalian-specific amplifier of WNT signaling pathway, maintains the homeostasis of various adult stem cells. However, its expression at the limbus and the effect on limbal epithelial stem cells (LESCs) remains unclear. We investigated the impact of RSPO3 on the proliferation and self-renewal of LESCs and explored its molecular mechanisms."
"Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a sympathetic neurotransmitter widely distributed in the peripheral and central nervous system, affecting many physiological functions. Consequently, dysregulation of the NPY system contributes to numerous pathological disorders, including stress, obesity, and cancer. The pleiotropic functions of NPY in humans are mediated by G protein-coupled receptors (Y1R, Y2R, Y5R), which activate several signaling pathways and thereby regulate cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, proliferation, angiogenesis, and metabolism. These activities of NPY are highly relevant to tumor biology and known hallmarks of cancer, including sustained proliferative potential, resisting cell death, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastases. In this comprehensive review, we describe the cellular functions of NPY and discuss its role in cancer pathobiology, as well as provide the current state of knowledge pertaining to NPY and its receptors in various cancer types. Moreover, we focus on potential clinical applications targeting the NPY system, such as its role as a prognostic and predictive factor, as well as its utility in cancer diagnostics, imaging, and treatment. Altogether, growing evidence supports the significant role of the NPY system in tumor pathobiology and implicates its potential therapeutic and diagnostic value in modern oncology."

"BitterDB (http://bitterdb.agri.huji.ac.il) was introduced in 2012 as a central resource for information on bitter-tasting molecules and their receptors, and was updated in 2019. The information in BitterDB is used for tasks such as exploring the bitter chemical space, choosing suitable ligands for experimental studies, analyzing receptors' selectivity and promiscuity, and developing machine learning predictors for taste. Here, we describe a major upgrade of the database, including significant increase in content as well as new features. BitterDB now holds over 2200 bitter molecules. For ∼700 molecules, at least one associated bitter taste receptor (TAS2R) is reported. The overall number of ligand-TAS2R associations is now close to 1800. BitterDB is extended to a total of 66 species (including dog, birds, fishes and primates). Following advances in computational structure prediction by AlphaFold and related methods, and the experimental determination of TAS2R structures by cryo-electron microscopy, BitterDB provides links to available structures of TAS2Rs."
"Despite multiple years of government HIV educational efforts, the growing trend of new cases among women in Indonesia runs parallel with their seemingly overall lack of comprehensive knowledge about HIV. A major prevention challenge for the Indonesian government lies in delivering HIV prevention education across the world's largest archipelago. This study investigates comprehensive HIV knowledge among reproductive-age women in Southwest Sumba, Indonesia, and the sources through which they report having learned about HIV along with potential mediators of the relationship between socioeconomic status (SES) and HIV knowledge."

"The Alismataceae family, widely distributed across tropical temperate swamps and wetlands, includes 15 genera post-merger with Limnocharitaceae. In Argentina, six genera are represented across three clades. Embryological characters, notably the male gametophyte and anther, are crucial in taxonomy due to their stability against environmental changes. This study aims to analyze the ultrastructure of the tapetum and pollen grain development in three economically and ecologically important species representing each clade: Sagittaria montevidensis (Clade A), Hydrocleys nymphoides (Clade B), and Alisma plantago-aquatica (Clade C). Anthers at different developmental stages were processed according to classic techniques for their observation with bright-field and transmission electron microscopy. The three studied species within the Alismataceae family exhibit similar reproductive characteristics. Seven stages of pollen grain development were identified. The microsporogenesis is successive with a regular meiosis. The ultrastructure of the tapetal cells shows similarities to other species with plasmodial tapetum. During the microspore tetrad stage, there is tapetal hyperactivity and an increase in secretion processes. In the free microspore stage, the tapetal cells lose their walls and increase the amount of rough endoplasmic reticulum forming a network of cisternae that extend into evaginations. Later cells completely invade the anther locule and fuse to form a tapetal plasmodium. No peritapetal membrane with orbicules was observed. Pollen is released at the tricellular stage. The pollen grain wall presents an ectexine with a basal layer, columellae, and tectum with supratectal spines while an endexine is not observed in any of the three species. This research enhances the understanding of tapetal cell interactions with developing pollen grains and contributes to the knowledge of the ultrastructure of plasmodial tapetum. Moreover, these findings highlight evolutionary reproductive patterns in Alismataceae, suggesting the plasmodial tapetum as a synapomorphy for the order."
"The PAX5 (paired box 5) gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a critical role in B-cell development. PAX5 rearrangement is a recurrent abnormality seen in about 1.0-2.5% of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) cases. In this study, we presented 3 cases of B-ALL harboring PAX5::ZCCHC7 rearrangement. We subsequently reviewed the literature and identified 45 additional B-ALL cases with PAX5::ZCCHC7. Our data showed that the majority of B-ALL patients with PAX5::ZCCHC7 were observed in various subtypes of B-ALL, including BCR::ABL1-like, BCR::ABL1, ETV6::RUNX1 and others. In B-ALL, PAX5::ZCCHC7 was always co-occur with other subtype-defining rearrangements, which as the sole abnormality in only 8 patients, with the remaining 34 patients harboring CRLF2, JAK2, TCF3 or other rearrangements. In PAX5::ZCCHC7, the PAX5 breakpoints are mainly between exon 1 and 2 (30/51). As a result, nearly all PAX5 protein domains are lost in PAX5::ZCCHC7, suggesting that the PAX5::ZCCHC7 seems to disrupt PAX5 similarly to a PAX5 deletion. In summary, the PAX5::ZCCHC7 is a recurrent genetic aberration in B-ALL and seems to act as an additional genetic abnormality of subtype-defining aberration. Whether the PAX5::ZCCHC7 could act as a leukemia-initiating event or not needs further investigation."

"Chemokines are vital in post-cerebral ischemia inflammatory reactions. We investigate the possible relationship between plasma chemokines and short-term and long-term outcomes after stroke. This study included 235 patients (median age, 72 years; 49.8% female) suffering from ischemic stroke, or transient ischemic attack admitted to the hospital within 24 h of onset. We evaluated chemokines CCL2, CCL5, CXCL8, CXCL9, and CXCL10 in plasma samples collected upon admission. Further, we assessed functional outcomes at 3- and 12-months, all-cause fatality over 5 years, and episodes of delirium within the first 7 days of admission. Multivariate analysis revealed an association between higher CXCL10 levels and an increased risk of poor functional outcomes at 3 months (OR: 3.02, 95%CI: 1.22-7.46, p = 0.016) and 12 months (OR: 2.32, 95%CI: 1.03-5.26, p = 0.043), as well as an increased death risk (HR: 1.79, 95%CI: 1.04-3.07, p = 0.036). High CXCL8 levels independently predicted poor functional outcomes at 12 months (OR: 2.69, 95%CI: 1.39-6.31, p = 0.005) and a higher 5-year case fatality rate (HR: 1.90, 95%CI: 1.23-2.93, p = 0.004). Elevated CXCL9 levels also predicted unfavourable functional outcomes at 12 months (OR: 2.45, 95%CI: 1.07-5.61, p = 0.034). In univariate analysis, increased levels of CXCL8, CXCL9, and CXCL10 showed an association with delirium, although this link was not evident in the multivariate analysis. Plasma CXCL8 and CXCL10 show potential as prognostic biomarkers for stroke outcomes and as therapeutic targets suitable for reverse translation."

"WHAT IS KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT?: The insecure attachment styles are associated with mental health problems and can influence reality perception, particularly in individuals with schizophrenia. WHAT THE PAPER ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: The paper provides empirical evidence for the correlation between insecure attachment styles and reality-testing impairment in clients with schizophrenia. Higher reality testing impairment scores were observed in specific demographics: males who were unmarried and aged between 40 and 50 years old, as well as those with a duration of illness of less than 5 years. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: The findings underscore the importance for nurses to understand insecure attachment styles, particularly anxious and avoidant styles, in clients with schizophrenia. Healthcare providers and nurses should understand the psychological dynamics of clients with insecure attachment styles to establish effective therapeutic relationships. A secure, structured and consistent environment is vital to modifying insecure attachment styles and promoting reality orientation. Secure Attachment Style Psycho-Educational Program, Mentalization, Cognitive Interpersonal Therapy, and Cognitive Analytic Therapy can help reduce reality-testing impairment. Imply early intervention through educating mothers on fostering secure bonds can potentially prevent future occurrences of schizophrenia. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH?: Conducting empirical studies to explore the associations between insecure attachment style, social functioning, and poor service engagement is essential. Research is needed to investigate specific techniques for managing insecure attachment styles, particularly the avoidant ones, and reality testing impairments within the therapeutic setting."
"Inflammation has been reported to drive cancer-related fatigue (CRF). As both obesity and chemotherapy promote inflammatory responses, obese cancer patients may be at risk of more severe CRF, especially when receiving chemotherapy."
"Response to BH3 mimetics in multiple myeloma (MM) correlates with CCND1-rearrangement or expression of anti-apoptotic molecules, particularly Bcl-2 and Mcl-1. Our study investigates the relationship between cytogenetic abnormalities (CGAs) and intracellular Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 expression in myeloma plasma cells (MPCs) using flow cytometry (FCM). We measured median fluorescence intensity (MFI) of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 in 163 bone marrow samples (143 MM, 20 controls) across various cell types. Both Bcl-2MFI and Mcl-1MFI were significantly higher in MPCs compared to other cells, with Bcl-2 MFI exceeding Mcl-1 MFI in MPCs. Bcl-2 expression peaked in CCND1-rearranged cases, while Mcl-1 expression was highest in cases with 1q21 gain/amplification. Notably, 65-74% of cases with other CGAs exhibited moderate to strong Bcl-2 or Mcl-1 expression, indicating potential utility of BH3 mimetics in this group, while 25% showed dim to absent expression of one or both markers, suggesting potential futility in these patients. Our study highlights FCM's potential for rapid Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 quantification, surpassing traditional methods. We propose that direct measurement of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 expression in PCs by FCM, combined with cytogenetic characterization, could improve therapeutic decision-making regarding the use of BH3 mimetics in MM, potentially enhancing outcomes and overcoming resistance."
"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common malignant disease worldwide, and its incidence is increasing, but the molecular mechanisms of this disease are highly heterogeneous and still far from being fully understood. Increasing evidence suggests that fibrosis mediated by abnormal activation of fibroblasts based in the microenvironment is associated with a poor prognosis. However, the function and pathogenic mechanisms of fibroblasts in CRC remain unclear. Here, combining scrna-seq and clinical specimen data, DAZ Interacting Protein 1 (DZIP1) was found to be expressed on fibroblasts and cancer cells and positively correlated with stromal deposition. Importantly, pseudotime-series analysis showed that DZIP1 levels were up-regulated in malignant transformation of fibroblasts and experimentally confirmed that DZIP1 modulates activation of fibroblasts and promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in tumor cells. Further studies showed that DZIP1 expressed by tumor cells also has a driving effect on EMT and contributes to the recruitment of more fibroblasts. A similar phenomenon was observed in xenografted nude mice. And it was confirmed in xenograft mice that downregulation of DZIP1 expression significantly delayed tumor formation and reduced tumor size in CRC cells. Taken together, our findings suggested that DZIP1 was a regulator of the CRC mesenchymal phenotype. The revelation of targeting DZIP1 provides a new avenue for CRC therapy."
Whether fetal cardiothoracic ratio (CTR) is constant or increasing with gestational age (GA) is controversial. The majority of the fetal CTR data has been obtained through ultrasound.
"Suicide prevention requires risk identification, intervention, and follow-up. Traditional risk identification relies on patient self-reporting, support network reporting, or face-to-face screening. Statistical risk models have been studied and some have been deployed to augment clinical judgment. Few have been tested in clinical practice via clinical decision support (CDS). Barriers to effective CDS include potential alert burden for a stigmatized clinical problem and lack of data on how best to integrate scalable risk models into clinical workflows."
"The objective of this study is to investigate the association between the Systemic Immune-Inflammation Index (SII) and cataracts. This cross-sectional study analyzed data from the 2005-2008 NHANES to examine the relationship between the SII and cataract prevalence. Covariates included age, race/ethnicity, gender, education level, marital status, Body Mass Index (BMI), smoking, alcohol consumption, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the association, while spline curve fitting explored potential non-linear relationships. Threshold analysis identified critical inflection points. To address age-related bias, Propensity Score Matching (PSM) was performed, aligning cataract patients with comparable non-cataract individuals for further evaluation. Our study included 3,623 participants, of whom 730 (20.15%) were diagnosed with cataracts. After adjusting for all covariates, multivariable logistic regression analysis demonstrated that elevated levels of the SII were significantly associated with increased odds of cataracts (Model1: OR = 1.56; 95%CI [1.33-1.85]; Model2: OR = 1.55; 95%CI [1.32-1.84]; Model3: OR = 1.57; 95%CI [1.33-1.86]). In the spline curve fitting model, the relationship between ln-SII and cataract prevalence was non-linear (P < 0.001), with a critical inflection point identified at an SII of 428.38. SII levels remained significantly associated with cataract prevalence following PSM adjustments (Model 1: OR = 1.48; 95% CI [1.21-1.80]; Model 2: OR = 1.48; 95% CI [1.21-1.80]; Model 3: OR = 1.46; 95% CI [1.20-1.78]). Elevated SII levels are associated with a higher prevalence of cataracts, underscoring the pivotal role of systemic inflammation in cataract development. These findings indicate that SII could serve as a valuable biomarker for assessing cataract risk, further emphasizing the significance of managing systemic inflammation as a potential strategy for cataract prevention."
"Cervical cancer (CC) is a malignant tumor in females characterized by high incidence and mortality rates, often resulting in a poor prognosis for patients. Zoledronic acid (ZA), a third-generation bisphosphonate, exhibits anti-tumor properties across various types of tumors. To further understand the effect of ZA in the treatment of CC, this article included two kinds of human CC cells (CCCs) as the research object, examining the impact of varying levels of ZA on the cells' biological properties. Hela and Siha were cultivated and exposed to ZA at 0, 50, 100, and 200 μM, and the changes of cell proliferation, clone formation, migration, and invasion characteristics were detected. Cell RNA was extracted to detect epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the relative expression (RE) of AKT/GSK3β/β-catenin (β-cat) pathway related proteins. The results show that as against 0 μM, the proliferation rate, clone formation cell number, migration distance, and invasive cell number of Hela and Siha were markedly reduced, while E-cadherin (E-cad) was markedly enhanced. N-cadherin (N-cad), vimentin (Vim), p-AKT, p-GSK3β, and β-cat were markedly decreased at 50, 100, and 200 μM ZA; With the increase of ZA concentration, the biological characteristics and protein expression levels of Hela and Siha changed more markedly, showing concentration dependent characteristics (P < 0.05). It was concluded that ZA can influence the malignant biological activities of CCCs."
"This study introduces an alternative strategy for evaluating antiparasitic persistence compounds in cattle hair by Direct Analysis in Real Time Mass Spectrometry (DART-MS). The developed DART-MS method aimed to determine fenthion, chlorpyrifos, and cypermethrin in cattle hair samples. DART-MS analyses were performed in positive ion mode, and parameters related to the DART source were evaluated. The analytical performance demonstrated the efficiency of the optimized DART-MS method for fenthion, chlorpyrifos, and cypermethrin quantification in the evaluated samples, meeting criteria for precision, accuracy and limits of detection. Overall, the DART-MS method provided a fast and efficient analysis for determination of antiparasitic agents in cattle hair, which contributes to the evaluation of drug administration protocols and dosage intervals, and aids the safety and advancement of the livestock sector."

"Sijilmassi et al. offer a cognitive account of historical myths, which they present as a cognitive technology designed to recruit coalitional support. We argue this account is incomplete, and that a comprehensive explanation of historical myths must include a central role for human emotions. In particular, emotion-driven narratives have the capacity to recruit coalitional support, which is critical to large-scale human cooperation and social cohesion."
"Regular pulmonary rehabilitation exercises are crucial for patients with lung cancer after surgery. However, poor adherence to outpatient exercises is difficult to address due to inadequate supervision.

"A single-aspiration maneuver using a large-volume syringe is a common and effective technique for aspiration thrombectomy. Multiple aspiration cycles using large aspiration syringes have been proposed as a means to improve the efficacy over single aspiration. In this study, we sought to investigate the efficacy of a ""triple aspiration technique"" in which a large-volume syringe is cycled 3 times before catheter retraction during aspiration thrombectomy."
"This study evaluated the factors affecting maternal satisfaction during labor and neonatal outcomes. This cross-sectional study was conducted with 319 mothers who gave birth in a hospital (01.10.2023-31.03.2024) and volunteered for the study. Data were collected using a personal information form including socio-demographic and obstetric characteristics of the mothers and the 'Birth Satisfaction Scale'. The mean age of the mothers who participated in the study was 28.07±6.44 years. The mean score of the Birth Satisfaction Scale was 22.29±5.03. The sub-dimensions of the scale were found to be significantly affected by mode of delivery, various factors (p<0.05). Positive birth experience also affects maternal satisfaction. This study showed that maternal satisfaction in labor was at a moderate level. It explains that maternal satisfaction in labor is affected by the mode of delivery and other factors. In addition, it is seen that the method of delivery has various negative effects on the newborn."
"Protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) play an essential role in the regulation of ferroptosis, a form of programmed cell death characterized by abnormal iron ion metabolism, lipid peroxidation, and DNA damage. Through methylation, PRMTs modify specific proteins, thereby altering their activity, localizations, or interactions with other molecules to control the ferroptosis process. This study was conducted to provide a comprehensive overview of the relationship between PRMTs and ferroptosis, with a focus on the mechanisms by which PRMTs regulate ferroptosis and their effect on this cell death pathway. Currently, only a few studies have been conducted on the regulation of ferroptosis by PRMTs. However, this review provides insights into the effects of PRMTs on ferroptosis regulators, suggesting that the regulation of ferroptosis by PRMTs holds potential as a new therapeutic target for related diseases."
"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory impairment and cognitive decline, ultimately culminating in dementia. This study aims to evaluate cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) and functional connectivity (FC) in patients with AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI), bypassing the requirement for hypercapnia. The study cohort comprised 53 AD patients, 38 MCI patients, and 39 normal control (NC) subjects. CVR is derived by extracting signals within specific frequency bands of rs-fMRI. This study compares the differences in CVR and FC among the three groups, using the brain regions with CVR differences as region of interest (ROI) for FC analysis. The correlation between CVR and FC and cognitive scale score was discussed. Compared with NC subjects, AD patients exhibited a decrease in CVR in the PCUN.L, whereas MCI patients showed an increase in CVR in the PCUN.R. With PCUN.L as ROI, FC in PCUN.R decreased in AD patients, and FC in SFGmed.R and other brain regions increased in MCI patients compared with NC subjects. The results of the correlation analysis indicate that CVR in all patients, as well as FC with the PCUN.L as the ROI to the PCUN.R and SFGmed.R, show positive correlations with MMSE and MoCA scores. These results suggest that there are significant differences between CVR and FC with CVR differential brain regions as ROI among the AD, MCI, and NC groups, which may help to explain the hemodynamic mechanism. CVR obtained with rs-fMRI may be a potential biomarker for assessing cognitive impairment."

"This study aimed to delineate trends in intervertebral disc degeneration among Mexican patients, specifically focusing on the distribution and correlation between BMI and Pfirrmann classification results within the Mexican population. Conducted using the public health database of Mexico City. The study involved 51 patients sampled via convenience sampling, with exclusive utilization of internal MRI data from L4-L5 and L5-S1 discs. Data encompassed gender, age, height, weight, BMI, and radiographic findings. The dataset was stratified by gender and BMI categories, with analyses including measures of distribution and association, notably employing the Dunn test to compare BMI groups. Visualization tools such as violin plots and box-and-whisker charts were employed to elucidate the relationships between BMI, age, and Pfirrmann classification results. In both female and male groups, increasing BMI exhibited a positive correlation with disc degeneration severity, particularly pronounced in the obesity category. Statistical analyses revealed differences between normal BMI and overweight/obesity groups. Furthermore, there is also an increase in severity between overweight and obesity groups. The odds ratios (ORs) for disc degeneration severity, comparing different BMI categories, reveal significant associations. Among women, overweight individuals have 3.333 times higher odds of presenting a Pfirrmann classification result 4 at L4-L5, and 6.545 times higher odds at L5-S1, compared to those with normal BMI. Similarly, women with obesity have 8 times higher odds of disc degeneration at both levels. For men, the ORs were 1.6 and 2.222 at L4-L5 and L5-S1, respectively, comparing normal BMI to overweight individuals, the ORs were 5 at L4-L5 and 4.166 at L5-S1 when comparing normal BMI to obesity. This study offers persuasive evidence that, among Mexican patients, body mass index (BMI) is probably correlated with the severity of lumbosacral degenerative disc degeneration (DDD). Acknowledging limitations in sample size, future investigations should delve into elucidating the underlying mechanisms driving this correlation. Multi-center studies with larger, diverse cohorts are warranted to validate and enhance the generalizability of our findings. We promote the focus on early detection and prevention, marking a paradigm change in the treatment of degenerative spine disorders and opening the door for creative methods of patient care and public health campaigns."
"In contrast to younger adult populations, clinical practice guidelines state that there is no difference in long-term functional outcomes in surgically versus nonoperatively treated distal radius fractures in patients ≥65 years old. In this study, we asked the following questions: (1) has treatment for distal radius fractures in younger and older adult populations changed over time? (2) What patient and surgeon factors are associated with treatment trends?"

Serous effusion fluids serve as crucial cytological materials in diagnosing the underlying causes of fluid accumulation in various body cavities. The International System for Reporting Serous Fluid Cytopathology (TIS) outlined atypia of undetermined significance (AUS) and suspicious for malignancy (SFM) as two intermediate categories for atypical fluids.
"Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD) encompass a range of conditions marked by abnormal brain development in conjunction with impaired cognitive, emotional and behavioural functions. Transgenic animal models, mainly rodents, traditionally served as key tools for deciphering the molecular mechanisms driving NDD physiopathology and significantly contributed to the development of pharmacological interventions aimed at treating these disorders. However, the efficacy of these treatments in humans has proven to be limited, due in part to the intrinsic constraint of animal models to recapitulate the complex development and structure of the human brain but also to the phenotypic heterogeneity found between affected individuals. Significant advancements in the field of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) offer a promising avenue for overcoming these challenges. Indeed, the development of advanced differentiation protocols for generating iPSC-derived brain organoids gives an unprecedented opportunity to explore human neurodevelopment. This review provides an overview of how 3D brain organoids have been used to investigate various NDD (i.e. Fragile X syndrome, Rett syndrome, Angelman syndrome, microlissencephaly, Prader-Willi syndrome, Timothy syndrome, tuberous sclerosis syndrome) and elucidate their pathophysiology. We also discuss the benefits and limitations of employing such innovative 3D models compared to animal models and 2D cell culture systems in the realm of personalized medicine."
"Orbital floor (OF) fractures present a dilemma, with controversies surrounding surgical indication, approach, and ideal material for reconstruction. Our study was conducted on cases of (OF) fracture admitted to a tertiary referral centre. Cases of (OF) associated with zygomaticomaxillary complex (ZMC) fracture were managed as follows: those with ophthalmological problems were subjected to endoscopically assisted transorbital reconstruction of the floor; cases without ophthalmological problems were subjected to reduction and fixation of the ZMC fracture only. The recently developed endoscopic endonasal transmaxillary approach was used to manage cases with pure OF fracture, while the same approach with added endoscopic transethmoidal reconstruction of the medial orbital wall (MOW) was applied to cases with associated MOW fracture. Outcome measurements were the correction of diplopia and enophthalmos, along with the restoration of normal globe function. The study included 80 patients, who were divided into four groups according to the proposed algorithm. OF reconstruction was performed in 32 cases with either septal cartilage (n = 4), titanium plate (n = 11), or porous polyethylene mesh (n = 17). Our study presents the novel role of minimally invasive endoscopic surgery in the management of (OF) fracture, together with a recently developed management plan that could maximize positive outcomes and decrease morbidity."
"This study aimed to evaluate the body composition of the Khisêdjê, an Indigenous people residing in the Xingu Indigenous Territory, and compare it to the results obtained by anthropometry. One hundred seventy-nine individuals aged above 20 of both genders were included. The nutritional status was classified per the cutoff proposed by the WHO (1995). The body composition was identified using measures derived directly from a bioelectrical impedance device (resistance - R, reactance - Xc, and phase angle - PA). Data were analyzed using the Student t-test, chi-square, Pearson correlation, and analysis of variance, and 57% of the sample was male. The mean age of the population was 37.5 years, and 48% of subjects had some overweight level (BMI ≥ 25,0 kg/m2). We identified a positive correlation between BMI with waist (WC) and arm (AC) circumference, and PA measurements, and an inverse correlation between BMI and R and Xc measurements. R and Xc mean values decreased with increasing BMI. In contrast, mean PA increased with greater weight. The results suggest that being overweight among the Khisêdjê Indigenous people was associated with higher muscle mass amounts."
"Medicare enrollment increases provider visits among older adults; however, it remains unclear whether this increase is uniform across all types of providers. Using data from the 2014-21 Medical Expenditure Panel Surveys, we examined the effect of Medicare enrollment on office and outpatient visits across providers, using a regression discontinuity design. We found that Medicare enrollment at age sixty-five led to a 14 percent increase in visits to primary care providers and a 31 percent increase in visits to other providers, with the former more prominent among Medicare Advantage enrollees. In contrast, there was no change in visits to mental health care providers. Our study highlights the heterogenous effects of Medicare enrollment on health care use across different types of providers. Strengthening partnerships across providers, especially between primary care and mental health care providers, could be one way to improve mental health care use among new Medicare enrollees."
"Species of the carnivorous family Lentibulariaceae exhibit the smallest genomes in flowering plants. We explored the hypothesis that their minute genomes result from the unique mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (COX) mutation. The mutation may boost mitochondrial efficiency, which is especially useful for suction-bladder traps of Utricularia, but also increase DNA-damaging reactive oxygen species, leading to genome shrinkage through deletion-biased DNA repair. We aimed to explore the impact of this mutation on genome size, providing insights into genetic mutation roles in plant genome evolution under environmental pressures."
"In this study we aimed to assess the role of wild red deer, along with other ungulates such as roe deer and wild boar, in the soil's physical properties, namely soil penetration resistance and depth (used as a proxy for soil compaction), hydraulic conductivity (a proxy for water infiltration), and the proportion of soil stable aggregates. Results showed that, at the density level found in our study area, red deer have a neutral effect at the soil level, not causing significant soil compaction or significantly influencing measured soil functions."
Assuta Ashdod Hospital is a regional trauma center. The hospital received casualties on the first day of the civilian massacre of October 7th and thereafter. The Assuta Ashdod Hospital was designated as an emergency landing site only for unstable or deteriorating patients who would not survive longer flights to a central trauma center. The aim of this study is to share our experience and challenges as a new regional trauma center in a war zone.
"B0AT1 (SLC6A19) is a major sodium-coupled neutral amino acid transporter that relies on angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) or collectrin for membrane trafficking. Despite its significant role in disorders associated with amino acid metabolism, there is a deficit of comprehensive structure-function understanding of B0AT1 in lipid environment. Herein, we have employed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to explore the architectural characteristics of B0AT1 in two distinct environments: a simplified POPC bilayer and a complex lipid system replicating the native membrane composition. Notably, our B0AT1 analysis in terms of structural stability and regions of maximum flexibility shows consistency in both the systems with enhanced structural features in the case of complex lipid system. Our findings suggest that diacylglycerol phospholipids significantly alter the pore radius, hydrophobic index, and surface charge distribution of B0AT1, thereby affecting the flexibility of transmembrane helices TM7, TM12, and loop connecting TM7-TM8, crucial for ACE2-B0AT1 interaction. Pro41, Ser190, Arg214, Arg240, Ser413, Pro414, Cys463, and Val582 are among the most prominent lipid binding residues that might influence B0AT1 functionality. We also perceive notable lipid mediated deviation in the degree of tilt and loss of helicity in TM1 and TM6 which might affect the substrate binding sites S1 and S2 in B0AT1. Considerably, destabilization in the structure of B0AT1 in lipid environment was evident upon mutation in TM domain, associated with Hartnup disorder through various structure-based protein stability tools. Our two-tiered approach allowed us to validate the use of POPC as a baseline for initial analyses of SLC transporters. Altogether, our all-atoms MD study provides a platform for future investigations into the structure-function mechanism of B0AT1 in realistic lipid mimetic bilayers and offers a framework for developing new therapeutic agents targeting this transporter."
"Superselective adrenal artery embolization (SAAE) offers a novel approach for treating primary aldosteronism (PA). In this study, we aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of SAAE for the treatment of PA based on the lateralization results obtained from adrenal vein sampling (AVS).In this prospective study, we enrolled 40 patients with PA who underwent SAAE. The patients were categorized into two groups, unilateral PA and bilateral PA, based on AVS results. Clinical parameters and biochemical markers were assessed at 3 and 12 months postoperatively. The primary outcomes were changes in blood pressure and defined daily dose (DDD) of antihypertensive medications compared to baseline. Thirty-eight patients achieved technical success, with favorable clinical and biochemical efficacy rates. At three months postoperatively, the clinical efficacy rates were 79.2% and 78.6% for the UPA and BPA groups, respectively. At 12 months, the rates were 83.3% and 71.4%, respectively. Both groups exhibited a significant decrease in average blood pressure at 3 and 12 months compared with baseline (P < 0.001), and there was also a notable reduction in DDD (P < 0.05). At three months, the biochemical efficacy rates were 61.9% and 58.3% in the UPA and BPA groups, respectively. Due to loss to follow-up, biochemical indicators were not assessed at 12 months postoperatively. No severe adverse reactions occurred during or after SAAE. Patients with both UPA and BPA can benefit from SAAE. The superiority of bilateral adrenal artery embolization in the treatment of BPA over unilateral adrenal artery embolization requires further investigation."
"Transcranial ultrasound imaging is a popular method to study cerebral functionality and diagnose brain injuries. However, the detected ultrasound signal is greatly distorted due to the aberration caused by the skull bone. The aberration mechanism mainly depends on thickness and porosity, two important skull physical characteristics. Although skull bone thickness and porosity can be estimated from CT or MRI scans, there is significant value in developing methods for obtaining thickness and porosity information from ultrasound itself. Here, we extracted various features from ultrasound signals using physical skull-mimicking phantoms of a range of thicknesses with embedded porosity-mimicking acoustic mismatches and analyzed them using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models. The performance evaluation demonstrated that both ML- and DL-trained models could predict the physical characteristics of a variety of skull phantoms with reasonable accuracy. The proposed approach could be expanded upon and utilized for the development of effective skull aberration correction methods."
"Emerging research in the field of microbiology has indicated that host-microbiota interactions play a significant role in regulating health and disease. Whereas the gut microbiome has received the most attention, distinct microbiota in other organs (mouth, larynx, and trachea) may undergo microbial shifts that impact disease states. A comprehensive understanding of microbial mechanisms and their role in communication and swallowing deficits may have downstream diagnostic and therapeutic implications."
"Water-injected meat leads to microbial growth, which affects the health of consumers. A colorimetric porous polymer microneedle patch was designed and prepared using photopolymerization of an acrylate monomer with porogen to be the substrate, and cobalt (II) chloride as color change indicator and tartrazine as the reference. The color of the microneedle patch changed from green to yellow green and to yellow as the increase of moisture concentration. Furthermore, the discoloration trend of the microneedle patch during the moisture measurement of meat is very regular. The moisture measurement of meat in range of 66.9 %-75.7 % exhibited a good linear dependence on RGB values. The results indicate that the microneedle patch can visually determine the moisture content of meat in 3 min. In addition, the microneedle patch can be combined with smartphone to achieve accurate detection of water-injected meat, making it a wonderful tool in the field of food safety testing."
"Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic inflammatory esophageal disorder, often associated with dysphagia, chest discomfort, and heartburn. There is limited information on persistent esophageal symptoms despite histologic remission (HR). We aimed to assess the prevalence and predictors of persistent esophageal symptoms in adult patients with EoE in HR. We performed a retrospective cohort study of adult EoE patients in HR (<15 eosinophils per high power field [eos/hpf]). Exclusion criteria included: no available data on symptoms, chronic opiate use, disorders of esophagogastric junction outflow on Chicago Classification version 4 diagnosis, esophageal candidiasis, erosive esophagitis, or other known cause of esophageal dysphagia besides EoE. Based on prior literature, definitions include: complete HR (<5 eos/hpf), partial HR (5-14 eos/hpf), and endoscopic fibrostenosis (rings and/or stricture). Esophageal symptoms were assessed within 2 weeks of HR and categorized into the major symptoms of dysphagia, chest pain, and heartburn. Given the retrospective nature of the study, a global symptom response (absence or presence) was used. Demographics, disease history, endoscopy reports, EoE endoscopic reference score, and histology were recorded. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed. Eosinophil thresholds for persistent symptoms were determined using receiver operating characteristics analyses. Of 289 EoE patients in HR, 133 (46%) had esophageal symptoms: dysphagia (N = 119; 41.2%), heartburn (N = 28; 20.8%), and chest pain (N = 10; 7.5%). Significant predictors for persistent dysphagia were anxiety (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 3.77) and endoscopic fibrostenosis (aOR 3.87). Significant predictors for persistent heartburn with or without chest pain were anxiety or depression (aOR 12.2 and aOR 11.0) and partial HR (aOR 1.17 and aOR 1.18). Threshold eosinophil counts for persistent heartburn and chest pain were 2.5 and 3.5 eos/hpf, respectively (AUC 0.71 and 0.69). We report a high prevalence of persistent esophageal symptoms in EoE patients who are in HR. Risk factors include anxiety, depression, endoscopic fibrostenosis, and partial HR. These findings can help direct patient care, including endoscopic dilation and managing psychiatric comorbidities. Targeting less than 2.5 and 3.5 eos/hpf for heartburn and chest pain may be warranted."
"RNA-focused therapy and diagnostics have been making waves in molecular biology due to the advantages RNA has over DNA; for instance, the ability of RNA to target nearly any genetic component in the cell is a big step in treating disorders. Moreover, RNA-based diagnosis of diseases is only becoming increasingly popular, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic, which brought up the need for cost-effective and efficient diagnosing kits for the vast majority. RNA-based techniques also have close to no risk of genotoxicity and can efficiently target undruggable regions of the cell. RNA treatments have effectively shown the future of the medical industry in the past couple of decades, and they will only be seen to improve. This review paper provides an overview on the different techniques that use RNA-based approaches in the field of diagnostics and therapeutics."
"This was an original research. The objective of the study was to investigate the efficacy of laparoscopic type C radical hysterectomy by deep uterine vein approach in treating cervical cancer. Two hundred cases of cervical cancer were allocated into control group and intervention group. The control group underwent pelvic lymph node dissection + para-aortic lymph node resection followed by extensive hysterectomy. The intervention group underwent laparoscopic type C radical hysterectomy by deep uterine vein approach + pelvic lymph node dissection ± para-aortic lymph node resection. In comparison with the control group, the intervention group had significantly lower amount of blood loss, longer time of indwelling catheter, shorter time of abdominal drainage tube removal and anal exhaust, lower incidence of postoperative complications, higher rate of pathological stage upgrading, and higher quality of life score, and had lower recurrence rate. We conclude that laparoscopic C-type radical hysterectomy by deep uterine vein approach is effective, safe and reliable, and can promote patients quality of life, which is valuable for clinical use."
"Alteration in DNA repair and metabolism genes can affect the maintenance of DNA integrity or xenobiotics metabolism, potentially leading to DNA damage accumulation. The present study investigated the association between polymorphisms in Glutathione S-Transferase Pi 1 (GSTP1, rs1695) and O-6-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase (MGMT, rs2308321) genes with urothelial bladder cancer (UBC) susceptibility and prognosis. Furthermore, the methylation patterns of the promoter region of these genes were analyzed in tumor and non-tumor bladder tissues, besides MGMT gene expression in tumor samples."
"Chronic kidney disease is characterised by the progressive loss of kidney function. However, predicting who will progress to kidney failure is difficult. Artificial Intelligence, including Machine Learning, shows promise in this area. This narrative review highlights the most common and important variables used in machine learning models to predict progressive chronic kidney disease. Ovid Medline and EMBASE were searched in August 2023 with keywords relating to 'chronic kidney disease', 'machine learning', and 'end-stage renal disease'. Studies were assessed against inclusion and exclusion criteria and excluded if variables inputted into machine learning models were not discussed. Data extraction focused on specific variables inputted into the machine learning models. After screening of 595 articles, 16 were included in the review. The most utilised machine learning models were random forest, support vector machines and XGBoost. The most commonly occurring variables were age, gender, measures of renal function, measures of proteinuria, and full blood examination. Only half of all studies included clinical variables in their models. The most important variables overall were measures of renal function, measures of proteinuria, age, full blood examination and serum albumin. Machine learning was consistently superior or non-inferior when compared to the Kidney Failure Risk Equation. This review identified key variables used in machine learning models to predict chronic kidney disease progression to kidney failure. These findings lay the foundations for the development of future machine learning models capable of rivalling the Kidney Failure Risk Equation in the provision of accurate kidney failure prediction."
"A Mixed Reality (MR) application using an optical see-through headset was developed to assess short-term spatial memory. A study with 29 participants was conducted. Data from this study were compared to two previous studies using mobile Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) with headsets. When comparing the three technologies (MR, AR, VR) for the performance variables, there were no statistically significant differences for either the total number of correctly placed objects or the total number of attempts. However, the MR application required more time than the AR and VR applications in the evaluation phase and more time than the VR application in the learning phase. Our arguments for the longer time are the novelty of the MR application for the participants and the characteristics of the applications. The key results from the MR study include the following: (1) the objects used in the MR application were correctly positioned on a map, which implies that the memory acquired with the MR application is effectively transferred to the user's mental map; (2) for the performance variables, there were no significant differences in the results by gender; (3) and the usability rating decreased with computer experience. The results show that the MR application is effective for spatial memory assessment and was well rated by the participants. The three technologies, along with suitable hardware, are effective for spatial memory assessment. However, MR using optical see-through headsets offers advantages over mobile AR and VR using headsets, discussed in this publication."
"Psychoactive substance use in adults and second-hand smoke (SHS) exposure among children are leading contributors to sleeping problems. Despite this, there is limited data on how these exposures influence sleep patterns in informal settings. Our study assessed the associations between substance use, SHS exposure and sleep disturbances among adults and children in an urban informal settlement in Uganda."
"Osteoarthritis (OA) significantly impacts the elderly, leading to disability and decreased quality of life. While hyaluronic acid (HA) and chondroitin sulfate (CS) are recognized for their therapeutic potential in OA, their effects on extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation are not well understood. This study investigates the impact of HA and CS, individually and combined, on ECM degradation in OA and the underlying mechanisms."
"The prevalence of allergic rhinitis (AR) reached 49.2% in 2019. In particular, the prevalence of Japanese cedar (JC) pollinosis is 38.8%, and the onset age of pollinosis is becoming younger. AR is known to be a risk factor for the development of allergic asthma, a potentially life-threatening condition. Allergen immunotherapy (AIT) is a well-documented, safe, effective treatment option for respiratory allergic disease. It has been demonstrated that AIT can provide relief from clinical symptoms and that AIT has the potential to provide long-term post-treatment effect. Unlike pharmacotherapy, AIT addresses the basic immunological mechanisms that are responsible for the development and persistence of allergic conditions. Currently, two main routes of AIT administration, subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) and sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT), are commonly available. In Japan, house dust mite (HDM) SLIT tablets have been available since 2015, and JC SLIT tablet had been approved by 2018 without any age limitation. The randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trials that included pediatric patients have been conducted in Japan. In phase II/III trail with JC SLIT tablets, treatment effect-size (improvement of clinical symptoms compared to placebo) was 46.3% after three years treatment. In addition, AR was improved in 40% (1 year) and 30% (2 years) after discontinuation of SLIT. Several future initiatives including the AIT against cedar pollen allergies were announced by Japanese government. This review covered the findings to date, including immunotherapy not only for JC pollinosis- but also for HDM-induced perennial AR."
"Thoracotomy is a common treatment for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the significant trauma from this procedure can limit patients' postoperative prognosis. Therefore, it's crucial to find an easily detected indicator that can predict the prognosis of NSCLC patients undergoing thoracotomy. FAM83A-AS1 was hypothesized as a predictor for the therapeutic effectiveness of thoracotomy. We evaluated its correlation with patient outcomes and its significance in predicting postoperative prognosis, with the aim of providing a reference to improve postoperative prognosis of thoracotomy."
The study aimed to evaluate the effect of fertitonex containing L-carnitine L-tartrate together with other micronutrients on different semen parameters in idiopathic male infertility as well as male reproductive hormones.
"A multicenter cross-sectional diagnostic study was carried out including 45 children with nontuberculous mycobacterial cervicofacial lymphadenitis and controls. The tested immunoassay, detecting M. avium- specific anti-glycopeptidolipid-core immunoglobulin A antibodies, had inadequate diagnostic performance in the studied population and seems to be of no additional value in detecting cases of nontuberculous mycobacterial cervicofacial lymphadenitis."
"Diabetes increases the likelihood of germ cell damage, hypogonadism, and male infertility. Diabetes leads to lower zinc (Zn) levels, an important micronutrient for maintaining male fertility, and zinc deficiency can lead to decreased male fertility through multiple mechanisms. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of combined metformin and zinc administration on epididymis in diabetic mice; 10 of 50 male mice were randomly selected as the control group (group C), and the remaining 40 mice were randomly divided into untreated diabetes group (group D), diabetes + zinc group (group Z), diabetes + metformin group (group M), and diabetes + metformin + zinc group (group ZM) with 10 mice each. Diabetic mice in group Z received oral zinc (10 mg/kg) once daily for 4 weeks; diabetic mice in group M received oral metformin (200 mg/kg) once daily for 4 weeks; diabetic mice in group ZM received oral metformin and zinc once daily for 4 weeks; and groups C and D received the same amount of sterile water by gavage. Overnight fasted mice were sacrificed, and blood samples, mouse epididymides, and sperm were collected for further experiments. In group D, fasting blood glucose and insulin resistance index increased significantly, semen quality, serum insulin, and testosterone decreased, and epididymal structure was disordered. In group D, epididymal tissue zinc, free zinc ions in the caput, and cauda of epididymis and zinc transporter (ZnT2) decreased significantly, while ZIP12, metallothionein (MT), and metal transcription factor (MTF1) increased significantly. In addition, the expressions of blood-epididymal barrier (BEB)-related molecules (including ZO-1 β-catenin and N-cadherin) and aquaporins (AQPs, including AQP3, AQP9, and AQP11) in the epididymis of mice in group D were significantly decreased. In addition, compared with groups D, Z, and M, in the ZM group, the expression of BEB-related molecules (including ZO-1, β-catenin, and N-cadherin) and aquaporins (AQP3, AQP9, and AQP11) in epididymis tissue were significantly increased, and sperm motility and serum testosterone were significantly increased. It was concluded that male diabetic mice have a disturbed epididymal structure and decreased semen quality by causing an imbalance in epididymal zinc homeostasis, BEB, and impaired absorptive function. The combination of zinc and metformin is an effective and safe alternative treatment and provides additional benefits over metformin alone."
"The use of noninvasive biomarkers may reduce the need for biopsy and guide immunosuppression adjustments during transplantation. The scientific community in solid organ transplantation currently considers that chemokines, T- and B-cell immunophenotypes, and gene expression, among other molecular biomarkers, have great potential as diagnostic and predictive biomarkers for graft evolution; however, in clinical practice, few valid early biomarkers have emerged. This review focuses on the most relevant scientific advances in this field in the last 5 years regarding the role of 3 biomarkers: miRNAs, chemokines, and ddcf-DNA, in both adult and pediatric populations. An update was provided on the scores based on the combination of these biomarkers. The most-featured articles were identified through a literature search of the PubMed database. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the potential clinical applications of these biomarkers in the diagnosis and prediction of graft outcomes and discusses the reasons why none have been implemented in clinical practice to date. Translating these biomarkers into routine clinical practice and combining them with pharmacogenetics and pharmacokinetic monitoring is challenging; however, it is the key to present/future individualized immunosuppressive therapies. It is essential that they be shown to be applicable and robust in real-life patient conditions and properly evaluate their added value when combined with the standard-of-care factor monitoring for graft clinical assessment. Partnership strategies among scientists, academic institutions, consortia, including expert working groups and scientific societies, and pharmaceutical and/or biotechnology companies should promote the development of prospective, randomized, multicenter intervention studies for adequate clinical validation of these biomarkers and their monitoring frequency, and their commercialization to make them available to transplant physicians."
"Accurately predicting individual antidepressant treatment response could expedite the lengthy trial-and-error process of finding an effective treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD). We tested and compared machine learning-based methods that predict individual-level pharmacotherapeutic treatment response using cortical morphometry from multisite longitudinal cohorts. We conducted an international analysis of pooled data from six sites of the ENIGMA-MDD consortium (n = 262 MDD patients; age = 36.5 ± 15.3 years; 154 (59%) female; mean response rate = 57%). Treatment response was defined as a ≥ 50% reduction in symptom severity score after 4-12 weeks post-initiation of antidepressant treatment. Structural MRI was acquired before, or < 14 days after, treatment initiation. The cortex was parcellated using FreeSurfer, from which cortical thickness and surface area were measured. We tested several machine learning pipeline configurations, which varied in (i) the way we presented the cortical data (i.e., average values per region of interest, as a vector containing voxel-wise cortical thickness and surface area measures, and as cortical thickness and surface area projections), (ii) whether we included clinical data, and the (iii) machine learning model (i.e., gradient boosting, support vector machine, and neural network classifiers) and (iv) cross-validation methods (i.e., k-fold and leave-one-site-out) we used. First, we tested if the overall predictive performance of the pipelines was better than chance, with a corrected 10-fold cross-validation permutation test. Second, we compared if some machine learning pipeline configurations outperformed others. In an exploratory analysis, we repeated our first analysis in three subpopulations, namely patients (i) from a single site, (ii) with comparable response rates, and (iii) showing the least (first quartile) and the most (fourth quartile) treatment response, which we call the extreme (non-)responders subpopulation. Finally, we explored the effect of including subcortical volumetric data on model performance. Overall, performance predicting antidepressant treatment response was not significantly better than chance (balanced accuracy = 50.5%; p = 0.66) and did not vary with alternative pipeline configurations. Exploratory analyses revealed that performance across models was only significantly better than chance in the extreme (non-)responders subpopulation (balanced accuracy = 63.9%, p = 0.001). Including subcortical data did not alter the observed model performance. Cortical structural MRI alone could not reliably predict individual pharmacotherapeutic treatment response in MDD. None of the used machine learning pipeline configurations outperformed the others. In exploratory analyses, we found that predicting response in the extreme (non-)responders subpopulation was feasible on both cortical data alone and combined with subcortical data, which suggests that specific MDD subpopulations may exhibit response-related patterns in structural data. Future work may use multimodal data to predict treatment response in MDD."
"Trichothiodystrophy (TTD) is a rare genetic disorder with a high mortality rate among pediatric patients, primarily as a result of related infections. Its defining clinical feature is brittle, dry hair, with broken hair shafts revealing ""tiger-tail banding"". Other common characteristics include photosensitivity, scaly skin and stunted growth. The disorder's rarity and variety of symptoms pose diagnostic challenges, yet early diagnosis and treatment can improve a patient's overall health and quality of life. The purpose of this report is to describe the case of an underweight five-year-old boy with brittle hair and scaly skin who presented to an emergency room with an active odontogenic infection and was incidentally diagnosed with TTD following genetic testing. This case illustrates the importance of evaluating patients comprehensively, while addressing their chief complaint. It also showcases the importance of involving providers across health professions in diagnosing and managing TTD and other genetic disorders in pediatric patients."
The purpose of this study was to determine the complementary and alternative medicinal (CAM) choices of international college students in the U.S.
"Contrary to cardiovascular risk reductions by aerobic exercise, arterial stiffness, as assessed by brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (PWV), is higher in swimmers and controls than in other aerobically trained individuals. The main muscles actively recruited in swimming are in the upper limbs, so this study aimed to investigate heart-brachial PWV in swimmers and to compare arterial stiffness indices between modes and measurement localities. Subjects comprised 60 individuals (18-22 years), including 20 untrained controls (Con), 20 aerobically trained cyclists (Aero), and 20 swimmers (Swim). Characteristics and strength did not differ, but peak oxygen uptake was significantly higher in Aero and Swim than in Con. Brachial-ankle PWV was significantly lower in Aero than in Con and Swim and no significant difference was observed between Con and Swim (Con, 1070 ± 115; Aero, 916 ± 109; Swim, 1035 ± 91 cm/s). Nevertheless, heart-brachial PWV was significantly lower in Swim than in Con and tended to be lower in Swim than in Aero (Con, 344 ± 25; Aero, 330 ± 41; Swim, 308 ± 31 cm/s). Heart-ankle PWV was significantly lower in both Swim and Aero than in Con (Con, 618 ± 47; Aero, 580 ± 54; Swim, 576 ± 43 cm/s). Therefore, these findings indicate that swimmers can develop segment-specific reductions in heart-brachial arterial stiffness, unlike aerobically trained cyclists."
"Oocytes are the largest cell type in multicellular animals. Here, we show that mRNA transporter 4 (MTR4) is indispensable for oocyte growth and functions as part of the RNA surveillance mechanism, which is responsible for nuclear waste RNA clearance. MTR4 ensures the normal post-transcriptional processing of maternal RNAs, their nuclear export to the cytoplasm, and the accumulation of properly processed transcripts. Oocytes with Mtr4 knockout fail to accumulate sufficient and normal transcripts in the cytoplasm and cannot grow to normal sizes. MTR4-dependent RNA surveillance has a previously unrecognized function in maintaining a stable nuclear environment for the establishment of non-canonical histone H3 lysine-4 trimethylation and chromatin reorganization, which is necessary to form a nucleolus-like structure in oocytes. In conclusion, MTR4-dependent RNA surveillance activity is a checkpoint that allows oocytes to grow to a normal size, undergo nuclear and cytoplasmic maturation, and acquire developmental competence."
"An early step in triploblastic embryo differentiation is the formation of the three germ layers. Maternal pioneer transcription factors (TFs) bind to embryonic enhancers before zygotic genome activation, initiating germ layer specification. While maternal TFs' role in establishing epigenetic marks is known, how early pluripotent cells gain spatially restricted epigenetic identities remains unclear. We show that by the early gastrula stage, H3K4me1-marked regions become distinct in each germ layer, with certain chromatin regions forming high density H3K4me1 marked regions (HDRs). Genes associated with these HDRs are more robustly expressed compared to those associated with low density H3K4me1 marked regions (LDRs) in the genome. This process is driven by the sequential actions of maternal and zygotic factors. Knockdown of key maternal endodermal TFs (Otx1, Vegt and Foxh1) leads to a loss of endodermal H3K4me1 marks in endoderm, with a concurrent emergence of ectodermal and mesodermal marks, indicating a shift in chromatin state. This work highlights the importance of coordinated activities of maternal and zygotic TFs in defining the regionally-resolved and dynamic process of chromatin modification conferred by H3K4me1 in the early Xenopus embryo."
"Motivation is of great importance in the teaching-learning process, because motivated students seek out opportunities and show interest and enthusiasm in carrying out their tasks. The objective of this review is to identify and present the information available in the literature on the status quo of motivation among nursing program entrants. This is a qualitative scoping review study, a type of literature review designed to map out and find evidence to address a specific research objective, following the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology. The objective was outlined using the PCC (Population, Concept, Context) acronym. The protocol was developed and registered on the Open Science Framework (OSF) platform under DOI 10.17605/OSF.IO/EJNGY. The search strategy and database selection were defined by a library and information science professional together with the authors. The search will be carried out in the following databases: Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Literatura Latino Americana e do Caribe em Ciências da Saúde, Lilacs Esp, National Library of Medicine (PubMed), ScienceDirect, Scopus, and the Web of Science platform. The researchers will meet to discuss discrepancies and make decisions using a consensus model, and a third researcher will be tasked with independently resolving any conflicts. Data extraction will involve two independent researchers reviewing each article. Documents such as original articles; theoretical studies; experience reports; clinical study articles; case studies; normative, integrative, and systematic reviews; meta-analyses; meta-syntheses; monographs; theses; and dissertations in English, Portuguese, and Spanish from 2017 to 2023 were included.

"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) comprises heterogeneous disorders, which have an increase in blood glucose concentrations in common. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) describes the simultaneous occurrence of several clinical symptoms that increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and T2DM, although T2DM itself is also considered a risk factor for developing MetS."
"Cell lineage analysis is primarily undertaken to understand cell fate specification and diversification along a cell lineage tree. Built with dual repressible markers, twin-spot mosaic analysis with repressible cell markers (MARCM) labels the two daughter cells made by a common precursor in distinct colors. The power of twin-spot MARCM to systematically subdivide complex lineages is exemplified in studies of Drosophila neural stem-cell lineages. To achieve targeted lineage analysis, lineage-restricted drivers can be created by restricting and immortalizing gene expression to a lineage of interest. Here, we describe detailed methods to perform lineage analysis in Drosophila neural stem-cell lineages utilizing lineage-specific drivers. Our innovative lineage tracing method can help resolve complex tissue development."

"The endoscopic endonasal approach (EEA), has become the preferred alternative to traditional open and transoral approaches to the ventral craniovertebral junction (CVJ) region. However, preoperative prediction of the limitations of caudal reach remains challenging. This cadaveric study aimed to quantify the CVJ area of exposure and access afforded by the EEA, evaluate the accuracy of previously described radiographic anthropometric lines, and identify the lowest limit of the EEA corridor."
"BACKGROUND Carotid artery injury has an incidence of 0.2% in the National Trauma Data Bank. The true incidence of intracranial carotid injury is unknown but can be estimated at less than one in 1000 trauma-related inpatient admissions in America. Operatively managed penetrating carotid trauma has a mortality rate approaching 20%, and the selection of the appropriate operative approach is not straightforward. We present a case of penetrating carotid trauma successfully managed via combined approach by neurosurgery and otolaryngology teams. CASE REPORT A 74-year-old woman fell into a honeysuckle bush. She presented with a branch embedded in the left cheek and blindness of the right eye. Further workup revealed the branch had penetrated the maxillary bone, pierced the right optic nerve, and lodged near the intracranial portion of the right internal carotid artery. She underwent emergent operative intervention via right pterional craniotomy with microsurgery and endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery with repair of the skull base. The foreign body was removed and the traumatic carotid laceration was repaired. The patient recovered successfully and was discharged on postoperative day 14. CONCLUSIONS The management of facially penetrating foreign bodies begins with assessment for neurologic deficits and vascular injury. We recommend leaving such objects in place and not removing them until definitive imaging is obtained. We present an interesting case of penetrating trauma to the intracranial carotid artery in which a retained foreign body was removed with satisfactory patient outcome using a combined endoscopic and open surgical approach."

"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a lethal lung disease characterised by irreversible lung structure and function. Phillygenin (PHI) is a lignan extracted from Forsythiae fructus with the activities of anti-inflammatory and antioxidant. This study aimed to explore the protective effect of PHI on IPF. The mouse model of IPF was established by bleomycin (BLM), and then treated with PHI. After 15 days of administration, the lung index was calculated. H&E staining, Masson staining and immunohistochemical methods were used to detect the effect of PHI on pulmonary fibrosis. MDA and SOD were tested to evaluate the effect of PHI on lung tissue oxidative stress. Western blot was used to detect the effect of PHI on the expressions of α-SMA, p-smad2, TGF- β1, Nrf2, HO-1 and NQO-1. Network pharmacology was used to identify the key signalling pathways for PHI to improve IPF, and Western blot was used to validate the result. The results showed that PHI prevented mice from BLM-induced IPF, manifested by reducing lung index, improving lung tissue pathological damage, inhibiting collagen deposition and expression of fibrosis markers including α-SMA, collagen1, p-smad2 and TGF-β1. PHI inhibited oxidative stress by upregulating the expressions of Nrf2, HO-1 and NQO-1. Network pharmacology revealed that PI3K-Akt-mTOR signalling pathway was the underlying target of PHI for IPF. Molecular docking indicated strong binding of PHI with PIK3CA, AKT1 and RELA. Western blot validated that PHI downregulated the PI3K-Akt-mTOR signalling pathway and stimulated autophagy. This study indicated that PHI prevented BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis by inhibiting PI3K-Akt-mTOR signalling pathway."
"The management strategies for eosinophilic esophagitis include proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), swallowed topical corticosteroids (tCSs), elimination diets, and the biologic agent dupilumab, although there remains little guidance on the selection of initial treatment. We performed cost-effectiveness analyses to compare these approaches of first-line therapy."
"Alcoholic liver injury is one of the most frequent liver diseases around the world, and nutritional intervention has been considered as an effective way to alleviate alcohol liver injury. To alleviate the liver damage caused by alcohol, a type of astaxanthin (AXT) loaded nanoparticles were designed for dual targeting of hepatocytes and mitochondria. Firstly, galactooligosaccharides (GOS) were conjugated to whey protein isolate (WPI) and sea cucumber peptide (SCP) via the Maillard reaction, achieving a grafting degree of 29 %, then triphenylphosphonium (TPP) was linked by amide reaction. Secondly, AXT was loaded into the complex of SCP-WPI-GOS-TPP (SWGT) to form AXT@SCP-WPI-GOS-TPP(AXT@SWGT) nanoparticles. The Pearson coefficient increased from 0.69 to 0.76 after introducing TPP targeting moiety. In vivo experiments showed that AXT@SWGT significantly alleviated liver injury caused by alcohol. The vacuolation and fat accumulation associated with alcoholic liver injury was alleviated. The alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase activity were improved by 296.88 % and 34.19 %, respectively. AXT@SWGT significantly enhanced the biological activities of glutathione by 76.86 %, catalase by 145.42 %, and superoxide dismutase by 33.48 %, thereby alleviating oxidative stress. The results indicated that the AXT@SWGT might have the potential to intervene alcoholic liver injury via the dual targeting strategy."

This review discusses the scientific literature investigating the effects of ambient and experimentally generated PM mixtures on reproduction."
"Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic autoimmune disease of the small bowel mucosa that develops because of the altered immune response to gluten, which leads to intestinal epithelium damage and villous atrophy. However, studies on regeneration of the damaged small bowel mucosa and density of intestinal stem cells (ISC) in CD persons are still scarce. We aimed to evaluate the number of small bowel mucosa cells positive for LGR5, CD138/Syndecan-1, CD71 and CXCR3 in CD and in controls with normal bowel mucosa; to find relationship between these markers and degree of small intestinal atrophy and to compare these results with our previous data about the number of CD103 + , IDO + DCs, FOXP3 + Tregs, enterovirus (EV) density and serum zonulin level. The paraffin sections of the small bowel biopsies were obtained from 26 children with CD (median age 6.5 years), and from 20 controls with normal intestinal mucosa (median age 14.2 years) and from the tissue bank of the Department of Pathology of Tartu University Hospital (from 18 participants with CD including 14 children (median age 13.2 years) and from 11subjects with normal small bowel mucosa, including one child aged 4.8 years. The number of LGR5 + , CD71 + , CD138 + , and CXCR3 + cells was evaluated using immunohistochemistry. The median number of CD138 + and CXCR3 + cells was significantly higher in the small bowel mucosa in CD compared with normal mucosa (p = 0.0002 for CD138 and p = 0.006 for CXCR3). The median number of CD71 + cells was significantly higher in normal small bowel mucosa (p = 0.005). The number of LGR5 + cells did not differ between persons with CD and those with normal small bowel mucosa (p = 0.7). A markedly increased number of CD138 + and CXCR3 + cells in the small bowel mucosa of participants with CD confirms their role in the pathogenesis of this disease. There was no expected marked difference in the density of any of the studied markers between lower or higher grade of small bowel atrophy and level of tTG-IgA in CD."

"Liquid biopsy (LB) involves the analysis of circulating tumour-derived DNA (ctDNA), providing a minimally invasive method for gathering both quantitative and qualitative information. Genomic analysis of ctDNA through next-generation sequencing (NGS) enables comprehensive genetic profiling of tumours, including non-driver alterations that offer prognostic insights. LB can be applied in both early-stage disease settings, for the diagnosis and monitoring of minimal residual disease (MRD), and advanced disease settings, for monitoring treatment response and understanding the mechanisms behind disease progression and tumour heterogeneity. Currently, LB has limited use in clinical practice, primarily due to its significant costs, limited diagnostic yield, and uncertain prognostic role. The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in the medical field is a promising approach to processing extensive information and applying it to individual cases to enhance therapeutic decision-making and refine risk assessment."
"Mental health treatment is hindered by the limited number of mental health care providers and the infrequency of care. Digital mental health technology can help supplement treatment by remotely monitoring patient symptoms and predicting mental health crises in between clinical visits. However, the feasibility of digital mental health technologies has not yet been sufficiently explored. Rhythms, from the company Health Rhythms, is a smartphone platform that uses passively acquired smartphone data with artificial intelligence and predictive analytics to alert patients and providers to an emerging mental health crisis."
Suicide rates among Black and Hispanic youth have been increasing over the past decade in the United States. The objective of this study was to identify risk factors for suicide ideation and attempt among Black and Hispanic youth in the United States using intersectionality theory and minority stress theory as a framework.
"Arthritis significantly reduces health-related quality of life, causing pain, fatigue, and decreased physical activity. To address this, exercise is highly recommended. However, men are less likely to participate in rehabilitation compared to women. We detected the same tendency in a nationwide nature-based exercise program in Denmark, with only 8% male participants. Therefore, this qualitative study investigated what engaged and restrained men with arthritis from participating in a nature-based exercise program. We employed interviews as the primary method for data collection. Data were analyzed using Braun and Clarke's thematic analysis, revealing key patterns in participants' experiences. This study finds that the fourteen participants' experiences revealed two themes: (1) meeting with the nature-based exercise program was confusing, motivating, and disappointing, and (2) the social aspect is less important. To better engage men, future programs should include a clear description of the concept of the exercise, high-intensity exercise, a reduced emphasis on social activities, and consistency in the instructors' roles and guidance. Incorporating these findings can better address the needs and preferences of men, helping them feel more like individuals than patients."
"We developed a scoring system for assessing glaucoma risk using demographic and laboratory factors by employing a no-code approach (automated coding) using ChatGPT-4. Comprehensive health checkup data were collected from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Using ChatGPT-4, logistic regression was conducted to predict glaucoma without coding or manual numerical processes, and the scoring system was developed based on the odds ratios (ORs). ChatGPT-4 also facilitated the no-code creation of an easy-to-use risk calculator for glaucoma. The ORs for the high-risk groups were calculated to measure performance. ChatGPT-4 automatically developed a scoring system based on demographic and laboratory factors, and successfully implemented a risk calculator tool. The predictive ability of the scoring system was comparable to that of traditional machine learning approaches. For high-risk groups with 1-2, 3-4, and 5 + points, the calculated ORs for glaucoma were 1.87, 2.72, and 15.36 in the validation set, respectively, compared with the group with 0 or fewer points. This study presented a novel no-code approach for developing a glaucoma risk assessment tool using ChatGPT-4, highlighting its potential for democratizing advanced predictive analytics, making them readily available for clinical use in glaucoma detection."
"Spatial transcriptomic tools are an upcoming and powerful way to investigate targeted gene expression patterns within tissues. These tools offer the unique advantage of visualizing and understanding gene expression while preserving tissue integrity, thereby maintaining the spatial context of genes. Curio is a robust spatial transcriptomic tool that facilitates high throughput comprehensive spatial gene expression analysis across the entir e transcriptome with high efficiency. Here, we present a bioinformatics protocol for performing whole transcriptome gene expression analysis of mouse brain tissue using Curio. Specifically, we demonstrate using computational techniques to visualize expression patterns of various HOX genes in the mouse brain."
"The tumor microenvironment is an altered milieu that imposes multiple selective pressures leading to the survival and dissemination of aggressive and fit tumor cell subpopulations. How pre-tumoral and tumoral cells respond to changes in their microenvironment will determine the subsequent evolution of the tumor. In this study, we have subjected pre-tumoral and tumoral cells to coverslip-induced hypoxia, which recapitulates the intracellular hypoxia and extracellular acidification characteristic of the early tumor microenvironment, and we have used a combination of quantitative phase microscopy and epifluorescence to analyze diverse cellular responses to this altered environment. In normoxia, tumor cells showed differences in nuclear organization, as evidenced by decreased numbers of HP1 foci, and in hypoxia major changes in nuclear architecture were observed, with tumor cells significantly increasing the number of high dry mass density foci in the nucleus compared to pre-tumoral and non-tumoral cells. Conversely, compared to pre-tumoral and normal cells, mitochondrial ATP levels decayed markedly in tumor cells in hypoxia, whereas the activation of executioner caspases increased only in tumor cells in this condition. Therefore, in terms of cellular organization, metabolic changes and activation of cell death processes, tumor cells showed more dramatic responses to an altered microenvironment than their pre-tumoral and normal counterparts, responses which in turn could play fundamental roles in shaping future tumor development."
"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS) with no definitive trigger. However, epidemiological studies indicate that environmental factors, such as infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and low vitamin D (Vit D) levels in genetically predisposed individuals, are important risk factors. One leading proposal is that EBV triggers MS via mechanisms such as molecular mimicry, where activated autoreactive B and T lymphocytes mistakenly target self-antigens. In line with other risk factors, low serum Vit D level, genetic polymorphism of Vit D receptor, and higher incidence of MS in countries in the northern hemisphere, suggest that Vit D also plays a role in MS pathology. Vitamin D, known for its neuroprotective and immunomodulatory effects, helps maintain a balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory immune cells. Studies and ongoing clinical trials indicate that hypovitaminosis D is associated with an increased risk of MS, and Vit D supplement can help to reduce the disease severity. Moreover, hypovitaminosis D has also been associated with a dysregulated immune system and an increased risk of developing MS. This review explores how these three well-recognized risk factors - EBV infection, hypovitaminosis D, and dysregulated immune system - interact in the pathogenesis of MS. Understanding these interactions and their consequences could provide new insights into novel therapeutic approaches for treating this devastating disease."

"Buprenorphine was synthesized in the 1960s as a result of a search for a safe and effective opioid analgesic. Present formulations of buprenorphine are approved for the treatment of both acute and chronic pain. Its long duration of action, high affinity, and partial agonism at the µ-opioid receptor have established it as a mainstay treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD). Full agonist opioids (FAOs) remain a primary choice for perioperative pain in both opioid-naïve and opioid-tolerant patients despite well-known harms and new emphasis on multimodal analgesia strategies prioritizing nonopioid analgesics. We review the evidence supporting the use of buprenorphine as an effective analgesic alternative to more commonly prescribed FAOs in acute and chronic pain management. For the patient prescribed buprenorphine for OUD, prior conventionalism advised temporary discontinuation of buprenorphine preoperatively; this paradigm has shifted toward continuing buprenorphine throughout the perioperative period. Questions remain whether dose adjustments may improve patient outcomes."
"Complex educational challenges emerge during Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) dissertation research, yet many newly hired faculty receive little preparation for the role of dissertation supervisor. The intensity and rigor of dissertation supervision are not reflected in workload calculations based on enrollments or clock hours. New faculty have few venues beyond personal experience to learn the challenges that supervision entails."
"We implemented a pilot study to investigate symptoms and functional outcomes of Asian Americans treated in urban community mental health centers for a diagnosis of schizophrenia spectrum disorder. Furthermore, we investigated whether these outcomes differed between East and Southeast Asians. We collected quantitative data from 75 participants recruited using a nonprobability sampling strategy from six urban community mental health centers. We used the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (Kay et al. in Schizophrenia Bulletin 13(2):261-276, 1987) and the Strauss and Carpenter Outcome Scale (Strauss and Carpenter in Archives of General Psychiatry 27(6):739-746, 1972) to measure their symptoms and functional outcomes. To compare the outcomes between East and Southeast Asians, we used a multivariable logistic regression model, which adjusted for the estimated effects of age, sex assigned at birth, and age at onset of illness for each outcome examined. The data shows that the treatment outcomes for this group are poor. Only a small number of participants experienced symptomatic remission (30.67%), role restoration (34.67%), and clinical recovery (21.33%). The majority of those who did not experience clinical recovery had difficulties sustaining symptomatic remission and restoring role functioning (54.67%). However, more participants achieved social restoration (68.00%). The results did not vary by national origin groups and sex assigned at birth. However, the participant's age, the age at which the illness began, or both determined whether the treatment outcomes were favorable. Findings underscore the need for interventions that improve symptom control to increase the likelihood of other favorable outcomes."
"Cutaneous warts are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Distinguishing plantar warts from clavus and tylosis can be difficult. A less-invasive method of examining these lesions is necessary. Previously, we collected data on 90 patients with warts and related diseases to explore differentiation methods using HPV typing of tissue from the wart surface. In that study, 21 patients were diagnosed as cases with plantar warts, however, 10 of those 21 cases showed HPV-negative by polymerase chain reaction analysis, causing some ambiguity, thus their outcomes should be confirmed. To assess the role of HPV typing in clinical practice, we followed up these 21 cases (11 HPV-positive and 10 HPV-negative) and analyzed their outcomes. The HPV-positive group included HPV1a (one case), HPV27 (four cases), HPV57 (three cases), and HPV65 (three cases). The median age of the 21 patients was 43 years, that of the 11 HPV-positive cases was 37 years, and that of the 10 HPV-negative cases was 44 years. The sex ratios (male:female) of the HPV-positive and HPV-negative groups were 6:5 and 2:8, respectively. All 21 patients were treated with liquid nitrogen after surface keratin removal, concomitant with salicylic acid topical plaster or oral administration of Yokuinin. The longest follow-up period was 548 days. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to assess the healing rate according to HPV-positivity. The healing rate in HPV-positive cases was significantly higher than in HPV-negative cases (P = 0.001). Although the sample size was small, the results suggest HPV typing using non-invasive surface materials facilitates accurate diagnosis and prevents prolonged treatment of plantar warts."
The postpartum period remains a very important period during which contraceptive needs can be met and a significant reduction of maternal and foetal morbi-mortality achieved. This study aimed to evaluate past contraceptive experience and identify factors associated with the desire for postpartum family planning among women in late pregnancy.
"Recently, we demonstrated, using mRNA microarray analysis, that fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS), which are indigestible carbohydrates, enhanced the expression of several inflammation-related genes, such as CLEC7A, CCL2, ITGA2, and F3, by ≥4-fold in Caco-2 cells, a model of human intestinal absorptive cells, independently of intestinal bacteria (Harasawa A et al., Nutrition, 112140, 2023). However, whether FOS enhances the expression of genes in other pathways, particularly the non-inflammatory pathways, in Caco-2 cells has not been investigated. Here, we explored the pathways affected by FOS, based on identification of differentially expressed genes with ≥2-fold change (linear-fold change) in expression upon FOS treatment. Caco-2 cells were cultured for 24 h in high glucose-Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum containing FOS. The differentially expressed genes in these cells, identified using mRNA microarray analysis, were categorized using the pathway analysis and subsequently upregulated genes in typical pathways were subjected to protein network analysis. RT-qPCR was performed to validate the expression of selected genes. Treatment with 10% FOS enhanced the expression of a set of genes, such as ITGB8, ITGA6, SPP1, CAV1, LAMA3, ARHGAP5, and LAMC2, in the focal adhesion pathway. In addition, this treatment increased the expression of many genes involved in various inflammatory pathways, such as TNF, ITGA5, ITGB3, PTGS2, FGF2, FLNC, EDNRB, VEGFA, and MMP13. Protein network analysis showed that genes in the focal adhesion and endothelin pathways induced by FOS were closely associated with each other. FOS treatment of human intestinal absorptive-like cells enhances a set of genes in the focal adhesion and inflammation pathways."
"Deep learning (DL)-enabled magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reconstructions can enable shortening of breath-hold examinations and improve image quality by reducing motion artifacts. Prospective studies with DL reconstructions of accelerated MRI of the upper abdomen in the context of pancreatic pathologies are lacking. In a clinical setting, the purpose of this study is to investigate the performance of a novel DL-based reconstruction algorithm in T1-weighted volumetric interpolated breath-hold examinations with partial Fourier sampling and Dixon fat suppression (hereafter, VIBE-Dixon DL ). The objective is to analyze its impact on acquisition time, image sharpness and quality, diagnostic confidence, pancreatic lesion conspicuity, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR)."
"With an increasing number of studies delving into the impact of dietary supplements on combat sports performance, researchers are actively seeking a more efficient dietary supplement for use in these sports. Nonetheless, controversies persist. Hence, we undertook a systematic review and Bayesian network meta-analysis to discern the most effective dietary supplements in combat sports by synthesizing the available evidence. We conducted a comprehensive search across PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane, Embase, and SPORTDiscus, covering the period from their establishment to November 2, 2023. Our aim was to identify randomized controlled trials that evaluated the benefits of various dietary supplements for elite combat sports athletes. The risk of bias in these trials was assessed using the revised Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for Randomized Trials. Subsequently, we employed Bayesian network meta-analysis through R software and Stata 15.0. During the analysis, we performed subgroup analysis based on the type of combat, distinguishing between striking and grappling disciplines. The analysis is based on 67 randomized controlled trials that meet all the inclusion criteria, involving 1026 elite combat sports athletes randomly assigned to 26 different dietary supplements or placebos. Results from the 50 trials included in the network meta-analysis indicate that compared to a placebo, sodium bicarbonate combined with caffeine (SMD: 2.3, 95% CrI: 1.5, 3.2), caffeine (SMD: 0.72, 95% CrI: 0.53, 0.93), beta-alanine (SMD: 0.58, 95% CrI: 0.079, 1.1), and sodium bicarbonate (SMD: 0.54, 95% CrI: 0.30, 0.81) was associated with a statistically significant increase in blood lactate concentrations. Compared to placebo, caffeine (SMD: 0.27, 95% CrI: 0.12, 0.41) was associated with a statistically significant increase in the final heart rate. Compared to placebo, creatine combined with sodium bicarbonate (SMD: 2.2, 95% CrI: 1.5, 3.1), creatine (SMD: 1.0, 95% CrI: 0.38, 1.6), and sodium bicarbonate (SMD: 0.42, 95% CrI: 0.18, 0.66) was associated with a statistically significant increase in mean power. Compared to placebo, creatine combined with sodium bicarbonate (SMD: 1.6, 95% CrI: 0.85, 2.3), creatine (SMD: 1.1, 95% CrI: 0.45, 1.7), and sodium bicarbonate (SMD: 0.35, 95% CrI: 0.11, 0.57) was associated with a statistically significant increase in peak power. Compared to placebo, caffeine (SMD: 1.4, 95% CrI: 0.19, 2.7) was associated with a statistically significant increase in the number of kicks. Compared to placebo, caffeine (SMD: 0.35, 95% CrI: 0.081, 0.61) was associated with a statistically significant increase in the number of throws. This study suggests that a range of dietary supplements, including caffeine, sodium bicarbonate, sodium bicarbonate combined with caffeine, creatine, creatine combined with sodium bicarbonate, and beta-alanine can improve the athletic performance of elite combat sports athletes."
"Early opacification of the renal collecting system during CT myelography (CTM) performed for the evaluation of spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) has been demonstrated in prior studies. However, these investigations often included CTMs scanned >30 minutes after intrathecal contrast injection, a longer delay than the myelographic techniques used in current practice. The purpose of this study was to determine whether renal contrast excretion (RCE) measured during this earlier time period (≤30 minutes) can discriminate patients with SIH from patients without SIH."
"Body mass index (BMI) consistently correlates with the triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index, a marker of insulin resistance, which in turn is linked to heightened cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Thus, insulin resistance could potentially mediate the association between BMI and CVD risk. However, few studies have explored this mechanism in the general population."
"With the widespread use of diverse modern molecular testing tools, the last two decades have seen significant advances in the classification of soft tissue neoplasms. Specifically, numerous molecularly defined new entities have been introduced and many established older entities have received more insightful molecular studies that have developed their classification further. The discrepant therapeutic and prognostic implications of this evolving complexity of the nosology of neoplastic diseases make the precise subtyping of soft tissue neoplasms unavoidable. However, these rapid developments of the modern diagnostic molecular pathology did not only offer efficient solutions to many complex classification issues, but they were accompanied by similarly complex and diverse emerging problems. Most importantly, these advances have not only challenged the historical dogma of some phenotypes that were once considered specific, but they also have questioned the value of diagnostic immunohistochemistry compared to emerging modern diagnostic molecular tools. Moreover, the central question of when to test, what to test, and how to test became more confusing. This review addresses the major molecular categories in soft tissue neoplasms, their characteristics, and the criteria to be used for selecting the most appropriate molecular diagnostic tool to be used in individual cases with a special focus on the value of next generation immunohistochemistry as a substitute for molecular testing."
Socioeconomic disadvantage has been associated with negative outcomes following total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The area deprivation index (ADI) and distressed communities index (DCI) are composite rankings that score socioeconomic status (SES) using patients' home addresses. The purpose of this study was to examine the association of ADI and DCI with outcomes following THA and TKA while controlling for potential confounding covariates.
"The rate at which mutations arise is a fundamental parameter of biology. Despite progress in measuring germline mutation rates across diverse taxa, such estimates are missing for much of Earth's biodiversity. Here, we present the first estimate of a germline mutation rate from the phylum Mollusca. We sequenced three pedigreed families of the white abalone Haliotis sorenseni, a long-lived, large-bodied, and critically endangered mollusk, and estimated a de novo mutation rate of 8.60 × 10-9 single nucleotide mutations per site per generation. This mutation rate is similar to rates measured in vertebrates with comparable generation times and longevity to abalone, and higher than mutation rates measured in faster-reproducing invertebrates. The spectrum of de novo mutations is also similar to that seen in vertebrate species, although an excess of rare C > A polymorphisms in wild individuals suggests that a modifier allele or environmental exposure may have once increased C > A mutation rates. We use our rate to infer baseline effective population sizes (Ne) across multiple Pacific abalone and find that abalone persisted over most of their evolutionary history as large and stable populations, in contrast to extreme fluctuations over recent history and small census sizes in the present day. We then use our mutation rate to infer the timing and pattern of evolution of the abalone genus Haliotis, which was previously unknown due to few fossil calibrations. Our findings are an important step toward understanding mutation rate evolution and they establish a key parameter for conservation and evolutionary genomics research in mollusks."
"Accurately diagnosing rare pediatric diseases frequently represent a clinical challenge due to their complex and unusual clinical presentations. Here, we explore the capabilities of three large language models (LLMs), GPT-4, Gemini Pro, and a custom-built LLM (GPT-4 integrated with the Human Phenotype Ontology [GPT-4 HPO]), by evaluating their diagnostic performance on 61 rare pediatric disease case reports. The performance of the LLMs were assessed for accuracy in identifying specific diagnoses, listing the correct diagnosis among a differential list, and broad disease categories. In addition, GPT-4 HPO was tested on 100 general pediatrics case reports previously assessed on other LLMs to further validate its performance. The results indicated that GPT-4 was able to predict the correct diagnosis with a diagnostic accuracy of 13.1%, whereas both GPT-4 HPO and Gemini Pro had diagnostic accuracies of 8.2%. Further, GPT-4 HPO showed an improved performance compared with the other two LLMs in identifying the correct diagnosis among its differential list and the broad disease category. Although these findings underscore the potential of LLMs for diagnostic support, particularly when enhanced with domain-specific ontologies, they also stress the need for further improvement prior to integration into clinical practice."
"Exploring the response relationship between civil war, population and land cover change is of great practical significance for social stability in Myanmar. However, the ongoing civil war in Myanmar hinders direct understanding of the situation on the ground, which in turn limits detailed study of the intricate relationship between the dynamics of the civil war and its impact on population and land. Therefore, this paper explores the response relationship between civil war conflict and population and land cover change in Myanmar from 2010 to 2020 from the perspective of remote sensing using the land cover data we produced, the open spatial demographics data, and the armed conflict location and event data project. The results of this study show that: (1) Myanmar has regional variations in land cover types and land cover types have changed significantly. (2) Land cover change types varies considerably, but the main land cover change type is from other types to forest, grassland and shrubland. (3) Myanmar has a significant increase in the number of civil war conflicts from 2010 to 2020 and a significant correlation between civil war conflicts and forests, shrublands and permanent snow and ice. (4) The number of people in areas with high civil war conflicts decreases. (5) Population counts has correlation with cultivated land, forests, water bodies and artificial surfaces."

"This article explores ""how do victims-survivors of gender-based violence (GBV) experience and perceive justice?"" based on interviews with 251 victims-survivors with experience of different types of GBV and criminal, civil, and family justice systems. Victims-survivors were found to have multiple perceptions of justice, related to different points in their journey following abuse and regarding individual, community, and societal responses. Perceptions relate to accountability; fairness in outcome and process; protection from future harm; recognition; agency; empowerment; affective justice; reparation; and social transformation. Current understandings of justice in legislative and policy approaches reproduce the ""justice gap"" by failing to take account of how survivors themselves understand and demand justice."
"Although the Neer and AO/OTA classifications have been widely accepted, observer reliability studies of these two classifications have questioned their reliability and reproducibility to date. We developed an entirely new classification, the Mitsuzawa classification, for dislocated and displaced proximal humeral fractures and tested all three classifications for their intra- and interobserver reliability."
"Osteoarthritis is a heterogeneous disorder that is increasingly prevalent largely due to aging and obesity, resulting in a major disease burden worldwide. Knowledge about the underlying aetiology has improved, with increased understanding of the role of genetic factors, the microbiome, and existence of different pain mechanisms. However, this knowledge has not yet been translated into new treatment options. New evidence has questioned the efficacy of recommended treatments, such as therapeutic exercise programmes and the focus on weight loss, but managing obesity and maintaining activity remain important for the prevention and management of osteoarthritis. Approaches should consider individual and cultural preferences and resource availability to increase patient and community engagement, and optimise outcomes worldwide. Most of the focus has been on established osteoarthritis where management is primarily directed at relieving symptoms. The search for the much needed effective treatments that improve both symptoms and structure, often referred to as disease-modifying osteoarthritic drugs, is ongoing. Promising data indicate that targeting inflammation is effective in hand osteoarthritis."
"The COVID-19 outbreak, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, was linked to significant neurological and psychiatric manifestations. This review examines the physiopathological mechanisms underlying these neuropsychiatric outcomes and discusses current management strategies. Primarily a respiratory disease, COVID-19 frequently leads to neurological issues, including cephalalgia and migraines, loss of sensory perception, cerebrovascular accidents, and neurological impairment such as encephalopathy. Lasting neuropsychological effects have also been recorded in individuals following SARS-CoV-2 infection. These include anxiety, depression, and cognitive dysfunction, suggesting a lasting impact on mental health. The neuroinvasive potential of the virus, inflammatory responses, and the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in neuroinflammation are critical factors in neuropsychiatric COVID-19 manifestations. In addition, the review highlights the importance of monitoring biomarkers to assess Central Nervous System (CNS) involvement. Management strategies for these neuropsychiatric conditions include supportive therapy, antiepileptic drugs, antithrombotic therapy, and psychotropic drugs, emphasizing the need for a multidisciplinary approach. Understanding the long-term neuropsychiatric implications of COVID-19 is essential for developing effective treatment protocols and improving patient outcomes."
"The conventional test to detect unilateral spatial neglect (USN) is the Bells Test performed in a paper-and-pencil format. While several studies showed immersive virtual reality (VR) tests may provide greater sensitivity in revealing the presence of USN using visual scanning tasks, none has investigated the Bells Test in VR. This study compares the Bells Test performed in paper-and-pencil format (PP) and in VR in conventional (CVR) and ecological (EVR) format, which differ by the size of the display, in stroke patients."
"Immune response plays an important role in the regulation of elderly hip fracture. This study aims to analyze the relationship between systemic inflammatory markers including neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), and systemic inflammation response index (SIRI) and mortality and walking independence, providing valuable references for the postoperative management of geriatric hip fracture."
"Veterans put their lives on the line to serve our country, but their well-being is often threatened by multifaceted health issues related to military service, including elevated rates of lung cancer and depression. A significant percentage of Veterans have lost faith in mental health care or are unable to breach stigma-related barriers to seek and engage in this care. Veterans' lack of trust can be exacerbated by community mental health clinicians who have had little experience with Veterans and feel inadequately prepared to address their complex needs."
"Named after the Greek term for ""hard fat"", stearic acid has gradually entered people's field of vision. As an important component of various physiological cellular functions, stearic acid plays a regulatory role in diverse aspects of energy metabolism and signal transduction. Its applications range from serving as a bodily energy source to participating in endogenous biosynthesis. Similar to palmitate, stearic acid serves as a primary substrate for the stearoyl coenzyme A desaturase, which catalyzes the conversion of stearate to oleate and is involved in the synthesis of triglyceride and other complex lipids. Additionally, stearic acid functions as a vital signaling molecule in pathological processes such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes development, liver injury and even nervous system disorders. Therefore, we conduct a comprehensive review of stearic acid, summarizing its role in various diseases and attempting to provide a systematic overview of its homeostasis, physiological functions, and pathological process. From a medical standpoint, we also explore potential applications and discuss stearic acid as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of human diseases."

"Oral artemisinin has antiparasitic activity and may help improve treatment success rates in dogs infected with Babesia gibsoni. However, these artemisinin products are unapproved and unregulated botanical supplements. They have not been evaluated for safety and efficacy or for strength, purity, or quality compared with a reference standard. Before considering these products for a clinical study, we evaluated the strength of four suppliers of artemisinin capsules using an high-performance liquid chromatography method validated in our laboratory. We found that the four artemisinin-labeled products that were tested had high within product and between product variability in capsule strength compared with the stated capsule strength on the product label. No products met the acceptance criteria of the United States Pharmacopeia and International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) as well as the criteria adapted by the authors. One product had no detectable artemisinin, and the other three products were much higher than the stated label strength. The results of this study reinforce the importance of testing unapproved and unregulated supplements before recommending a supplement for clinical use in dogs."
"Robotic technology has been used in total hip arthroplasty (THA) for several years. Despite the advances in this field, perspectives surrounding robotic THA are not fully understood. This study aimed to characterize the landscape of robotic THA on social media."
"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disease mainly caused by β-amyloid (Aβ) accumulation in the brain. Among the several factors that may concur to AD development, elevated cholesterol levels and brain cholesterol dyshomeostasis have been recognized to play a relevant role. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a protein primarily known to regulate plasma low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) rich in cholesterol and to be one of the main causes of familial hypercholesterolemia. In addition to that, PCSK9 is also recognized to carry out diverse important activities in the brain, including control of neuronal differentiation, apoptosis, and, importantly, LDL receptors functionality. Moreover, PCSK9 appeared to be directly involved in some of the principal processes responsible for AD development, such as inflammation, oxidative stress, and Aβ deposition. On these bases, PCSK9 management might represent a promising approach for AD treatment. The purpose of this review is to elucidate the role of PCSK9, whether or not cholesterol-related, in AD pathogenesis and to give an updated overview of the most innovative therapeutic strategies developed so far to counteract the pleiotropic activities of both humoral and brain PCSK9, focusing in particular on their potentiality for AD management."
"The precise localization of epileptic foci with the help of EEG or iEEG signals is still a clinical challenge with current methodology, especially if the foci are not close to individual electrodes. On the research side, dipole reconstruction for focus localization is a topic of recent and current developments. Relatively low numbers of recording electrodes cause ill-posed and ill-conditioned problems in the inversion of lead-field matrices to calculate the focus location. Estimations instead of tissue conductivity measurements further deteriorate the precision of location tasks. In addition, time-resolved phase shifts are used to describe connectivity. We hypothesize that correlations over runtime approaches might be feasible to predict seizure foci with adequate precision. In a case study on EEG correlation in a healthy subject, we found repetitive periods of alternating high correlation in the short (20 ms) and long (300 ms) range. During these periods, a numerical determination of proportions of predominant latency and, newly established here, directionality is possible, which supports the identification of loops that, according to current opinion, manifest themselves in epileptic seizures. In the future, this latency and directionality analysis could support focus localization via dipole reconstruction using new triangulation calculations."
"Using hydrophobic antimicrobial food packaging films offers significant opportunities to extend the shelf life of food. This study developed a hydrophobically modified starch-based film incorporating alkyl ketene dimers (AKDs) and chitosan (CS) for mango preservation. The film's physicochemical properties and structural characteristics were comprehensively analyzed. The successful integration of AKDs into the starch (ST) matrix was confirmed through FT-IR, XRD, XPS, and SEM techniques, which revealed the establishment of β-ketoester linkages via esterification. The addition of AKDs significantly enhanced the film's hydrophobicity and mechanical properties, attributed to chemical cross-linking and the formation of intermolecular hydrogen bonds. In an eight-day room temperature storage test, the ST-AKD/CS films effectively extended the shelf life of mangoes by four days compared to the control and ST groups. As all components of the films are environmentally friendly and biodegradable, these hydrophobic films offer a promising solution for prolonging the freshness of mangoes while maintaining sustainability."
"Juvenile granulosa cell tumor (JGCT) of the ovary is a rare tumor with distinct clinicopathological and hormonal features primarily affecting young women and children. We conducted a complex clinicopathological, immunohistochemical, and molecular analysis of five cases of JGCT."
"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic condition influenced by a variety of factors, including genetics, the environment, and gut microbiota. The incidence of IBD is increasing globally. Previous studies have shown that interactions between diet and gut microbiota influence the pathogenesis and treatment of IBD. Proper dietary nutrition including oat and oat bran regulates chronic inflammation, which is essential for individual health, and is one of the essential factors in reducing inflammation in the body and keeping the immune system functioning properly, which plays a role in the prevention and treatment of diseases. However, the mechanism of action of whether oat and oat bran will alleviate chronic inflammation by modulating intestinal flora and metabolites remains unknown."
Reconstruction of the pharynx after ablative cancer surgery is challenging. Restoration of function and esthetics is at the forefront. There is currently no gold standard for reconstruction. The workhorses for free flap reconstruction are the radial free forearm flap or the anterolateral thigh flap. For medium size defects the free lateral arm flap is an excellent alternative.

"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide, and its incidence and prevalence are increasing in many countries. Modeling of CVD plays a crucial role in understanding the trend of CVD death cases, evaluating the effectiveness of interventions, and predicting future disease trends. This study aims to investigate the modeling and forecasting of CVD mortality, specifically in the Sindh province of Pakistan. The civil hospital in the Nawabshah area of Sindh province, Pakistan, provided the data set used in this study. It is a time series dataset with actual cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality cases from 1999 to 2021 included. This study analyzes and forecasts the CVD deaths in the Sindh province of Pakistan using classical time series models, including Naïve, Holt-Winters, and Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES), which have been adopted and compared with a machine learning approach called the Artificial Neural Network Auto-Regressive (ANNAR) model. The performance of both the classical time series models and the ANNAR model has been evaluated using key performance indicators such as Root Mean Square Deviation Error, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). After comparing the results, it was found that the ANNAR model outperformed all the selected models, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting CVD mortality and quantifying future disease burden in the Sindh province of Pakistan. The study concludes that the ANNAR model is the best-selected model among the competing models for predicting CVD mortality in the Sindh province. This model provides valuable insights into the impact of interventions aimed at reducing CVD and can assist in formulating health policies and allocating economic resources. By accurately forecasting CVD mortality, policymakers can make informed decisions to address this public health issue effectively."
"Kirner deformity is a rare anomaly of the little finger in adolescents, characterized by a deformity of the distal phalanx and a radiologically L-shaped epiphysis, along with palmar and radial angulation of the distal phalanx. Due to the rarity of these pathological findings, there are no systematic literature reviews available. This work serves as an overview of the clinical presentation, frequency and age distributions, as well as possible conservative and surgical treatment options."
"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) can achieve durable responses in patients with advanced melanoma, and results from clinical trials suggest cure may be possible for a subset of patients. Despite clinical trial data, little is known about the risk, character, and clinical outcome of late recurrences after ICI. This study aimed to explore the disease outcomes and survival in a cohort of patients with long-term responses to ICI. We retrospectively identified patients treated with ICI for advanced melanoma with long-term disease control, defined as not requiring a subsequent line of systemic therapy within 3 years of ICI commencement. We analysed disease characteristics, treatment, toxicity, recurrence patterns, management, and outcomes. A total of 567 patients were identified with a median follow-up of 7.1 years: 504 (89 %) without disease progression within 3 years (cohort 1) and 63 (11.1 %) with disease progression within 3 years managed without a change in systemic therapy (cohort 2). Subsequent progression after 3 years occurred for 39 (7.7 %) patients in cohort 1, compared to 14 (22 %) in cohort 2. Predictors for late progression after 3 years were a non-complete radiological response (CR) best response and prior progression within 3 years. Thirty-two patients (5.6 %) died during follow-up, 8 (1.4 %) from melanoma, 6 (1.2 %) from cohort 1 and 2 (3.2 %) from cohort 2. In this population of patients with advanced melanoma with long-term disease control from ICI, the risk of subsequent disease progression and death was low. This suggests that a significant proportion of long-term ICI responders are likely cured and may inform the frequency and duration of follow-up."
"Quorum sensing (QS) enables bacteria to coordinate colony-wide activities, including those associated with infections. Quorum quenching (QQ) inhibits QS and is a promising method for controlling bacterial infections.

This review examines the potential of nanoparticles for quorum quenching, focusing on the QS-regulated pathogenicity of wound pathogens."
"The CUT&RUN technique facilitates detection of protein-DNA interactions across the genome. Typical applications of CUT&RUN include profiling changes in histone tail modifications or mapping transcription factor chromatin occupancy. Widespread adoption of CUT&RUN is driven, in part, by technical advantages over conventional ChIP-seq that include lower cell input requirements, lower sequencing depth requirements, and increased sensitivity with reduced background signal due to a lack of cross-linking agents that otherwise mask antibody epitopes. Widespread adoption of CUT&RUN has also been achieved through the generous sharing of reagents by the Henikoff lab and the development of commercial kits to accelerate adoption for beginners. As technical adoption of CUT&RUN increases, CUT&RUN sequencing analysis and validation become critical bottlenecks that must be surmounted to enable complete adoption by predominantly wet lab teams. CUT&RUN analysis typically begins with quality control checks on raw sequencing reads to assess sequencing depth, read quality, and potential biases. Reads are then aligned to a reference genome sequence assembly, and several bioinformatics tools are subsequently employed to annotate genomic regions of protein enrichment, confirm data interpretability, and draw biological conclusions. Although multiple in silico analysis pipelines have been developed to support CUT&RUN data analysis, their complex multi-module structure and usage of multiple programming languages render the platforms difficult for bioinformatics beginners who may lack familiarity with multiple programming languages but wish to understand the CUT&RUN analysis procedure and customize their analysis pipelines. Here, we provide a single-language step-by-step CUT&RUN analysis pipeline protocol designed for users with any level of bioinformatics experience. This protocol includes completing critical quality checks to validate that the sequencing data is suitable for biological interpretation. We expect that following the introductory protocol provided in this article combined with downstream peak annotation will allow users to draw biological insights from their own CUT&RUN datasets."
"Non-adherence to standard wear, care, and follow-up procedures is a major risk factor for contact lens-related complications. The effectiveness of orthokeratology largely depends on the wearer's adherence. However, a deficiency in scales capturing adherence beliefs pertinent to orthokeratology exacerbates the lack of guidance for effective intervention strategies. The purpose of this study is to develop and evaluate the psychometric properties of a new scale based on the Theory of Planned Behavior that assesses the level of adherence among ortho-k wearers."
"Studies have confirmed that rituximab (RTX) can improve the efficacy of BL, but there is a certain effect on the level of immunoglobulin, which will lead to the verification of infection, and the previous study of our center has confirmed that reducing the dose of RTX (4 doses) can achieve a similar effect to the standard dose of RTX (6 doses), can it reduce the effect on the level of immunoglobulin? To date, few studies have concentrated on the effects of immunoglobulin (Ig) on Chinese paediatric patients. This study aimed to examine whether there is a variation in the impact of different doses of RTX on immunoglobulin levels in the high-risk group of children with BL. Clinical data of high-risk pediatric patients with BL who were treated in Beijing Children's Hospital (Beijing, China) were retrospectively analysed. Baseline characteristics and serum Ig levels were collected at four distinct time points (t0 = pre-chemotherapy, t1 = at the end of chemotherapy, t2 = 6 months post-chemotherapy, t3 = 12 months post-chemotherapy). Ig levels were measured at various time points before and after treatment within three RTX treatment groups: R0 group (standard chemotherapy without RTX), R6 group (6 doses of RTX + chemotherapy), and R4 group (4 doses of RTX + chemotherapy). The objective was to compare whether differences existed among the three groups. The results revealed that the study enrolled 300 high-risk BL patients, including 256 boys and 44 girls, distributed across three groups based on RTX dosage: R0 group (n = 38), R6 group (n = 87), and R4 group (n = 175). Median Ig levels were assessed at four time points (t0, t1, t2, t3) for each group. In the R0 group, IgA and IgM levels significantly decreased at t1 compared with t0 (P = 0.006 and 0.002, respectively), while were gradually recovered at t2, returning to t0 levels at t3 (P = 0.073 and 0.293, respectively). IgG levels exhibited no significant difference between t0 and t1 (P = 0.89), reaching their lowest levels at t2 and returning to t0 levels at t3 (P = 0.14). In the R4 group, the minimum levels of IgA, IgM, and IgG were identified at t1 (P < 0.001, < 0.001, and < 0.001, respectively), which were gradually recovered at t2, while remained lower than t0 levels at t3 (P < 0.001, < 0.001, and = 0.005, respectively). The R6 group exhibited reduction in IgA and IgM levels at t1, with gradual recovery at t2 and t3, while remained lower than t0 levels (P = 0.003 and < 0.001, respectively). IgG levels in the R6 group decreased at t1 (P < 0.001) and did not return to t0 levels at t3 (P = 0.004). In the R4 and R6 groups, it was observed that children with hypogammaglobulinemia pre-RTX were more likely to combine with persistent hypogammaglobulinemia (PH-Ig) post-RTX. A 1:1 matched comparison between R4 and R6 groups (78 patients each) revealed consistently higher IgA, IgM, and IgG levels in the R4 group at each time point after chemotherapy. Notably, IgA and IgG levels recovered earlier in the R4 group than those in the R6 group (P < 0.05). Burkitt lymphoma in the high-risk group were more likely to complicated hypoimmunoglobulinemia after treatment, it is important to monitor Ig levels before and during treatment, and to inform replacement therapy for Ig. Compared with standard chemotherapy group, the RTX group had a longer time of low Ig and a slower recovery, reducing the dosage of rituximab can improve the recovery of IgA and IgG levels."
"α-Synuclein misfolds into pathological forms that lead to various neurodegenerative diseases known collectively as α-synucleinopathies. In this Review, we provide a comprehensive overview of pivotal advances in α-synuclein research. We examine structural features and physiological functions of α-synuclein and summarize current insights into key post-translational modifications, such as nitration, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, sumoylation and truncation, considering their contributions to neurodegeneration. We also highlight the existence of disease-specific α-synuclein strains and their mechanisms of pathological spread, and discuss seed amplification assays and PET tracers as emerging diagnostic tools for detecting pathological α-synuclein in clinical settings. We also discuss α-synuclein aggregation and clearance mechanisms, and review cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous processes that contribute to neuronal death, including the roles of adaptive and innate immunity in α-synuclein-driven neurodegeneration. Finally, we highlight promising therapeutic approaches that target pathological α-synuclein and provide insights into emerging areas of research."

"Adolescence is a crucial period for the development of the sexual self-concept. While existing research shows that adolescents' sexual self-concept varies, few studies have examined its relation with psychosocial competencies such as the general self-concept, interpersonal skills, and self-control capacities. The objective of this study was to examine the association between dimensions of the sexual self-concept (sexual self- and body esteem, self-efficacy, and anxiety) and psychosocial competencies among Canadian adolescents. Self-reported data from 1584 adolescents aged between 14 and 18 years (49.7% girls) were analyzed using path analysis. Results show that adolescents whose general self-concept was characterized by more internally consistent self-beliefs and greater self-worth, and who perceived their interpersonal skills as more developed, displayed higher sexual self- and body esteem, higher sexual self-efficacy, and lower sexual anxiety. Self-control capacities were positively correlated with sexual body-esteem and negatively correlated with sexual anxiety. These associations were, however, minimal and, when significant, exhibited a counterintuitive relationship with the sexual self-concept in the path model. Age, gender and sexual experience did not moderate these associations. Findings from the study highlight the need to pursue research on the interface between sexuality and psychosocial functioning to increase current understanding of adolescent development."
"Part 2 explores the transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in addressing the complexities of headache disorders through innovative approaches, including digital twin models, wearable healthcare technologies and biosensors, and AI-driven drug discovery. Digital twins, as dynamic digital representations of patients, offer opportunities for personalized headache management by integrating diverse datasets such as neuroimaging, multiomics, and wearable sensor data to advance headache research, optimize treatment, and enable virtual trials. In addition, AI-driven wearable devices equipped with next-generation biosensors combined with multi-agent chatbots could enable real-time physiological and biochemical monitoring, diagnosing, facilitating early headache attack forecasting and prevention, disease tracking, and personalized interventions. Furthermore, AI-driven advances in drug discovery leverage machine learning and generative AI to accelerate the identification of novel therapeutic targets and optimize treatment strategies for migraine and other headache disorders. Despite these advances, challenges such as data standardization, model explainability, and ethical considerations remain pivotal. Collaborative efforts between clinicians, biomedical and biotechnological engineers, AI scientists, legal representatives and bioethics experts are essential to overcoming these barriers and unlocking AI's full potential in transforming headache research and healthcare. This is a call to action in proposing novel frameworks for integrating AI-based technologies into headache care."
"Plastics are a prevalent and persistent pollutant in the environment. As plastic production increases, finding ways to degrade these recalcitrant polymers is paramount. Many terrestrial fungi, across the kingdom, degrade various types of plastic. Plastics are the fastest-growing habitat in the oceans, and we hypothesized that fungi isolated from the ocean would demonstrate high success rates in degrading polyurethane (PU). To test this, visual degradation assays were performed by inoculating 1% PU medium with 68 different fungal strains cultured from marine habitats. The area of clearance of the fungus was measured periodically, to determine a relative degradation rate. Of the 68 fungal strains, 42 demonstrated the ability to degrade PU. We conditioned the nine fastest PU degraders through serial inoculations into liquid media with increasing concentrations of PU, starting at 1% and going up to 12%. The growth rates of the original and conditioned fungi were then compared in new inoculation trials, and results show that three of the nine conditioned fungi demonstrate higher PU degradation rates than their unconditioned counterparts. Marine fungi, coupled with conditioning, show promise for developing novel mycoremediation technologies."
"Raman spectroscopy, a nondestructive optical technique that provides detailed chemical information, has attracted growing interest in the food industry. Complementary spectroscopic methods, such as near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), terahertz (THz) spectroscopy, laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS), and fluorescence spectroscopy (Flu), enhance Raman spectroscopy's capabilities in various applications. The integration of Raman with these techniques, termed ""Raman plus X,"" has shown significant potential in agri-food analysis. This review highlights the latest advances and applications of dual-modal spectroscopy methods combining Raman spectroscopy with NIR, NMR, THz, LIBS, and Flu in food analysis. Key applications include detecting harmful contaminants, evaluating food quality, identifying adulteration, and characterizing structure. The synergistic use of Raman-based dual-modal spectroscopy provides more comprehensive information and improves modeling accuracy compared to single techniques. The review also explores the role of data fusion in multisource spectral analysis and discusses challenges and prospects of ""Raman plus X,"" including the development of integrated hardware and advanced data fusion algorithms. These advancements aim to streamline multisource data analysis, offering valuable insights to select appropriate analytical methods for practical applications in the food industry."
"In recent years, numerous potential prognostic biomarkers for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have been investigated. Despite these advancements, clinical practice primarily relies on autoantibody tests-for rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-citrullinated protein antibody (anti-CCP)-alongside inflammatory markers, such as the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP). Expanding the repertoire of diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers is critical for improving clinical outcomes in RA. Emerging evidence highlights the significance of synovial fluid biomarkers, including aggrecan, matrix metalloproteinases, glucosyl-galactosyl-pyridinoline, hyaluronic acid, S100 proteins, calprotectin, and various cytokines, as well as immunological markers. Additionally, specific components of extracellular vesicles, such as non-coding RNAs, heat shock proteins, and lipids, are gaining attention. This review focuses on molecular markers found in synovial fluid and extracellular vesicles, excluding clinical and imaging biomarkers, and explores their potential applications in the diagnosis and management of RA."
"Amniotic fluid (AF)-derived exosomal miRNA have been explored as potential contributors to the pathogenesis of Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). This study aimed to investigate the expression profiles of AF-derived exosomal miRNAs and their potential contribution to TOF development. Exosomes were isolated from AF samples obtained from pregnant women carrying fetuses diagnosed with TOF. AF-derived exosomal miRNAs expression profiles were generated using the Agilent human miRNA Array V21.0, comparing 5 TOF samples with 5 healthy controls. Differential expression analysis identified 257 significantly dysregulated miRNAs in the TOF group. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis revealed that the predicted targets of these differentially expressed miRNAs were enriched in pathways associated with congenital disorders. Notably, 25 of these miRNAs were previously reported to be regulated by both Notch and Wnt signaling pathways, which are critical to heart development. Further investigation using mouse embryonal carcinoma P19 cells revealed that miR-10a-5p overexpression inhibited cardiomyogenic differentiation, as evidenced by the suppression of cardiomyocyte marker genes like TBX5. A dual-luciferase reporter assay confirmed TBX5 as a direct target of miR-10a-5p, suggesting a regulatory mechanism involving their interaction. In summary, our study demonstrates that miR-10a-5p may contribute to the pathogenesis of TOF by impairing cardiomyocyte differentiation through direct targeting of TBX5. These findings enhance our understanding of TOF and its molecular underpinnings."
"Improvement of left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction (DD) is known to be a good prognostic factor in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (EF).

"Neuron conversion leads to proliferation inhibition of glioma cells and may be an effective strategy to combat glioma and prevent recurrence. In this study, drug repositioning based on Connectivity Map (CMap) was conducted to discover drugs that could induce the differentiation of glioma cells into neuron-like cells, complemented by in vitro experimental validation. Downregulated neuronal genes in glioma were identified by the Human Protein Atlas database and the GeneCards database, and enrichment analysis and Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) were performed to ensure their reliability before they were uploaded to CMap for drug screening. The potential drug targets were screened through GEPIA and validated by the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas database. Cell morphology, proliferation, and neuronal marker expression were detected to evaluate the differentiation-inducing effect of the selected drugs. The bioinformatics analysis identified histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors as potential drugs. HDAC1/3/7 showed the relationship with neuronal genes, and HDAC1 showed the highest level of inverse correlation with neuronal gene expression and had the highest hazard ratio. In vitro study showed that both the pan-HDAC inhibitor belinostat, class I and class IIa HDAC inhibitor valproic acid, and selective HDAC1 inhibitor parthenolide induce morphology alteration, proliferation inhibition, expression of neuronal markers including microtubule-associated protein 2, neuronal nuclei antigen, and synaptophysin in U87 cells. This study suggests that the HDAC inhibitors belinostat, valproic acid, and parthenolide can induce glioma cells to differentiate into neuron-like cells, with HDAC1/3/7 being the likely drug targets and HDAC1 potentially playing an important role in this."
"In prolactinoma diagnosis, current guidelines recommend prolactin (PRL) assessment, considering values exceeding 200 ng/mL highly suggestive of prolactinoma. However, subtler hyperprolactinemia is more common, and to rule out potential prolactinomas, pituitary resonance magnetic imaging (MRI) studies are necessary. These present limitations in terms of availability, costs, and delays in diagnosis. We aimed to evaluate the screening utility of the metoclopramide (MCP) test in identifying patients with moderate hyperprolactinemia for whom MRI studies might be unnecessary."

"Despite the considerable body of research dedicated to the field of neurodegeneration, the gap in knowledge on the prion protein and its intricate involvement in brain diseases remains substantial. However, in the past decades, many steps forward have been taken toward a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying both the physiological role of the prion protein and the misfolding event converting it into its pathological counterpart, the prion. This review aims to provide an overview of the main findings regarding this protein, highlighting the advantages of many different animal models that share a conserved amino acid sequence and/or structure with the human prion protein. A particular focus will be given to the species Danio rerio, a compelling research organism for the investigation of prion biology, thanks to its conserved orthologs, ease of genetic manipulation, and cost-effectiveness of high-throughput experimentation. We will explore its potential in filling some of the gaps on physiological and pathological aspects of the prion protein, with the aim of directing the future development of therapeutic interventions."
"Translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane (TOMM) complex plays an important role in the transport of proteins from the cytoplasm into the mitochondria. TOMM7, one of the subunits of the TOMM complex, modulates its assembly and stability. Bi-allelic disease-causing variants in TOMM7 (MIM* 607980) have been previously reported in two unrelated families with a diverse phenotype of short stature, lipodystrophy, progeria, developmental delay, hypotonia, and skeletal dysplasia. We report a 4-month-old female child significantly affected with neonatal-onset hypotonia, lactic acidosis, optic atrophy, and neuroimaging findings suggestive of Leigh disease with a novel canonical splice variant, c.153-2A > C in TOMM7 (NM_019059.5). Further work done on cDNA of parents revealed the presence of shorter transcripts secondary to aberrant splicing."
"Synchrotron microbeam radiotherapy (MRT), which has entered the clinical transfer phase, requires the development of appropriate quality assurance (QA) tools due to very high dose rates and spatial hyperfractionation. A microstrip plastic scintillating detector system with associated modules was proposed in the context of real-time MRT QA. A prototype of such a system with 105 scintillating microstrips was developed and tested under MRT conditions. The signal obtained from each microstrip when irradiated was reproducible, linear with the dose, and independent of both the dose rate and the beam energy. The detector prototype was capable of measuring an entire 52-microbeam field in real time and exhibited outstanding radiation hardness. It could withstand more than 100 kGy absorbed dose, which is at least ten times higher than the doses reported in the literature for plastic scintillators before deterioration. The potential of this detector system in MRT QA was demonstrated in this study."
"The ongoing global health crisis caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) necessitates the continuous development of innovative vaccine strategies, especially in light of emerging viral variants that could undermine the effectiveness of existing vaccines. In this study, we developed a recombinant virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine based on the Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) platform, displaying a stabilized prefusion form of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. This engineered S protein includes two proline substitutions (K986P, V987P) and a mutation at the cleavage site (RRAR to QQAQ), aimed at enhancing both its stability and immunogenicity. Using a prime-boost regimen, we administered NDV-VLP-S-3Q2P intramuscularly at different doses (2, 10, and 20 µg) to BALB/c mice. Robust humoral responses were observed, with high titers of S-protein-specific IgG and neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, reaching titers of 1:2200-1:2560 post-boost. The vaccine also induced balanced Th1/Th2 immune responses, evidenced by significant upregulation of cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-2, and IL-4) and S-protein-specific IgG1 and IgG2a. Furthermore, strong activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the spleen and lungs confirmed the vaccine's ability to promote cellular immunity. These findings demonstrate that NDV-S3Q2P-VLP is a potent immunogen capable of eliciting robust humoral and cellular immune responses, highlighting its potential as a promising candidate for further clinical development in combating COVID-19."
"The present study aimed to investigate the hydrogeochemical patterns and contamination of the radiogeology, especially radon activity, related to geothermal aquifer properties and to perform a risk assessment of annual effective doses covering all hydrothermal spring attractions in Southern Thailand. Radon is an established lung carcinogen; especially longer term exposure to radioactive radon through inhalation could be a cause of lung cancer risk. Altogether 22 hydrothermal spring samples were collected from the six hydrothermal provinces in Southern Thailand in early November of 2023. Geochemical data represented by calcium chloride and sodium chloride type, most of which were influenced by seawater intrusion. In addition, the hydrothermal springs that located along local fault zones were mainly controlled by water‒rock interactions, indicating that hydrothermal spring quality was influenced by weathering. Hydrothermal springs located along the coastlines of the Gulf of Thailand and Andaman Sea were dominated by evaporation. Radon activity concentrations show value levels from 9 Bq/L (PG1) to 7,070 Bq/L (SR3), with an average of 580 Bq/L. Radon levels of hydrothermal spring attractions can be divided into three categories: (a) low radon levels below 100 Bq/L, (b) moderate to high radon levels between 100 and 580 Bq/L, and (c) very high radon levels greater than 580 Bq/L. The total annual effective doses for adults due to ingestion and dominantly inhalation of radon at hydrothermal spring attractions varied from 0.01 to 19.30 mSv/year. These results highlight the usefulness of this method as an essential tool for delineating radon concentrations, which could be used to introduce guidelines for health risk assessment."
"We reviewed the efficacy and safety of intravenous administration of tranexamic acid (TXA) in randomized trials involving patients undergoing intracranial meningioma resection surgery, with special emphasis on the effects of different dosages. A comprehensive search was conducted in the following databases: Cochrane, PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Lilacs, and Web of Science. Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts, reviewed the full texts and collected data. Efficacy outcomes analyzed included intraoperative blood loss, blood transfusion rate, duration of surgery, and length of hospital stay. The safety outcomes evaluated included postoperative complications such as seizures, thromboembolic events, and hematoma. A subgroup analysis was performed based on the dosage and timing of administration. Six randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included, covering 881 patients. Meta-analysis of the data demonstrated that the use of TXA resulted in a significant reduction in intraoperative blood loss (Mean Difference [MD] = -270.26 ml, 95% CI [-422.84, -117.67], p < 0.01, I² = 99%), blood transfusion rate (Relative Risk [RR] = 0.60, 95% CI: [0.46, 0.78], p < 0.01, I² = 3%), duration of surgery (MD = -19.76 min, 95% CI: [-41.74, 2.23], p < 0.01, I² = 75%), and length of hospital stay (MD: -0.48 days, 95% CI: [-0.93, -0.04], p < 0.01, I² = 32%). No significant differences were found in the postoperative complications assessed. In the dosage analysis, the preoperative 20 mg/kg regimen, along with the intraoperative maintenance dose of 1 mg/kg/h, was more effective in reducing intraoperative blood loss in the TXA group, although not statistically significant (323.64 ml vs. 145.54 ml, p = 0.29). The administration of TXA in patients undergoing intracranial meningioma resection surgery showed beneficial results in all efficacy outcomes evaluated, without increasing postoperative complications. However, further studies, especially multicenter ones, are needed to confirm our results."
"Wilms tumors are commonly associated with predisposition syndromes. Many of these syndromes are associated with specific phenotypic features and are discussed in the related article from the AACR Pediatric Cancer Working Group. Guidelines for surveillance in this population were published in 2017, but since then several studies have identified new genes with recurrent pathogenic variants associated with increased risk for Wilms tumor development. In general, variants in these genes are less likely to be associated with other phenotypic features. Recently, members of the AACR Pediatric Cancer Working Group met to update surveillance guidelines for patients with a predisposition to Wilms tumors with a review of recently published evidence and risk estimates. Risk estimates for Wilms tumor for the more recently described genes are discussed here along with suggested surveillance guidelines for these populations. Several other emerging clinical scenarios associated with Wilms tumor predisposition are also discussed, including patients with family histories of Wilms tumor and no identified causative gene, patients with bilateral tumors, and patients with somatic mosaicism for chromosome 11p15.5 alterations. This perspective serves to update pediatric oncologists, geneticists, radiologists, counselors, and other health care professionals on emerging evidence and harmonize updated surveillance recommendations in the North American and Australian context for patients with emerging forms of Wilms tumor predisposition."
The aim of this study is to systematically examine the role of the pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A) serum biomarker in the first trimester screening of preeclampsia (PE).
"Establishing a strategy for sequencing of T cell-redirecting therapies for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) is a pressing clinical need. We longitudinally tracked the clinical and immunologic impact of bispecific T cell-engaging antibodies (BsAb) as bridging therapy (BT) to subsequent B-cell maturation antigen-directed chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapies in 52 patients with RRMM. BsAbs were a potent and safe option for BT, achieving the highest overall response rate (100%) to BT compared with chemotherapy, anti-CD38, or anti-SLAMF7 antibody-based regimens (46%). We observed early CD4+CAR+ and delayed CD8+CAR+ T-cell expansion in patients receiving BsAbs as BT. In vitro cytotoxicity of CAR-T cells was comparable among BT options. Single-cell analyses revealed increased clonality in the CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell compartments in patients with previous exposure to BsAbs at leukapheresis and on day 30 after CAR-T cell infusion. This study demonstrates the feasibility and efficacy of BT with BsAbs for CAR-T cell therapy in RRMM. Significance: CAR-T cell therapy and BsAbs have revolutionized treatment of triple-class refractory multiple myeloma; however, optimal sequencing is unknown. We demonstrate that BT with BsAb before B-cell maturation antigen-directed CAR-T cell therapy is safe and effective, which might have implications for other hematologic malignancies as well.

"Sudden cardiac death (SCD) in early adults aged 25 to 44 years represents an important and unexpected cause of death. We assessed trends in SCD-related mortality in the United States from 1999 to 2020 among early adults to determine differences by sex, ethnoracial groups, urbanization, and census region."
"Human trichinosis is a serious foodborne parasitic zoonosis. Diagnosing human trichinosis is usually difficult due to the nonspecific clinical picture and the limited effectiveness of serological tests in acute infections. While ELISA can detect circulating Trichinella antigens, aiding in early diagnosis, its sensitivity may be low. The application of nanoparticles can improve the sensitivity of ELISA and allow a specific early diagnosis of the disease. This work compares the nano chitosan beads-based ELISA (NCSB-ELISA) and traditional sandwich ELISA for the detection of circulating Trichinella spiralis (T. spiralis) crude extract-antigen (CEA) in serum samples of experimentally infected mice. Fifty-seven mice included in this study were classified into 3 groups: T. spiralis infected group (Group I) (36 mice), which was equally subdivided into six subgroups according to the time of sacrifice (6, 8, 10, 12, 14 and 16) days post-infection (dpi), cross-reactivity group (Group II) (9 mice) and negative control group (Group III) (12 mice). T. spiralis AW-CEA prepared from the adult worms were used to produce anti- T. spiralis IgG-polyclonal antibodies in rabbits; these antibodies were utilized to detect AW-CEA in serum samples by traditional sandwich ELISA and NCSB-ELISA. Using NCSB-ELISA, T. spiralis AW-CEA was detected in sera collected at 8 dpi, with a sensitivity of 50% and a specificity of 100%. Meanwhile, traditional sandwich ELISA could not detect the antigen at the same time interval. Both ELISA were able to detect the antigen in samples collected at 10, 12, 14 and 16 dpi with a sensitivity of 16.67%, 50%, 67.67% and 83.67%, respectively, for traditional sandwich-ELISA and a specificity of 100% at 10, 12 and 14 dpi while at 16 dpi specificity was decreased to 90.91%. In contrast, the sensitivity of NCSB-sandwich ELISA on the same days was 66.67%, 83.34%, 100% and 100%, respectively, with a specificity of 100% at all days. False positive detection of T. spiralis AW-CEA in the serum of mice in GII was recorded on day 16 pi by only traditional sandwich ELISA. This study concluded that NCSB-ELISA is a promising and sensitive technique for the early and specific diagnosis of acute trichinosis in an animal model."

"Carcinocythemia, known as the presence of circulating tumor cells in the peripheral blood, is difficult to detect when the carcinoma cells are minimally present. We describe a case of a 56-year-old patient presenting with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and multiple organ failure. Despite initial suspicion of sepsis, a peripheral blood smear showed the presence of atypical cells, mainly located at the feathered edge, leading to a presumptive diagnosis of carcinocythemia of unknown primary origin. The presence of a high-fluorescent cell population detected by our hematology analyzer (Sysmex XN-9100) and immunohistochemical staining with pancytokeratin AE1/AE3 confirmed the carcinoma cell origin. The patient died 4 days after referral to our hospital. Postmortem examination revealed a pleomorphic lobular breast carcinoma (triple-negative, androgen receptor-negative). Given the clinical acuity of patients with carcinocythemia, early diagnosis is essential to guide management. This case underscores the importance of optimizing current workflows relying on complex flagging algorithms and enhanced digital imaging to aid in the early detection of such rare condition. When patients present with DIC of unknown origin and high fluorescent signals are detected on the hematology analyzer, carcinocythemia should actively be ruled out by extensive microscopic peripheral blood examination."
"Ulcerative colitis (UC), one among other refractory diseases worldwide, has shown an increasing trend of progression to colorectal cancer in recent years. In the treatment of UC, traditional Chinese medicine has demonstrated good efficacy, with a high cure rate, fewer adverse effects, great improvement in the quality of patient survival, and reduction in the tendency of cancerous transformation. It shows promise as a complementary and alternative therapy. This review aims to evaluate and discuss the current research on UC, signaling pathways, and gut microbiota. We also summarized the mechanisms of action of various Chinese medicines (active ingredients or extracts) and herbal formulas, through signaling pathways and gut microbiota, with the expectation that they can provide references and evidence for treating UC and preventing inflammation-associated colorectal cancer by traditional Chinese medicine. We illustrate that multiple signaling pathways, such as TLR4, STAT3, PI3K/Akt, NF-[Formula: see text]B, and Keap1/Nrf2, can be inhibited by Chinese herbal treatments through the combined regulation of signaling pathways and gut microbiota, which can act individually or synergistically to inhibit intestinal inflammatory cell infiltration, attenuate gut oxidative responses, and repair the intestinal barrier."
"Acute appendicitis and acute cholecystitis are two of the most commonly encountered surgical entities. Multiple hypotheses are behind their coexistence, which include pathogen predilection, and mucosal ischemia inducing portal vein bacteremia as the management of uncomplicated acute cholecystitis and acute appendicitis is surgical, for which a single operation for synchronous presentation is effective. Here, we report a case with coexistent acute cholecystitis and acute appendicitis managed at our institution."
"As cell-free nanotherapeutics, extracellular vesicles derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSC-EVs) have shown potential therapeutic action against liver diseases. However, their effects on autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) are not yet well understood."
"Neurodegenerative diseases are often characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction. In Alzheimer's disease, abnormal tau phosphorylation disrupts mitophagy, a quality control process through which damaged organelles are selectively removed from the mitochondrial network. The precise mechanism through which this occurs remains unclear. Previously, we showed that tau which has been mutated at Thr-231 to glutamic acid to mimic an Alzheimer's-relevant phospho-epitope expressed early in disease selectively inhibits oxidative stress-induced mitophagy in Caenorhabditis elegans. Here, we use immortalized mouse hippocampal neuronal cell lines to extend that result into mammalian cells. Specifically, we show that phosphomimetic tau at Ser-396/404 (EC) or Thr-231/Ser-235 (EM) partly inhibits mitophagy induction by paraquat, a potent inducer of mitochondrial oxidative stress. Moreover, a combination of immunologic and biochemical approaches demonstrates that the levels of the mitophagy receptor FKBP8, significantly decrease in response to paraquat in cells expressing EC or EM tau mutants, but not in cells expressing wildtype tau. In contrast, paraquat treatment results in a decrease in the levels of the mitophagy receptors FUNDC1 and BNIP3 in the presence of both wildtype tau and the tau mutants. Interestingly, FKBP8 is normally trafficked to the endoplasmic reticulum during oxidative stress induced mitophagy, and our results support a model where this trafficking is impacted by disease-relevant tau, perhaps through a direct interaction. We provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease and highlight FKBP8 receptor as a potential target for mitigating mitochondrial dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases."
"In COPD patients with severe right-sided emphysema, complete major and incomplete minor fissure, implantation of one-way valves in both the right upper (RUL) and middle lobes (ML) is a possible approach for endoscopic lung volume reduction. The aim of this retrospective analysis was to evaluate the response to therapy and the complication rate at 90 days (90d-FU) after combined RUL-ML valve implantation."
"Gene-edited animals are crucial for addressing fundamental questions in biology and medicine and hold promise for practical applications. In light of the rapid advancement of gene editing technologies over the past decade, a dramatically increased number of gene-edited animals have been generated. Genome editing at off-target sites can, however, introduce genomic variations, potentially leading to unintended functional consequences in these animals. So, there is an urgent need to systematically collect and collate these variations in gene-edited animals to aid data mining and integrative in-depth analyses. However, existing databases are currently insufficient to meet this need. Here, we present the Variation Database of Gene-Edited animals (VDGE, https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/vdge), the first open-access repository to present genomic variations and annotations in gene-edited animals, with a particular focus on larger animals such as monkeys. At present, VDGE houses 151 on-target mutations from 210 samples, and 115,710 variations identified from 107 gene-edited and wild-type animal trios through unified and standardized analysis and concurrently provides comprehensive annotation details for each variation, thus facilitating the assessment of their functional consequences and promoting mechanistic studies and practical applications for gene-edited animals."
"Universal healthcare is a cornerstone of Brazil's public health system. However, delayed diagnosis and treatment of chronic kidney disease (CKD) remain substantial issues. The scarcity of outpatient dialysis facilities contributes to extended hospital stays. This study aimed to examine how the time to dialysis initiation (TID) impacts mortality in patients with renal disease."
"Ceramide (Cer) is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) using sphinganine as the common backbone and is then transported to the Golgi apparatus to synthesize two complex sphingolipids, sphingomyelin (SM) and glucosylceramide (GlcCer). Brefeldin A (BFA) affects the structure of the Golgi apparatus, resulting in the redistribution of the Golgi proteins into the ER. Therefore, BFA has been used to examine the ER-to-Golgi trafficking of lipids, but the detailed lipid changes in cells upon BFA treatment are not fully understood. Here, we examined the metabolism of deuterium-labeled sphinganine in HEK293T cells treated with BFA using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The BFA-pretreated cells were incubated in the presence of deuterium-labeled sphinganine and BFA for 5 min to 8 h, and the levels of dihydroceramide, Cer, dihydrosphingomyelin, SM, GlcCer, and phosphatidylcholine (PC) were investigated. The levels of Cer species in BFA-treated cells were lower than those in untreated cells within 2 h of incubation, but following >4 h of incubation, the levels of C14-20 Cer, encompassing C14-20 acyl chains, were similar in BFA-treated and untreated cells. Furthermore, BFA treatment increased the levels of C14-20 GlcCer but had little effect on those of C22-24 GlcCer. Moreover, after incubation for >4 h, BFA treatment decreased the levels of saturated C30-32 PC but had almost little effect on those of PC containing a monounsaturated C32-34 acyl chain. Our findings showed that BFA affected the metabolism of various lipids depending on the length and saturation of the fatty acid chain."

"Increasing use of co-design concepts and buzzwords create risk of generating 'co-design branded' healthcare research and healthcare system design involving insincere, contrived, coercive engagement with First Nations Peoples. There are concerns that inauthenticity in co-design will further perpetuate and ingrain harms inbuilt to colonial systems.Co-design is a tool that inherently must truly reposition power to First Nations Peoples, engendering both respect and ownership. Co-design is a tool for facilitating cultural responsiveness, and therefore a tool for creating healthcare systems that First Nations People may judge as safe to approach and use. True co-design centres First Nations cultures, perspectives of health, and lived experiences, and uses decolonising methodologies in addressing health determinants of dispossession, assimilation, intergenerational trauma, racism, and genocide.Authentic co-design of health services can reduce racism and improve access through its decolonising methods and approaches which are strategically anti-racist. Non-Indigenous people involved in co-design need to be committed to continuously developing cultural responsiveness. Education and reflection must then lead to actions, developing skill sets, and challenging 'norms' of systemic inequity. Non-Indigenous people working and supporting within co-design need to acknowledge their white or non-Indigenous privileges, need ongoing cultural self-awareness and self-reflection, need to minimise implicit bias and stereotypes, and need to know Australian history and recognise the ongoing impacts thereof.This review provides narrative on colonial load, informed consent, language and knowledge sharing, partnering in co-design, and monitoring and evaluation in co-design so readers can better understand where power imbalance, racism, and historical exclusion undermine co-design, and can easily identify skills and ways of working in co-design to rebut systemic racism. If the process of co-design in healthcare across the First Nations of the land now known as Australia is to meaningfully contribute to change from decades of historical and ongoing systemic racism perpetuating power imbalance and resultant health inequities and inequality, co-designed outcomes cannot be a pre-determined result of tokenistic, managed, or coercive consultation. Outcomes must be a true, correct, and beneficial result of a participatory process of First Nations empowered and led co-design and must be judged as such by First Nations Peoples."
"Pathogenic bacteria can detect a variety of environmental signals, including temperature changes. While sudden and significant temperature variations act as danger signals that trigger a protective heat-shock response, minor temperature fluctuations typically signal to the pathogen that it has moved from one environment to another, such as entering a specific niche within a host during infection. These latter temperature fluctuations are utilized by pathogens to coordinate the expression of crucial virulence factors. Here, we elucidate the critical role of temperature in governing the expression of virulence factors in bacterial pathogens. Moreover, we outline the molecular mechanisms used by pathogens to detect temperature fluctuations, focusing on systems that employ proteins and nucleic acids as sensory devices. We also discuss the potential implications and the extent of the risk that climate change poses to human pathogenic diseases."
"Social interaction with others is essential to life. Although social isolation and loneliness have been implicated as increased risks of cardiometabolic and cardiovascular diseases and all-cause mortality, the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which social connection maintains cardiometabolic and cardiovascular health remain largely unresolved."
"Available codes in the ICD-10 do not accurately reflect soft tissue sarcoma diagnoses, and this can result in an underrepresentation of soft tissue sarcoma in databases. The National VA Database provides a unique opportunity for soft tissue sarcoma investigation because of the availability of all clinical results and pathology reports. In the setting of soft tissue sarcoma, natural language processing (NLP) has the potential to be applied to clinical documents such as pathology reports to identify soft tissue sarcoma independent of ICD codes, allowing sarcoma researchers to build more comprehensive databases capable of answering a myriad of research questions."
"Bovine parasitic otitis poses challenges in diagnosis, treatment and involves various agents, such as bacteria, fungi, mites, and nematodes. This study focused on the nematodes and bacteria isolated from the auditory canals of dairy cattle. A total of twenty samples were collected from dairy cattle in two states of Brazil. The results showed that Metarhabditis freitasi and M. costai nematodes were identified in 75% of samples. Bacterial species from the ear, identified via mass spectrometry, revealed that different strains were present in 65% of the cattle. Mycoplasma spp. were identified in 45% of samples through molecular techniques. Gram-negative bacteria and Mycoplasma spp. were exclusively found in nematode-infected cattle. Furthermore, the bacteria exhibited resistance to multiple antimicrobial classes, and demonstrating multiresistance. Electron microscopy revealed biofilm aggregates on the cuticle of Metarhabditis spp., suggesting a potential role of these nematodes in bacterial migration and interaction with nervous tissue. Thirteen bacterial strains demonstrated biofilm formation ability, indicating their potential pathogenic role. This research highlights the persistent and complex nature of parasitic otitis, emphasizing the significant role of nematode-bacteria associations in its pathogenicity. The presence of resistant strains and biofilm formation underscores the challenges in managing the diagnosis and treatment of bovine parasitic otitis."
"Positive character is an integral component of positive youth development that relates to psychological well-being among adolescents, yet the literature has largely overlooked its within-group variation. This study examined the latent profiles of positive character and explored their variation in psychological well-being across four adolescent groups (i.e., migrant, left-behind, rural local, and urban local adolescents) within each profile."
"The cardiac defense response to aversive auditory stimulation is characterized by two acceleration/deceleration heart rate components. The first component is ascribed to attentional processes that facilitate detection and processing of potential threat, and the second one to protective actions. This study investigated attentional modulation of the cardiac defense response and the role of autonomic cardiac control therein. In 60 healthy subjects, the cardiac defense response was elicited, while electrocardiography, impedance cardiography and continuous blood pressure recordings were accomplished. Pre-ejection period represented sympathetic, heart rate variability parasympathetic, and systolic blood pressure sympathetic and parasympathetic, control. Half of the subjects performed a visual search task following the noise stimulus; the other half was exposed to the stimulus without any subsequent task. Task execution was associated with potentiation of the second heart rate acceleration/deceleration component of the defense response. Moreover, there was a greater systolic blood pressure decline during the second component. While pre-ejection period was unaffected by the task, the heart rate variability response was smaller overall in subjects performing the task. The findings suggest mediation of the first acceleration/deceleration component of the cardiac defense response by parasympathetic cardiac control; sympathetic and parasympathetic mechanisms contribute to the second component. While sympathetic control was unaffected by attentional demands, the potentiation of the cardiac defense response due to demands on external attention may relate to increased parasympathetic withdrawal."
"The world is experiencing a demographic shift toward an increasing proportion of elderly persons. Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurological disorders are far more likely to develop as people age. AD is a gradual, irreversible, and degenerative brain disorder that progressively deteriorates memory and cognitive function, eventually leading to death. Treatment for AD is the most significant unmet clinical need in neurology. There are no effective treatment options to prevent or reverse the degenerative process. The current medical management focuses primarily on temporarily easing symptoms, with little or no overall improvement. Although genetic predisposition and lifestyle factors influence the risk of neurodegenerative disorders, recent research suggests that dietary polyphenols with solid antioxidant capacities play crucial roles in determining brain health and aging. Aspalathus linearis is used to produce Rooibos, a popular South African herbal tea, which may modulate neurodegenerative mechanisms such as oxidative stress, tau protein, amyloid plaques, inflammation, and metals, all of which have been associated with AD. We reviewed the literature to evaluate the potential neuroprotective effects of Rooibos and its major flavonoids and to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms."
"Food insecurity (FI) is a persistent issue in Brazil, with significant disparities existing across the country's macroregions. This study investigated the food acquisition locations and types of foods purchased at different levels of FI, utilizing data from 57,920 households in the 2017-2018 Brazilian Household Budget Survey. Food acquisition locations were grouped into supermarkets, small markets, street fairs/fruit and vegetable stores/public markets, and others. Foods were categorized into 12 groups: rice, beans, vegetables, fruits, red meats, fish, poultry, eggs, milk and dairy products, bread, cookies, and sugary drinks. Supermarkets are the primary source of food in Brazil. However, in the North and Northeast regions, small markets are more frequently used across all levels of FI. Nationally, most food groups are predominantly purchased at supermarkets. Nevertheless, households experiencing moderate or severe FI rely more on small markets for essential items such as rice, beans, and proteins, as well as ultraprocessed foods. These findings highlight the need for public policies that improve food access for vulnerable populations and address regional inequalities. Enhancing access and ensuring food security across different regions is essential to promoting equitable and healthy diets throughout the country."
"Flexor tendon injuries are a commonly encountered hand problem caused by trauma. They can be associated with fractures or neurovascular injury or occur in isolation. Thorough physical examination is an integral aspect of management of these injuries to identify concomitant pathology and to facilitate preoperative planning and timing of surgery to improve outcome. Management of flexor tendon injuries varies based on the zone of injury, associated fractures, neurovascular inquiries, and injury acuity. The goal of management of flexor tendon injuries is a strong repair and smooth-gliding tendon that heals in a timely manner, resulting in a functional digit. Appropriate rehabilitation is essential in managing these injuries to regain satisfactory motion and prevent adhesion formation and stiffness."
"(1) Background: Continuous health promotion systems are increasingly important, enabling decentralized patient care, providing comfort, and reducing congestion in healthcare facilities. These systems allow for treatment beyond clinical settings and support preventive monitoring. Wearable systems have become essential tools for health monitoring, but they focus mainly on physiological data, overlooking motor data evaluation. The World Health Organization reports that 1.71 billion people globally suffer from musculoskeletal conditions, marked by pain and limited mobility. (2) Methods: To gain a deeper understanding of wearables for the motor rehabilitation, monitoring, and prediction of the progression and/or degradation of symptoms directly associated with upper-limb pathologies, this study was conducted. Thus, all articles indexed in the Web of Science database containing the terms ""wearable"", ""upper limb"", and (""rehabilitation"" or ""monitor"" or ""predict"") between 2019 and 2023 were flagged for analysis. (3) Results: Out of 391 papers identified, 148 were included and analyzed, exploring pathologies, technologies, and their interrelationships. Technologies were categorized by typology and primary purpose. (4) Conclusions: The study identified essential sensory units and actuators in wearable systems for upper-limb physiotherapy and analyzed them based on treatment methods and targeted pathologies."
"Inborn errors of selenoprotein expression arise from deleterious variants in genes encoding selenoproteins or selenoprotein biosynthetic factors, some of which are associated with neurodegenerative disorders. This study shows that bi-allelic selenocysteine tRNA-specific eukaryotic elongation factor (EEFSEC) variants cause selenoprotein deficiency, leading to progressive neurodegeneration. EEFSEC deficiency, an autosomal recessive disorder, manifests with global developmental delay, progressive spasticity, ataxia, and seizures. Cerebral MRI primarily demonstrated a cerebellar pathology, including hypoplasia and progressive atrophy. Exome or genome sequencing identified six different bi-allelic EEFSEC variants in nine individuals from eight unrelated families. These variants showed reduced EEFSEC function in vitro, leading to lower levels of selenoproteins in fibroblasts. In line with the clinical phenotype, an eEFSec-RNAi Drosophila model displays progressive impairment of motor function, which is reflected in the synaptic defects in this model organisms. This study identifies EEFSEC deficiency as an inborn error of selenocysteine metabolism. It reveals the pathophysiological mechanisms of neurodegeneration linked to selenoprotein metabolism, suggesting potential targeted therapies."
"Maternal hyperglycemia is linked to adverse neonatal outcomes. However, current evidence was insufficient for mechanistic pathways. We aim to use two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the causal association and mediation pathways."
"The biologic activities of antibody drugs are dictated by structure-function relationships-emerging from the kind, composition, and degree of interactions with a target antigen and with soluble and cellular antibody receptors of the innate immune system. These activities are canonically understood to be both modular: antigen recognition is driven by the heterodimeric antigen-binding fragment, and innate immune recruitment by the homodimeric constant/crystallizable fragment. The model that treats these domains with a high degree of independence has served the field well but is not without limitations. Here, we consider how new insights, particularly from structural studies, complicate the model of neat biophysical separation between these domains and shape our understanding of antibody effector functions. The emerging model endeavors to explain the phenotypic impact of both antibody intrinsic characteristics and extrinsic features-fitting them within a spatiotemporal paradigm that better accounts for observed antibody activities. In this review, we will use insights from recent models of classical complement complexes and T cell immune synapse formation to explore how structural differences in antibody-mediated immune synapses may relate to their functional diversity."
"The prevalence and characteristics of drug-related problems (DRPs) in the cardiovascular surgery unit have not been adequately explored, leaving a gap in our understanding of this critical issue. This study aimed to address this gap by determining the prevalence, characteristics of DRPs and identifying factors associated with their occurrence."
"In the present study, the nematicidal and fungicidal activity of the biosurfactant (BS) produced by the strain Serratia ureilytica UTS was evaluated. The highest mortality of J2 juveniles of the nematode Nacobbus aberrans was 92.3% at a concentration of 30 mg/mL. Among the phytopathogenic fungi, the concentration of 1.0% of the crude extract of the biosurfactant was the one that obtained the highest percentage inhibition against the phytopathogens Fusarium oxysporum 72.2%, Fusarium sp., 80.2% and Alternaria solani 100% at 168 h of incubation. Analysis of the BS by GC-MS revealed the presence of the three amino acids alanine, homocystine and valine in its composition. As well as the presence of fatty acids: stearic acid, lauric acid and palmitic acid. With nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectrophotometry (MS) analysis, the crude extract was found to have the structure of a quaternary ammonium salt derived from stearic fatty acid, which is a component of the biosurfactant. Based on this evidence, it is suggested that the BS produced by S. ureilytica has a lipopeptide-like chemical structure and possesses nematicidal and fungicidal activity, and is therefore proposed for potential use and application as a biopesticide for the benefit of regenerative and sustainable agriculture."
"Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a condition where the pressure of the cerebrospinal fluid in the brain increases without a known cause. It typically affects adults but can also occur in adolescents and children, although it is less common. Numerous elements, including coagulopathy, have been documented in previous cases as potential etiological factors of IIH. Nonetheless, our objective was to present the insufficiency of a coagulation factor as an additional contributing factor to IIH, a notion that has not been previously reported."
"This article examines the co-occurrence of violence against women and violence against animals based on interviews with 15 survivors in Saskatchewan, Canada. The qualitative data reveal complex dynamics of the human-animal bond for victims/survivors. Insufficient social supports exacerbate barriers for leaving relationships with animals when experiencing intimate partner violence; nonetheless, the participants perceived animals as crucial to their well-being. Care of horses and livestock is further complicated by financial issues and difficulty evacuating large animals. Survivors emphasized the need for social programs to assist survivors who care for companion animals and large animals."
"Glioblastoma (GBM) is a malignant brain tumor with diffuse infiltration. Here, we demonstrate how GBM cells usurp guidance receptor Plexin-B2 for confined migration through restricted space. Using live-cell imaging to track GBM cells negotiating microchannels, we reveal endocytic vesicle accumulation at cell front and filamentous actin assembly at cell rear in a polarized manner. These processes are interconnected and require Plexin-B2 signaling. We further show that Plexin-B2 governs membrane tension and other membrane features such as endocytosis, phospholipid composition, and inner leaflet surface charge, thus providing biophysical mechanisms by which Plexin-B2 promotes GBM invasion. Together, our studies unveil how GBM cells regulate membrane tension and mechano-electrical coupling to adapt to physical constraints and achieve polarized confined migration."
Sever's disease is among the most common causes of foot pain in childhood.The etiology of Sever's disease is still under debate.The objective of this prospective study is to investigate the relationship between Sever's disease and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder(ADHD).
"The archaeal ribosome is of the eukaryotic type. TACK and Asgard superphyla, the closest relatives of eukaryotes, have ribosomes containing eukaryotic ribosomal proteins not found in other archaea, eS25, eS26 and eS30. Here, we investigate the case of Saccharolobus solfataricus, a TACK crenarchaeon, using mainly leaderless mRNAs. We characterize the small ribosomal subunit of S. solfataricus bound to SD-leadered or leaderless mRNAs. Cryo-EM structures show eS25, eS26 and eS30 bound to the small subunit. We identify two ribosomal proteins, aS33 and aS34, and an additional domain of eS6. Leaderless mRNAs are bound to the small subunit with contribution of their 5'-triphosphate group. Archaeal eS26 binds to the mRNA exit channel wrapped around the 3' end of rRNA, as in eukaryotes. Its position is not compatible with an SD:antiSD duplex. Our results suggest a positive role of eS26 in leaderless mRNAs translation and possible evolutionary routes from archaeal to eukaryotic translation."
"Given the rising number of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria, there is a need to design synthetic antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) that are highly active, non-hemolytic, and highly soluble. Machine learning tools allow the straightforward in silico identification of non-hemolytic antimicrobial peptides."
"On October 7, 2023, a large-scale attack in southern Israel and the subsequent war resulted in extensive loss of life and injuries, with many individuals experiencing traumatic losses, such as family members or close friends being killed or kidnapped. This study aims to longitudinally examine its effects on mental health, specifically, clinical symptoms of anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We anticipated greater symptom severity among individuals who experienced traumatic loss, were forcibly displaced, or suffered income loss, as well as among women and members of ethnic minorities. This three-wave online survey study assessed mental health symptoms in a sample of 1052 individuals, aged 18-40, residing in conflict zones in Israel from February 2024 (day 1), through March 2024 (day 30), to May 2024 (day 90). Symptoms of anxiety, depression, and PTSD were measured using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and Primary Care PTSD Screen (PC-PTSD). Individuals experiencing traumatic losses, forced displacement, or economic hardships, as well as females, consistently demonstrated higher rates of anxiety, depression, and PTSD symptoms compared to those without such experiences or to males, across all time points (F values ranged from 17.7 to 215.3, p < .001). For ethnic minorities (Arab and other), as compared to Jewish, anxiety and depression symptoms were higher at every time point (F = 8.3-97.1, p = .004 to < .001). This study highlights the urgent need for targeted mental health interventions in conflict zones, particularly for affected individuals. Further research should expand these findings to broader populations."
"This study aimed to investigate the ultrastructural anatomy of the developing ACL tibial enthesis. We hypothesized that enthesis architecture would progressively mature and remodel, eventually resembling that of the adult by the early postnatal stage. Five fresh-frozen human pediatric cadaveric knees aged 1-36 months underwent anatomical dissection to harvest the ACL insertion and underlying tibial chondroepiphysis. The samples were prepared for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to examine the ultrastructural anatomy of the enthesis and underwent histological staining for circular polarized light (CPL) and light microscopy imaging. SEM analysis of the 1- and 8-month-old samples revealed a shallow interdigitation between the dense fibrous (ligamentous) tissue and unmineralized chondrogenic tissues, with a minimal transition zone. By 11-month, a more complex transition zone was present. By age 19- and 36-month-old, a progressively more complex and defined fibrocartilage zone was observed. CPL analysis revealed distinct collagen fiber continuity, alignment, and organization changes over time. By 19 and 36 months, the samples exhibited complex fiber arrangements and a progression toward uniform fiber orientation. Similarly, histological analysis demonstrated progressive remodeling of the enthesis with increasing age. Our results suggest that the ACL enthesis of the developing knee begins to mimic that of an adult as early as 19 months of age, as a more complex transition between ligamentous and chondro-epiphyseal tissue can be appreciated. We hypothesize that the observed changes are likely due to mechanical loading of the enthesis with the onset of weightbearing. Future investigations of ACL reconstruction and repair will benefit from improved understanding of the chondro-epiphyseal/ACL regions."
"In this article, the submersion dose due to a radioactive cloud of pollutants was evaluated at short downwind distances from an emission stack. The atmospheric transport of contaminants was modelled using the Gaussian plume model (GPM). The algorithm for dose computation and its hypotheses were analysed. Two relevant issues were discussed: the semi-infinite cloud approximation used for pre-calculated dose conversion factors and the lack of a radiation transport model for dose computation outside the radioactive cloud. The GPM-based software HotSpot and GENII V2.10 and a FLUKA Monte Carlo GPM implementation were compared in a scenario characterized by a low release height and two different simplified atmospheric conditions. Compared to FLUKA, HotSpot and GENII V2.10 results showed a significant dose overestimation inside the plume. Moreover, in extremely stable meteorological conditions, only the Monte Carlo code could detect the ground-level dose contribution from an overhead plume."
"Active surveillance (AS) has become an increasingly important option for managing low-risk and select intermediate-risk prostate cancer. Although imaging, particularly multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI), has emerged in the prebiopsy pathway for the diagnosis of prostate cancer, the role of mpMRI in patient selection for AS and the necessity of prostate biopsies during AS remain poorly defined. Despite well-founded biopsy schedules, there has been substantial investigation into whether imaging may supplant the need for prostate biopsies during AS. This review aimed to summarize the contemporary role of imaging in the diagnosis and surveillance of prostate cancer."
The purpose of this study was to evaluate implant survivorship and clinical outcomes following radial head arthroplasty for fracture at long-term follow-ups.
"The number of female doctors is increasing worldwide, but the percentage of female general surgeons and gastrointestinal surgeons remains low, at only 6% in Japan. Furthermore, in rural areas, the number of doctors is small and training opportunities are limited, and training in surgical techniques is reportedly inadequate compared with urban areas. This study examined the current status and surgical outcomes of colorectal cancer surgery by surgeon sex using a multicenter database in a Japanese rural area."
"Phenolic compounds exhibit potent antioxidant properties and defense mechanisms in plants, serving as quality biomarkers. This study investigates the effect of chitosan formulations, incorporated with 1 % and 2 % ascorbic acid and quercetin, for extending cassava shelf life and improving nutritional quality. The PhotoMetrix® smartphone App was employed to analyze the impact of these treatment-formulations on their total phenolic contents (TPC) using RGB (Red-Green-Blue) color scale, validated by statistical analysis. Treated cassava samples exhibited higher levels of TPC (up to 70 %) and antioxidant activity (up to 35.39 %). Treated cassava samples with high TPC demonstrated better antioxidant capacities, visual appearances and starch contents, alongside reduced dry matter and H₂O₂ levels. These outcomes highlight the effectiveness of chitosan-antioxidant formulations in boosting TPC, mitigating oxidative stress, and delaying cassava deterioration. The study also demonstrates PhotoMetrix® as a cost-effective, efficient alternative for phenolic assessment, and a tool for shelf-life study towards food security."
"SIRT1, a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD +)-dependent class III histone deacetylase, exhibits a high level of expression within renal tissues. It has garnered considerable recognition for its pivotal role in modulating signaling pathways intricately linked with the aging process; however, it extends beyond this in the organism. The literature reports that SIRT1 regulates biological processes such as glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, oxidative stress, inflammation, autophagy, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and apoptosis. Therefore, our study reviews the primary mechanisms by which SIRT1 induces kidney disease and the regulation of related signaling pathways in different models of renal disease. We also discuss commonly studied SIRT1-targeted interventional drugs reported in the literature, including inhibitors (e.g., Ex-527) and activators (e.g., resveratrol). This study aims to provide theoretical foundations and clinical insights for the development and screening of clinical drugs targeting SIRT1, aiming at enhanced scientific approaches for the prevention and treatment of kidney diseases."

"Prostate cancer frequently metastasizes to bones; however, the detection of metastases can be challenging in rare locations. We present the case of a 76-year-old man with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer with lymph nodal and skeletal metastases who underwent 177Lu-prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) therapy. Initial 18F-PSMA PET/CT scan acquired until the midthigh failed to identify metastases in the foot, but posttherapy 177Lu-PSMA scan revealed the presence of metastases in the navicular and cuboid bones of the right foot, which is a very rare finding. This case highlights the limitations of standard PSMA PET/CT acquisition protocol and incremental value of whole-body posttherapy scan."
"The only cure of HIV has been achieved in a small number of people who received a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) comprising allogeneic cells carrying a rare, naturally occurring, homozygous deletion in the CCR5 gene. The rarity of the mutation and the significant morbidity and mortality of such allogeneic transplants precludes widespread adoption of this HIV cure. Here, we show the application of CRISPR/Cas9 to achieve >90% CCR5 editing in human, mobilized hematopoietic stem progenitor cells (HSPC), resulting in a transplant that undergoes normal hematopoiesis, produces CCR5 null T cells, and renders xenograft mice refractory to HIV infection. Titration studies transplanting decreasing frequencies of CCR5 edited HSPCs demonstrate that <90% CCR5 editing confers decreasing protective benefit that becomes negligible between 54% and 26%. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of using CRISPR/Cas9/RNP to produce an HSPC transplant with high frequency CCR5 editing that is refractory to HIV replication. These results raise the potential of using CRISPR/Cas9 to produce a curative autologous HSCT and bring us closer to the development of a cure for HIV infection."
"Mental health problems are the most significant cause of disability and have high annual economic costs; hence, they are a priority for the government, service providers and policymakers. Consisting of largely coastal and rural communities, the populations of Norfolk and Suffolk, UK, have elevated burdens of mental health problems, areas with high levels of deprivation and an increasing migrant population. However, these communities are underserved by research and areas with the greatest mental health needs are not represented or engaged in research. This National Institute of Health and Care Research-funded project aims to bring together key stakeholders to conduct extensive scoping work to identify mental health needs and priorities as a basis for conducting larger research to address the identified priorities over the next 5 years."
"Resveratrol and extra virgin olive oil are both recognized for their potential protective effects against age-related diseases. This overview highlights their mechanisms of action, health benefits, and the scientific evidence supporting their roles in promoting longevity and cognitive health. A literature search was conducted. Important findings related to the health benefits, mechanisms of action, and clinical implications of resveratrol and EVOO were summarized. Both resveratrol and EVOO have complementary mechanisms that may enhance their anti-aging effects. Resveratrol and EVOO are promising age-related disease-protective agents. Their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective properties contribute to improved health outcomes and longevity. Incorporating these compounds into a balanced diet may offer significant benefits for aging populations, supporting cognitive health and reducing the risk of chronic diseases. Continued research is essential to fully understand their mechanisms and optimize their use in clinical settings. Future research should focus on investigating the synergistic effects of resveratrol and EVOO when consumed together, as they may enhance each other's bioavailability and efficacy in promoting health; conducting extensive clinical trials to confirm the long-term benefits of these compounds in various populations, particularly in aging individuals; further exploring the molecular pathways through which resveratrol and EVOO exert their effects, including their interactions with gut microbiota and metabolic pathways."
"People who stutter experience societal misconceptions and negative stereotypes due to cultural prejudices. The present study aimed to compare attitudes toward stuttering of Indian teachers, students, and members of the public and to further compare their attitudes to comparable samples regionally and internationally."
"Preoperative identification of the site of rectal cancer surgery is crucial for ensuring accurate tumor localization and resection. Commonly employed methods include contrast-enhanced enterography and endoscopic marking techniques, such as clipping and India ink tattooing. However, India ink tattooing poses challenges, including obstruction of the surgical field, ink leakage into the abdominal cavity, and potential complications such as peritonitis and adhesive bowel obstruction. Similarly, clipping requires palpation, making minimally invasive procedures, such as laparoscopic or robotic-assisted surgery, impractical."
"The American Cancer Society has recommended high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) testing as the primary screening method for cervical cancer since 2020. Up to this point, the transition from Pap test cytology-based screening or co-testing with cytology and HPV testing has been slow and limited. However, more health systems in the United States are in the process of implementing this change. The transition to HPV-based screening requires a triage strategy for positive results. Genotyping to specifically detect HPV types 16 and 18 in conjunction with reflex cytology for the remaining high-risk HPV genotypes has been the recommended method. Testing options including Dual Stain for p16/Ki-67 and extended HPV genotyping are currently being incorporated into treatment algorithms as alternatives. Methylation testing is another promising method extensively investigated around the world. This review, performed by members of the Clinical Practice Committee of the American Society of Cytopathology, examines the rationale behind the switch away from reliance on Pap test cytology in the cervical cancer screening algorithm and the opportunities and problems associated with the most promising alternative approaches. Published studies that give insight into the performance characteristics of these newer tests are reviewed. At the present time, Pap test cytology remains a viable triage option for positive HPV screening results, but alternative tests have significant appeal and should be considered in tandem with the decision to offer primary HPV screening."

"Remitting seronegative symmetrical synovitis with pitting edema (RS3PE) syndrome is a rare seronegative synovial inflammatory disease in which fever is a rare symptom.There are few case reports of RS3PE syndrome with fever as the first clinical manifestation in China.In this paper,we report a case of RS3PE syndrome with fever as the first symptom and diagnosed by systematic fever investigation."
"The COVID-19 pandemic is highly contagious, with symptoms such as myalgia, cough, fever, and weakness, posing a greater risk to older adults and individuals with chronic conditions. Effective management requires meaningful community involvement to reduce health inequalities and ensure people-centered health care. Engaging local voices, including leaders, health care professionals, and vulnerable populations, enhances decision-making, transparent communication, and resource mobilization. A whole-community approach, involving collaboration across various sectors, strengthens prevention, testing, and recovery efforts. By prioritizing vulnerable groups and adapting interventions to local contexts, community engagement plays a vital role in addressing the pandemic's challenges and building a resilient health care system. This strategy not only aids in managing the current crisis but also prepares public health systems for future emergencies, emphasizing equity and comprehensive public health responses."
"Rice products are ubiquitous in the diets of American children and are often utilized to thicken feeds as part of treatments for gastroesophageal reflux disease in infants. However, a 2015 Food and Drug Administration investigation demonstrated that they contain unsafe levels of inorganic arsenic. Inorganic arsenic exposure has been linked to serious health issues including skin, lung, and bladder cancer. Smaller children are put at higher risk due to the increased arsenic-to-weight ratio compared to adults, threatening their development in multiple ways. Other thickeners offer cost-effective, safer alternatives. With this communication, we aim to raise awareness of this issue within the otolaryngology practice thereby bringing us abreast of the best practices of the pediatric and gastrointestinal medical societies who have recommended against the use of rice for thickening feeds, instead advocating for alternate natural thickening agents like wheat or oatmeal."
"Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is one of the most prevalent opportunistic infections after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Prophylaxis and preemptive therapy have demonstrated promise in reducing the incidence of CMV infection and CMV disease, but the management of refractory/resistant (R/R) CMV infections after HSCT remains a challenge that significantly affects the prognosis of patients undergoing HSCT. Intolerance and resistance to antivirals are the primary reasons for developing refractory CMV infections. CMV DNA quantification PCR combined with CMV-specific cell-mediated immunity monitoring may help to optimize diagnosis and enable personalized management of R/R CMV infection. Novel antiviral drugs and other immunotherapies, including intravenous immunoglobulin and adoptive CMV T cell therapy, constitute an appealing option."
"Capecitabine is a widely used drug for cancer treatment. Capecitabine is a derivative of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). A known complication of 5-FU is hyperammonaemia which can cause encephalopathy. To our knowledge, there are very few documented cases demonstrating hyperammonaemia associated with capecitabine. There are also cases suggesting capecitabine improves hyperammonaemia from 5-FU. We present the case of an older man taking capecitabine, who presented to our hospital with severe encephalopathy with elevated ammonia. Workup led to the diagnosis of a urea cycle disorder. This case highlights the importance of determining the aetiology of a patient's presentation, especially if they have presented repeatedly with the same issue. It is important to think of common causes first; however, we must broaden the differential diagnoses when the simple answer does not explain the clinical picture."
"People Living with HIV (PLHIV) experience accelerated aging, yet strategies for healthy aging in this group are not well studied. Although survival rates have improved, non-infectious comorbidities, like cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and cancers, are increasing and tend to appear earlier and more severely in PLHIV frailty, defined as increased vulnerability to stressors, which is a growing concern among aging PLHIV, driven by factors, like chronic inflammation, antiretroviral therapy toxicity, and traditional risk factors. Key areas of focus include inactivity, sarcopenia, vitamin D deficiency, and polypharmacy. Addressing these factors is crucial to preventing functional decline and improving the quality of life of PLHIV, though more research is necessary. The aim of this article was to identify and conduct a narrative review of these factors in a pragmatic way in order to facilitate the clinicians."

"Permafrost harbours a diversity of cryophilic microorganisms that can be metabolically active at sub-zero temperatures and likely play a role in global carbon cycling. This forum article explores possible impacts of permafrost warming on cold-adapted microbiota, highlights underexplored areas of research, and suggests future short and long-term research foci."
"Among white rheumatoid arthritis (RA) cohorts, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction is the most prevalent type of heart failure (HF). We aimed to assess the type of HF affecting Black RA patients. A total of 64 patients with RA-HF were compared with age-, sex-, and race-matched RA patients without HF. Left ventricular ejection fraction, wall motion abnormalities, left ventricle (LV) mass, and wall thickness were reviewed. About 87.3% were Black and 84.4% were women, with a mean age of 69.6 ± 1.38 (± SEM) and body mass index (kg/m 2 ) of 29.6 ± 1.07. RA-HF patients had higher rates of hypertension (HTN), chronic kidney disease, and atrial fibrillation. However, 66.7% had ≥3 cardiovascular risk factors compared with RA patients without HF. 2D echocardiograms of RA-HF revealed that 62.3% had left ventricular ejection fraction ≥50%, 37% had diastolic dysfunction, and 43.1% had wall motion abnormalities. LV mass and relative wall thickness measurements indicated LV eccentric remodeling. The odds ratio for HF was 4.7 (CI, 1.5-14.53), P < 0.01, among the RA-HTN group and 3.5 (CI, 1.091-11.7) P < 0.01 among smokers. In our predominantly Black RA-HF patients, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction was the most common type of HF. HTN was associated with the highest OR for HF. Eccentric hypertrophic remodeling, a known poor prognostic indicator for cardiovascular events, was found. Further studies are required to confirm our findings."
"Most people who seek mental health treatment cannot access it. Certain groups (e.g., Medicaid enrollees and the uninsured) face particularly severe treatment access barriers along the care continuum. We interviewed 31 clinicians across two studies about their perspectives working in New York City's public mental health system. Because every clinician across both studies reported gaps in the system, we deployed an emergent, ""serendipitous finding"" approach and qualitatively analyzed the interviews together. Clinicians described three public mental health system gaps. First, many treatment-seekers must wait long periods of time to receive care and some never receive it at all. Second, patients with more serious challenges cannot access longer-term, higher-intensity, or specialized treatment. Third, some patients receiving high-intensity services may benefit from lower-intensity mental health support that is better integrated with medical and social service support. Coordinated and sustained financial investments at every step of the mental healthcare continuum are needed."
"Terminal nucleotidyltransferase 5A (TENT5A), recently predicted as a non-canonical poly(A) polymerase, is critically involved in several human disorders including retinitis pigmentosa, cancer and obesity. However, the exact biological role of TENT5A in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been elucidated."
"Earth's old animals are in decline. Despite this, emerging research is revealing the vital contributions of older individuals to cultural transmission, population dynamics, and ecosystem processes and services. Often the largest and most experienced, old individuals are most valued by humans and make important contributions to reproduction, information acquisition and cultural transmission, trophic dynamics, and resistance and resilience to natural and anthropogenic disturbance. These observations contrast with the senescence-focused paradigm of old age that has dominated the literature for more than a century yet are consistent with findings from behavioral ecology and life history theory. In this work, we review why the global loss of old individuals can be particularly detrimental to long-lived animals with indeterminate growth; those with increasing reproductive output with age; and those dependent on migration, sociality, and cultural transmission for survival. Longevity conservation is needed to protect the important ecological roles and ecosystem services provided by old animals."
"The course of evolution is strongly shaped by interaction between mutations. Such epistasis can yield rugged sequence-function maps and constrain the availability of adaptive paths. While theoretical intuition is often built on global statistics of large, homogeneous model landscapes, mutagenesis measurements necessarily probe a limited neighborhood of a reference genotype. It is unclear to what extent local topography of a real epistatic landscape represents its global shape. Here, we demonstrate that epistatic landscapes can be heterogeneously rugged and this heterogeneity may render biomolecules more evolvable. By characterizing a multipeaked fitness landscape of a SARS-CoV-2 antibody mutant library, we show that heterogeneous ruggedness arises from sparse epistatic hotspots, whose mutation impacts the fitness effect of numerous sequence sites. Surprisingly, mutating an epistatic hotspot may enhance, rather than reduce, the accessibility of the fittest genotype, while increasing the overall ruggedness. Further, migratory constraints in real space alleviate mutational constraints in sequence space, which not only diversify direct paths taken but may also turn a road-blocking fitness peak into a stepping stone leading toward the global optimum. Our results suggest that a hierarchy of epistatic hotspots may organize the fitness landscape in such a way that path-orienting ruggedness confers global smoothness."

This study aimed to explore a combined transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) and radiomics model for predicting tumor regression grade (TRG) after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NCRT) in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC).
"The transition of chromatin configuration in mammalian oocytes from a non-surrounded nucleolus (NSN) to a surrounded nucleolus (SN) is critical for acquiring the developmental competence. However, the genomic and epigenomic features underlying this process remain poorly understood. In the present study, we first establish the chromatin accessibility landscape of mouse oocytes from NSN to SN stage. Through the integrative analysis of multi-omics, we find that the establishment of DNA methylation in oocytes is independent of the dynamics of chromatin accessibility. In contrast, histone H3K4me3 status is closely associated with the dynamics of accessible regions during configuration transition. Furthermore, by focusing on the actively transcribed genes in NSN and SN oocytes, we discover that chromatin accessibility coupled with histone methylation (H3K4me3 and H3K27me3) participates in the transcriptional control during phase transition. In sum, our data provide a comprehensive resource for probing configuration transition in oocytes, and offer insights into the mechanisms determining chromatin dynamics and oocyte quality."
"Despite the importance of medication reconciliation for the continuity of care, there is currently no information on the practices, knowledge, and attitudes of Portuguese family doctors on this subject. This study aimed to characterize the formal medication reconciliation procedures in the Lisbon and Tagus Valley Health Region, as well as the perception of family doctors in this region about what they know, how they think and how they practice medication reconciliation."
"Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) can activate pyroptosis through CHOP and TXNIP; however, the correlation between this process and the formation of kidney stones has not been reported. The purpose is to investigate the effects of calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM) and calcium oxalate dihydrate (COD) on ERS and pyroptosis in HK-2 cells and to explore the formation mechanism of calcium oxalate stones. HK-2 cells were injured by 3 μm COM and COD. COM and COD significantly upregulated the expression levels of GRP78, CHOP, TXNIP, and pyroptosis-related proteins (NLRP3, caspase-1, GSDMD-N, and IL-1β). Fluorescence colocalization revealed that COM induced pyroptosis by inducing the interaction between TXNIP and NLRP3. Both COM and COD crystals can induce ERS and pyroptosis in HK-2 cells. COM induces the interaction with NLRP3 by the upregulation of CHOP and TXNIP and then promotes pyroptosis, while COD only promotes pyroptosis by the upregulation of CHOP. The cytotoxicity and the ability of COM to promote crystal adhesion and aggregation are higher than COD, suggesting that COM is more dangerous for calcium oxalate kidney stone formation."
"Infectious bursal disease (IBD) continues to threaten poultry production globally, with highly virulent strains circulating in many parts of Africa. In this study, molecular characterization was performed on a circulating infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) strain from an outbreak in a layer flock in Ghana. Layer chicks presented for necropsy had markedly enlarged and hemorrhagic bursae of Fabricius, with necrotic foci and catarrhal exudate on the serosal surface. Histopathology of the bursa of Fabricius revealed scattered to effacing hemorrhages on the plicae, extensive necrosis with expansion of the stroma between the follicles, and depletion of lymphocytes within the interfollicular epithelium. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and subsequent sequencing of the VP2 gene showed the presence of IBDV in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues. A phylogenetic analysis compared 62 other IBDV sequences from different parts of the world and placed the Ghanaian IBDV in genogroup 3 (vvIBDV), closely related to IBDV from Nigeria. In comparison to reference vvIBDV, there were amino acid substitutions at positions 252, 254, and 300. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report in which an IBDV from a disease outbreak in Ghana has been sequenced and compared with other IBDVs in a phylogenetic analysis."
"Age-related hearing loss is the third most common health condition affecting elderly individuals. The relationship between lycopene in blood and sensorineural hearing loss in elderly adults has rarely been reported. This study aimed to elucidate the connection between serum lycopene levels and sensorineural hearing loss among elderly individuals. This cross-sectional study included 693 participants aged 70-80 years from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2017 to 2018. The outcomes included sensorineural low-frequency hearing loss [pure-tone average (PTA) at 0.5, 1, and 2 kHz ≥ 20 dB], speech-frequency hearing loss (PTA at 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz ≥ 20 dB), and high-frequency hearing loss (PTA at 4, 6, and 8 kHz ≥ 20 dB). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine the relationship between lycopene in blood and the risk of hearing loss. There were 418 (60.3%), 522 (75.3%), and 667 (96.2%) participants who experienced hearing loss at low, speech, and high frequencies, respectively. Serum total lycopene (OR = 0.575, 95% CI 0.337-0.984) and serum cis-lycopene (OR = 0.334, 95% CI 0.112-0.994) were associated with a lower risk of low-frequency hearing loss after adjusting for covariates. Among male participants, the serum total, cis-, and trans-lycopene levels were inversely related to low- and speech-frequency hearing loss. However, no relationship was observed among the female participants. In conclusion, our findings indicate that increased serum lycopene levels are associated with a decreased prevalence of sensorineural low-frequency hearing loss in older adults, especially in men."
"The study of hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication in cell culture is mainly based on cloned viral isolates requiring adaptation for efficient replication in Huh7 hepatoma cells. The analysis of wild-type (WT) isolates was enabled by the expression of SEC14L2 and by inhibitors targeting deleterious host factors. Here, we aimed to optimize cell culture models to allow infection with HCV from patient sera. We used Huh7-Lunet cells ectopically expressing SEC14L2, CD81, and a GFP reporter with nuclear translocation upon cleavage by the HCV protease to study HCV replication, combined with a drug-based regimen for stimulation of non-modified wild-type isolates. RT-qPCR-based quantification of HCV infections using patient sera suffered from a high background in the daclatasvir-treated controls. We therefore established an automated image analysis pipeline based on imaging of whole wells and iterative training of a machine learning tool, using nuclear GFP localization as a readout for HCV infection. Upon visual validation of hits assigned by the automated image analysis, the method revealed no background in daclatasvir-treated samples. Thereby, infection events were found for 15 of 34 high titer HCV genotype (gt) 1b sera, revealing a significant correlation between serum titer and successful infection. We further show that transfection of viral RNA extracted from sera can be used in this model as well, albeit with so far limited efficiency. Overall, we generated a robust serum infection assay for gt1b isolates using semi-automated image analysis, which was superior to conventional RT-qPCR-based quantification of viral genomes."
"Intimate partner violence (IPV) has been targeted as a significant concern worldwide, but evidence for the efficacy of perpetrators' interventions is not undisputable. This article briefly summarizes the evidence about perpetrators' intervention efficacy, factors associated with recidivism, and evidence-based recommendations, before outlining the assumptions of a new community-delivered intervention aiming to rehabilitate IPV perpetrators: the CONTIGO Program. This program uses an innovative framework, focused on early maladaptive schemas, and combining cognitive, interpersonal, and motivational interview principles. The features of this intervention are discussed, and exploratory results regarding drop-out rates (8%) and recidivism (15.4%) in a sample of 162 court-mandated males are exposed. The detailed presentation of the CONTIGO Program and its intervention model represents a novel contribution that is sorely lacking in the IPV literature and could foster further research and debate about what can be done to effectively intervene with IPV perpetrators."
Few studies have examined the impact of late-life depression trajectories on specific domains of cognitive function. This study aims to delineate how different depressive symptom trajectories specifically affect cognitive function in older adults.
To investigate hip dysplasia as a risk factor for clinically relevant and incident radiographic hip OA.
"The study of heat tolerance in Drosophila melanogaster has been of particular interest to researchers for decades, with a common approach to assessing heat tolerance being to monitor the time to knockdown (TKD) after exposure to an elevated temperature. Classically, flies are housed in individual vials and placed inside a heated water bath. TKD is then monitored manually by researchers. While very well-established, there remain problems of subjectivity and consistent application of a tangible definition of cessation of all movement, including muscular spasms, when implementing these manual assays. We have developed a high-throughput method for automating heat tolerance assays using the TriKinetics Drosophila Activity Monitors (DAM2). To accompany the DAM2 system, we have written a program and created an easy-use executable to automatically read the last time of movement from the activity data generated. This script then writes to a .csv file the time to heat paralysis (TKD) for each fly. Our data show that this automated DAM2 method is consistent and reliable. Meanwhile, activity profiles created from the activity count data are of interest. These activity profiles can be compiled and have the potential to expand heat tolerance assays to include the relatively unstudied behavioral components of heat tolerance. This protocol will describe in detail how to use the DAM2 system and the HoTDAM! software to estimate heat tolerance in D. melanogaster."
"Children with speech sound difficulties often require educational psychology services, yet systematic reviews examining the association between these difficulties and language or reading problems are lacking. This meta-analysis examines whether these children are at higher risk of language and reading difficulties compared to their peers."
"Bombyx mori silk fibroin fibers constitute a class of protein building blocks capable of functionalization and reprocessing into various material formats. The properties of these fibers are typically affected by the intense thermal treatments needed to remove the sericin gum coating layer. Additionally, their mechanical characteristics are often misinterpreted by assuming the asymmetrical cross-sectional area (CSA) as a perfect circle. The thermal treatments impact not only the mechanics of the degummed fibroin fibers, but also the structural configuration of the resolubilized protein, thereby limiting the performance of the resulting silk-based materials. To mitigate these limitations, we explored varying alkali conditions at low temperatures for surface treatment, effectively removing the sericin gum layer while preserving the molecular structure of the fibroin protein, thus, maintaining the hierarchical integrity of the exposed fibroin microfiber core. The precise determination of the initial CSA of the asymmetrical silk fibers led to a comprehensive analysis of their mechanical properties. Our findings indicate that the alkali surface treatment raised the Young's modulus and tensile strength, by increasing the extent of the fibers' crystallinity, by approximately 40 % and 50 %, respectively, without compromising their strain. Furthermore, we have shown that this treatment facilitated further production of high-purity soluble silk protein with rheological and self-assembly characteristics comparable to those of native silk feedstock, initially stored in the animal's silk gland. The developed approaches benefits both the development of silk-based materials with tailored properties and the proper mechanical characterization of asymmetrical fibrous biological materials made of natural building blocks."
"Extracting behavioral information from animal sounds has long been a focus of research in bioacoustics, as sound-derived data are crucial for understanding animal behavior and environmental interactions. Traditional methods, which involve manual review of extensive recordings, pose significant challenges. This study proposes an automated system for detecting and classifying animal vocalizations, enhancing efficiency in behavior analysis. The system uses a preprocessing step to segment relevant sound regions from audio recordings, followed by feature extraction using Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), and linear-frequency cepstral coefficients (LFCCs). These features are input into convolutional neural network (CNN) classifiers to evaluate performance. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of different CNN models and feature extraction methods, with AlexNet, DenseNet, EfficientNet, ResNet50, and ResNet152 being evaluated. The system achieves high accuracy in classifying vocal behaviors, such as barking and howling in dogs, providing a robust tool for behavioral analysis. The study highlights the importance of automated systems in bioacoustics research and suggests future improvements using deep learning-based methods for enhanced classification performance."
"Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FHCC) is a rare variant of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), characterised by a poorer prognosis in later stages compared with conventional HCC due to a high rate of local recurrence, lymph node metastasis and peritoneal metastasis. Conventional chemotherapy is generally ineffective, making surgery the only potentially curative treatment. Currently, surgery is also indicated in cases of recurrence, always aiming for an R0 resection.We present the case of a young patient with peritoneal and retroperitoneal carcinomatosis following multiple resections, exhibiting a peculiar 'sarcomatoid' pattern of recurrence that is primarily local and not widespread within the abdomen. Immunotherapy was ineffective, and after the third recurrence, a cytoreductive surgery combined with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy was performed.To date, there are no studies on the effectiveness of intraperitoneal chemotherapy in FHCC, though promising results have been observed for conventional HCC. As reported in two other articles in the literature, we attempted to apply this approach to FHCC."
"Emerging research has examined electronic and mobile health (e/mHealth) technologies for weight loss and manage of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), but few studies have focused specifically on ways to target social support behaviors that have proven to be effective. While gamifying an mHealth behavioral weight loss intervention holds promise to promote and sustain social support, there has been very little research in this area. The mobile Lifestyle Intervention for Food and Exercise study (mLife) was designed to test if receiving points for social support is an effective way to promote sustained weight loss."
"Particle therapy (PT) as an initial hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment has been reported to be effective; however, its efficacy for the treatment of recurrent HCC remains unclear."
"3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing, holds immense potential for rapid prototyping and customized production of functional health-related devices. With advancements in polymer chemistry and biomedical engineering, polymeric biomaterials have become integral to 3D-printed biomedical applications. However, there still exists a bottleneck in the compatibility of polymeric biomaterials with different 3D printing methods, as well as intrinsic challenges such as limited printing resolution and rates. Therefore, this review aims to introduce the current state-of-the-art in 3D-printed functional polymeric health-related devices. It begins with an overview of the landscape of 3D printing techniques, followed by an examination of commonly used polymeric biomaterials.

"Despite increasing numbers of working-age cancer survivors, evidence on their future work-related circumstances is limited. This study examined their future sick leave, disability pension, and unemployment benefits compared to matched cancer-free individuals."
"This work represents a significant contribution to understanding the importance of appropriately rounding numbers with minimal error. That is, to reduce inexact rounding and data truncation error and simultaneously eliminate unintentional misleading findings in epidemiological studies. The rounding of numbers represents a compromise solution that attempts to find a balance between the loss of information from reporting too few significant digits versus retaining more digits than necessary. Substituting a rounded number for its original value may be acceptable and practical in many applied situations if an adequate degree of accuracy is retained. On the other hand, numeric error may result from improper rounding or data truncation which, in effect, compromises the credibility of study findings and may lead to a false sense of discovery. Performing complex computations on such values, especially when sequential or composite operations are involved, can lead to error propagation and inaccurate results. Having an overall awareness of the nature and impact of rounding error, including preventive actions, can contribute greatly to the integrity of research, yielding more reliable and accurate conclusions. Heuristic examples are provided to illustrate the consequences of rounding and data truncation error in epidemiology studies, specifically those pertaining to relative effect estimation."
"Hypercholesterolemia and other lipid disorders are major causes of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Statins have been the mainstay of lipid-lowering therapy for many years, but they may not be adequate to achieve the target low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels and there are other residual lipid risk factors."
"The aim of this study was to evaluate the quality of prenatal care among pregnant women in Mardin Artuklu. Study data were collected in August and September 2022. A total of 335 pregnant women participated in this descriptive research. The socio-demographic information form and Prenatal Care Quality Scale were used as data collection tools. The mean total score of the Prenatal Care Quality Questionnaire was 168.66-30.69. Results showed that prenatal visits more than 4 times, giving care from health centers, mothers educational level more than 12 years old, having health insurance are predisposing factors of quality of prenatal care (p<0.05). Although quality prenatal care is the right of every woman, there are still women who do not receive this care sufficiently and who are not aware of the care they receive. The role of midwives is important in raising awareness in women about the quality of prenatal care."
"Cognitive load stimulates neural activity, essential for understanding the brain's response to stress-inducing stimuli or mental strain. This study examines the feasibility of evaluating cognitive load by extracting, selection, and classifying features from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. We employed robust local mean decomposition (R-LMD) to decompose EEG data from each channel, recorded over a four-second period, into five modes. The binary arithmetic optimization (BAO) algorithm employed to reduce the feature space and extract multi-domain features from modes, thereby optimizing classification performance. Using six optimized machine learning (ML) classifiers, we conducted an exhaustive study that encompassed both lead-wise and overall feature classification. We improved our method by combining R-LMD-based multi-domain features with BAO and optimized ensemble learning (OEL) classifiers. It was 97.4% accuracy (AC) at finding cognitive load in the MAT (mental arithmetic task) dataset and 96.1% AC at finding it in the STEW (simultaneous workload) dataset. In the same vein, this work introduces lead-wise cognitive load detection, which offers both temporal and spatial information regarding brain activity during cognitive tasks. We analyzed the 19 and 14 leads for the MAT and STEW, respectively. The F3 lead was notably noteworthy in its ability to analyze a variety of cognitive tasks, obtaining the maximum classification AC of 94.5% and 94%, respectively. Our approach (R-LMD+BAO+OEL) outperformed existing state-of-the-art techniques in cognitive load detection."
Recent advancements in therapeutics for BRCA-associated breast cancer have changed indications for germline genetic testing. This study investigated whether Medicaid plans cover National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)-concordant and/or American Society for Clinical Oncology/Society for Surgical Oncology (ASCO/SSO)-concordant BRCA germline testing for patients with breast cancer.

"This part reviews the management of chronic cough and proposes a management algorithm. Despite proven improvements in quality of life following chronic cough treatment, a clear understanding of the disease and the evidence for the efficacy of some treatments remain vague. Eight key questions regarding the treatment in the uncertain areas were systematically addressed based on the PICO framework and applying the GRADE system for evidence synthesis to provide the strength of recommendation and quality of evidence for key questions, with narrative components for the description of other chronic cough treatment including non-pharmacological therapy. Practical diagrams were developed to facilitate clinical decision-making on treatment. Our guideline introduces the concept of the cough management process for guiding practitioners to assess chronic cough using a holistic approach."
"Coptisine (COP) is a natural protoberberine isoquinoline alkaloid that is isolated from Coptis chinensis and exhibits a variety of pharmacological activities, such as the inhibition of tumor growth, bacterial infection, inflammation and oxidative stress. In this study, COP penetrated and produced fluorescent signals in living tumor cell lines, primary MEF cells and polyformaldehyde-fixed cells. The fluorescent signal was detected at a wavelength of 488 nm. The fluorescent signal of COP was observed predominantly in the nucleoli and colocalized with nucleolus fibrillarin and B23. The fluorescence intensity of COP was associated with tumor malignancy. Compared with cells with high fluorescent signals, cells with low fluorescent signals were highly malignant. Taken together, these data suggest that COP can function as a nucleolus probe and a probe candidate for distinguishing tumor cell malignancy."
"Rapamycin is an important natural macrolide antibiotic with antifungal, immunosuppressive and antitumor activities produced by Streptomyces rapamycinicus. However, their prospective applications are limited by low fermentation units. In this study, we found that the exogenous aromatic amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine could effectively increase the yield of rapamycin in industrial microbial fermentation. To gain insight into the mechanism of rapamycin overproduction, comparative transcriptomic profiling was performed between media with and without phenylalanine and tyrosine addition. The results showed that the addition of phenylalanine and tyrosine upregulated the transcription levels of genes involved in rapamycin biosynthesis, precursor production, and transporters. In addition, the transcription levels of many carbohydrate metabolism-related genes were down-regulated, leading to a decrease in growth, suggesting that balancing cell growth and rapamycin biosynthesis may be important to promote efficient biosynthesis of rapamycin in Streptomyces rapamycinicus. These results provide a basis for understanding physiological roles of phenylalanine and tyrosine, and a new way to increase rapamycin production in Streptomyces cultures."
Risk factors for bloodstream infection in patients with COVID-19 in the intensive care unit (ICU) remain unclear. The purpose of this systematic review was to study the risk factors for BSI in patients admitted to ICUs for COVID-19.
"Substance use disorders, particularly alcohol use disorders, represent a significant public health problem, with adolescents particularly vulnerable to their adverse effects. This study examined the possible anxiolytic and antidepressant effects of biotin, a crucial vitamin for brain function, in attenuating the behavioral and neurobiological changes associated with alcohol withdrawal in adolescent rats."
"Until around 2000, the number of medicinal products labelled for paediatric use was limited worldwide. Regulatory measures to promote paediatric drug development in the US and Europe and the establishment of an international guideline (ICH-E11) have led to an increase in the number of paediatric labels. In Japan, efforts have been made to promote the development of paediatric drugs. This study was aimed to examine whether these supportive efforts are successful in Japan."
"wrist ligament injuries and triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) lesions are common but often underdiagnosed conditions causing chronic wrist pain. The diagnostic challenge necessitates a combination of clinical examination, imaging studies, and arthroscopy, considered the gold standard. Ligament injuries, particularly scapholunate ligament (SL), and TFCC lesions account for significant wrist instability and ulnar-sided wrist pain, respectively."
"Generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP) is a recurrent and sometimes life-threatening sterile pustular disease. Because interleukin (IL)-36 is the central cytokine in disease formation, spesolimab, which interferes with IL-36 receptor signaling, is highly effective. Here, we report a patient with GPP with a heterozygous hypomorphic MPO variant refractory to intravenous spesolimab. Although spesolimab showed excellent clinical efficacy in resolving pre-existing pustules and erythema, it did not suppress the emergence of new pustules and erythema, which did not decrease the peripheral blood neutrophil count, therefore bimekizumab, an anti-IL-17A/IL-17F antibody, was administered after the second spesolimab infusion, which resolved the pustules and erythema. We discuss the possible reasons for the resistance mechanism to spesolimab."
"Colorectal cancer (CRC), a digestive tract malignancy with high mortality and morbidity, lacks effective biomarkers for clinical prognosis due to its complex molecular pathogenesis. Nucleotide binding protein 2 (NUBP2) plays a vital role in the assembly of cytosolic Fe/S protein and has been implicated in cancer progression. In this study, we found that NUBP2 was highly expressed in CRC by TCGA database analysis. Subsequently, we verified the expression of NUBP2 in CRC tumor tissues and para-carcinoma tissues using IHC staining, and further investigated its association with clinicopathological parameters. In vitro cell experiments were conducted to assess the role of NUBP2 in CRC by evaluating cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis upon NUBP2 dysregulation. Furthermore, we established a subcutaneous CRC model to evaluate the impact of NUBP2 on tumor growth in vivo. Additionally, we performed mechanistic exploration using a Human Phospho-Kinase Array-Membrane. Our results showed higher expression of NUBP2 in CRC tissues, which positively correlated with the pathological stage, indicating its involvement in tumor malignancy. Functional studies demonstrated that NUBP2 knockdown reduced cell proliferation, increased apoptosis, and impaired migration ability. Moreover, NUBP2 knockdown inhibited tumor growth in mice. We also observed significant changes in the phosphorylation level of GSK3β upon NUBP2 knockdown or overexpression. Additionally, treatment with CHIR-99021 HCl, an inhibitor of GSK3β, reversed the malignant phenotype induced by NUBP2 overexpression. Overall, this study elucidated the functional role of NUBP2 in CRC progression both in vitro and in vivo, providing insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying CRC and potential implications for targeted therapeutic strategies."
"Olfactory neuroblastoma (ONB) is a rare malignant tumor originating from the olfactory neuroepithelium, typically within the sinonasal cavity. Cases of ONB originating outside of the olfactory cleft area are extremely rare and are referred to as ""ectopic"" (eONB), in contrast to ""orthotopic"" tumors (oONB). ONB has been associated with paraneoplastic syndromes (PNSs), including the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). This study investigate the association between eONB and SIADH and compared the prognosis of eONB to oONB."
"Building on the algorithmic equivalence between finite population replicator dynamics and particle filtering based approximation of Bayesian inference, we design a computational model to demonstrate the emergence of Darwinian evolution over representational units when collectives of units are selected to infer statistics of high-dimensional combinatorial environments. The non-Darwinian starting point is two units undergoing a few cycles of noisy, selection-dependent information transmission, corresponding to a serial (one comparison per cycle), non-cumulative process without heredity. Selection for accurate Bayesian inference at the collective level induces an adaptive path to the emergence of Darwinian evolution within the collectives, capable of maintaining and iteratively improving upon complex combinatorial information. When collectives are themselves Darwinian, this mechanism amounts to a top-down (filial) transition in individuality. We suggest that such a selection mechanism can explain the hypothesized emergence of fast timescale Darwinian dynamics over a population of neural representations within animal and human brains, endowing them with combinatorial planning capabilities. Further possible physical implementations include prebiotic collectives of non-replicating molecules and reinforcement learning agents with parallel policy search."
"Inadequate sleep is a common problem among those receiving palliative care services, yet there is limited knowledge regarding nonpharmacological sleep interventions among staff. An educational online program was developed to address this deficit. This study assessed the extent of knowledge acquired following the online educational sleep program and determined the feasibility of using this intervention with palliative care professionals. Thirty-one participants (54.8% licensed nurses) completed the educational program. Most worked in either inpatient residential (38.7%) or home-based (35.5%) settings and had considerable experience working in palliative care. The total average pretest score was 67.5% (SD, 6.5%; range, 56.3%-79.2%) compared with the total average posttest score of 93.1% (SD, 6.0; range, 78.7%-100%). There was a significant mean difference in the scores as documented by a paired-sample t test ( t30 = -21.9, P < .0001). The results did not differ between the disciplines and those working in each setting or by years of experience. The study had a 51.6% recruitment rate and an 88.6% retention rate. The significant increase in the palliative care professionals' knowledge following the educational program suggests it is a useful tool for nurses, aides, social workers, and managers to improve direct care."
Idiopathic condylar resorption (ICR) is a rare condition of unknown etiology characterized by progressive decrease in volume and pathologic remodeling of a previously normal mandibular condyle. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) affecting only the temporomandibular joint (TMJ-only JIA) is characterized by synovitis and destruction of TMJ tissues without involvement of other joints. It is often difficult to differentiate the 2 conditions because they exhibit similar phenotypes.
"This study evaluated the diagnostic value of the automated UF-5000 parameters and compared it with that of aberrant erythrocytes and acanthocytes classified by microscopy for identifying IgA glomerular hematuria to propose a predictive model for clinical use. It also compared correlations between erythrocyte parameters and malformed erythrocytes. Urine samples from 53 biopsy-proven IgA hematuria cases and 143 non-IGA nephropathic hematuria cases as controls were analyzed. The ratio of small red blood cells to nonlysed red blood cells (UF-sRBC%) and lysed red blood cells (lysed RBCs) showed good diagnostic performance for IgA glomerular hematuria (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.857 [P = 0.000] and AUC = 0.860 [P = 0.000], respectively). Combining UF-sRBC%, lysed RBCs, and urine protein dry chemistry improved the diagnostic accuracy (AUC = 0.967; positive predictive value [PPV] = 91.89%; negative predictive value [NPV] = 93.10%; P = 0.000). This approach surpassed traditional microscopy for aberrant erythrocytes (AUC = 0.895; PPV = 62.27%; NPV = 88.66%; P = 0.008) and acanthocytes (AUC = 0.868; PPV = 72.97%; NPV = 83.65%; P = 0.006). The erythrocyte size index was negatively correlated with the proportion of urinary aberrant erythrocytes (r = - 0.787; P = 0.000). The UF-5000 erythrocyte parameters facilitate rapid identification of IgA nephropathy and could replace manual microscopy."
"This work presents the development of an amperometric biosensor for detecting aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activity in biological fluids using a platinum disk electrode as the working transducer. Optimal concentrations of substrates (aspartate, α-ketoglutarate) and the coenzyme (pyridoxal phosphate) were determined to ensure efficient biosensor operation. A semi-permeable poly-m-phenylenediamine membrane was applied to enhance selectivity against electroactive interferents. The biosensor demonstrated good stability (storage, continuous operation, and production reproducibility) and analytical performance (sensitivity 8.56 nA/min for 50 U/L AST, LOD 1 U/L, linear range 1-110 U/L). Testing with real samples showed a high correlation (R = 0.989) with spectrophotometric analysis, supporting its potential for further applications."

"Coxiella burnetii is the etiological agent of Q fever in humans, a zoonosis of increasingly important public health concern. The disease results in significant economic losses to livestock farmers and its presence in ready-to-eat dairy products poses a public health threat to consumers."
"The opioid crisis has been an issue in the United States since the mid-1990s, claiming numerous lives and presenting a significant challenge to health care clinicians. Various preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative strategies aimed at reducing opioid consumption can be used by orthopaedic surgeons to help minimize this crisis. Preoperative screening tools can help identify patients at risk for prolonged opioid use, allowing for tailored interventions and counseling. Patient education initiatives, including multimedia presentations and handouts, have shown promising results in decreasing opioid consumption postoperatively. Intraoperatively, administering local and regional anesthesia in collaboration with anesthesia colleagues has proved effective for minimizing postoperative pain and opioid requirements. Postoperatively, alternative therapies such as acetaminophen, NSAIDs, and cryotherapy offer viable options for pain management while reducing reliance on opioids. In addition, the prudent prescribing of opioids, based on patient needs and expectations, coupled with refill options, helps minimize excess opioid supply and potential diversion. Orthopaedic surgeons are urged to embrace a multimodal approach to pain management and decrease opioids prescription while integrating these various strategies to optimize outcomes while mitigating the risks associated with opioid use."
"Targeting the TGF-β pathway in tumor therapy has proven challenging due to the highly context-dependent functions of TGF-β. Integrin αvβ8, a pivotal activator of TGF-β, has been implicated in TGF-β signaling within tumors, as demonstrated by the significant anti-tumor effects of anti-αvβ8 antibodies. Nevertheless, the expression profile of αvβ8 remains a subject of debate, and the precise mechanisms underlying the anti-tumor effects of anti-αvβ8 antibodies are not yet fully elucidated."
"Based on the presenting injury, patients undergoing abuse evaluation may be managed by different specialties. Our local child abuse specialist expressed concern over the variability in evaluation of patients presenting with injuries concerning for non-accidental trauma (NAT). The aim of this quality improvement project was to increase the percentage of patients for whom there is a concern for NAT who receive a guideline-adherent evaluation from 7.7% to 50% in 6 months' time."
To compare the demographic and clinical characteristics of familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) patients according to age at disease onset and evaluate the dose effect of the number of pathogenic or likely pathogenic exon 10 mutations of the MEFV gene on disease severity.
"Previous studies have revealed that muscle atrophy emerges as a significant challenge faced by astronauts during prolonged missions in space. A loss in muscle mass results in a weakening of skeletal muscle strength and function, which will not only contribute to a decline in overall physical performance but also elevate the risk of various age-related diseases. Skeletal muscle atrophy in the microgravity environment is thought to be associated with changes in energy metabolism, protein metabolism, calcium ion homeostasis, myostatin levels, and apoptosis. Modulating some pathways could be a promising approach to mitigating muscle atrophy in the microgravity environment. This review serves as a comprehensive summary of research on the impact of microgravity on skeletal muscle, with the aim of providing insights into its pathogenesis and the development of effective treatments."
"COVID-19 exhibits not only respiratory symptoms but also neurological/psychiatric symptoms rarely including delirium/psychosis. Pathological studies on COVID-19 provide evidence that the cytokine storm, in particular (epidermal growth factor) EGF receptor (EGFR, ErbB1, Her1) activation, plays a central role in the progression of viral replication and lung fibrosis. Of note, SARS-CoV-2 virus (specifically, S1 spike domain) mimics EGF and directly transactivates EGFR, preceding the inflammatory process. In agreement, the anticancer drugs targeting EGFR such as Nimotuzumab and tyrosine kinase inhibitors are markedly effective on COVID-19. However, these data might raise a provisional caution regarding implication of psychiatric disorder such as schizophrenia. The author's group has been investigating the etiologic and neuropathologic associations of EGFR signaling with schizophrenia. There are significant molecular associations between schizophrenia and EGFR ligand levels in blood as well as in the brain. In addition, perinatal challenges of EGFR ligands and intraventricular administration of EGF to rodents and monkeys both resulted in severe behavioral and/or electroencephalographic endophenotypes relevant to this disorder. These animal models also display postpubertal abnormality in soliloquy-like self-vocalization as well as in intercortical functional connectivity. Here, we discuss neuropsychiatric implication of coronavirus infection and its interaction with the EGFR system, by searching related literatures in PubMed database as of the end of 2023."
"High rates of suicidal ideation (SI), suicide attempts (SA), and repetitive nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) among some ethnoracially minoritized United States youth populations may be related to adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) with structural roots."
"We introduce a 61-year-old man with poorly differentiated gastric adenocarcinoma, who previously underwent surgical treatment. In this presentation, he complained of a newly appeared midabdominal mass after the latest chemotherapy session. He was a candidate for diagnostic laparotomy, but in the setting of trial, 99m Tc-FAPI-46 SPECT/CT was performed revealing 2 peritoneal masses, which were the only findings of diagnostic surgery subsequent to the scan. This report presents the first case of 99m Tc-FAPI-46 SPECT/CT in metastasis workup of gastric adenocarcinoma."
"Vestibular schwannomas (VS) are often associated with debilitating hearing loss. Therefore, preservation and rehabilitation of hearing have become major therapeutic goals of VS management. Recently, cochlear implantation (CI) has been established as an effective treatment option for VS-associated hearing loss. Nevertheless, the integrity and proper function of the cochlear nerve must be evaluated before conducting CI to ensure optimal CI outcomes. Various methods to determine cochlear nerve integrity and functionality have emerged in the last few years. Of these, the use of electrically evoked auditory brainstem response audiometry (eABR) in particular has been proven to be a meaningful tool for monitoring cochlear nerve health during VS surgery. Here, the cochlear nerve can be electrically stimulated using an intracochlear test electrode before, during, and after tumor extirpation. Subsequently, the resulting brainstem responses can be measured and interpreted accordingly to obtain direct information on the cochlear nerve function. This allows for continuous monitoring of cochlear nerve function throughout the course of VS surgery and aids in the decision-making for CI candidacy. Finally, in the case of preserved brainstem responses, CI can be performed instantly after VS extirpation. This simultaneous approach offers several advantages over two-staged procedures and has been shown to be an efficient and safe procedure for restoring hearing after VS removal."
Radiofrequency ablation is a common non-opioid treatment to manage chronic knee pain. The inferior medial genicular nerve is conventionally targeted. It has been suggested that the infrapatellar branch (saphenous nerve) should also be targeted. There is controversy regarding the contribution of the infrapatellar branch to the innervation of the knee joint capsule.
"Moderately hypofractionated, preoperative radiotherapy in patients with soft tissue sarcomas (HYPORT-STS; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT03819985) investigated a radiobiologically equivalent, moderately hypofractionated course of preoperative radiotherapy (RT) 15 × 2.85 Gy in patients with soft tissue sarcoma (STS). Here, the authors report longer term follow-up to update local control and report late toxicities, as well as functional and patient-reported outcomes."
"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had a significant effect on mortality rates worldwide, with Thailand being no exception. Gaining insights into the impact of pandemic-related mortality is essential for assessing its broader consequences on public health. This study aimed to analyze excess deaths during the pandemic (January 1, 2020-September 30, 2022) and post-pandemic period (October 2022-December 2023) at regional and national levels in Thailand. Expected deaths were estimated using a negative-binomial model, utilizing 2015-2019 data to project deaths for 2020-2021, with adjustments for seasonality. We found that Thailand experienced 76,756 excess deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a p-score of 5.24%, and 36,126 excess deaths with a p-score of 5.26% in the post-pandemic period. After the pandemic, excess deaths in some provinces were elevated but did not reach statistical significance. Pneumonia was the major contributor to the deaths. In conclusion, Thailand experienced excess mortality during both the pandemic and post-pandemic periods. The study has identified regional areas with excess deaths, and further investigation into these findings could support public health improvements and strengthen preparedness for future health crises."
"We aim to explore variations of serum inflammation-related proteins in an acute compartment syndrome (ACS) rat model. We collected serum from 25 healthy Sprague-Dawley rats (control group, CG) and 50 rats with tibial fractures, including 25 rats with ACS (ACS group, AG), and 25 rats without ACS (fracture group, FG). Ten samples per group were randomly chosen for proximity extension assay analysis of 92 inflammation-related proteins, and all samples were verified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis was used to identify the diagnostic ability and cut-off values. Our findings showed that the levels of Il6 and Prdx5 in the FG and Il6, Prdx5, Dctn2, and Plin1 in the AG, were significantly higher than those in the CG. Notably, compared with the FG, high expression of Prdx5, Dctn2, and Plin1 was observed in the AG. Additionally, we identified 58.8764, 14.023, and 31.8730 pg/ml as the cut-off values of Prdx5, Dctn2, and Plin1 to predict ACS in rats. Similarly, the cut-off values of Il6, Prdx5, Dctn2, and Plin1 to predict ACS in healthy rats were 10.6783, 766.5879, 12.5627, and 14.3623 pg/ml, respectively. Furthermore, the combination of these proteins had the highest diagnostic accuracy. We identified Prdx5, Dctn2, and Plin1 as potential biomarkers of ACS compared with fracture in rats and revealed that combination of Il6, Prdx5, Dctn2, and Plin1 had the highest diagnostic accuracy to predict ACS compared with the healthy condition. Furthermore, the cut-off values for these biomarkers were determined, providing a new method to rapidly assess the risk of ACS and manage early targeted interventions."
"Donafenib is an improved version of sorafenib in which deuterium is substituted into the drug's chemical structure, enhancing its stability and antitumor activity. Donafenib exhibits enhanced antitumor activity and better tolerance than sorafenib in preclinical and clinical studies. However, the specific mechanism of its effect on hepatocellular carcinoma has not been reported. Iron deposition is a cell death pattern caused by disturbances in iron metabolism. Apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death. They may interact with each other during cell death. This study mainly explores the potential mechanism of donafenib activating the p53 signaling pathway, inducing iron deposition, and enhancing cell apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepa1-6 and Huh7 cells were treated with various concentrations of donafenib. Scratch healing and pore migration tests were conducted. Analyze apoptosis through flow cytometry and TUNEL fluorescence labeling. RNA sequencing was conducted on both untreated and donafenib-treated Huh7 cells. The key proteins involved in ferroptosis (SLC7A11, GPX4) and apoptosis (caspase3, caspase8, Bax, Bcl-2, p53) were then evaluated using immunoblotting and immunohistochemical staining. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in the cancer cells were measured. Donafenib treatment resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in the proliferation, migration, and invasion capabilities of cancer cells. There was an increase in apoptosis rates and ROS accumulation, and a reduction in tumor volume. The key proteins involved in ferroptosis and apoptosis underwent significant changes. Donafenib activates the p53 signaling pathway, induce ferroptosis, and enhance apoptosis, suggesting its potential as an effective therapeutic agent for HCC."
"Botulinum toxin is a well-established treatment for dynamic glabellar lines. Glabellar contraction patterns were described previously in the general Brazilian population and also among Koreans, Chinese, and Indian individuals. So far, no study has addressed glabellar contraction ""patterns"" in Black subjects."
"As the primary glial cells in the peripheral nervous system (PNS), Schwann cells (SCs) have been proven to influence the behavior of cancer cells profoundly and are involved in cancer progression through extensive interactions with cancer cells and other stromal cells. Indeed, the tumor microenvironment (TME) is a critical factor that can significantly limit the efficacy of immunotherapeutic approaches. The TME promotes tumor progression in part by reshaping an immunosuppressive state. The immunosuppressive TME is the result of the crosstalk between the tumor cells and the different immune cell subsets, including macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells, dendritic cells (DCs), lymphocytes, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), etc. They are closely related to the anti-tumor immune status and the clinical prognosis of cancer patients. Increasing research demonstrates that SCs influence these immune cells and reshape the formation of the immunosuppressive TME via the secretion of various cytokines, chemokines, and other effector molecules, eventually facilitating immune evasion and tumor progression. In this review, we summarize the SC reprogramming in TME, the emerging role of SCs in tumor immune microenvironment, and the underlying mechanisms involved. We also discuss the possible therapeutic strategies to selectively target SCs, providing insights and perspectives for future research and clinical studies involving SC-targeted treatment."

"Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is length-dependent peripheral nerve damage arising as a complication of type 1 or type 2 diabetes in up to 50% of patients. DPN poses a substantial burden on patients, who can experience impaired gait and loss of balance, predisposing them to falls and fractures, and neuropathic pain, which is frequently difficult to treat and reduces quality of life. Advanced DPN can lead to diabetic foot ulcers and non-healing wounds that often necessitate lower-limb amputation. From a socioeconomic perspective, DPN increases both direct health-care costs and indirect costs from loss of productivity owing to neuropathy-related disability. In this Review, we highlight the importance of understanding country-specific and region-specific variations in DPN prevalence to inform public health policy and allocate resources appropriately. We also explore how identification of DPN risk factors can guide treatment and prevention strategies and aid the development of health-care infrastructure for populations at risk. We review evidence that metabolic factors beyond hyperglycaemia contribute to DPN development, necessitating a shift from pure glycaemic control to multi-targeted metabolic control, including weight loss and improvements in lipid profiles."
"A fault diagnosis method of nonlinear analog circuits is proposed that combines the generalized frequency response function (GFRF) and the simplified least squares support vector machine (LSSVM). In this study, the harmonic signal is used as an input to estimate the GFRFs. To improve the estimation accuracy, the GFRFs of an analog circuit are solved directly using time-domain data. The Fourier transform of the time-domain data is avoided. After obtaining the fault features, a multi-fault classifier is designed based on the LSSVM. In order to improve the training speed and reduces storage, a simplified LSSVM model is used to construct the classifier, and the conjugate gradient algorithm is used for training. The fault diagnosis simulation experiment is conducted on a biquad filter circuit to verify the proposed method. The experimental results show that the proposed method has high diagnostic accuracy and short training time."
"Accelerated senescence of renal tubular epithelial cells (RTEC) is critical in the progression of diabetic kidney disease (DKD). GLIS family zinc finger 1 (Glis1) alleviates age-related renal fibrosis in naturally aged mice. However, the role and associated mechanism of Glis1 in accelerated senescence of RTEC and the development of DKD remain unclear."
"Air pollution, comprising a variable mixture of gaseous and solid particulate material, represents a serious, unmet, global health issue. The Global Burden of Disease study reported that 12% of all deaths occurring in 2019 were related to ambient air pollution, with particulate matter often considered to be the leading cause of harm. As of 2024, over 90% of the world's population are exposed to excessive amounts of particulate matter, based on WHO maximum exposure level guidelines. A substantial body of evidence supports a link between air pollution and cardiovascular disease, with around half of ambient pollution-related deaths thought to be secondary to cardiovascular causes. A possible association between particulate matter and venous thromboembolism has been less clear, but in the past decade, several studies have added to the available literature. In this Review, we discuss the current epidemiological evidence linking air pollution to the development of venous thrombotic events. We consider mechanisms promoting a thromboinflammatory phenotype in these individuals, including platelet dysfunction, dysregulated fibrinolysis, and enhanced thrombin generation. Given the relevance to global health, we also discuss possible strategies required to mitigate the impact of air pollution on human health worldwide."

"Similarly to acute intestinal helminth infection, several conditions of chronic eosinophilic type 2 inflammation of mucosal surfaces, including asthma and eosinophilic esophagitis, feature robust expansions of intraepithelial mast cells (MCs). Also the hyperplastic mucosa of nasal polyposis in the context of chronic rhinosinusitis, with or without COX1 inhibitor intolerance, contains impressive numbers of intraepithelial MCs. In this issue of the JCI, Derakhshan et al. elucidate the heterogeneity of MCs in nasal polyposis and identify a transcriptional signature of TGF-β target genes expressed by the intraepithelial MC population. These MCs displayed effector functions that implicate them as pathogenetic contributors. TGF-β directed differentiation of similar MC populations also in vitro. These findings extend the emerging concept of TGF-β as a driver of type 2 inflammation at barrier surfaces."

"YouTube has emerged as a popular platform for accessing educational content. However, its effectiveness has been a topic of debate in dental education. This study aimed to analyze the content and quality of YouTube videos focusing on Class II resin composite restorations. The first 100 videos of Class II resin composite information on YouTube were evaluated. The overall quality of the videos was assessed using the video information and quality index (VIQI) and Content Score based on Class II resin composite criteria. Videos with a score of less than the mean were recognized as low-content. No significant differences were observed between high- and low-content videos when the number of views, likes, duration, days since upload, viewing rate, and interaction index were investigated (p>0.05). The number of subscribers revealed a marginally significant difference (p=0.053). The high-content videos demonstrated higher mean values compared to the low-content videos in flow (4.6 vs. 3.8; p=0.0004), accuracy (4.3 vs. 3.3; p<0.0001), value (3.7 vs. 2.9; p=0.002), and precision (4.8 vs. 4.2; p=0.0002). The overall VIQI score was significantly higher (p<0.0001) in high-content videos (Mean 17.4; SD 1.5) compared to the low-content videos (Mean 14.2; SD 2.2). When the Content Score was assessed, high-content videos (Mean 9.9; SD 1.3) revealed a higher score (p<0.0001) than low-content-videos (Mean 4.2; SD 2.3). Most YouTube videos showcasing Class II resin composites serve as effective teaching tools. However, a significant number of videos with low content exist. Therefore, dental students should exercise caution when utilizing YouTube videos for learning purposes."
"An abnormal shock index (SI) is associated with greater injury severity among children with trauma. We sought to empirically-derive age-adjusted SI cutpoints associated with major trauma in children, and to compare the accuracy of these cutpoints to existing criteria for pediatric SI."
"Black birthing people experience lower rates of postpartum follow-up care. The objective of this study was to examine factors associated with postpartum follow-up care and explore suggestions for improving the quality and experience of care during the postpartum period. A survey was conducted among Black birthing people in the Boston area who had delivered an infant within two years of the study. Our survey comprised the Jackson, Hogue, Phillips Contextualized Stress Measure (JHPCSM), the Power as Knowing Participation in Change Tool (PKPCT), and demographic questions. One hundred and twenty-one self-identified Black birthing people completed the survey. One-third of participants did not attend their postpartum appointment. Those with public insurance, an educational level of less than a college degree, or were working outside the home were significantly less likely to have a postpartum follow-up visit. Participants who attended postpartum visits had higher scores on the JHPCSM (lower stress) and PKPCT. Inability to take time off from work, COVID-19 concerns, and lack of childcare were the most frequently reported barriers to attending appointments. There is a need for better institutional and policy support for Black parents in the postpartum period."
"Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is an acquired clonal disorder of hematopoietic stem cells induced by PIG-A gene mutations. It is clinically manifested by hemolysis, bone marrow failure, and high-risk concurrent thrombosis, which are life-threatening in severe cases. Significant progress has been made in the pathogenesis research and clinical diagnosis and treatment of PNH in recent years. The Red Blood Cell Disease (Anemia) Group Chinese Society of Hematology, Chinese Medical Association, combined with the latest diagnosis and treatment progress of PNH, relevant foreign guidelines/consensus, and China's national conditions, jointly formulated the ""Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (2024) "" based on extensive solicitation of expert suggestions and opinions. This article discussed the key and difficult issues in PNH diagnosis and treatment, interpreted the updated part of the guidelines, and expanded the relevant recommendations of the guidelines according to the latest research progress at home and abroad, thereby providing more references for clinical practice."
"Extremely premature infants are at significant risk for developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI). Although BPD is a predictor of poor neurodevelopmental outcomes, it is currently unknown how BPD contributes to brain injury and long-term NDI in pre-term infants. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are small, membrane-bound structures released from cells into the surrounding environment. EVs are involved in inter-organ communication in diverse pathological processes. Inflammasomes are large, multiprotein complexes that are part of the innate immune system and are responsible for triggering inflammatory responses and cell death. Apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC) is pivotal in inflammasome assembly and activating inflammatory caspase-1. Activated caspase-1 cleaves gasdermin D (GSDMD) to release a 30 kD N-terminal domain that can form membrane pores, leading to lytic cell death, also known as pyroptosis. Activated caspase-1 can also cleave pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 to their active forms, which can be rapidly released through the GSDMD pores to induce inflammation. Recent evidence has emerged that activation of inflammasomes is associated with neonatal lung and brain injury, and inhibition of inflammasomes reduces hyperoxia-induced neonatal lung and brain injury. Additionally, multiple studies have demonstrated that hyperoxia stimulates the release of lung-derived EVs that contain inflammasome cargos. Adoptive transfer of these EVs into the circulation of normal neonatal mice and rats induces brain inflammatory injury. This review focuses on EV-inflammasomes' roles in mediating lung-to-brain crosstalk via EV-dependent and EV-independent mechanisms critical in BPD, brain injury, and NDI pathogenesis. EV-inflammasomes will be discussed as potential therapeutic targets for neonatal lung and brain injury."

"Plasmodium vivax, a significant contributor to global malaria cases, poses an escalating health burden on a substantial portion of the world's population. The increasing spread of P. vivax because of climate change underscores the development of new and rational drug-discovery approaches. The Seattle Structural Genomics Center for Infectious Diseases is taking a structure-based approach by investigating essential enzymes such as N-myristoyltransferase (NMT). P. vivax N-myristoyltransferase (PvNMT) is a promising target for the development of novel malaria treatments unlike current drugs, which target only the erythrocytic stages of the parasite. Here, the 1.8 Å resolution ternary structure of PvNMT in complex with myristoyl-CoA and IMP-1088, a validated NMT inhibitor, is reported. IMP-1088 is a validated nonpeptidic inhibitor and a ternary complex structure with human NMT has previously been reported. IMP-1088 binds similarly to PvNMT as to human NMT."
Diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) are one of the most destructive complications of diabetes mellitus. The aim of this study was to link miR-155 and SOX2 with DFU to explore the regulation of wound healing by DFU and its potential mechanism.
"Convergent extension (CE) is an evolutionarily conserved developmental process that elongates tissues and organs via collective cell movements known as cell intercalation. Here, we sought to understand the mechanisms connecting cell behaviors and tissue shaping. We focus on an often-overlooked aspect of cell intercalation, the resolution of 4-cell vertices. Our data reveal that imbalanced cellular forces are involved in a timely vertex resolution, which, in turn, enables the propagation of such cellular forces, facilitating the propagation of tissue-scale CE. Conversely, delayed vertex resolution leads to a subtle but significant change in tissue-wide cell packing and exerts a profound impact by blocking force propagation, resulting in CE propagation defects. Our findings propose a collaborative nature of local cell intercalations in propagating tissue-wide CE. It unveils a multiscale biomechanical synergy underpinning the cellular mechanisms that orchestrate tissue morphogenesis during CE."
"With an estimated incidence of 0.02% to 0.2%, multiligamentous knee injuries are rare, often devastating injuries that can occur with concomitant vascular or neurologic involvement. Generally, outcomes of surgical treatment have been superior to those of nonsurgical treatment for active individuals and the general population. Surgical treatment options include primary repair, reconstruction, or augmentation. However, the ideal timing of treatment, both surgery and rehabilitation, is unclear. Options include acute (ie, within 3 weeks), subacute (3 to 8 weeks), and delayed treatment of all ligaments simultaneously, or alternatively managed in two stages. Primary repair can be considered in avulsion injuries of the posterior cruciate ligament and posteromedial corner and distal posterolateral corner avulsions; however, treatment paradigms are still evolving. Reconstruction is preferred in younger patients, for most midsubstance injuries and cruciate ligament injuries, and when presentation is delayed. Early surgery may be associated with better outcomes and a lower incidence of cartilage lesions compared with delayed surgery, although there may be an increased risk of arthrofibrosis. More traditional protocols often restrict weight bearing in the first weeks to protect ligament healing. Although early range-of-motion exercises decrease the risk of stiffness following surgery for multiligamentous knee injury, concern remains regarding attenuation or loosening of the surgically repaired or reconstructed ligaments. The Surgical Timing and Rehabilitation trial has been designed to assess the outcomes of early versus delayed surgery and early versus delayed rehabilitation."
"In Australian EDs, patients experience long waits for imaging, particularly for presentations such as renal colic. Computed tomography (CT) imaging is the gold-standard for renal stones, although ultrasonography is recommended for young patients and those susceptible to radiation, an approach supported by The Canberra Hospital (TCH) ED guidelines for renal colic. This audit aims to not only assess how well these guidelines are adhered to, but also to discuss possible methods of improving flow through ED and thus patient outcomes."
"Alternative complex III (ACIII) is a multi-subunit quinol:electron acceptor oxidoreductase that couples quinol oxidation with transmembrane proton translocation in bacterial respiratory and photosynthetic electron transport chains. Four ACIII cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures are known. However, the effects of cryo-EM versus X-ray crystallography structure determination on ACIII structure are unclear. Here, we report a 3.25 Å crystal structure of photosynthetic ACIII from Chloroflexus aurantiacus (CaACIIIp), revealing eight subunits (ActA-G and I) with four iron-sulfur clusters and six c-type hemes, a menaquinol-binding site, and two proton translocation passages. Structural comparisons with the previously reported cryo-EM structures reveal slight local conformational changes in the solvent-exposed regions of ActB, ActD, ActG, and the transmembrane (TM) helix of subunit I. The regions conferring structural flexibility possess low sequence conservation across species. However, the core functional modules containing the menaquinol-binding pocket, redox centers, and proton translocation passages remain unchanged, preserving the enzyme's activity."

"Bartter's and Gitelman's syndromes (BS/GS) are genetically determined kidney tubulopathies leading to electrolyte and neurohormonal abnormalities. Although considered benign entities, major adverse cardiovascular events may complicate both syndromes, in form of ventricular arrhythmias leading to palpitations, syncope or sudden cardiac death, microvascular cardiac dysfunction and exercise-induced myocardial contractile deficit. The mechanisms leading to cardiovascular complications are not only driven by chronic electrolyte abnormalities, i.e. chronic hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, but also by neurohormonal alterations that can impair vascular tone and myocardial contractility. In presence of triggering factors, BS/GS patients may experience a spectrum of cardiac arrhythmias necessitating prompt diagnosis and treatment. The aim of this review is to explore the pathophysiological mechanisms of BS and GS, highlighting those responsible for cardiovascular involvement, and to analyze the spectrum of associated cardiovascular complications. This highlights the importance of an integrated shared management of GS/BS patients between Nephrologist and Cardiologist."
"Lycoris aurea, celebrated for its visually striking flowers and significant medicinal value due to the presence of alkaloids such as lycorine and galanthamine, has intricate yet poorly understood regulatory mechanisms. This study provides a detailed examination of the transcriptomic, metabolomic and ecological dynamics of L. aurea, aiming to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms of alkaloid biosynthesis. Our comparative analysis across different ecological settings highlighted key genes involved in alkaloid biosynthesis, such as genes encoding aldehyde dehydrogenase and norbelladine 4'-O-methyltransferase, which were distinctively increased in the high alkaloids-producing group. We identified a total of 6871 differentially expressed genes and 915 metabolites involved in pathways like terpenoid backbone biosynthesis, phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis. Protein interaction network analysis revealed significant upregulation of photosynthesis, photosystem and photosynthetic membrane pathways in the alkaloids-producing region. Furthermore, our research delineated the interactions among soil microbial communities, genes and plant and soil biochemical properties, noting that bacterial populations correlate with soil properties that favour the activation of metabolic pathways essential for alkaloid production. Collectively, this study advances our understanding of the genetic and metabolic alkaloid biosynthesis pathways in L. aurea, shedding light on the complex interactions that govern alkaloid production."
"Sample size calculation and power estimate are an integral part of clinical trials. With accelerated development to address the unmet medical needs, the fast-paced development may lead to uncertainties in initial planning and assumptions of clinical trials. Promising zone design presents sponsors an opportunity to re-estimate the sample size based on the interim data to mitigate risks, reduce uncertainties, and increase probability of trial success."
"The aim of this study was to evaluate whether an A-PRF + membrane can lower the fistula rate in patients undergoing primary palatoplasty. A total of 20 children were included: 10 were randomized and included in the platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) group, and 10 were assigned to the control group. Before two-flap palatoplasty was performed, the cleft's width was measured. The patients in the PRF group underwent an intraoperative collection of 5 ml venous blood, which was centrifugated and pressed onto an A-PRF + membrane. Subsequently, the membrane was placed between the oral and nasal mucosal layers. The control group underwent the same procedure without the addition of A-PRF+. The need for transfusions or postoperative intensive care was registered. All children were followed up at 10 days, 1, 2, 3, and 6 months, and after more than 6 months and the occurrence of fistulae and need for a second palatal operation was then evaluated. After more than six months postoperatively, only two fistulae (10%) remained and had to undergo secondary palatoplasty (p = 1.00). Moreover, the blood transfusion rate did not differ significantly (p = 1.00). A-PRF + might be beneficial in cleft closure, but further randomized studies with larger patient cohort are needed."

"There is plenty of evidence supporting the clinical benefits of mHealth interventions for type 2 diabetes, but despite often being promoted as cost-effective or cost-saving, there is still limited research to support such claims. The objective of this review was to summarize and critically analyze the current body of economic evaluation (EE) studies for mHealth interventions for type 2 diabetes."
"Systems serology aims to broadly profile the antigen binding, Fc biophysical features, immune receptor engagement, and effector functions of antibodies. This experimental approach excels at identifying antibody functional features that are relevant to a particular disease. However, a crucial limitation of this approach is its incomplete description of what structural features of the antibodies are responsible for the observed immune receptor engagement and effector functions. Knowing these antibody features is important for both understanding how effector responses are naturally controlled through antibody Fc structure and designing antibody therapies with specific effector profiles. Here, we address this limitation by modeling the molecular interactions occurring in these assays and using this model to infer quantities of specific antibody Fc species among the antibodies being profiled. We used several validation strategies to show that the model accurately infers antibody properties and then applied the model to infer previously unavailable antibody fucosylation information from existing systems serology data. Using this capability, we find that COVID-19 vaccine efficacy is associated with the induction of afucosylated spike protein-targeting IgG. Our results also question an existing assumption that controllers of HIV exhibit gp120-targeting IgG that are less fucosylated than those of progressors. Additionally, we confirm that afucosylated IgG is associated with membrane-associated antigens for COVID-19 and HIV, and present new evidence indicating that this relationship is specific to the host cell membrane. Finally, we use the model to identify redundant assay measurements and subsets of information-rich measurements from which Fc properties can be inferred. In total, our modeling approach provides a quantitative framework for the reasoning typically applied in these studies, improving the ability to draw mechanistic conclusions from these data."
"Previous work suggested that phonation threshold pressure (PTP), phonation threshold flow (PTF), and phonation threshold power (PTW) could be effective aerodynamic measures for quantifying glottal incompetence. This study examined how these measures could reflect varying extent of incomplete glottal closure in individuals with voice disorders."
"Myelinating oligodendrocytes arise from the stepwise differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). Approximately 5% of all adult brain cells are OPCs. Why would a mature brain need such a large number of OPCs? New myelination is possibly required for higher-order functions such as cognition and learning. Additionally, this pool of OPCs represents a source of new oligodendrocytes to replace those lost during injury, inflammation, or in diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). How OPCs are instructed to differentiate into oligodendrocytes is poorly understood, and for reasons presently unclear, resident pools of OPCs are progressively less utilized in MS. The complement component 1, q subcomponent-like (C1QL) protein family has been studied for their functions at neuron-neuron synapses, but we show that OPCs express C1ql1. We created OPC-specific conditional knockout mice and show that C1QL1 deficiency reduces the differentiation of OPCs into oligodendrocytes and reduces myelin production during both development and recovery from cuprizone-induced demyelination. In vivo over-expression of C1QL1 causes the opposite phenotype: increased oligodendrocyte density and myelination during recovery from demyelination. We further used primary cultured OPCs to show that C1QL1 levels can bidirectionally regulate the extent of OPC differentiation in vitro. Our results suggest that C1QL1 may initiate a previously unrecognized signaling pathway to promote differentiation of OPCs into oligodendrocytes. This study has relevance for possible novel therapies for demyelinating diseases and may illuminate a previously undescribed mechanism to regulate the function of myelination in cognition and learning."
"The detection of a local per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) pollution hotspot in Zwijndrecht (Belgium) necessitated immediate action to address health concerns of the local community. Several human biomonitoring (HBM) studies were initiated, gathering cross-sectional exposure data from more than 10,000 participants. The linkage of these HBM data with primary care health registries might be a useful new tool in environmental health analysis."
"Needle stick injury (NSI) is one of the most common and severe occupational hazards for healthcare workers (HCWs), leading to both physical harm and psychological distress and ultimately affecting patient safety. Previous studies on NSI were predominantly focused on general clinical practice, and limited research has targeted specifical NSI occurring in acupuncture practice in China, which has the greatest use of acupuncture."
"Drug repurposing (DR) offers a compelling alternative to traditional drug discovery's lengthy, resource-intensive process. DR is the process of identifying alternative clinical applications for pre-approved drugs as a low-risk and low-cost strategy. Computational approaches are crucial during the early hypothesis-generating stage of DR. However, 'large-scale' data retrieval remains a significant challenge. A computational workflow addressing such limitations might improve hypothesis generation, ultimately benefit patients and advance DR research."
"A homozygous calf with CACNA1S-related muscle weakness, a new autosomal recessive congenital disorder in Holstein cattle, was identified by genotyping 195 stored blood samples from Holstein calves aged less than 12 months. The patient was an 8-day-old male calf with congenital astasia which presented to a university hospital in 2019. The patient was unable to maintain an upright position with assistance to stand. Congenital abnormalities in the central nervous system were suspected, but necropsy revealed no specific lesion, with no clear diagnosis. CACNA1S-related muscle weakness should be considered a cause of congenital astasia or weakness in calves. Genotyping is required for a definitive diagnosis because clinical and laboratory findings are non-specific."
"Electrochemical imaging enables an in-depth analysis of the interface heterogeneity and reaction kinetics of single entities. However, electrode passivation during electrochemical reactions decreases the active sites and harms the long-term stability. Here, we introduce a method using laser-induced photothermal effects to restore the electrochemical activity, which is particularly displayed as enhanced micrometric patterns in electrochemiluminescence (ECL) microscopy. By co-localization characterization and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), the mechanism of active site regeneration is validated as the removal of the oxide film for restoring the local surface ECL reactivity under laser irradiation. The surface-confined and voltage-dependent features of ECL allows for easy pattern erasure and rewriting, and it shows good reversibility and anti-counterfeiting potential. This approach overcomes the passivation processes, evidently improves the image quality of single biological entities including Shewanella bacteria and cells, and makes the subtle contour structures more distinct. The renewable electrode interface also enhances the ECL signal of model bead-based bioassays. This approach not only showcases precise control in fabricating micron patterns but also holds promise for enhancing the sensitivity in electrochemical immunoassays and bioimaging."
Surgical site infections (SSIs) are a major driver of morbidity after combined liver and colorectal surgery for metastatic colorectal cancer. Available literature is inadequate to characterize risk factors and benchmarks for quality improvement.
"Ulcerative colitis(UC)is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease characterized by non-specific,persistent inflammation in the intestines.This chronic inflammation often increases the risk of serious complications such as colorectal cancer.Dysplasia acts as a driver of cancer development and plays a connecting role in the occurrence and development of chronic intestinal inflammation and colorectal cancer.Cell proliferation/apoptosis imbalance is the driving factor for dysplasia development.The abnormal proliferation/apoptosis of intestinal mucosal epithelial cells may be affected by cyclooxygenase-2(COX-2),tumor suppressor gene p53,or both.Therefore,reasonable regulation of COX-2/p53 axis may be a key to achieving intestinal mucosal proliferation/apoptosis balance.This article discusses the effects and mechanism of COX-2 and p53 in regulating the occurrence and development of dysplasia in UC from the proliferation/apoptosis imbalance of intestinal mucosal epithelial cells,aiming to provide a reference for understanding the mechanism of dysplasia in UC and developing targeted therapeutic drugs."

"Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) have an overall poor prognosis, especially in locally advanced and metastatic stages. In most cases, multimodal therapeutic approaches are required and show only limited cure rates with a high risk of tumor recurrence. Anti-PD-1 antibody treatment was recently approved for recurrent and metastatic cases but to date, response rates remain lower than 25%. Therefore, the investigation of the immunological tumor microenvironment and the identification of novel immunotherapeutic targets in HNSCC is of paramount importance. In our study, we used tissue samples of n = 116 HNSCC patients for the immunohistochemical detection of the intratumoral and peritumoral expression of T cell exhaustion markers (PD-1, LAG-3, TIM-3) on tumor infiltration leukocytes (TIL), as well as the expression level of stromal senescence markers (IL-8, MMP-3) on tumor-associated fibroblasts. The clinical parameter of the vitamin D serum status as well as the histopathological HPV infection status of the tumor was correlated with the expression rates of the biomarkers and the overall patient survival. An increased peritumoral and intratumoral expression of the biomarkers PD-1 and TIM-3 significantly correlated with improved overall patient survival. A high peritumoral expression of LAG-3 correlated with better overall survival. A positive HPV tumor status correlated with a significantly elevated expression of PD-1 and TIM-3. Biomarkers of stromal senescence showed no influence on the patient outcome. However, the vitamin D serum status showed no influence on patient outcomes or biomarker expressions. Our study identified PD-1, LAG-3, and TIM-3 as promising targets of a therapeutic strategy targeting the tumor microenvironment in HNSCC, particularly among HPV-positive patients, where a higher expression of these checkpoints correlated with an improved overall survival. These findings support the potential of antibodies targeting these immune checkpoints to enhance treatment efficacy, especially in the context of bispecific targeting."
A work environment where employees feel comfortable taking chances without fear and with sufficient protection from retaliation is psychologically safe. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of leader training for nurse managers on psychological safety of clinical registered nurses.
"Phenology is a major component of animals' breeding, as they need to adjust their breeding timing to match optimal environmental conditions. While the effects of shifting phenology are well-studied on populations, few studies emphasise its ecological causes and consequences at the inter-individual level. Using a 20-year monitoring of more than 2500 breeding events from ~ 500 breeding little penguins (Eudyptula minor), a very asynchronously breeding seabird, we investigated the consequences of late breeding on present and next breeding events. We found that individuals breeding later had reduced breeding success, lighter chicks at fledging, lower probability of laying a second clutch, and decreased parents' post-breeding body condition. Importantly, we found important cycling effects where delayed breeding during a given year led to significantly later laying date, lower breeding probability and lower breeding success when they breed during the next season, suggesting potential carry-over effects from one season to the next. To further understand the causes of such variability in phenology while earlier breeding is associated with better individual fitness, we aimed to assess intrinsic differences amongst individuals. We showed that the heterogeneity in breeding timing was partly fixed, the laying date being a significantly repeatable behaviour (17%), asking for more studies on heritability or early-development effects. This extensive study highlights the combined roles of carry-over effects and intrinsic differences on individual phenology, with important implications on breeding capacity through life."
"Porcine stool-associated RNA virus (Posavirus) is an unclassified virus with sequence similarity to viruses in the order of Picornaviridae. In China, lineage 1 Posavirus (Posavirus 1) has been circulating in the field since its initial emergence in 2014 however no other lineages have been reported. To investigate the genetic diversity of Posavirus in China, 1200 diarrheic samples were collected from pigs in China. Following high-throughput and Sanger sequencing, one complete genome sequence of a Posavirus (designated SC01) strain was obtained. The genome of SC01 strain was 10217 nucleotides in length and encoded a polyprotein of 3346 amino acids. Genome comparative analysis revealed that SC01 shared 85.6% nucleotide similarity to Posavirus 2 strains, but only 35.2-58.0% sequence identity with Posavirus 1 and 3-12 strains. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the SC01 was classified in Posavirus 2 and clustered into a separate branch with the American Posavirus 2 isolates, indicating that the SC01 is a Posavirus 2 strain. Notably, a novel 1-amino acid deletion was observed in polyprotein at amino acid position 147. This is the first report of the presence of Posavirus 2 in China, and the genomic data of SC01 provides insights into the genetic diversity and evolution of Posavirus in the region."
"Despite growing utilization of family planning in Ethiopia, many pregnancies in rural areas are still unintended and unintended pregnancy remains a major global challenge in public and reproductive health, with devastating impact on women and child health, and the general public. Hence, this study was aimed to determine the prevalence and associated factors of unintended pregnancy in rural women of Ethiopia. This study used a 2016 Ethiopian Demography and Health Survey data. A total weighted samples of 974 reproductive-aged rural women were included in this analysis. Multilevel mixed logistic regression analysis was employed to consider the effect of hierarchal nature of EDHS data using Stata version 14 to determine individual and community level factors. Variables significantly associated with unintended pregnancy were declared at p-value < 0.05 with adjusted odds ratio and 95% confidence interval (CI). The prevalence of unintended pregnancy in rural women was 31.66% ( 95%CI 28.8%, 34.66%). Never had media exposure (AOR: 2.67, 95%CI 1.48, 4.83), don't have work (AOR: 0.33, 95%CI 0.21, 0.52), being from household size of one to three (AOR: 0.44 95%CI 0.2, 0.96), being primiparous (AOR: 0.41, 95%CI 0.17, 0.99), women from poor families (AOR: 2.4, 95%CI 1.24, 4.56), lacking the intention to use contraceptive (AOR: 0.24, 95%CI 0.14, 0.44) were individual-level factors significantly associated with unintended pregnancy. Women from large central region (AOR: 4.2, 95%CI 1.19, 14.62) and being from poor community wealth status (AOR: 4.3, 95%CI 1.85, 10.22) were community-level factors statistically associated with unintended pregnancy. The present study prevalence of unintended pregnancy in rural women was relatively high. Maternal occupation, household size, media exposure, parity, women wealth, intention to use contraceptive, region and community level wealth were factors statistically associated with unintended pregnancy. Hence, demographer and public health practitioners has to give great emphasis on designing an intervention with implementation strategies to increase accessibility of media for reproductive-age women's and improve women financial capacity, and strengthen maternal health services. These strategies helps to decrease adverse birth outcomes associated with unintended pregnancy in rural areas."
"Santalum album is an economically important plant in the craft, spices and medicine industries. The main chemical constituents found in sandalwood essential oils are sesquiterpenes. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl monoacyl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGR) is one of the rate-limiting enzymes required for the synthesis of sandal sesquiterpenes, but there are no studies on the HMGR gene in S. album. In this study, the full-length ORFs of the upper rate-limiting enzyme genes SaHMGR1 and SaHMGR2, which lie upstream of the MVA metabolic pathway of sandal sesquiterpenes, were cloned for the first time. Bioinformatics and phylogenetic analyses were conducted. The results showed that SaHMGR1 and SaHMGR2 had typical domains of HMGR class I enzymes in the HMGR superfamily, including four catalytic sites, six NADPH-binding sites, five substrate binding regions, four inhibitor binding sites, and several dimer interface regions. A phylogenetic analysis showed that SaHMGR1 and SaHMGR2 were highly conserved relative to corresponding genes in other plants. An analysis of subcellular localization showed that these SaHMGR genes were located in the endoplasmic reticulum. SaHMGR1 and SaHMGR2 were detected by real-time PCR in roots, sapwood, heartwood, young leaves, mature leaves and twigs. Highest expression was in roots. SaHMGR1 expression was higher in mature leaves than in heartwood while SaHMGR2 expression was lower in mature leaves than in heartwood. Expression in Escherichia coli strain DH5α with plasmid pET-32a (+) was also used to verify the functionality of both HMGR proteins, which catalyzed the formation of MVA from HMG-CoA. In E. coli, the enzymatic activity of SaHMGR1 was higher than that of SaHMGR2. These findings provide a basis for further studies on the function of SaHMGR genes and the regulation of sesquiterpene biosynthesis in S. album."
It is significant to know how much early detection and screening could reduce the proportion of occult metastases and benefit NSCLC patients.
"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) exhibits an ∼4:1 male-to-female sex bias and is characterized by early-onset impairment of social/communication skills, restricted interests, and stereotyped behaviors. Disruption of the Xp22.11 locus has been associated with ASD in males. This locus includes the three-exon PTCHD1, an adjacent multi-isoform long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) named PTCHD1-AS (spanning ∼1 Mb), and a poorly characterized single-exon RNA helicase named DDX53 that is intronic to PTCHD1-AS. While the relationship between PTCHD1/PTCHD1-AS and ASD is being studied, the role of DDX53 has not been comprehensively examined, in part because there is no apparent functional murine ortholog. Through clinical testing, here, we identified 8 males and 2 females with ASD from 8 unrelated families carrying rare, predicted damaging or loss-of-function variants in DDX53. Additionally, we identified a family consisting of a male proband and his affected mother with high-functioning autism, both harboring a gene deletion involving DDX53 and exons of the noncoding RNA PTCHD1-AS. Then, we examined databases, including the Autism Speaks MSSNG and Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative, as well as population controls. We identified 26 additional individuals with ASD harboring 19 mostly maternally inherited, rare, damaging DDX53 variations, including two variants detected in families from the original clinical analysis. Our findings in humans support a direct link between DDX53 and ASD, which will be important in clinical genetic testing. These same autism-related findings, coupled with the observation that a functional orthologous gene is not found in mice, may also influence the design and interpretation of murine modeling of ASD."

"The purpose of this study is to develop and validate the scale of health education demand of patients with HPV infection based on KANO model, so as to provide a tool for further exploring the types of health education demand and influencing factors of patients with HPV infection."
"Cartilage repair necessitates adjunct therapies such as cell-based approaches, which commonly use MSCs and chondrocytes but is limited by the formation of fibro-hyaline cartilage. Articular cartilage-derived chondroprogenitors(CPs) offer promise in overcoming this, as they exhibit higher chondrogenic and lower hypertrophic phenotypes. The study aimed to compare the efficacy of various cell types derived from adult and foetal cartilage suspended in platelet-rich plasma(PRP) in repairing chondral defects in an Ex-vivo Osteochondral Unit(OCU) model."
"Disulfiram (Antabuse®) is an oral alcohol sobriety medication that exhibits antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive facultative anaerobes.

"Photodynamic inactivation (PDI) has been revealed as a valuable approach against viral infections because of the fast therapeutic effect and low possibility of resistance development. The photodynamic inhibition of the infectivity of human herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) strain Victoria at different stages of its reproduction was studied. PDI activity was determined on extracellular virions, on the stage of their adsorption to the Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cell line and inhibition of the viral replication stage by application of two tetra-methylpyridiloxy substituted gallium and zinc phthalocyanines (ZnPcMe and GaPcMe) upon 660 nm light exposure with a light-emitting diode (LED 660 nm). The PDI effect was evaluated on extracellular virions and virus adsorption by the terminal dilution method and the change in viral infectivity, which was compared to the untreated control group. The decrease in viral titer (Δlgs) was determined. The effect on the replicative cycle of the virus was determined using the cytopathic effect inhibition (CPE) assay. The direct influence on the virions showed a remarkable effect with a decrease in the viral titer more than 4 (Δlg > 4). The influence of the virus to the cell on the stage of adsorption was also significantly affected by the exposure time and the concentration of applied photosensitizers. A distinct inhibition was evaluated for ZnPcMe at the viral replication stage, which demonstrated a high photoinactivation index (PII = 33.0). This study suggested the high efficacy of PDI with phthalocyanines on HSV-1 virus, with full inhibition caused by the mechanism of singlet oxygen generation. These promising data are a good basis for further investigations on the PDI application against pathogenic viruses."
"Thyroid disorders have significant clinical sequelae, including impaired growth in children, metabolic abnormalities, and impaired cognitive function. However, available studies on burden of thyroid diseases in people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), particularly its prevalence and its interaction with HIV related factors (like CD4 count), are controversial. This review aimed to provide a comprehensive summary and analysis on the extent of thyroid dysfunctions in this population."
"No study has validated questionnaires for assessing easily calculable diet quality scores in Japan. The Brief-type self-administered Diet History Questionnaire (BDHQ) is widely used to assess dietary intake in Japan, while the Meal-based Diet History Questionnaire (MDHQ) assesses dietary intake for each meal (breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks) and overall dietary intake. This study examined the relative validity of the BDHQ and MDHQ for assessing three diet quality scores in Japanese adults. A total of 111 women and 111 men aged 30-76 years completed the web MDHQ and BDHQ, followed by 4-non-consective-day weighed dietary records. The diet quality scores examined included the Diet Quality Score for Japanese (DQSJ), Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score and Alternate Mediterranean Diet (AMED) score. The means of the three scores for overall diet from the BDHQ were not significantly different from those from the dietary records in both sexes, whereas those from the MDHQ were higher than those from the dietary records, except for the DASH and AMED in women. Pearson's correlation coefficients between both questionnaires and dietary records were 0·57-0·63 for DQSJ, 0·49-0·57 for DASH and 0·31-0·49 for AMED across both sexes and both questionnaires. For each meal, Pearson's correlation coefficients between the MDHQ and dietary records ranged from 0·01 (DASH for snacks in women) to 0·55 (DQSJ for breakfast in men), with a median of 0·35. This study showed that the ability of the BDHQ and MDHQ to rank individuals was good for DQSJ and DASH and acceptable for AMED."

Our objective is to inspire innovation and contribute to the establishment of novel, efficient, and scalable synthetic approaches, thereby advancing the frontiers of pharmaceutical research and development."
"Brain inflammation, with an increased density of microglia and macrophages, is an important component of Alzheimer's disease and a potential therapeutic target. However, it is incompletely characterized, particularly in patients whose disease begins before the age of 65 years and, thus, have few co-pathologies. Inflammation has been usefully imaged with translocator protein (TSPO) PET, but most inflammation PET tracers cannot image subjects with a low-binder TSPO rs6971 genotype. In an important development, participants with any TSPO genotype can be imaged with a novel tracer, 11C-ER176, that has a high binding potential and a more favourable metabolite profile than other TSPO tracers currently available. We applied 11C-ER176 to detect brain inflammation in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) caused by early-onset Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, we sought to correlate the brain localization of inflammation, volume loss, elevated amyloid-β (Aβ)and tau. We studied brain inflammation in 25 patients with early-onset amnestic MCI (average age 59 ± 4.5 years, 10 female) and 23 healthy controls (average age 65 ± 6.0 years, 12 female), both groups with a similar proportion of all three TSPO-binding affinities. 11C-ER176 total distribution volume (VT), obtained with an arterial input function, was compared across patients and controls using voxel-wise and region-wise analyses. In addition to inflammation PET, most MCI patients had Aβ (n = 23) and tau PET (n = 21). For Aβ and tau tracers, standard uptake value ratios were calculated using cerebellar grey matter as region of reference. Regional correlations among the three tracers were determined. Data were corrected for partial volume effect. Cognitive performance was studied with standard neuropsychological tools. In MCI caused by early-onset Alzheimer's disease, there was inflammation in the default network, reaching statistical significance in precuneus and lateral temporal and parietal association cortex bilaterally, and in the right amygdala. Topographically, inflammation co-localized most strongly with tau (r = 0.63 ± 0.24). This correlation was higher than the co-localization of Aβ with tau (r = 0.55 ± 0.25) and of inflammation with Aβ (0.43 ± 0.22). Inflammation co-localized least with atrophy (-0.29 ± 0.26). These regional correlations could be detected in participants with any of the three rs6971 TSPO polymorphisms. Inflammation in Alzheimer's disease-related regions correlated with impaired cognitive scores. Our data highlight the importance of inflammation, a potential therapeutic target, in the Alzheimer's disease process. Furthermore, they support the notion that, as shown in experimental tissue and animal models, the propagation of tau in humans is associated with brain inflammation."
"The pathogenesis of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) remains unclear due to the complexity of its etiology. The emerging field of the epitranscriptome has shown significant promise in advancing the understanding of disease pathogenesis and developing new therapeutic approaches. Recent research has demonstrated that N4-acetylcytosine (ac4C), an RNA modification within the epitranscriptome, is implicated in progression of various diseases. However, the role of ac4C modification in MASLD remains unexplored. Herein, we performed acRIP-ac4c-seq and RNA-seq analysis in free fatty acids-induced MASLD model cells, identifying 2128 differentially acetylated ac4C sites, with 1031 hyperacetylated and 1097 hypoacetylated peaks in MASLD model cells. Functional enrichments analysis showed that ac4C differentially modified genes were significantly involved in processes related to MASLD, such as nuclear transport and MAP kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. We also identified 341 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including 61 lncRNAs and 280 mRNAs, between control and MASLD model cells. Bioinformatics analysis showed that DEGs were significantly enriched in long-chain fatty acid biosynthetic process. Notably, 118 genes exhibited significant changes in both ac4C modification and expression levels in MASLD model cells. Among these proteins, JUN, caveolin-1 (CAV1), fatty acid synthase (FASN), and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNPA1) were identified as core proteins through protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis using cytoscape software. Collectively, our findings establish a positive correlation between ac4C modification and the pathogenesis of MASLD and suggest that ac4C modification may serve as a therapeutic target for MASLD."
"Despite numerous surveys on traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) and their impact on people in Taiwan, only a few directly assessed the perspectives of the users and their experiences with the practice. In this study, we aimed to explore the attitudes, experiences, and understanding of TCMs, and also to identify the TCMs that are commonly preferred among people in Taiwan."
"Single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics enable unprecedented insight into cellular and molecular pathways implicated in human skin aging and regeneration. Senescent cells are individual cells that are irreversibly cell cycle arrested and can accumulate across the human lifespan due to cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic stressors. With an atlas of single-cell RNA-sequencing and spatial transcriptomics, epidermal and dermal senescence and its effects were investigated, with a focus on melanocytes and fibroblasts. Photoaging due to ultraviolet light exposure was associated with higher burdens of senescent cells, a sign of biological aging, compared to chronological aging. A skin-specific cellular senescence gene set, termed SenSkin™, was curated and confirmed to be elevated in the context of photoaging, chronological aging, and non-replicating CDKN1A+ (p21) cells. In the epidermis, senescent melanocytes were associated with elevated melanin synthesis, suggesting haphazard pigmentation, while in the dermis, senescent reticular dermal fibroblasts were associated with decreased collagen and elastic fiber synthesis. Spatial analysis revealed the tendency for senescent cells to cluster, particularly in photoaged skin. This work proposes a strategy for characterizing age-related skin dysfunction through the lens of cellular senescence and suggests a role for senescent epidermal cells (i.e., melanocytes) and senescent dermal cells (i.e., reticular dermal fibroblasts) in age-related skin sequelae."
"Experimental and clinical studies have suggested atherosclerotic effects of uric acid (UA) on vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Nitroglycerine-induced vasodilation (NID), a control test for flow-mediated vasodilation, can be used as a possible marker of VSMC dysfunction. However, there is little information on the association between UA and NID. Therefore, we investigated the association between serum UA levels and NID according to sex. We measured NID of the brachial artery in 598 women (mean age: 66.2 ± 12.0 years) and 1008 men (mean age: 59.0 ± 18.0 years). In women, the mean serum UA level was 5.06 ± 1.24 mg/dL. Serum UA levels were negatively correlated with NID (p < 0.001), and NID significantly decreased with increasing serum UA levels (≤4.0 mg/dL, 13.4 ± 6.4%; 4.0 to ≤5.0 mg/dL, 11.4 ± 5.3%; 5.0 to ≤6.0 mg/dL, 10.8 ± 5.7%; >6.0 mg/dL, 9.7 ± 5.7%; p < 0.001). The prevalence of VSMC dysfunction, defined as NID < 8.4%, the division points for the lowest and middle tertiles of NID in women, increased with increasing serum UA levels ( ≤ 4.0 mg/dL, 23.3%; 4.0 to ≤5.0 mg/dL, 30.9%; 5.0 to ≤6.0 mg/dL, 36.4%; >6.0 mg/dL, 44.6%; p < 0.001). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed a significant association between serum UA levels and VSMC dysfunction (odds ratio, 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.02─1.43; p = 0.03). There was no interaction between age (<50 or ≥50 years) and the effect of serum UA levels on VSMC dysfunction (p interaction = 0.88). In contrast, no association was observed between serum UA levels and NID in men. Serum UA levels were significantly associated with VSMC dysfunction as assessed by NID in women."
"This study presents a comprehensive methodology for the synthesis, characterization, and evaluation of selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) for their anthelmintic properties against Trichinella spiralis. SeNPs were synthesized via a chemical reduction method, with a color change from clear white to brownish-red indicating nanoparticle formation. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis revealed broad peaks at 2θ ranges of 20-33° and 48-58°, confirming the semi-crystalline nature of the nanoparticles. UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy identified a characteristic peak at around 295 nm. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) showed spherical, monodispersed SeNPs with smooth surfaces, ranging from 30 to 106 nm in size, with an average diameter of 69 nm. Forty-two male rats were divided into six groups, including healthy controls and T. spiralis-infected rats treated with varying doses of SeNPs. Body and organ weight indexes were assessed at the start, during the intestinal and muscular phases. Significant body weight increases were observed during the intestinal phase, particularly in the positive control group. Organ weight analysis showed a significant decrease in liver weight in the high-dose SeNP group compared to controls. SeNP treatment significantly reduced the number of adult worms in the intestines and encysted larvae in muscles. The high-dose group reduced adult worms and encysted larvae more than the low-dose group. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed morphological alterations in adult T. spiralis worms, including wrinkled architecture, torn cuticles, and severe sloughing in high-dose treated worms. During the muscular phase, significant decreases in hemoglobin and red blood cell count were observed in the positive control group, while SeNP treatment restored these levels. Liver enzyme activities (AST, ALT, and ALP) were elevated in infected untreated groups but were enhanced with SeNP treatment. Antioxidant enzyme activities (CAT, and SOD) increased in SeNP-treated groups, with higher doses showing greater efficacy in reducing oxidative stress markers (MDA) and inflammatory markers (TNF-α, and IL-6). Histological analysis showed significant restoration of normal intestinal architecture in high-dose SeNP-treated infected rats, including the reduction of villus atrophy and leukocyte infiltration. In diaphragm muscles, high-dose SeNP treatment minimized encysted larval deposition and restored normal muscle architecture. We can conclude that the study demonstrates the potential of SeNPs as an effective anthelmintic agent against T. spiralis, highlighting their synthesis, characterization, and therapeutic efficacy."

"EGFR-TKIs are effective therapies for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with EGFR-activating mutations. However, responses vary within individuals and resistant disease inevitably emerges. A prospective cohort of 130 patients with advanced EGFR mutation NSCLC were enrolled. Pre-and post-treatment plasma from subjects treated with EGFR-TKIs were obtained. The correlation between EGFR mutation abundance using the Idylla™ ctEGFR mutation assay, radiographic assessment, and clinical outcomes were analyzed. Eighty-nine patients with retrieved blood collection were analyzed. Undetectable ctEGFR (49.5%), detectable ctEGFR CqMut-high (23.5%), and detectable ctEGFR CqMut low (27%) using CqMut cutoff at 28.1, represented consecutive incremental tumor burden by radiographic assessment and outcome of treatment. Median PFS was 13.4 months [95% CI 12.0-14.8] in undetectable ctEGFR, 10.4 months [95% CI 9.9-10.9] in ctEGFR CqMut-high, and 5.9 months [95% CI 3.8-7.4] in ctEGFR CqMut-low. Number of metastasis sites > 3 was found in 22.7%, 23.8%, and 58.3% of the 3-tier ctEGFR tumor burden levels, respectively (p-value 0.01). Presence of liver metastasis was significantly correlated with number of metastasis sites > 3 and ctEGFR CqMut-low (45.8%). Liver metastasis was an independent factor of reduced PFS and OS by multivariate analysis with an HR = 2.41 [95% CI 1.27-4.60, p-value 0.007]) and HR = 2.96 [95% CI 1.35-6.51, p-value 0.007], respectively. The pretreatment ctEGFR detection using the Idylla™ ctEGFR mutation assay served as a surrogate marker for tumor abundance and tumor burden. Presence of liver metastasis was found to be a clinical predictor associated with high tumor abundance and worsening treatment outcomes."

"Job satisfaction is a vital factor associated with better physical health and subjective well-being among social workers. This study aims to explore the job satisfaction of social workers from China's Mainland and Macao and the role of attitudinal professionalism on regional differences. A cross-sectional survey collected data from 292 social workers in Mainland and 108 from Macao one year after the outbreak of COVID-19; 72 percent were female, less than half were married (44.8 percent), the average age was 32.64 years old, and the average working time was 6.07 years. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, independent t tests, and mediation analysis. Results indicated that Mainland social workers reported a significantly higher level of job satisfaction and attitudinal professionalism than Macao social workers. Moreover, attitudinal professionalism helped explain the regional difference in job satisfaction. The evidence from this study highlights the need to nurture professional beliefs and values among social workers, especially for Macao social workers, and also underscores the importance of developing continuing education programs to enhance social workers' identification with and commitment to the profession. We also need to improve financial compensation and social status for Mainland social workers to sustain their professionalism."

"Minimally invasive cardiac surgery for mitral regurgitation is challenging in patients with narrow chests due to limited thoracic space. The butterfly technique can prevent systolic anterior motion in patients with degenerative mitral regurgitation and redundant posterior leaflets, but it is difficult to perform via minimally invasive cardiac surgery. Few reports have described mitral valve repair using the butterfly technique or in a narrow chest. This case report demonstrates the feasibility and utility of robotically assisted mitral valve repair using the butterfly technique in a patient with a narrow chest, addressing the challenges involved through innovative port insertion and visualization."
"In this study, we explore the interactions between melittin, a cationic antimicrobial peptide, and model lipid membranes composed of the negatively charged phospholipids 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (DMPG) and 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine (DMPS). Using the Langmuir monolayer technique and atomic force microscopy (AFM), we reveal novel insights into these interactions. Our key finding is the observation of the ripple phase in the DMPS bilayer on mica, a phenomenon not previously reported for negatively charged single bilayers. This discovery is significant given the critical role of phosphatidylserine (PS) in cancer biology and the potential of melittin as an anticancer agent. We also highlight the importance of subphase composition, as melittin interacts preferentially with lipids in the liquid-condensed phase; thus, selecting the appropriate subphase composition is crucial because it affects lipid behavior and consequently melittin interactions. Our results show that melittin incorporates into lipid monolayers in both liquid-expanded and liquid-condensed phases, enhancing membrane fluidity and disorder, but is expelled from DMPS in the solid phase. AFM imaging further reveals that melittin induces substantial structural changes in the DMPG membrane and forms the ripple phase in the DMPS bilayers. Despite these alterations, melittin does not cause pore formation or membrane rupture, suggesting strong electrostatic adsorption on the membrane surface that prevents penetration. These findings highlight the differential impacts of melittin on lipid monolayers and bilayers and underscore its potential for interacting with membranes without causing disruption."
"Obtaining a full understanding of the anatomical structure of the eyeball and the contents within the eye plays a crucial role in learning eye diseases. However, it can be challenging for beginners to quickly learn, memorize, and apply this anatomical knowledge.

"There is ample research discussing the benefits of a pacifier-activated music system with preterm and high-risk infants. Benefits include improving the quality of nonnutritive sucking (NNS) and increased feeding volume/attempts/endurance, which lead to decreased time to full oral feedings and shortened hospital stays. The use of pacifier-activated music systems supports a faster transition to oral feeding in preterm infants while learning to breastfeed or bottle feed in the NICU. When coupling pacifier-activated music systems with the NNS of a pacifier, the preterm infant gains efficacy in feeding strength and endurance. Benefits also include faster nipple feeding success, mother/infant stress reduction, fewer rehospitalizations, diminished length of stay, and other long-term benefits. This article will discuss how the benefits of using music in the NICU are widespread and should be implemented as a multidisciplinary approach in a variety of NICU settings. Several NICU patient populations can benefit from music using a music pacifier system dependent on the modes used."
"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is widespread, under-recognized, and under-treated, impacting the health and quality of life for millions. The current gold standard for sleep apnea testing is based on the in-lab sleep study, which is costly, cumbersome, not readily available and represents a well-known roadblock to managing this huge societal burden. Assessment of neuromuscular function involved in the upper airway using electromyography (EMG) has shown potential to characterize and diagnose sleep apnea, while the development of transmembranous electromyography (tmEMG), a painless surface probe, has made this opportunity practical and highly feasible. However, experience and ability to interpret electrical signals from the upper airway are scarce, and much of the pertinent information within the signal is likely difficult to detect visually. To overcome this issue, we explored the use of transformers, a deep learning (DL) model architecture with attention mechanisms, to model tmEMG data and distinguish between electromyographic signals from a cohort of control, neurogenic, and sleep apnea patients. Our approach involved three strategies to train a generalizable model on a relatively small dataset including, (1) transfer learning using an audio spectral transformer (AST), (2) the use of 6,000 simulated EMG recordings, converted to spectrograms and using standard backpropagation for fine-tuning, and (3) application of regularization to prevent overfitting and enhance generalizability. This DL approach was tested using 177 transoral EMG recordings from a prior study's database that included six healthy controls, five moderate to severe OSA patients, and five amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients with evidence of bulbar involvement (neurogenic injury). Sensitivity and specificity for classifying neurogenic cases from controls were 98% and 73%, respectively, while classifying OSA from controls were 88% and 64%, respectively. Notably, by averaging the predicted probabilities of each segment for individual patients, the model correctly classified up to 82% of control and OSA patients. These results not only suggest a potential to diagnose OSA patients accurately, but also to identify OSA endotypes that involve neuromuscular pathology, which has major implications for clinical management, patient outcomes, and research."
"Adequate nurse staffing is crucial for quality healthcare, necessitating accurate predictions of patient arrival rates. These forecasts can be determined using supervised machine learning methods. Optimization of machine learning methods is largely about minimizing the prediction error. Existing models primarily utilize data such as historical patient visits, seasonal trends, holidays, and calendars. However, it is unclear what other features reduce the prediction error. Our systematic literature review identifies studies that use supervised machine learning to predict patient arrival numbers using nontemporal features, which are features not based on time or dates. We scrutinized 26 284 studies, eventually focusing on 27 relevant ones. These studies highlight three main feature groups: weather data, internet search and usage data, and data on (social) interaction of groups. Internet data and social interaction data appear particularly promising, with some studies reporting reduced errors by up to 33%. Although weather data are frequently used, its utility is less clear. Other potential data sources, including smartphone and social media data, remain largely unexplored. One reason for this might be potential data privacy challenges. In summary, although patient arrival prediction has become more important in recent years, there are still many questions and opportunities for future research on the features used in this area."

"BACKGROUND Primary cutaneous lymphomas (PCL) are a multifaceted spectrum of cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL) and cutaneous B cell lymphomas (CBCL). Mycosis fungoides (MF) is a rare subset of CTCL that primarily affects adults, and its occurrence in children is exceedingly rare. Most pediatric MF manifests as hypopigmented patches resembling other benign dermatoses, causing diagnostic challenges. This report outlines a case of pediatric MF in a 7-year-old Malaysian boy. CASE REPORT A 7-year-old boy exhibited progressing skin lesions characterized initially by erythematous, papular rashes over the face and upper limbs, then to the whole body, becoming hypopigmented, with pruritus and scaling for 1 year. Multiple clinics treated him for eczema and pityriasis alba but he responded poorly to courses of various topical steroids and emollient treatment. Due to the refractory nature of the lesions, he was subsequently referred to a dermatology clinic, where 2 skin biopsies were performed. The first biopsy revealed epidermotropism of atypical lymphocytes, consistent with MF. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed positive CD3+ expression with slightly reduced CD4+, CD7+, and CD8+ expression, and normal CD2+ and CD5+ expression at the epidermis level. Nevertheless, due to the rarity of MF in children, a second biopsy was performed, validating the diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS Pediatric MF is a rare and challenging diagnosis. This case report highlights the importance of close monitoring of unresolved hypopigmented lesions and increased vigilance on lesions not responding to standard treatment. Timely diagnosis with support of skin biopsy is crucial to avoid potentially serious disease progression and helps provide appropriate management leading to improved outcomes."
"Precontoured cancellous allograft wedges have gained popularity in foot and ankle procedures in recent years because of their ease of use and ability to decrease operative time.

"The Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Database (dbSNP), established in 1998 by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), has been a critical resource in genomics for cataloging small genetic variations. Originally focused on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), dbSNP has since expanded to include a variety of genetic variants, playing a key role in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), population genetics, pharmacogenomics, and cancer research. Over 25 years, dbSNP has grown to include more than 4.4 billion submitted SNPs and 1.1 billion unique reference SNPs, providing essential data for identifying disease-related genetic variants and studying human diversity. Integrating large-scale projects like 1000 Genomes, gnomAD, TOPMed, and ALFA has expanded dbSNP's catalog of human genetic variation, increasing its usefulness for research and clinical applications. Keeping up with advancements such as next-generation sequencing and cloud-based infrastructure, dbSNP remains a cornerstone of genetic research supporting continued discoveries in precision medicine and population genomics.

"Partial-thickness rotator cuff tears (PTRCTs) are a common source of shoulder pathology, both in the aging population and in younger overhead athletes. Advanced imaging modalities used currently have led to increases in recognition, diagnosis, and treatment of these tears. The anatomy, five-layer histology, and relationship to the Ellman classification of PTRCTs have been well studied, with recent interest in radiographic predictors, such as the critical shoulder angle and acromial index. Almost all PTRCTs should be managed nonsurgically initially. If nonsurgical management is unsuccessful, the surgical options are either arthroscopic débridement with or without acromioplasty if the tear thickness is less than 50%, or arthroscopic conversion repair or in situ repair if the tear thickness is greater than 50%. The biologic augmentation of PTRCTs is promising, with leukocyte-poor platelet-rich plasma having the most robust supporting data. Mesenchymal signaling cell biologics and the variety of scaffold onlay augments have been receiving increased attention in clinical practice but require more rigorous studies before widespread usage."

"Following maternal COVID-19 vaccination, the persistence of antibodies in sera and breast milk for mothers and infants is not well characterized. We sought to describe the persistence of antibodies through 2 months after delivery in maternal and infant serum and breast milk following maternal COVID-19 mRNA vaccination and to examine differences by receipt of booster dose during pregnancy or postpartum."
"The brain is protected from invading pathogens by the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the innate immune system. Pattern recognition receptors play a crucial role in detecting bacteria and initiating the innate immune response. Among these are G-protein-coupled formyl peptide receptors (FPR), which are expressed by immune cells in the central nervous system. In this study, we investigated the influence of the FPR ligand Ac2-26 on the integrity of the BBB during pneumococcal meningitis."
"Selective C-H activation on complex biological macromolecules is a key goal in the field of organic chemistry. It requires thermodynamically challenging chemical transformations to be delivered under mild, aqueous conditions. 5-Methylcytosine (5mC) is a fundamentally important epigenetic modification in DNA that has major implications for biology and has emerged as a vital biomarker. Selective functionalisation of 5mC would enable new chemical approaches to tag, detect and map DNA methylation to enhance the study and exploitation of this epigenetic feature. We demonstrate the first example of direct and selective chemical oxidation of 5mC to 5-formylcytosine (5fC) in DNA, employing a photocatalytic system. This transformation was used to selectively tag 5mC. We also provide proof-of-concept for deploying this chemistry for single-base resolution sequencing of 5mC and genetic bases adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), thymine (T) in DNA on a next-generation sequencing system. This work exemplifies how photocatalysis has the potential to transform the analysis of DNA."

"Type 2 diabetes, characterized by hyperglycemia, is closely linked to obesity and low-grade inflammation. Acute cocoa flavanols (CF) intake has demonstrated benefits in vasoreactivity, cognitive functions, and antioxidant enzyme activity. However, the physiological mechanisms of CF concerning glucose uptake, inflammatory mediators, and their interplay with aerobic exercise remain unclear in populations with metabolic diseases."
"Indoor air pollution (IAP) is the major contributor (26%) to TB, in addition to other socioeconomic and environmental factors. It occurs in most developing countries like India, where people rely on the combustion of biomass-based solid fuels (low combustion efficiency and high pollution emissions) due to the prevailing socio-economic conditions. However, this cause-and-effect relationship between TB and IAP has not been studied much. The current study tries to bridge the gap and analyze the cause-effect relationship to come up with concrete remedies for its minimization and help secure the holy grail of TB-free India."
"Pain management is often suboptimal in individuals with dementia, and their family caregivers are tasked with supporting pain management despite limited preparation.

"This study was an original article, mainly aimed to explore the influence of nutritional guidance during pregnancy on nutritional status and pregnancy outcome of pregnant women. Two hundred (200) pregnant women were admitted to the Nanjing General Hospital of Nanjing Military Command from May 2021 to May 2023. They were randomly sub-divided into a control group and an intervention group. Each group had 100 cases. The control group received routine guidance, while the intervention group received personalized nutrition guidance based on standards from the routine guidance protocol. The results showed that in comparison with the control group, the intervention group presented higher calcium, protein, folate, sodium, iron, vitamin and zinc levels, lower fat levels, lower incidence of adverse birth outcomes, lower incidence of adverse neonatal status, higher fetal body weight and Apgar score higher satisfaction rate, and lower incidence of complications during pregnancy. We conclude that reasonable intake of nutrition during pregnancy can meet the nutritional needs of pregnant women and fetuses, improve pregnancy safety, improve delivery and newborn conditions, reduce the occurrence of pregnancy complications, and improve the satisfaction of pregnant women."
"Accurate detection of abnormal cervical cells in cervical cancer screening increases the chances of timely treatment. The vigorous development of deep learning methods has established a new ecosystem for cervical cancer screening, which has been proven to effectively improve efficiency and accuracy of cell detection in many studies. Although many contributing studies have been conducted, limited public datasets and time-consuming collection efforts may hinder the generalization performance of those advanced models and restrict further research. Through this work, we seek to provide a large dataset of cervical cytology images with exhaustive annotations of abnormal cervical cells. The dataset consists of 8,037 images derived from 129 scanned Thinprep cytologic test (TCT) slide images. Furthermore, we performed evaluation experiments to demonstrate the performance of representative models trained on our dataset in abnormal cells detection."
"E3 ubiquitin ligases have been linked to developmental diseases including autism, Angelman syndrome (UBE3A), and Johanson-Blizzard syndrome (JBS) (UBR1). Here, we report variants in the E3 ligase UBR5 in 29 individuals presenting with a neurodevelopmental syndrome that includes developmental delay, autism, intellectual disability, epilepsy, movement disorders, and/or genital anomalies. Their phenotype is distinct from JBS due to the absence of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and the presence of autism, epilepsy, and, in some probands, a movement disorder. E3 ubiquitin ligases are responsible for transferring ubiquitin to substrate proteins to regulate a variety of cellular functions, including protein degradation, protein-protein interactions, and protein localization. Knocking out ubr-5 in C. elegans resulted in a lower movement score compared to the wild type, supporting a role for UBR5 in neurodevelopment. Using an in vitro autoubiquitination assay and confocal microscopy for the human protein, we found decreased ubiquitination activity and altered cellular localization in several variants found in our cohort compared to the wild type. In conclusion, we found that variants in UBR5 cause a neurodevelopmental syndrome that can be associated with a movement disorder, reinforcing the role of the UBR protein family in a neurodevelopmental disease that differs from previously described ubiquitin-ligase-related syndromes. We also provide evidence for the pathogenic potential loss of UBR5 function with functional experiments in C. elegans and in vitro ubiquitination assays."
"Due to the high mortality and hospitalization rate in chronic heart failure (HF), it is of great significance to study myocardial nutrition conditions. Amino acids (AAs) are essential nutrient metabolites for cell development and survival. This study aims to investigate the associations and prognostic value of plasma branched-chain amino acid/aromatic amino acid ratio (Fischer's ratio, FR) in patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 50%."
"This study uses Texas's 2017 integration of the state disability and mental health agencies as a case study, combining interviews with Texas agency and advocacy organization leaders to examine perceptions of agency integration and augmented synthetic control analyses of 2014-2020 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey to examine impacts on mental health service use among individuals with co-occurring cognitive disabilities (including intellectual and developmental disabilities) and mental health conditions. Interviewees described the intensive process of agency integration and identified primarily positive (e.g., decreased administrative burden) impacts of integration. Quantitative analyses indicated no effects of integration on receipt of mental health-related services among people with co-occurring conditions. While leaders identified some potentially beneficial impacts of state agency integration, the limited impact of integration beyond the agency suggests that interventions at multiple levels of the service system, including those targeting providers, are needed to better meet the mental health service needs for this population."
"The rapid and selective identification of microorganisms is of great significance for clinical therapy applications. To develop high performance probes for microbe determination, we systemically constructed series aggregation-induced emission (AIE) luminogens by modulating the structural planarity, the basicity of functional group, the length of linker moiety and the hydrophobicity based on our previous work. The detail structure-property relationship study based on experimental and theoretical observation revealed that: i) the planar skeleton is essential for probe insertion towards the cell wall via van n der Waals' force. ii) the basic function group enable the anchoring on the membrane by binding with acidic biomolecules. iii) the shortened alkyl chain is in favor of the efficient binding of basic groups with microbes and endows the desirable hydrophobicity. Based on the developed probes, the successful detection of the pathogens in clinic samples was achieved in highly sensitive and simple way. This work provides a reliable strategy for designing intelligent luminogens for microorganism discrimination and identification in efficient and sensitive way for in vitro diagnosis applications, especially point-of-care testing (POCT)."
"Event-based surveillance is crucial for the early detection and rapid response to potential public health risks. In recent years, social networking services (SNS) have been recognized for their potential role in this domain. Previous studies have demonstrated the capacity of SNS posts for the early detection of health crises and affected individuals, including those related to infectious diseases. However, the reliability of such posts, being subjective and not clinically diagnosed, remains a challenge. In this study, we address this issue by assessing the classification performance of transformer-based pretrained language models to accurately classify Japanese tweets related to heat stroke, a significant health effect of climate change, as true or false. We also evaluated the efficacy of combining SNS and artificial intelligence for event-based public health surveillance by visualizing the data on correctly classified tweets and heat stroke emergency medical evacuees in time-space and animated video, respectively. The transformer-based pretrained language models exhibited good performance in classifying the tweets. Spatiotemporal and animated video visualizations revealed a reasonable correlation. This study demonstrates the potential of using Japanese tweets and deep learning algorithms based on transformer networks for event-based surveillance at high spatiotemporal levels to enable early detection of heat stroke risks."
"Robot-assisted pancreaticobiliary junction resection is a surgical technique employed to treat benign duodenal tumors. The procedure involves several key steps: making a longitudinal incision in the duodenum, excising the tumor at the pancreaticobiliary junction, inserting a biliary stent, connecting the biliary and duodenal mucosa, and suturing the duodenal incision during phase I. The robotic system enhances visibility, facilitates precise operations, minimizes duodenal traction injuries to the duodenum and surgical trauma, ensures accurate suture and fixation of bile duct stents, connects the bile duct and duodenal mucosa and reduces postoperative recovery time. Given the complexity of the operation and the associated risk of postoperative duodenal fistula, a thorough preoperative evaluation and meticulous perioperative preparation are crucial. Prior to the procedure, a comprehensive assessment was conducted, integrating the patient's medical history, family history, serological tests, and imaging studies. Special emphasis was placed on determining the benign or malignant nature of the tumor and evaluating the status of the duodenal artery blood supply network to ascertain the feasibility and efficacy of the surgery. During the operation, efforts were made to minimize duodenal trauma and avoid compromising the duodenal artery blood supply network. Additionally, the use of bile duct stents was considered essential to prevent biliary strictures, facilitate bile discharge, and mitigate biliary complications. Postoperatively, real-time monitoring of amylase and jaundice indicators in drainage fluid informed the timely removal of drainage tubes in accordance with the enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocol. Subsequent follow-up indicated a successful recovery, characterized by a notable reduction in preoperative abdominal pain, the absence of long-term complications, and no evidence of tumor recurrence. Consequently, robot-assisted pancreaticobiliary junction resection demonstrates a safe and effective surgical approach for the treatment of benign duodenal tumors."
"The aim of the study was to investigate the effectiveness of radial and focus (extracorporeal shock wave therapy) ESWT treatment on pain, function and size of the calcaneal spur in patients with clinical and radiological diagnosis of plantar fasciitis. A total of 112 patients aged between 18 and 95 years, were divided into 2 groups; group 1, rESWT (2.4 bar 12 hz 2000 beats), group 2 received fESWT (0.14 bar 14 hz 1000 beats) 3 times a week for 3 weeks. All patients were evaluated using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS)-pain and Foot Function Index before and after the treatment, at 4 week and 12 weeks. Calcaneal spur size was measured radiographically in the patients before and after the treatment at the 12th week follow-up. According to our records, VAS scores were found to be similar between the groups before treatment and at follow-ups (all p > .05). In both groups, a significant decrease in VAS scores was found in the follow-ups compared to before treatment (p < .001). FFI total, pain, activity and disability scores were found to be similar between the groups before treatment and at follow-up (all p > .05). In both groups, a significant decrease in Foot Function Index scores was found in the follow-ups compared to before treatment (p < .001). Both of rESWT and fESWT were effective in plantar fasciitis treatment there were no significant difference between 2 modalities in long term."
"Individuals with certain primary immunodeficiency disorders (PID) may be unable to clear poliovirus infection after exposure to oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV). Over time, vaccine-related strains can revert to immunodeficiency-associated vaccine-derived poliovirus (iVDPVs) that can cause paralysis in the patient and potentially spread in communities with low immunity. We reviewed the efforts for detection and management of PID patients with iVDPV infections and the epidemiology through an analysis of 184 cases reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) during 1962-2024 and a review of polio program and literature reports. Most iVDPV patients (79%) reported in the WHO Registry were residents in middle-income countries and almost half (48%) in the Eastern Mediterranean Region. Type 2 iVDPV was most frequently isolated (53%), but a sharp decline was observed after the switch to bivalent OPV in 2016, with only six cases reported during 2017-2024 compared to 63 during 2009-2016. Patients with common variable immunodeficiency have longer excretion of iVDPV than with other PID types. Implementation of sensitive sentinel surveillance to detect cases of iVDPV infection in high-risk countries and offer antiviral treatment to patients is challenged by competition with other health priorities and regulatory hurdles to the compassionate use of investigational antiviral drugs."
"Lysosomal acid lipase deficiency (LAL-D) is an ultra-rare lysosomal storage disease with two distinct phenotypes, an infantile-onset form (formerly Wolman disease) and a later-onset form (formerly cholesteryl ester storage disease). The objective of this narrative review is to examine the most important aspects of the diagnosis and treatment of LAL-D and to provide practical expert recommendations. The infantile-onset form occurs in the first weeks of life and is characterized by malnourishment and failure to thrive due to gastrointestinal impairment (vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption), as well as systemic inflammation, hepatosplenomegaly, and adrenal calcifications. Mortality is close to 100% before one year of life in the absence of specific treatment. The later-onset form can be diagnosed in childhood or adulthood and is characterized by chronic liver injury and/or lipid profile alterations. When LAL-D is suspected, enzyme activity should be determined to confirm the diagnosis, with analysis from a dried blood spot sample being the quickest and most reliable method. In infantile-onset LAL-D, the initiation of enzyme replacement therapy (sebelipase α) and careful nutritional management with a low-lipid diet is very urgent, as prognosis is directly linked to the early initiation of specific treatment. In recent years, our knowledge of the management of LAL-D has increased considerably, with improvements regarding the initial enzyme replacement therapy dose and careful nutritional treatment with a low-lipid diet to decrease lipid deposition and systemic inflammation, leading to better outcomes. In this narrative review we offer a quick guide for the initial management of infantile-onset LAL-D."
"Participatory design places a strong emphasis on human agency, user perspectives and democratic ideals of inclusivity and empowerment, and is therefore often associated with humanist principles and values. In contrast, critical posthumanism questions key humanist assumptions about the centred and singular nature of the 'human condition'. Instead, posthumanism points to the evolving and diverse lived experiences of people and how these are transformed by (and are transforming of) culture, environment and technology. In this commentary, we explore how participatory design could benefit from a posthumanist perspective that more explicitly acknowledges the entangled and interconnected nature of our technologised lives."
"Genicular nerve radiofrequency ablation (GNRFA) is an emerging procedure used to relieve pain from severe knee osteoarthritis. While there have been rare reports of significant complications, their incidence has not been well established. The objective of this study was to examine complication rates at 30 and 90 days post treatment as well as characterize opioid-prescribing patterns before and after treatment."
"How many species of life are there on Earth? This is a question that we want to know but cannot yet answer. Some scholars speculate that the number of species may reach 2.2 billion when considering cryptic diversity and that each morphology-based insect species may contain an average of 3.1 cryptic species. With nearly two million described species, such high estimates of cryptic diversity would suggest that cryptic species are widespread. The development of molecular species delimitation has led to the discovery of a large number of cryptic species, and cryptic biodiversity has gradually entered our field of vision and attracted more attention. This paper introduces the concept of cryptic species, how they evolve, and methods by which they may be discovered and confirmed, and provides theoretical and methodological guidance for the study of hidden species. A workflow of how to confirm cryptic species is provided. In addition, the importance and reliability of multi-evidence-based integrated taxonomy are reaffirmed as a way to better standardize decision-making processes. Special focus on cryptic diversity and increased funding for taxonomy is needed to ensure that cryptic species in hyperdiverse groups are discoverable and described. An increased focus on cryptic species in the future will naturally arise as more difficult groups are studied, and thereby, we may finally better understand the rules governing the evolution and maintenance of cryptic biodiversity."

"Transposable elements (TEs) account for 50% of the human genome and have essential functions as gene promoters. A subset of TEs is expressed in normal cells and differentially expressed in cancers, yet their biological significance is understudied. In a recent article, Tu et al. describe the tumor suppressive function of POGK, an expressed TE with a KRAB domain, and its cooperation with TRIM28 to repress ribosomal gene transcription in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)."
"Type II CRISPR endonucleases are widely used programmable genome editing tools. Recently, CRISPR-Cas systems with highly compact nucleases have been discovered, including Cas9d (a type II-D nuclease). Here, we report the cryo-EM structures of a Cas9d nuclease (747 amino acids in length) in multiple functional states, revealing a stepwise process of DNA targeting involving a conformational switch in a REC2 domain insertion. Our structures provide insights into the intricately folded guide RNA which acts as a structural scaffold to anchor small, flexible protein domains for DNA recognition. The sgRNA can be truncated by up to ~25% yet still retain activity in vivo. Using ancestral sequence reconstruction, we generated compact nucleases capable of efficient genome editing in mammalian cells. Collectively, our results provide mechanistic insights into the evolution and DNA targeting of diverse type II CRISPR-Cas systems, providing a blueprint for future re-engineering of minimal RNA-guided DNA endonucleases."
"Myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1), a key anti-apoptotic protein within the BCL-2 family, is essential in regulating cell survival, particularly in cancer, where its overexpression is often linked to therapeutic resistance. This review begins with an overview of BCL-2-mediated apoptosis, highlighting the pivotal role of MCL-1 in cellular homeostasis. We then focus on the structure and function of MCL-1, elucidating how its unique structural features contribute to its function and interaction with pro-apoptotic proteins. The core of this review is a detailed structural analysis of selective MCL-1 inhibitors, tracing their development from initial discovery to stepwise optimization. We explore various classes of inhibitors, including those with distinct core structures, covalent inhibitors that reversibly/irreversibly bind to MCL-1, and innovative approaches such as metal-based inhibitors and proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs). The structural evolution of these inhibitors is discussed, with particular emphasis on the modifications that have enhanced their selectivity, potency, and pharmacokinetic profiles. Additionally, we summarize the synergistic potential of MCL-1 inhibitors when used in combination with other therapeutic agents, emphasizing their role in overcoming drug resistance. The review concludes with a discussion of current challenges in MCL-1 modulation and future perspectives, proposing alternative strategies for targeting this critical protein for cancer therapy."
"SSBD (https://ssbd.riken.jp) is a platform for the sharing and reuse of bioimaging data.

This update addresses the conflicting demands of rapid data publication and sharing of richly annotated data, thereby promoting bioimaging data sharing and reuse. With this update, SSBD is now positioned as a core repository and database within the foundingGIDE, an international consortium working to establish a global image data ecosystem. Harmonizing metadata between data resources enables cross-searching and data exchange with data resources from other countries and regions."
"Exposure to phthalates, alone or in mixtures, at different periods of development alters the reproductive function of males and females, especially in rodents, where they have been most studied. This review addressed the most recent data (last 10 years) on exposure to phthalates in different scenarios and how the use of natural products could mitigate the harmful effects caused by exposure at different stages of development."
"The topic of the timing of the manifestation of age-associated diseases (as an indirect indicator of accelerated population aging) after the transfer of COVID-19 remains an urgent area in scientific research. Early targeted diagnosis can significantly reduce the consequences of pathology, in connection with which the features of the manifestation of various nosologies in the post-COVID period were studied. The materials were the accounting and statistical data of the municipal polyclinics of the Sakhalin Region for the pre-COVID (2017-2019) and post-COVID (2022-2023) periods. The median age of newly diagnosed patients and the age-specific incidence index were analyzed for the following nosologies: hypertensive diseases, coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, glaucoma, senile cataracts, and Parkinson's disease. There was a «rejuvenation» of the timing of the manifestation of the disease in the post-COVID period. Meanwhile, the decrease in the median age of disease manifestation was uneven: the most pronounced «rejuvenation» was characteristic of hypertensive diseases, type 2 diabetes mellitus, glaucoma and coronary heart disease. The order of manifestation of the considered nosologies was maintained in both observation periods. This circumstance is confirmed by both the median age of patients and the age-specific incidence index."

"Abortion can be a very stressful experience for women, and many social and psychological factors can influence this stress. The present study aims to investigate the impact of perceived social support on the marital satisfaction of women who have undergone an abortion. The study also explored whether resilience played a mediating role in this relationship. Data were analyzed from the cross-sectional study. The Perceived Social Support (including Social support, friend support, and other support subscales), ENRICH marital satisfaction, and Connor-Davidson Resilience questionnaire were completed by 150 women who had undergone an abortion and were referred to hospitals and clinics of Jahrom University of Medical Sciences from April 2021 to June 2021. The structural equation modeling (SEM) approach was used to obtain the direct and indirect effects of Perceived Social Support subscales and Resilience on marital satisfaction. The study found that the women who participated had high marital satisfaction and social support scores, while their resilience scores were moderate. The results indicated a positive correlation between social support dimensions and marital satisfaction and resilience. The study also revealed that family support (β = 0.41, p < 0.001), other supports (β = 0.46, p < 0.001), and resilience as a mediating variable (β = 0.15, p < 0.001) had a direct and significant positive impact on marital satisfaction. However, none of the three domains of perceived social support showed any indirect significant relationship with marital satisfaction. The study's findings demonstrate that the perception of social support from family members and other individuals can significantly impact the level of satisfaction in a marriage. Appropriate social support can increase resilience and help couples better cope with the stress associated with abortion. This study suggests that educating families, healthcare providers, and other individuals can help women experiencing this issue by providing them with counseling and support. This can ultimately help women maintain their mental and sexual health."
"Previous research suggests that insomnia and depressive symptoms might be causally related. Emotional reactivity and regulation have been proposed to explain the potential causal relationship between insomnia and depression. However, longitudinal evaluations of their mediating effects are limited. Hence, the current study aimed to examine the mediating effects of emotional reactivity and regulation on the longitudinal associations between daily sleep parameters and depressive symptoms over 14 days in individuals with insomnia."
"Immunotherapy that targets immune checkpoints has achieved revolutionary success, but its application in solid tumors remains limited, highlighting the need for reliable enhancement of the efficacy of immunotherapy. Golgi protein 73 (GP73), a Golgi membrane protein, has been implicated in various cellular processes, including immune regulation. Recent studies suggested that GP73 may play a role in modulating the immune response in patients with cancer. In this study, we investigated the mechanism by which GP73 regulates T-cell-mediated antitumor immunity within the tumor microenvironment."
"The aim of this study was to assess the impact of tomato pomace (TP) on the content of volatile compounds and L-carnitine and the sensory characteristics of raw fermented sausages produced with reduced nitrite. The produced sausages were divided into three experimental groups: control sample, sample with 1.5% addition of freeze-dried tomato pomace, and sample with 2.5% addition of TP. The results showed that the addition of tomato pomace significantly affected the quality of raw fermented sausages. Lower L-carnitine content was observed in samples with TP. The main groups of volatile compounds identified in fermented sausages were alcohols, aldehydes, hydrocarbons, and ketones. The addition of TP influenced the smell and taste of the sausages, which were characterized by a more intense tomato taste and smell and more intense red color compared to the control sample. Despite the influence of TP addition on some sensory features, the products were characterized by a high score of overall quality of over 7 c.u. on a 10-point scale, similar to the control sausage."
"Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) remains a serious public health problem worldwide, especially in economically developed regions/countries. This study intends to thoroughly analyze the incidence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) rate of SAH at the global, regional, and national levels.

"Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis (Hpa) is an oomycete pathogen that causes downy mildew disease on Arabidopsis. This obligate biotroph manipulates the homeostasis of its host plant by secreting numerous effector proteins, among which are the RxLR effectors. Identifying the host targets of effectors and understanding how their manipulation facilitates colonization of plants are key to improve plant resistance to pathogens. Here we characterize the interaction between the RxLR effector HaRxL106 and BIM1, an Arabidopsis transcription factor (TF) involved in Brassinosteroid (BR) signaling. We report that HaRxL106 interacts with BIM1 in vitro and in planta. BIM1 is required by the effector to increase the host plant susceptibility to (hemi)biotrophic pathogens, and thus can be regarded as a susceptibility factor. Mechanistically, HaRxL106 requires BIM1 to induce the transcriptional activation of BR-responsive genes and cause alterations in plant growth patterns that phenocopy the shade avoidance syndrome. Our results support previous observations of antagonistic interactions between activation of BR signaling and suppression of plant immune responses and reveal that BIM1, a new player in this crosstalk, is manipulated by the pathogenic effector HaRxL106."

"Parallel analysis of phenotype, transcriptome and antigen receptor sequence in single B cells is a useful method for tracking B cell activation and maturation during immune responses. However, in most cases, the specificity and affinity of the B cell antigen receptor cannot be inferred from its sequence. Antibody cloning and expression from single B cells is then required for functional assays. Here we propose a method that integrates FACS-based 5'-end single-cell RNA sequencing (FB5P-seq) and monoclonal antibody cloning for integrative analysis of single B cells. Starting from a cell suspension, single B cells are FACS-sorted into 96-well plates for reverse transcription, cDNA barcoding and amplification. A fraction of the single-cell cDNA is used for preparing 5'-end RNA-seq libraries that are sequenced for retrieving transcriptome-wide gene expression and paired BCR sequences. The archived cDNA of selected cells of interest is used as input for cloning heavy and light chain variable regions into antibody expression plasmid vectors. The corresponding monoclonal antibodies are produced by transient transfection of a eukaryotic producing cell line and purified for functional assays. We provide detailed step-by-step instructions and describe results obtained on ovalbumin-specific murine germinal center B cells after immunization. Our method is robust, flexible, cost-effective, and applicable to different B cell types and species. We anticipate it will be useful for mapping antigen specificity and affinity of rare B cell subsets characterized by defined gene expression and/or antigen receptor sequence."
"Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide.

"Collagenase digestion (d) and cellular outgrowth (og) are the current modalities of meniscus fibrochondrocytes (MFC) isolation for bioengineering and mechanobiology-related studies. However, the impact of these modalities on study outcomes is unknown. Here, we show that og- and d-isolated MFC have distinct proliferative capacities, transcriptomic profiles via RNA sequencing (RNAseq), extracellular matrix (ECM)-forming, and migratory capacities. Our data indicate that microtissue pellet models developed from og-isolated MFC display a contractile phenotype with higher expressions of alpha-smooth muscle actin (ACTA2) and transgelin (TAGLN) and are mechanically stiffer than their counterparts from d-MFC. Moreover, we introduce a novel method of MFC isolation designated digestion-after-outgrowth (dog). The transcriptomic profile of dog-MFC is distinct from d- and og-MFC, including a higher expression of mechanosensing caveolae-associated caveolin-1 (CAV1). Additionally, dog-MFC were superior chondrogenically and generated larger-size microtissue pellet models containing a higher frequency of smaller collagen fibre diameters. Thus, we demonstrate that the modalities of MFC isolation influence the downstream outcomes of bioengineering and mechanobiology-related studies."
"Increased numbers of circulating microparticles (MPs) have long been documented in thalassemia and are considered as a contributing factor in developing the thromboembolic events (TEEs), which are associated with endothelial dysfunction. Indeed, the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which MPs and endothelial cells interact and their consequences remain poorly investigated."
"Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are common neurodegenerative diseases with distinct but overlapping pathogenic mechanisms. The clinical similarities between these diseases often result in high misdiagnosis rates, leading to serious consequences. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are easy to collect and can accurately reflect the immune characteristics of both DLB and AD."
"Food allergy management has greatly evolved in the last several years, moving from passive approaches, such as strict food allergen avoidance, to more active treatments, including regulatory approval of the first specifically indicated immunotherapy product (for peanut) in 2020. In 2024, a second therapy, omalizumab, received regulatory approval for the treatment of 1 or more IgE-mediated food allergies, providing clinicians with multiple treatment options to offer patients and families. With this expanded armamentarium of food allergy treatment options, the practicing clinician requires detailed knowledge of benefits and risks of omalizumab, how omalizumab fits into the management landscape, and how to use shared decision-making to optimize therapy. This yardstick aims to provide the clinician with a review of data leading to omalizumab's food allergy indication and an evidence-based expert opinion approach regarding on how best to use this and other therapies available to optimize patient management."
"Vacuoles, E1 enzyme, X-linked, auto inflammatory, somatic (VEXAS) syndrome is an inflammatory disorder caused by somatic UBA1 variants and is characterized by late-onset systemic autoimmune inflammation and blood abnormalities. Glucocorticoids ameliorate symptoms effectively. However, other treatment options have limited efficacy and a transient effect. Herein, we describe a case of a 69-year-old male patient with VEXAS syndrome with skin, lung and hematologic involvement. He was treated with glucocorticoids and after the failure with anti IL-1 he began treatment with azacitidine with excellent hematological and clinical response. Azacitidine may be a suitable option for treating VEXAS syndrome, especially due to the relationship between inflammatory symptoms and response to azacitidine."
"Motivated by comparing the distribution of longitudinal quality of life (QoL) data among different treatment groups from a cancer clinical trial, we propose a semiparametric test statistic for the homogeneity of the distributions of multigroup longitudinal measurements, which are bounded in a closed interval with excess observations taking the boundary values. Our procedure is based on a three-component mixed density ratio model and a composite empirical likelihood for the longitudinal data taking values inside the interval. A nonparametric bootstrap method is applied to calculate the p-value of the proposed test. Simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the proposed procedure, which show that the proposed test is effective in controlling type I errors and more powerful than the procedure which ignores the values on the boundaries. It is also robust to the model mispecification than the parametric test. The proposed procedure is also applied to compare the distributions of the scores of Physical Function subscale and Global Heath Status between the patients randomized to two treatment groups in a cancer clinical trial."
"Monitoring the spread of infectious disease is essential to design and adjust the interventions timely for the prevention of the epidemic outbreak and safeguarding the public health. The governments have generally adopted the incidence-based statistical method to estimate the time-varying effective reproduction number Rt and evaluate the transmission ability of epidemics. However, this method exhibits biases arising from the reported incidence data and assumes the generation interval distribution which is not available at the early stage of epidemic. Recent studies showed that the viral loads characterized by cycle threshold (Ct) of the infected populations evolving throughout the course of epidemic and providing a possibility to infer the epidemic trajectory. In this work, we propose the Cycle Threshold-based Transformer (Ct-Transformer) to estimate Rt. We find the supervised learning of Ct-Transformer outperforms the traditional incidence-based statistic and Ct-based Rt estimating methods, and more importantly Ct-Transformer is robust to the detection resources. Further, we apply the proposed model to self-supervised pre-training tasks and obtain excellent fine-tuned performance, which attains comparable performance with the supervised Ct-Transformer, verified by both the synthetic and real-world datasets. We demonstrate that the Ct-based deep learning method can improve the real-time estimates of Rt, enabling more easily adapted to the track of the newly emerged epidemic."
"Oral mucosal grafts are essential in reconstructive urology, particularly for urethral and genital defects. Advances in harvesting and implantation techniques have been made, yet perioperative care remains crucial for optimal outcomes. This systematic review explores postoperative care pathways following oral mucosal graft harvesting to consolidate knowledge, identify best practices, and highlight research gaps."
"Low-temperature plasma (LTP) offers a promising alternative for cancer therapy, as it targets malignant cells selectively while minimizing damage to healthy tissues. Upon interaction with an aqueous solution, LTP generates reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and thereby influences the solution's pH, which is a crucial factor in cancer proliferation and response to treatment. This study investigated the effects of LTP on the pH of aqueous solutions, with a focus on the effect of LTP parameters such as voltage, frequency, and irradiation time. In addition, it explored the influence of solution composition, specifically the presence of the amino acids, glycine and serine, on pH changes; these amino acids are known to play significant roles in cancer proliferation. Our results indicated that LTP induces acidification in deionized water, in which the extent of acidification increased proportionally with plasma parameters. In glycine-containing solutions, pH changes were concentration-dependent, whereas serine-containing solutions maintained a constant pH across all tested concentrations. To investigate potential changes to the structural properties of glycine and serine exposed to LTP that could be responsible for different pH responses, we analyzed the samples using FTIR spectroscopy. A significant decrease in absorbance was observed for solutions with low concentrations of amino acids, suggesting their degradation."
"Little is known about the emotional health of parents caring for children with shunted hydrocephalus. The aim of this pilot study was to find out whether parents caring for shunt-treated hydrocephalic children experience serious psychological problems and psychosocial distress and whether these problems are related to the sociodemographic background of the caregivers, the clinical characteristics of their children, and parents' illness-related concerns and perceived burden of their children's illness."

"Tobacco use among people with mental illness is one of the contributing risk factors for premature morbidity and mortality. Two in three people with mental illness are current smokers with deteriorating physical health and quality of life. This review outlines the prevalence and predictors of tobacco use among people with mental illness in Asia. Twenty-five cross-sectional studies were selected from the exhaustive search of databases. Ten countries emerged based on the number of studies conducted within Asia among people diagnosed with mental illness and tobacco use, namely, India (8), China (7), Pakistan (2), Singapore (2), Sri Lanka (01), Japan (01), Jordan (01), Malaysia (01), Korea (01), and Taiwan (01). The prevalence of tobacco use was in the range of 3.6% to 89.4%, with the measure of precision at 95% confidence. The highest and lowest prevalence was reported in China, followed by India. Being male, separated, lower education, unemployed, lack of family support, a psychotic diagnosis, lack of knowledge, motivation, and a coping mechanism were predictors of tobacco use. This review emphasized the extent and predictors of tobacco use among this vulnerable group that need to be reflected while initiating and implementing cessation strategies by healthcare providers."
"The aim of this study was to decipher the reprogramming of protective machineries and sulfur metabolism, as responses to time-dependent effect of fluoride stress for 10 and 20days in two indica rice (Oryza sativa ) varieties. Unregulated accumulation of fluoride via chloride channels (CLC1 and CLC2) in 10-day-old (cv. Khitish) and 20-day-old (cv. MTU1010) seedlings caused higher accumulation of H2 O2 and superoxide anion that eventually incited chlorophyll loss and electrolyte leakage, along with the formation of malondialdehyde and methylglyoxal. Higher fluoride accumulation also enhanced lipoxygenase and NADPH oxidase activities, which further aggravated the oxidative damages. However, for stressed 20-day-old Khitish and 10day-old MTU1010 seedlings, plant growth was maintained with lesser oxidative damages due to upregulated expression of H+ -ATPase and FEX along with the elevated level of cysteine and H2 S, which could be linked with higher activity of ATP-S, OASTL, and DES. The activity of the enzymatic antioxidants (superoxide dismutase, catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, guaiacol peroxidase, and glutathione peroxidase) and level of non-enzymatic antioxidants (anthocyanins and flavonoids) were also enhanced that strengthened the antioxidative potential of the seedlings. Our work demonstrated that differential reprogramming of the protective metabolites and sulfur assimilation pathways is responsible for the differential pattern of adaptive strategies against fluoride stress in the two indica rice varieties, with Khitish exhibiting tolerance against long-term fluoride stress, whilst MTU1010 showing high susceptibility to the same."
"The purpose of this literature review is to evaluate the extant research addressing food insecurity and mental health among street-involved 2S/LGBTQI+ youth in Canada. Searches were undertaken in academic databases, Google, and Google Scholar for relevant research articles, reports, and grey literature. Our team found nil research specifically addressing food insecurity and the mental health of street-involved 2S/LGBTQI+ youth in Canada. Given that, contextual and contributory factors affecting the mental health and food security of this population are discussed. The available research demonstrates a significant misalignment between the existing support mechanisms and the requirements of this specific population. This underscores the urgent necessity for the establishment of structurally competent, safe, and easily accessible resources. Moreover, there is a clear imperative for additional research endeavors aimed at addressing knowledge deficiencies. These efforts are crucial in empowering dietitians to facilitate enhanced interdisciplinary collaboration, thereby fostering the creation of sustainable, accessible, and appropriate food systems tailored to the needs of this vulnerable demographic."
"The aim of this study was to validate the diagnostic content and the NANDA-I and NOC linkages for six psychosocial nursing diagnoses. This multicentre, descriptive, cross-sectional validation study followed Fehring's model. Expert nurses in nursing methodology and standardised nursing languages in Spain participated, with expertise criteria based on academic level and clinical, teaching, and research experience in the fields of nursing methodology and standardised nursing languages. This study adhered to the STROBE guidelines for cross-sectional studies. Eighty-seven professionals participated in the diagnostic content validation phase, and 57 in the NANDA-I and NOC linkages validation phase. The content validity indices of the six diagnoses ranged from 0.74 to 0.84, all considered valid. All 84 proposed defining characteristics were valid, with 42 scoring ≥0.8. Thirty-two linkages between diagnoses and NOC outcomes were proposed, all valid, with mean scores between 0.73 and 0.98. Each diagnosis was linked to 5-6 NOC outcomes, comprising 26 main outcomes and 6 supplementary outcomes. Overall coverage rates for each diagnosis ranged from 68.42% to 100%. All linkages between defining characteristics and NOC outcome indicators were validated. The six selected psychosocial diagnoses, their defining characteristics, and the proposed linkages between diagnoses and outcomes have been validated. The validation of linkages between NOC indicators and nearly all major defining characteristics of these six psychosocial diagnoses will make it possible to enhance diagnostic accuracy and enable continuous assessment of the effects of nursing interventions on the clinical progression of these diagnoses."
"Rhythm perception in speech and non-speech acoustic stimuli has been shown to be affected by general acoustic biases as well as by phonological properties of the native language of the listener. The present paper extends the cross-linguistic approach in this field by testing the application of the iambic-trochaic law as an assumed general acoustic bias on rhythmic grouping of non-speech stimuli by speakers of three languages: Arabic, Hebrew and German. These languages were chosen due to relevant differences in their phonological properties on the lexical level alongside similarities on the phrasal level. The results show Iambic-Trochaic-Law (ITL) conforming weak-strong grouping for duration-cued acoustic salience. However, only German participants judged intensity-varying sequences as strong-weak; no grouping preferences were found for speakers of Arabic and Hebrew. Overall these results suggest that prosodic properties of the phonological phrase and of the lexical level of the native language show differing effects on rhythmical grouping."
"Intercostal neuralgia can be debilitating and extremely difficult to treat despite multi-modal therapies. The literature describing the role of neuromodulation in patients with intercostal neuralgia is scarce. In this medically challenging case report, we describe a 56-year-old male with a near complete resolution of intractable chronic intercostal neuralgia, secondary to traumatic rib fractures and multiple surgical interventions, with a single lead thoracic spinal cord stimulator (SCS) implant. Neuromodulation therapies should be considered as a viable option for this patient population."
"Different oxidation states of oil affect the emulsion stablility and gel properties of emulsified meat products. Emulsified chicken gels were prepared using sunflower oil (SFO) with different oxidation levels (0, 20, 40, and 60 min, 120 °C). The pre-oxidation treatment of oils was investigated for emulsification and gelation of myofibrillar protein (MP). The results showed that MP emulsion gels with mildly oxidized (20 min) SFO had higher elastic modulus (G') and more homogeneous water distribution, which were due to increased hydrophobic interactions between MP and lipids, and improved emulsification stability. However, the addition of highly oxidized (60 min) SFO resulted in aggregation of proteins, increased emulsion particle size, significantly reduced hardness and chewiness (P > 0.05), and exhibited large pores in the network microstructure. The results suggested that mildly oxidized SFO has an ameliorating effect on MP emulsion gelation, which facilitates better comprehension of the protein oxidation process in oil-loaded meat systems."
"Neonates are prone to experiencing acute kidney injury (AKI) and metabolic irregularities. Although hemodialysis is a primary treatment for these conditions, its utilization is not prevalent in the Ningxia Autonomous Region in China. Peritoneal dialysis (PD) presents itself as an alternative with benefits such as simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and minimal technical complexity compared to hemodialysis. Nonetheless, the safety and efficacy of employing PD in neonates, particularly in very low birth weight infants, require additional investigation."

"Midportion tendinopathy is a common overuse lower extremity injury, with a prevalence of 4% to 7%. Achilles tendinopathy especially affects people who participate in activities that load the Achilles tendon, such as running. The Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment-Achilles (VISA-A) questionnaire has been the go-to patient-reported outcome measure of the perceived impact of Achilles tendinopathy. Recently, new instruments have been developed to try and overcome concerns about the validity of the VISA-A. The revised CPG summarized current evidence, and updated recommendations to support evidence-based practice, including tailored clinical decision-making, about managing Achilles tendinopathy. The CPG excluded interventions that were outside the typical scope of physical therapy practice (eg, pharmacological interventions and surgery) and extracorporeal shock wave therapy."
"Immune checkpoint inhibitors have improved the clinical outcomes of several cancers but have also been associated with a greater risk of immune-related adverse effects, especially when combined. The objective of this study was to investigate the incidence of myocarditis in relation to the use of dual concurrent versus single immune checkpoint inhibitors therapies."
"Despite reductions in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (LDLc), residual cardiovascular risk remains due to factors beyond lipoprotein levels, such as LDL particle count, size, electronegativity and modifications. Technological advances allow detailed profiling of LDL particles, offering potential biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The aim of this review is to provide an updated overview of the state of knowledge in the field of LDL atherosclerotic role, which is evolving rapidly due to technological advances in biomarker measurement and applications."

"Treatment with finerenone, a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA), improved outcomes in patients with heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction in FINEARTS-HF, but was associated with increased levels of serum potassium in follow-up."
"Breast cancer stem cells (CSCs) are resistant to most cancer therapeutics and contribute to tumor recurrence and metastasis. Two breast CSC-promoting transcription factors, truncated glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1 (tGLI1) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), have been reported to be frequently co-expressed in HER2-enriched breast cancer and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), undergo protein-protein interactions for gene regulation and activation, and functionally cooperate to promote breast CSCs. STAT3 can be activated by activated interleukin-6 receptor/glycoprotein-130 (IL-6R/GP130). Co-targeting of tGLI1 and IL-6R/GP130 has not been investigated in breast cancer or any tumor type. Here, we report that tGLI1 and GP130 are co-overexpressed in the majority of HER2-enriched breast cancers and TNBCs at 53.8% and 44.4%, respectively. tGLI1+IL-6/IL-6R/GP130 signaling is frequently co-enriched and co-activated in HER2-enriched breast cancer and TNBC when compared to luminal subtypes. tGLI1+GP130 co-overexpression strongly promotes CSCs of HER2-enriched breast cancer and TNBC. FDA-approved tGLI1 inhibitor Ketoconazole and GP130 inhibitor Bazedoxifene synergize against breast cancer proliferation and CSC phenotypes in vitro and reduce TNBC tumor growth and metastatic burden in vivo. Our study demonstrates, for the first time, that co-targeting tGLI1 and IL-6R/GP130/STAT3 signaling pathways is synergistic against HER2-enriched breast cancer and TNBC, warranting future clinical investigations."
"As the International Commission on Radiological Protection lowers the equivalent dose limit for lens of the eye of radiation workers, the importance of radiation protection for the lens of the eye has been increased. In the case of poor working condition, such as high temperatures and humid environments at nuclear power plants, wearing an eye dosemeter near the worker's eye may interfere with work. In addition, it would not be reasonable for all workers to wear an eye dosemeter to evaluate the lens equivalent dose even in areas with an expected low exposure dose in the NPPs. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an indirect assessment method for lens equivalent dose. The purpose of this study is to develop an indirect assessment method for a lens equivalent dose using correlation factors between whole-body dose and eye. The correlation factors are calculated by MCNP simulation results."
"The ability to accurately quantify biological age could help monitor and control healthy aging. Epigenetic clocks have emerged as promising tools for estimating biological age, yet they have been developed from heterogeneous bulk tissues, and are thus composites of two aging processes, one reflecting the change of cell-type composition with age and another reflecting the aging of individual cell-types. There is thus a need to dissect and quantify these two components of epigenetic clocks, and to develop epigenetic clocks that can yield biological age estimates at cell-type resolution. Here we demonstrate that in blood and brain, approximately 39% and 12% of an epigenetic clock's accuracy is driven by underlying shifts in lymphocyte and neuronal subsets, respectively. Using brain and liver tissue as prototypes, we build and validate neuron and hepatocyte specific DNA methylation clocks, and demonstrate that these cell-type specific clocks yield improved estimates of chronological age in the corresponding cell and tissue-types. We find that neuron and glia specific clocks display biological age acceleration in Alzheimer's Disease with the effect being strongest for glia in the temporal lobe. Moreover, CpGs from these clocks display a small but significant overlap with the causal DamAge-clock, mapping to key genes implicated in neurodegeneration. The hepatocyte clock is found accelerated in liver under various pathological conditions. In contrast, non-cell-type specific clocks do not display biological age-acceleration, or only do so marginally. In summary, this work highlights the importance of dissecting epigenetic clocks and quantifying biological age at cell-type resolution."

"Craniosynostoses are an underrecognized cause of intracranial hypertension (ICH), especially when associated with congenital syndromes. Alagille syndrome (ALGS) is a multisystem disorder with typical facial features and hepatobiliary, cardiac, vascular, skeletal, and ocular manifestations. The occurrence of craniosynostosis in ALGS is rare and can be associated with chronic ICH, requiring craniofacial surgery to increase the intracranial volume. The authors report a series of 6 patients with ALGS with craniosynostosis and discuss their neurosurgical management."
"Nucleases of the S1/P1 family have important applications in biotechnology and molecular biology. We have performed structural analyses of SmNuc1 nuclease from Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, including RNA cleavage product binding and mutagenesis in a newly discovered flexible Arg74-motif, involved in substrate binding and product release and likely contributing to the high catalytic rate. The Arg74Gln mutation shifts substrate preference towards RNA. Purine nucleotide binding differs compared to pyrimidines, confirming the plasticity of the active site. The enzyme-product interactions indicate a gradual, stepwise product release. The activity of SmNuc1 towards c-di-GMP in crystal resulted in a distinguished complex with the emerging product 5'-GMP. This enzyme from an opportunistic pathogen relies on specific architecture enabling high performance under broad conditions, attractive for biotechnologies."
"Root circumnutation, the helical movement of growing root tips, is a widely observed behaviour of plants. However, our mechanistic understanding of the impacts of root circumnutation on root growth and soil exploration is limited. Here, we deployed a unique combination of penetrometer measurements, X-ray computed tomography and time-lapse imaging, and cavity expansion modelling to unveil the effects of root circumnutation on the mechanical resistance to soil penetration. To simulate differences in circumnutation amplitude and frequency occurring among plant species, genotypes and environmental conditions, we inserted cone penetrometers with varying bending stiffness into soil samples that were subjected to orbital movement at different velocities. We show that greater circumnutation intensity, determined by a greater circumnutation frequency in conjunction with a larger circumnutation amplitude, decreased the mechanical resistance to soil penetration. Cavity expansion theory and X-ray computed tomography provided evidence that increased circumnutation intensity reduces friction at the cone-soil interface, indicating a link between root circumnutation and the ability of plants to overcome mechanical constraints to root growth. We conclude that circumnutation is a key component of root foraging behaviour and propose that genotypic differences in circumnutation intensity can be leveraged to adapt crops to soils with greater mechanical resistance."
"This paper investigates enhancing the efficiency of solar water pumping systems (SWPS) by implementing a Maximum Power Point Tracking technique based on the Bat Metaheuristic Optimizer (MPPT-bat) for the photovoltaic generator (PVG) side, coupled with Direct Torque Control (DTC) for the induction motor powering the pump. Unlike traditional techniques, which make no compromise between tracking speed, oscillation and robustness. The integration of the MPPT-bat represents a significant advance, making it possible to improve PVG performance whatever the weather conditions. The main objective remains to improve the energy efficiency of this type of application by maximizing the electrical power allocated to the SWPS. At the same time, a DTC controller applied to the pump motor aims to optimize the use of the energy generated by the MPPT-bat. This intelligent approach adjusts the motor power according to the power extracted from the PVG, thus avoiding inappropriate profiles for the pumping system. The study confirms that optimizing SWPS using this approach based on MPPT-bat and DTC, significantly improves overall performances in terms of tracking error, oscillations, tracking speed and robustness, promotes more efficient pump rotation and, consequently, increases the flow rate of pumped water, and that these improvements persist under different climate conditions."
Claims-based analyses have demonstrated high medical costs associated with myasthenia gravis (MG). We examined the economic burden of MG from the perspective of affected people and their families.
The skull base ligaments have been extensively studied in the literature due to their clinical and surgical significance.

The present study uses an innovative classification system to investigate the PPCNF and PCVL ossification patterns.
Our objective was to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on the proportion of past-year HIV testing in Peru.
"Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are potential candidates for treating multidrug-resistant bacterial infections, yet only a small number of them have progressed into clinical trials. The main challenges include the poor stability and hemolytic/cytotoxic properties of AMPs. Considering this, in the update of the Data Repository of Antimicrobial Peptides (DRAMP), a new annotation on serum and protease stability is added, and special efforts were made to update the hemolytic/cytotoxic information of AMPs. The DRAMP 4.0 currently holds 30 260 entries (8 001 newly added), consisting of 11 612 general entries, 17 886 patent entries, 96 clinical entries, 377 specific entries, 110 entries with stability data, and 179 expanded entries. A total of 2891 entries possess experimentally determined hemolytic activity information, while 2674 entries contain cytotoxicity data by experimental validation. The update also covers new annotations, statistics, categories, functions, and download links. DRAMP is available online at http://dramp.cpu-bioinfor.org/."
"Autoimmune inner ear disease (AIED) manifests with recurrent fluctuating sensorineural hearing loss and vestibular symptoms. Treatment includes steroids and a variety of immunosuppressants. Despite adequate treatment, sensorineural hearing loss can be progressive to the point of deafness. In these patients, a cochlear implant (CI) is indicated. We present the case of a 25-year-old male who underwent cochlear implantation in the left ear. After implantation we noticed brisk variations in impedances which were related to application of the previously prescribed tumor necrosis alpha (TNFα) inhibitor adalimumab."
"The purpose of this article is to present three cases of a rare phenomenon called pre-eruptive coronal resorption (PCR), which occurs in teeth with enamel degeneration. In the first case, the enamel defects occurred due to ectodermal dysplasia, which represents the first documented case of a patient with ectodermal dysplasia who underwent PCR. In the other two cases, the enamel defects occurred due to amelogenesis imperfecta. PCR typically develops asymptomatically; therefore, it is usually incidentally identified through radiological findings, as it presents diffuse degeneration originating externally from the enamel. The precise etiology and pathogenesis of PCRs have yet to be fully elucidated. However, as PCR can spread throughout the dentin and progress to the pulp, early diagnosis is crucial for preserving the affected teeth. Therefore, pediatric dentists should be aware of this pathology."
"This study aims to provide a theoretical foundation for the future management of diabetes at various stages induced by a high-fat diet. Specifically, it seeks to determine the appropriate pharmacological interventions for each phase of diabetes development and the targeted therapeutic directions at different stages of diabetes progression. This investigation employed C57BL6 mice as experimental subjects, successfully establishing an insulin resistance model through a 12-week high-fat diet. Clinical manifestations, weight, body composition, and overall health of each mouse group were observed on the first day of the 6th, 8th, 10th, and 12th week of high-fat feeding to analyze insulin resistance. Subsequently, open-field test of each mouse group, and histopathological changes in the skeletal muscle and myocardium of each mouse group, along with the detection of protein-level expression of relevant genes, were performed to assess alterations in mitochondrial energy metabolism during insulin resistance. This endeavor aims to contribute insights for future in-depth veterinary research. The outcomes demonstrated that a continuous 12-week high-fat diet successfully induced stable insulin resistance in C57BL6 mice. Following insulin resistance, the motor activity of mice decreased, gradual pathological damage and functional decline were observed in the skeletal muscle and myocardium. The insulin signaling pathway was inhibited, resulting in reduced glucose transport and increased gluconeogenesis. Additionally, mitochondrial dysfunction manifested as diminished ATP synthesis capacity, weakened mitochondrial biogenesis, reduced mitochondrial fusion, increased division, and diminished autophagy. Notably, during insulin resistance progression, skeletal muscles and myocardium in C57BL6 mice predominantly relied on glycolytic pathways for energy supply. In the early stages of insulin resistance, the glycogen synthesis pathway in C57BL6 mouse skeletal muscles was inhibited. Our findings underscore a distinct mechanism in skeletal muscle and myocardium that ensures the utilization of anaerobic fermentation to meet energy demands in instances of inadequate aerobic respiration (Fig 1)."
"This study aimed to compare the fascicular anatomy of upper limb nerves visualized using in situ high-resolution ultrasound (HRUS) with ex vivo imaging modalities, namely, magnetic resonance microscopy (MRM), histological cross-sections (HCS), and optical projection tomography (OPT). The median, ulnar, and superficial branch of radial nerve (n = 41) were visualized in 14 cadaveric upper limbs using 22-MHz HRUS. Subsequently, the nerves were excised, imaged with different microscopic techniques, and their morphometric properties were compared. HRUS accurately differentiated 51-74% of fascicles, while MRM detected 87-92% of fascicles when compared to the referential HCS. Among the compared modalities, HRUS demonstrated the smallest fascicular ratios and fascicular cross-sectional areas, but the largest nerve cross-sectional areas. The probability of a fascicle depicted on HRUS representing a cluster of multiple fascicles on the referential HCS increased with the fascicular size, with some differences observed between the larger median and ulnar nerves and the smaller radial nerves. Accordingly, HRUS fascicle differentiation necessitates cautious interpretation, as larger fascicles are more likely to represent clusters. Although HCS is considered the reference modality, alterations in nerve cross-sectional areas or roundness during sample processing should be acknowledged."
"Streptococcus pneumoniae does not produce β-lactamases, and its reduced susceptibility to β-lactam antibiotics is predominantly caused by mutations of penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). However, mechanisms of non-PBP mutation-related β-lactam antibiotic resistance in pneumococcal strains remain poorly characterized."
"Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine-metabolic disorder in female adolescents, and it is associated with metabolic, cardiovascular, and reproductive complications. Recent findings also suggest an association with psychiatric pathology, both affected patients and their offspring. In this update, we synthesized the recent literature on mental health in women and adolescents with PCOS through a systematic search in PubMed, Epistemonikos, and Scielo for articles published in the last 5 years. There is a significantly increased risk of anxiety disorders, depression, eating disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, bipolar affective disorder, and psychosis in women with PCOS. Additionally, there is a risk of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder, both affected individuals and their offspring. Hyperinsulinemia and hyperandrogenism could explain part of these associations, affecting the maturation of the central nervous system, especially during intrauterine life and adolescence. Distress due to the physical phenotypic characteristics of the disease could also impact the mental health of patients. There are still not enough studies explaining the origin of this correlation, nor clinical trials that specifically address mental health in these patients. Current evidence suggests the need to actively assess the mental health of these patients and to coordinate the different health teams involved in managing the pathology."

"Tartary buckwheat (Fagopyrum tataricum) is an important crop used for edible food and medicinal usage. Drought annually brings reduction in crop yield and quality, causing enormous economic losses. Transcription factors are often involved in the regulation of plant responses to environmental stresses. In this study, we identified 233 MYB transcription factors in tartary buckwheat and classified them into 13 groups, including 1R, R2R3, 3R, 4R types. Gene structure and conserved motifs of these 233 FtMYBs suggested the relative conservation of these FtMYBs within each group. There is strong collinearity within the genomes of F. tataricum, with identifying syntenic gene pairs of FtMYB. Further, the expansion of FtMYB genes was attributed to whole genome duplication. The enrichment analysis of cis-acting elements in the FtMYB genes indicated that FtMYBs may participate in abiotic stress responses. The transcriptional changes of FtMYB genes in tartary buckwheat were then investigated using public data and qPCR. A number of FtMYB genes exhibited apparent transcript levels in the detected tissues and most of them disturbed their expression after the treatment of PEG6000 or natural treatment of tartary buckwheat seedlings. Some of the FtMYB genes showed a similar expression trend with qPCR validation. FtMYB gene FtPinG0005108900.01 were shown to activated by PEG6000 and natural drought treatment, and its encoded protein localizes to nucleus, revealing it as a typical transcription factor.

Our results provided detailed evolution and comparative genomic information of FtMYBs in tartary buckwheat and dissected the function of a FtMYB gene FtPinG0005108900.01 in response to drought."
"For the time being, tafamidis is the only approved treatment for wild-type transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis. However, benefits on all-cause death only emerge after ≈18 months. The current available staging systems are unable to specifically discriminate patients at high risk of death within 18 months from diagnosis, and the selection of patients who are expected to benefit from tafamidis is left to the clinical judgment of treating physicians, being often based primarily (and sometimes only) on age. We searched baseline variables able to discriminate patients at risk of death within 18 months."
"This study aims to investigate the biodegradation potential of a gut bacterial strain, Bacillus cereus AP-01, isolated from Tenebrio molitor larvae fed Styrofoam, focusing on its efficacy in degrading low-density polyethylene (LDPE). The biodegradation process was evaluated through a series of assays, including clear zone assays, biodegradation assays, and planktonic cell growth assessments in mineral salt medium (MSM) over a 28-day incubation period. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were employed to characterize the alterations in LDPE pellets, followed by molecular characterization. Over three months, sterile soil + LDPE pellets were treated with different concentrations of gut bacterial strain. The degradation capabilities were assessed by measuring pH, total microbial counts, carbon dioxide evolution, weight loss, and conducting phase contrast microscopy and mechanical strength tests. Results demonstrated that MSM containing LDPE as a carbon source with gut bacterial strain produced a clear zone and enhanced planktonic cell growth. FTIR analysis revealed the formation of new functional groups in the LDPE, while SEM images displayed surface erosion and cracking, providing visual evidence of biodegradation. Molecular characterization confirmed the strain as Bacillus cereus AP-01 (NCBI Accession Number: OR288218.1). A 10% inoculum concentration of Bacillus cereus AP-01 exhibited increased soil bacterial counts, carbon dioxide evolution, and pH levels, alongside a notable weight loss of 30.3% in LDPE pellets. Mechanical strength assessments indicated substantial reductions in tensile strength (7.81 ± 0.84 MPa), compression (4.92 ± 0.53 MPa), hardness (51.96 ± 5.62 shore D), flexibility (10.62 ± 1.15 MPa), and impact resistance (14.79 ± 0.94 J). These findings underscore the biodegradation potential of Bacillus cereus AP-01, presenting a promising strategy for addressing the global LDPE pollution crisis."
"Stroke is the second-leading cause of death worldwide, including in Syria, and the third-leading cause of death and disability combined. With approximately 90% of strokes worldwide linked to modifiable risk factors, identifying and quantifying these factors within a specific population is essential for effective prevention. This is the first study to investigate primary risk factors for stroke in Syria. This study included the six primary stroke centres across four major cities in Syria. Data was collected through case files and a questionnaire answered by the cases or their proxies through personal interviews, as well as selected controls. A total of 411 cases were recruited, comprising 363 ischemic strokes (IS) and 48 haemorrhagic strokes, and with a matched ratio of 1:1 for age and sex. IS was significantly associated with multiple chronic conditions including atrial fibrillation AF [AOR 5.04 (2.64-9.62)], high body mass index (overweight [AOR 2.09 (1.28-3.40)], obesity [AOR 4.17 (2.32-7.50)]), hypercholesterolemia [AOR 2.10 (1.34-3.28], hypertension HTN [AOR 1.83 (1.23-2.73)], and diabetes mellitus DM [AOR 1.79 (1.18-2.71)]. Moreover, several lifestyle risk factors contributed to IS: Alcohol consumption [AOR 4.80 (1.72-13.41)], a diet lacking fruits and vegetables [AOR 2.04 (1.28-3.23)], and low physical activity PA [AOR 1.75 (1.01-2.86)]. Notably, over 40% of the population exhibited medication nonadherence. IS showed no significant association with cigarette smoking, heart failure (HF), ischemic heart disease (IHD), or a family history of stroke (p > 0.05). In contrast, haemorrhagic stroke was linked to higher BMI, HTN, DM, and AF (p < 0.05), but not to hypercholesterolemia, cigarette smoking, IHD, or HF (p > 0.05). This first nationwide multicentre case-controlled study in Syria identified critical modifiable risk factors for stroke, including hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, and obesity, with high rates of medication non-adherence, especially among hypertensive patients, complicating stroke risk. These findings underscore the urgent need for targeted health interventions promoting lifestyle modifications, medication adherence, and public health policies tailored to Syria's current resource-limited context to reduce the stroke burden and improve population health."
"The Oncology Care Model (OCM), a value-based payment model for traditional Medicare beneficiaries with cancer, yielded total spending reductions that were outweighed by incentive payments, resulting in net losses to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. We studied whether the OCM yielded spillover effects in total episode spending, utilization, and quality among commercially insured and Medicare Advantage (MA) members, who were not targeted by the program."
"Hindbrain herniation (HH) is a clinical prerequisite for prenatal repair of myelomeningocele/myeloschisis; however, a subset of patients lack HH on initial fetal imaging and may ultimately progress to exhibit herniation on subsequent prenatal or postnatal imaging. The authors sought to explore the cohort of patients without HH at the time of initial fetal consultation for myelomeningocele/myeloschisis repair to define their clinical characteristics and outcome."
"BACKGROUND Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) encephalitis is a commonly reported form of encephalitis that clinically manifests as skin lesions, fever, headache, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. We present a case of a patient with VZV encephalitis complicated by cerebral hemorrhagic transformation, characterized by high levels of inflammation and protein in the cerebrospinal fluid. The aim is to highlight the risk of hemorrhagic transformation associated with VZV encephalitis. CASE REPORT The patient exhibited scattered herpes lesions on the head, neck, and chest. Notably, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein concentration was markedly elevated at 9049.3 mg/L, with a CSF white blood cell count of 950×10⁶/L, of which lymphocytes constituted 80%. MRI revealed abnormal signal foci in the bilateral temporal lobes and the right frontal lobe, consistent with findings associated with herpes encephalitis. Despite initial treatment with anti-inflammatory agents, acyclovir antiviral, and antiepileptic medications, the patient did not show improvement, prompting the addition of double filtration plasmapheresis. However, the patient experienced hemorrhagic transformation and succumbed to the illness. CONCLUSIONS This case highlights the challenge of managing VZV encephalitis in the context of significant inflammation and protein elevation in the CSF, and underscores the need for further research into more effective therapeutic strategies for this rare but potentially devastating condition."

"In oxygen-deprived conditions, cells respond by activating adaptive mechanisms to bolster their survival and protect tissue integrity. A key player in this process is the HIF-1α signaling cascade, meticulously regulated by Prolyl Hydroxylase Domain 2 (PHD2), which orchestrates cellular responses to varying oxygen levels. The primary aim of this investigation is to utilize gut siderophores as inhibitors of PHD2 in ischemic conditions. This study also helps in understanding the structural mechanisms by which gut microbiota regulate HIF-1α via PHD2 inhibition through the secretion of siderophores. We explore potential PHD2 inhibitors through in-silico approaches, specifically molecular docking, binding pose metadynamics, molecular dynamics simulations, and free energy calculations. We evaluated siderophores secreted by gut microbiota as candidate inhibitors for PHD2. Docking studies revealed that Salmochelin SX exhibits the highest binding affinity to PHD2 (- 9.527 kcal/mol), interacting with key residues such as ASP254, TYR310, ASP315, and ARG322. Despite its high affinity, binding pose metadynamics indicated instability for Salmochelin SX, whereas Staphyloferrin A demonstrated superior stability. Molecular dynamics simulations confirmed stable ligand interactions with PHD2, highlighting HIS313 and ASP315 as critical for inhibition. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Free Energy Landscape (FEL) analyses underscored conformational changes and binding stability, suggesting that these interactions may stabilize PHD2's active site and have potential therapeutic implications. Additionally, the study reveals how gut microbiota prevent gut dysbiosis through the stabilization of HIF-1α signaling by secreting siderophores."

"A press-actuated slidable microfluidic colorimetric biosensor was designed for rapid, sensitive and multi-channel detection of Salmonella. The nickel mesh sheet (NMS) modified with capture antibodies was employed for capturing target bacteria, and metal organic frameworks decorated with palladium (Pd) and platinum (Pt) nanoparticles (MIL-88@Pd/Pt NPs) modified with detection antibodies were used for amplifying colorimetric signals. The capture efficiency of the immune NMS reached 83 %, and the detection limit of this colorimetric biosensor was 35 CFU/mL in 20 min. The average recoveries for Salmonella in spiked chicken meats ranged from 92.2 % to 102.5 % with a variation from 3.7 % to 7.2 %. The press-actuated slidable microfluidic chip was elaboratively developed with multiple functions, including mixing, separation, washing, catalysis and detection."
"There is growing interest in use of transcutaneous spinal stimulation (TSS) for people with neurologic conditions both to augment volitional control (by facilitating motoneuron excitability), and to decrease spasticity (by activating inhibitory networks). Various electrode montages are used during TSS, with little understanding of how electrode position influences spinal circuit activation. We sought to identify the thoracolumbar electrode montage associated with the most robust activation of spinal circuits by comparing posterior root-muscle reflexes (PRM reflexes) elicited by 6 montages. Additionally, we assessed tolerability of the stimulation during PRM reflex testing."

"While there are many proposed clinical prediction models for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, like the International Prognostic Index (IPI), revised IPI and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network IPI, there is no widely used model for older patients. A recent study proposed a Geriatric Prognostic Index (GPI) validated in a Norwegian cohort, using independent predictors involving demographic, biochemical and functional parameters. This study aims to validate the GPI in an Asian cohort and simplify the GPI for ease of clinical application. Older patients (age ≥ 70) treated with R-CHOP-like regimens were identified through the Singapore Lymphoma Study. In a retrospective Asian cohort comprising 268 patients, a simplified GPI (sGPI) was created using variables of predictive significance advanced age > 80 years, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score ≥ 2, serum lactate dehydrogenase level > 3-times upper limit of normal, and stage 3-4, stratifying patients into Low (0), Intermediate (1-2) and High risk (3-4). Cox regression analysis demonstrated a statistically significant difference between risk groups in terms of overall survival (p < 0.00010), with hazard ratios of 1.50 (95% CI: 0.93-2.42), and 4.86 (95% CI: 1.63-14.48), for intermediate and high-risk groups respectively, when compared to the low-risk group. Similar findings were noted for progression free survival (p = 0.00010), with hazard ratios of 1.49 (95% CI: 0.93-2.39) and 4.92 (95% CI: 1.64-14.77) for intermediate and high-risk groups respectively. The sGPI was found to have a C-index of 0.65 (95% CI: 0.60-0.70), which was superior to existing models. In conclusion, we have validated the GPI in an Asian cohort. The sGPI demonstrates good predictive value in an Asian cohort as compared to existing prognostic models."

"Astragalus membranaceus (AM) herb is a component of traditional Chinese medicine used to treat various cancers. Herein, we demonstrate a strong anti-leukemic effect of AM injected (Ai) into the mouse model of erythroleukemia induced by Friend virus. Chemical analysis combined with mass spectrometry of AM/Ai identified the compounds Betulinic acid, Kaempferol, Hederagenin, and formononetin, all major mediators of leukemia inhibition in culture and in vivo. Docking analysis demonstrated binding of these four compounds to FLI1, resulting in downregulation of its targets, induction of apoptosis, differentiation, and suppression of cell proliferation. Chemical composition analysis identified other compounds previously known having anti-tumor activity independent of the FLI1 blockade. Among these, Astragaloside-A (As-A) has marginal effect on cells in culture, but strongly inhibits leukemogenesis in vivo, likely through improvement of anti-tumor immunity. Indeed, both IDO1 and TDO2 were identified as targets of As-A, leading to suppression of tryptophane-mediated Kyn production and leukemia suppression. Moreover, As-A interacts with histamine decarboxylase (HDC), leading to suppression of anti-inflammatory genes TNF, IL1B/IL1A, TNFAIP3, and CXCR2, but not IL6. These results implicate HDC as a novel immune checkpoint mediator, induced in the tumor microenvironment to promote leukemia. Functional analysis of AM components may allow development of combination therapy with optimal anti-leukemia effect."
"Measuring attention and engagement is essential for understanding a wide range of psychological phenomena. Advances in technology have made it possible to measure real-time attention to naturalistic stimuli, providing ecologically valid insight into temporal dynamics. We developed a research protocol called Trace, which records anonymous facial landmarks, expressions, and patterns of movement associated with engagement in screen-based media. Trace runs in a standard internet browser and resembles a contemporary media player. It is embedded in the open-source package PsychoJS (the JavaScript sister library of PsychoPy) hosted via Pavlovia, and can be integrated with a wide range of behavioral research methods. Developed over multiple iterations and tested with over 200 participants in three studies, including the official broadcast of a major theatre production, Trace is a powerful, user-friendly protocol allowing behavioral researchers to capture audience attention and engagement in screen-based media as part of authentic, ecologically valid audience experiences."

"Bilateral hip osteoarthritis is evident in approximately 20% of patients who present to the clinic for evaluation of hip pain, and for those undergoing total hip arthroplasty (THA), 22% will end up needing a contralateral THA. The risk and benefits of simultaneous bilateral total hip arthroplasty (SBTHA) versus staged bilateral THA procedures have been well studied, demonstrating equivalent safety profiles comparable to unilateral and SBTHA. However, the influence of the surgical approach on SBTHA on postoperative outcomes remains unclear. We sought to compare perioperative outcomes and complication rates between the direct anterior approach (DAA) and posterior approach (PA) in patients undergoing SBTHA."
"High-sensitive detection of circulating biomarkers is in high demand because many of them are found at low concentrations in bioliquids. Herein, we report an immuno-transcription-amplified single microbead (MB) assay (IT-SMA) based on the specific S9.6 antibody-DNA/RNA hybrid recognition strategy for the sensitive and universal quantification of protein biomarkers. This design rationally converts the immunoreaction events into amplified nucleic acid transcription to produce numerous RNA molecules, which can efficiently enrich fluorescent signals onto a single MB through a specific S9.6 antibody-DNA/RNA hybrid recognition mechanism, enabling sensitive protein analysis. This method exhibits excellent specificity and high sensitivity for protein analysis with a low detection limit at the fg/mL level. Furthermore, the S9.6 antibody-aided IT-SMA allows for universal detection of various proteins and even exosomes, testing target proteins in serum samples, and differentiating cancer patients from healthy individuals by directly analyzing the exosomes in human blood samples. These features make the IT-SMA strategy a promising tool for the quantitative detection of a variety of biomarkers toward precision diagnostics."
"The Ebola virus (EBOV) causes severe disease in humans, and animal models are needed to evaluate the efficacy of vaccines and therapeutics. While non-human primate (NHP) and rodent EBOV infection models have been well characterized, there is a growing need for an intermediate model. Here, we provide the first report of a small-particle aerosol (AE) EBOV ferret model and disease progression compared with the intramuscular (IM) EBOV ferret model. EBOV infection of ferrets by either route resulted in uniform lethality in 5-6.5 days post infection (dpi) in a dose-dependent manner, with IM-infected ferrets succumbing significantly earlier than AE-infected ferrets. EBOV disease progression differed between AE and IM routes, with significant viremia and presence of virus in target organs occurring earlier in the AE model. In contrast, significant fever, clinical signs of disease, liver pathology, and systemic inflammation occurred earlier in the IM EBOV model. Hepatocellular damage and splenic pathology were noted in both models, while pronounced lung pathology and renal impairment were exclusive to the AE and IM models, respectively. These results demonstrate that small-particle AE and IM ferret EBOV models share numerous common features with NHP and human EBOV infection by these routes and will therefore be useful for the development of vaccine and therapeutic countermeasures."

"US sales of oral nicotine pouches (ONPs) have rapidly increased, with cool/mint-flavoured ONPs the most popular flavour category. Restrictions on sales of flavoured tobacco products have either been implemented or proposed by several US states and localities. Zyn, the most popular ONP brand, is marketing Zyn Chill and Zyn Smooth as 'Flavour-Ban Approved' or 'unflavoured', probably to evade flavour bans and increase product appeal. At present, it is unclear whether these ONPs are indeed free of flavour additives that can impart pleasant sensations such as cooling."
"The benefit of cytoreduction with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (CRS/HIPEC) for epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) remains uncertain.

"Pharmacogenomics, the study of how an individual's genetic makeup influences their response to medications, is a rapidly evolving field with significant implications for personalized medicine. As researchers and healthcare professionals face challenges in exploring the intricate relationships between genetic profiles and therapeutic outcomes, the demand for effective and user-friendly tools to access and analyze genetic data related to drug responses continues to grow. To address these challenges, we have developed PGxDB, an interactive, web-based platform specifically designed for comprehensive pharmacogenomics research. PGxDB enables the analysis across a wide range of genetic and drug response data types - informing cell-based validations and translational treatment strategies. We developed a pipeline that uniquely combines the relationship between medications indexed with Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) codes with molecular target profiles with their genetic variability and predicted variant effects. This enables scientists from diverse backgrounds - including molecular scientists and clinicians - to link genetic variability to curated drug response variability and investigate indication or treatment associations in a single resource. With PGxDB, we aim to catalyze innovations in pharmacogenomics research, empower drug discovery, support clinical decision-making, and pave the way for more effective treatment regimens. PGxDB is a freely accessible database available at https://pgx-db.org/."
"Microglia are the most important immune cells in the central nervous system (CNS), which can defend against external pathogens and stimuli. Dysregulation of microglia releases excessive proinflammatory cytokines and leads to neuroinflammation, which is fundamental to the pathophysiology of multiple neurological diseases. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of proinflammatory cytokines in microglia are still not well-understood. Here, we identified that inhibitor of DNA binding protein 2 (Id2) was a negative regulator of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) in cultured microglia. Knockdown of Id2 significantly increased the expression of TNFα in microglia, while overexpression of Id2 inhibited TNFα expression. Furthermore, by interacting with the p65 subunit of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB), Id2 suppressed the transcription activation of NF-κB and inhibited TNFα expression. Interestingly, in lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-treated microglia, Id2 increased and underwent a cytoplasmic relocation. Immunoprecipitation and immunostaining results showed that by binding to the LIM domain of Id2, a scaffold protein PDZ and LIM 5 (PDLIM5) involved in the Id2 cytoplasmic relocation, which inactivated Id2 and resulted in higher TNFα expression in LPS-treated microglia. Collectively, our data delineate a novel effect of Id2 on TNFα regulation in microglia, which may shed a light on the proinflammatory cytokines regulating in microglia associated neuroimmune disorders."
"Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) have become increasingly utilized in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Despite these purported advantages, prior reports regarding the use of IVUS and OCT have indicated that contemporary use of intravascular imaging remains low with significant regional variation. Here, we present the findings of an updated contemporary analysis regarding the use of IVUS/OCT-guided PCI versus angiography-guided PCI in the United States. We also evaluated in-hospital mortality and clinical outcomes between IVUS/OCT-guided PCI versus angiography-guided PCI-only over million patients in the United States. There has been a significant decrease in the number of PCIs performed, while there has been increasing in the trend of IVUS/OCT-guided PCI over this period. Most importantly, we found that IVUS/OCT-guided PCI was associated with better clinical outcomes in terms of in-hospital mortality, compared with angiography-guided PCI."

In addition, the authors performed a comparison of demographics, aneurysm characteristics, and treatment outcomes in patients before and after the introduction of the WEB device."
"Exosomes derived from human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSC-ex) have become a hopeful substitute for whole-cell therapy due to their minimal immunogenicity and tumorigenicity. The present study aimed to investigate the hypothesis that hUCMSC-ex can alleviate excessive inflammation resulting from intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and facilitate the rehabilitation of the nervous system in rats. In vivo, hemorrhagic stroke was induced by injecting collagenase IV into the striatum of rats using stereotactic techniques. hUCMSC-ex were injected via the tail vein at 6 h after ICH model establishment at a dosage of 200 µg. In vitro, astrocytes were pretreated with hUCMSC-ex and then stimulated with hemin (20 μmol/mL) to establish an ICH cell model. The expression of TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway proteins and inflammatory factors, including TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-10, was assessed both in vivo and in vitro to investigate the impact of hUCMSC-ex on inflammation. The neurological function of the ICH rats was evaluated using the corner turn test, forelimb placement test, Longa score, and Bederson score on the 1st, 3rd, and 5th day. Additionally, RT-PCR was employed to examine the mRNA expression of TLR4 following hUCMSC-ex treatment. The findings demonstrated that hUCMSC-ex downregulated the protein expression of TLR4, NF-κB/P65, and p-P65, reduced the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β, and increased the expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Ultimately, the administration of hUCMSC-ex improved the behavioral performance of the ICH rats. However, the results of PT-PCR indicated that hUCMSC-ex did not affect the expression of TLR4 mRNA induced by ICH, suggesting that hUCMSCs-ex may inhibit TLR4 translation rather than transcription, thereby suppressing the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway. We can conclude that hUCMSC-ex mitigates hyperinflammation following ICH by inhibiting the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway. This study provides preclinical evidence for the potential future application of hUCMSC-ex in the treatment of cerebral injury."
"Plateau hyperuricemia is a common disease in the plateau area, and the incidence is much higher than that in the plain area. Dioscin (DIO) and its active metabolite Diosgenin (DG) exert therapeutic effects on hyperuricemia through oxidative stress and inflammation. In this study, DIO and its active metabolite DG were taken as the research objects to explore their therapeutic effects on high-altitude hyperuricemia in rats. To evaluate the therapeutic effect of DIO on the rat model of high-altitude hyperuricemia, the evaluation indexes include blood biochemical indexes, renal histopathology, oil red O staining of the kidney, rat kidney index, and rat renal inflammatory factors. Transcriptomics was used to analyze the control group, model group, and drug-administered group to preliminarily explore the protective mechanism of DIO in rats with high-altitude hyperuricemia. An HK-2 high-altitude hyperuricemia cell injury model was established to verify the therapeutic mechanism of DIO in rats with high-altitude hyperuricemia. Western blot was used to detect the expression of related proteins in renal tissues and cell models. The results showed that DIO and its active metabolite DG regulate renal lipid metabolism through the EPHX2 gene, attenuate renal inflammatory reaction, and then promote the excretion of uric acid and reduce its reabsorption, which ultimately achieves the effect of treating plateau hyperuricemia."
"Effective pain management in cardiac surgery presents as a continuous challenge related to the intensity of postoperative pain and reliance on opioid therapy. The dependance of opioid-based therapies is concerning, as these therapies carry risk future addiction and potential severe side effects. The transversus thoracic plane block (TTPB) has emerged as a promising regional anesthesia technique that blocks the anterior branches of the intercostal nerves in the chest wall, potentially providing improved analgesia for cardiac surgery patients. The present investigation evaluates the efficacy of TTPB in reducing opioid consumption, decreasing postoperative pain scores, and enhancing recovery outcomes in patients undergoing cardiac surgeries."
"Dual mode detection can overcome the poor anti-interference ability of single-mode detection, and greatly improve the detection accuracy. Fluorescence/electrochemiluminescence (FL/ECL) dual mode detection combines the advantages of FL and ECL, and has a promising application in bioanalysis. Common FL/ECL dual mode detection used different signal probes. Multiple signal probes inevitably have complex operation and uncontrollable differences between the two modes. In this work, poly [9,9-dioctylfluorenyl-2,7-diyl]-End-capped with 2,5-diphenyl-1,2,4-oxadiazole (PFO) was functionalized by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and polyethylenimine (PEI), and the resulting PFO-SDS-PEI nanoparticles (PSP NPs) exhibited excellent FL and ECL performance at the same time, so were creatively developed as mono-luminophore-based signal probe for FL/ECL dual-mode detection. The functional reagent SDS can significantly improve the water dispersion of luminophores, and PEI can not only provide amino functional groups for assembling biomolecules, but also significantly enhance the FL and ECL signals of the luminophores. Self-enhanced PSP NPs coupled strand displacement reaction (SDR) mediated by exonuclease Ⅲ (Exo Ⅲ) to achieve FL/ECL dual-mode detection of Tau protein, a biomarker of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The linear ranges for FL and ECL detection were 0.001-500 pg/mL and 0.00001-1.0 pg/mL and the limit of detections were 549.16 ag/mL and 5.45 ag/mL, respectively, showing good application potential. Self-enhanced PSP NPs provided an ideal mono-luminophore-based signal probe for FL/ECL dual-mode detection, and built a new method for detecting AD biomarker."

"Centralized drug procurement is a common practice worldwide to relieve the healthcare burden and promote high-quality development in the pharmaceutical industry. However, scholars have not yet reached an agreement on whether centralized procurement can facilitate the innovation activities of pharmaceutical firms. China's centralized volume-based procurement (CVBP) implemented in 2018 provides an ideal quasi-natural experiment to evaluate the effect of centralized procurement on the R&D investment of the firms. Drawing data from listed manufacturing firms in China's A-share market (2015-2020), the results from a difference-in-differences analysis with different model specifications indicate that the CVBP significantly promotes the pharmaceutical manufacturing firms' R&D investment. Moreover, the positive effect of the CVBP on R&D investment is stronger in pharmaceutical manufacturing firms with high marketing expenses. A series of robustness tests including the parallel trend test, placebo test, and the PSM-DID analysis show that our findings are solid. This paper advances our understanding of centralized procurement in emerging markets and provides new insights into how governments and pharmaceutical manufacturing firms can strengthen innovation."
"Cutaneous immune-related adverse events (cirAEs) may be associated with tumoral response and survival in patients using immune checkpoint inhibitors, but this relationship remains unclear because previous reports on the topic have various limitations. The purpose of this study was to examine the association of cirAEs with overall survival and progression-free survival in patients starting immune checkpoint inhibitors. A prospective observational study was conducted in a Spanish tertiary care hospital, including participants between March 2020 and May 2022. The statistical analysis involved the Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test, and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models. At total of 189 patients were included, of whom 82 (43.4%) presented cirAEs. Most participants (56.6%) were diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Mortality and progression rates were lower in patients with vs without cirAEs (p < 0.0001). Cox models showed that cirAEs were a protective factor for overall survival (adjusted HR 0.50; p < 0.0001) and progression-free survival (adjusted HR 0.54; p = 0.001) independently of cancer type, tumour stage or immune checkpoint inhibitor category. There were similar results for extracutaneous irAEs. A limitation was the single-centre design. CirAE occurrence is positively associated with longer survival and less cancer progression among immune checkpoint inhibitor recipients independently of other factors."
"Asclepius was the main healing deity of the Classical Antiquity. After his gradual establishment, his cult expanded throughout the Greek world, especially in the 5th and 4th centuries BC. Asclepius was worshipped in sacred precincts labelled asklepieia (singular asklepieion), which served both as religious sites and as medical facilities where the sick came for healing. One of the smaller asklepieia is located on the island of Paros in the Cyclades, on two terraces about 3 km southwest of the centre of Parikia. The site was partially excavated in 1898-1899 by the German archaeologist Otto Rubensohn (1867-1964) and incompletely published in 1902. Over the last few years, the authors have been working on a project to (re)identify all surviving finds based on original descriptions and original excavation documentation, and to better understand the healing practices at the site. From the 6th century BC at the latest, the cult of Apollo, a deity with certain healing powers, is attested here, who was succeeded by his mythological son Asclepius sometime between the end of the 5th and the beginning of the 4th centuries BC. During the 4th and probably also in the 3rd century BC, a large complex is built on both terraces, with a temple, retaining and enclosure walls, a specific circular structure, a building for pilgrims and the performance of healing sleep, an altar and 2 sacred healing springs. The site's greatest bloom occurred in the 4th to 2nd century BC and especially in the Roman period, in the 1st to 3rd centuries."
"In an era marked by an abundance of news sources, access to information significantly influences public opinion. Notably, the bias of news sources often serves as an indicator of individuals' political leanings. This study explores this hypothesis by examining the news sharing behavior of politically active social media users, whose political ideologies were identified in a previous study. Using correspondence analysis, we estimate the Media Sharing Index (MSI), a measure that captures bias in media outlets and user preferences within a hidden space. During Argentina's 2019 election on Twitter, we observed a predictable pattern: center-right individuals predominantly shared media from center-right biased outlets. However, it is noteworthy that those with center-left inclinations displayed a more diverse media consumption, which is a significant finding. Despite a noticeable polarization based on political affiliation observed in a retweet network analysis, center-left users showed more diverse media sharing preferences, particularly concerning the MSI. Although these findings are specific to Argentina, the developed methodology can be applied in other countries to assess the correlation between users' political leanings and the media they share."
"Although the immune system participates in the development of hypertension, the proportional contributions of distinct immune cells remain poorly understood. With the development of transcriptomics, we can profile the transcriptomes of individual immune cells and assess the relative contribution of each immune cell to the development of hypertension. So, we tested the hypothesis that increased lamina propria B cells play roles in fructose-induced hypertension of Dahl salt-sensitive (SS) rats."
"Spinal cord injury (SCI) represents a complex pathophysiological process involving the interaction of multiple cell types. Conventional sequencing methods can only detect the average gene expression level of the damaged local cell populations, which is difficult to reflect its heterogeneity. Therefore, new technologies are needed to reveal the intercellular heterogeneity and the complex intercellular interactions of the damaged lesions. The single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technique facilitates high-resolution profiling of gene expression at the single-cell level, providing insights into cellular heterogeneity and function, potential molecular pathways, cell fate transitions, and the intercellular interactions pertinent to disease progression. This technology generates valuable gene expression data that support both basic and translational research efforts aiming at the identification of therapeutic targets for intervention. The scRNA-seq technique and its multifaceted application in the local immune microenvironment of injury after SCI were discussed, which will contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the pathophysiological processes in the immune microenvironment of SCI."
"Polypharmacy (use of ≥5 concurrent medications) is highly prevalent among older adults to manage chronic diseases and is linked to adverse geriatric outcomes, including physical and cognitive functional impairments, falls, frailty, hospitalization, and mortality. Deprescribing (withdrawal) is a potential strategy to manage polypharmacy. The broad molecular changes by which polypharmacy causes harm and deprescribing may be beneficial are unknown and unfeasible to study rigorously in tissue from geriatric patients. Therefore, in a randomized controlled trial, we administered therapeutic doses of commonly used chronic medications (oxycodone, oxybutynin, citalopram, simvastatin, or metoprolol) as monotherapy or concurrently (polypharmacy) from middle-age (12 months) to old-age (26 months) to male C57BL/6J (B6) mice and deprescribed (gradually withdrew) treatments in a subset from age 21 months. We compared drug-related hepatic effects by applying proteomics along with transcriptomics and histology. We found that monotherapy effects on hepatic proteomics were limited but significant changes were seen with polypharmacy (93% unique to polypharmacy). Polypharmacy altered the hepatic expression of proteins involved in immunity, and in drug, cholesterol, and amino acid metabolism, accompanied by higher serum drug levels than monotherapies. Deprescribing not only reversed some effects but also caused irreversible and novel changes in the hepatic proteome. Furthermore, our study identified several hepatic protein co-expressed modules that are associated with clinically relevant adverse geriatric outcomes, such as mobility, frailty, and activities of daily living. This study highlights the complex molecular changes following aging, chronic polypharmacy, and deprescribing. Further exploration of these mechanistic pathways may inform management of polypharmacy and deprescribing in older adults."
"Green development is related to the long-term sustainable development of enterprises, but there is little literature on the impact of information and communication technology (ICT) investment on green development of enterprises. To fill this gap, based on the sample of A-share high-polluting industry enterprises in China's Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets from 2007 to 2019, this paper uses the dynamic panel threshold model to deeply study the non-linear impact of ICT investment on green development. This paper found that: (1) there is a threshold effect on the impact of ICT investment on green development of enterprises in high-polluting industries, and when ICT investment breaks through the threshold value, it can promote green development. This conclusion remains robust after the estimation of Multi-period DID model and instrumental variable; (2) ICT investment mainly promotes green development of enterprises by improving production efficiency and promoting green technology innovation; (3) ICT investment has a significant impact on green development of enterprises with higher management level, heavy industrial enterprises and non-state-owned enterprises, but has no significant impact on green development of enterprises with lower management level, light industrial enterprises and state-owned enterprises. And digital technology investment has a stronger role in promoting green development than traditional ICT investment. This paper proposes that enterprises in high-pollution industries can increase ICT investment to promote green development."
"The infant gut microbiome undergoes rapid changes in the first year of life, supporting normal development and long-term health. Although diet shapes this process, the role of fibers in complementary foods on gut microbiome maturation is poorly understood."
"Ancient whole-genome duplications are believed to facilitate novelty and adaptation by providing the raw fuel for new genes. However, it is unclear how recent whole-genome duplications may contribute to evolvability within recent polyploids. Hybridization accompanying some whole-genome duplications may combine divergent gene content among diploid species. Some theory and evidence suggest that polyploids have a greater accumulation and tolerance of gene presence-absence and genomic structural variation, but it is unclear to what extent either is true. To test how recent polyploidy may influence pangenomic variation, we sequenced, assembled, and annotated 12 complete, chromosome-scale genomes of Camelina sativa, an allohexaploid biofuel crop with 3 distinct subgenomes. Using pangenomic comparative analyses, we characterized gene presence-absence and genomic structural variation both within and between the subgenomes. We found over 75% of ortholog gene clusters are core in C. sativa and <10% of sequence space was affected by genomic structural rearrangements. In contrast, 19% of gene clusters were unique to one subgenome, and the majority of these were Camelina specific (no ortholog in Arabidopsis). We identified an inversion that may contribute to vernalization requirements in winter-type Camelina and an enrichment of Camelina-specific genes with enzymatic processes related to seed oil quality and Camelina's unique glucosinolate profile. Genes related to these traits exhibited little presence-absence variation. Our results reveal minimal pangenomic variation in this species and instead show how hybridization accompanied by whole-genome duplication may benefit polyploids by merging diverged gene content of different species."
Randomized trials of bivalirudin in patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) have yielded heterogeneous results.
"Subclinical depressive symptoms increase the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). The neurobiological mechanisms underlying this link may involve stress system dysfunction, notably related to the hippocampus which is particularly sensitive to AD. We aimed to investigate the links between blood stress markers and changes in brain regions involved in the stress response in older adults with or without subclinical depressive symptoms."
"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) with a complex and not fully understood etiopathological background involving inflammatory and neurodegenerative processes. CHI3L1 has been implicated in pathological conditions such as inflammation, injury, and neurodegeneration, and is likely to play a role in the physiological development of the CNS. CHI3L1 is primarily produced by CNS macrophages, microglia, and activated astrocytes. The CHI3L1 expression pattern in MS lesions might support the important role of astrocytes in modulating inflammatory processes in this disease. The potential applications of CHI3L1 as a biomarker in MS are multifactorial. The measurement of CHI3L1 in body fluids might find its role in the early diagnosis of MS. In further stages, the monitoring of CHI3L1 levels might provide information on disease severity and progression, enabling a better adjustment of therapeutic strategies. Importantly, CHI3L1 might potentially serve as a marker of ongoing glial activation, reflecting the dynamic response of the CNS cells to the inflammatory processes in MS. Although preliminary findings have been promising, further research is needed to validate the utility of CHI3L1 measurements in the diagnosis and prediction of the progression of MS. Additionally, comparisons with other biomarkers might be useful in clinical practice."
"The KHDC3L gene encodes a component of the subcortical maternal complex (SCMC). Biallelic mutations in this gene cause 5%-10% of biparental hydatidiform moles (BiHM), and a few maternal deletions in KHDC3L have been identified in women with recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL)."
"Ulva lactuca (U. lactuca) is an important seaweed species. Some ingredients in this species are thought to accelerate wound healing. However, limited data on the use of seaweed for wound healing exists. This study examined whether ethanol or aqueous extracts of U. lactuca promote antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties in vitro and wound healing in vitro and in vivo. Cell proliferation, antioxidation, and migration were observed in NIH3T3 cells treated with U. lactuca extract in vitro. Both U. lactuca extracts were examined for their ability to inhibit inflammatory cytokine synthesis in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. In vivo experiments involved four groups of albino mice (BALB/c; 10 mice per group). One 1.0 cm2 wound was created via excision of full-thickness skin on the back of all mice. Group I mice were treated topically with the ethanol extract of U. lactuca (25 mg/mL) for 10 d. Group II mice were treated topically with an aqueous extract of U. lactuca (12.5 mg/mL) for 10 d. Group III mice received topical application of phosphate-buffered saline solution. Group IV mice wounds were maintained without treatment. Both extracts considerably increased fibroblast proliferation. The antioxidant activity of the U. lactuca extract was determined using a total antioxidant capacity assay. Both extracts inhibited the release of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) from LPS-mediated inflammation in RAW 264.7 cells. These extracts also upregulated the expression of Th2 cytokines such as transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) and interleukin 10 (IL-10) in RAW 264.7 cells under pro-inflammatory conditions. Both extracts enhanced the migratory ability of NIH3T3 cells. U. lactuca ethanol extract enhances wound healing properties in vivo. These results suggest that bioactive compounds derived from U. lactuca extract are beneficial for wound healing and anti-inflammatory therapies."
"Over the recent years, the self-care program has been a significant policy in the field of health. The WHO recommended self-care for every country and economic setting for reaching universal health coverage, promoting health, keeping the world safe and serving the vulnerable. Conducting a policy analysis study can be useful in closely examining the self-care program's content, process, context and actors."
"Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) effectively treats high-risk myeloid neoplasms, but relapses post-HSCT, particularly in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic neoplasms (MDS), pose significant challenges. Donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) has been utilized, but its effectiveness, especially in haploidentical settings, remains insufficiently clarified, and graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) poses a substantial risk."
"The intestinal barrier function is a critical defense mechanism in the human body, serving as both the primary target and initiating organ in cases of sepsis. Preserving the integrity of this barrier is essential for preventing complications and diseases, including sepsis and mortality. Despite this importance, the impact of resveratrol on intestinal barrier function remains unclear. Thus, this study aims to explore the potential beneficial effects of resveratrol on maintaining intestinal barrier function. Fifteen male Sprague Dawley rats, weighing between 180 g and 220 g, were randomly assigned to one of three groups: the control group (Con), the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) group, and the resveratrol (RSV) group. The resveratrol group received an intravenous administration of resveratrol at a dosage of 8 mg/kg, 10 min prior to lipopolysaccharide treatment. Each group comprised five rats. Various techniques including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), hematoxylin and eosin staining (HE), periodic acid Schiff (PAS) staining, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Western blot analysis (WB), and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) were utilized to assess differences in inflammatory cytokine expression, histopathological changes, apoptosis, tight junction (TJ) protein, and the TLR4/MyD88/NF-кB signaling pathways. Resveratrol exhibited anti-inflammatory effects by decreasing levels of interleukin (IL)-1β, interleukin(IL)-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, while increasing interleukin (IL)-10. Additionally, in rats treated with resveratrol, there was a reduction in the expression of apoptosis-associated proteins Bax and Caspase-3. Resveratrol also significantly increased the expression of intestinal tight junction proteins (TJ), and decreased the levels of intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP) and D-lactic acid (D-LA). Furthermore, the expression of proteins in the related signaling pathways TLR4, MyD88, and NF-κB was decreased. Resveratrol has been shown to reduce the expression of intestinal apoptotic proteins, enhance the expression of intestinal tight junction proteins, and inhibit the inflammatory response mediated by the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway, thereby alleviating LPS-induced septic intestinal injury."
"Current asthma guidelines, including those of the European Respiratory Society (ERS) and American Thoracic Society (ATS), suboptimally predict asthma remission, disease severity, and health-care utilisation. We aimed to establish a novel approach to assess asthma severity based on asthma health-care burden data."
"Although heightened intratumoral levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are typically associated with a suppressive tumor microenvironment, under certain conditions ROS contribute to tumor elimination. Treatment approaches, including some chemotherapy and radiation protocols, increase cancer cell ROS levels that influence their mechanism of cell death and subsequent recognition by the immune system. Furthermore, activated myeloid cells rapidly generate ROS upon encounter with pathogens or infected cells to eliminate disease, and recently, this effector function has been noted in cancer contexts as well. Collectively, ROS-induced cancer cell death may help initiate adaptive antitumor immune responses that could synergize with current approved immunotherapies, for improved control of solid tumors. In this work, we explore the use of glucose oxidase, an enzyme which produces hydrogen peroxide, a type of ROS, to therapeutically mimic the endogenous oxidative burst from myeloid cells to promote antigen generation within the tumor microenvironment. We engineer the enzyme to target pan-tumor-expressed integrins both as a tumor-agnostic therapeutic approach and as a strategy to prolong local enzyme activity following intratumoral administration. We found the targeted enzyme potently induced cancer cell death and enhanced cross-presentation by dendritic cells in vitro and further combined with interferon alpha for long-term tumor control in murine MC38 tumors in vivo. Optimizing the single-dose administration of this enzyme overcomes limitations with immunogenicity noted for other prooxidant enzyme approaches. Overall, our results suggest ROS-induced cell death can be harnessed for tumor control and highlight the potential use of designed enzyme therapies alongside immunotherapy against cancer."
"Empathy is the capacity to understand and share the experiences of others. This ability fosters connections between individuals, enriching the fabric of our shared world. One notable example is empathy for the pain of others. Such experiences facilitate the identification of potential dangers, both for oneself and for others. Neuroimaging studies have helped to pinpoint brain regions that modulate empathic pain. Recently, there has also been a surge in studies exploring the neural mechanisms of empathic pain in rodent models. Neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism, psychosis, and schizophrenia often exhibit empathy deficits. Targeting the modulation of empathic pain holds potential for alleviating core symptoms in these patients. Interestingly, empathy research may also benefit pain management, leading to new approaches for understanding the negative emotions associated with pain. This review summarizes recent advances in neuroimaging for the study of empathic pain, outlines the underlying neurocircuit mechanisms, describes therapeutic strategies, and explores promising avenues for future research. This article is part of the Special Issue on ""Empathic Pain""."
"Image segmentation is a key step of the 3D reconstruction of the hepatobiliary duct tree, which is significant for preoperative planning. In this paper, a novel 3D U-Net variant is designed for CT image segmentation of hepatobiliary ducts from the abdominal CT scans, which is composed of a 3D encoder-decoder and a 3D multi-feedforward self-attention module (MFSAM). To well sufficient semantic and spatial features with high inference speed, the 3D ConvNeXt block is designed as the 3D extension of the 2D ConvNeXt. To improve the ability of semantic feature extraction, the MFSAM is designed to transfer the semantic and spatial features at different scales from the encoder to the decoder. Also, to balance the losses for the voxels and the edges of the hepatobiliary ducts, a boundary-aware overlap cross-entropy loss is proposed by combining the cross-entropy loss, the Dice loss, and the boundary loss. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method is superior to some existing deep networks as well as the radiologist without rich experience in terms of CT segmentation of hepatobiliary ducts, with a segmentation performance of 76.54% Dice and 6.56 HD."
The aim of the study was to analyze the data of diabetic patients regarding warning signs of hypoglycemia to predict it at an early stage using various novel machine learning (ML) algorithms. Individual interviews with diabetic patients were conducted over 6 months to acquire information regarding their experience with hypoglycemic episodes.
"This study aims to investigate the differences of clinical indices in HIV patients between three different first-line antiretroviral treatment strategies in Yunnan Province, China. Furthermore, the hematologic system, liver function, kidney function, blood lipid levels of HIV patients and its association with CD4+ count, CD8+ count, CD4/CD8 ratio and antiretroviral treatment were also assessed."
"Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) is a (probably) rare syndrome that occurs in frequent and chronic cannabis users. It is characterised by cyclical vomiting and gastrointestinal symptoms. CHS is frequently misdiagnosed resulting in extensive investigations and delayed diagnosis and treatment. Standard anti-emetic treatments are typically not effective, and no standardised treatment protocol exists for CHS. Bathing or showering in hot water is often reported to relieve symptoms. Little is known of the aetiology of CHS as the literature is predominantly informed by case reports and chart reviews. Similarly, little is known of the demographics and cannabis use patterns of those who develop CHS. The number of CHS cases globally appears to have risen following liberalisation of cannabis regulation and access in some countries, underscoring the need for wider recognition of CHS in emergency care and by the wider public."
"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most lethal malignancies, with limited treatment options yielding poor outcomes. This study aimed to evaluate the real-world clinical characteristics, treatment patterns, and outcomes of patients with locally advanced unresectable and de-novo metastatic PDAC in Saudi Arabia, providing regional data to compare with international benchmarks."
"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), i.e., anti-PD1/PDL1 and anti-CTLA-4, have reshaped the prognosis of many cancers. Increased use of ICI has led to the onset of new adverse events. Neurological immune-related adverse events are rare, heterogenous, and potentially life-threatening. Chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (CIPO) is an immune-related autonomic plexus neuropathy that may be caused by infiltration of the myenteric plexus by CD8 + T cells. It is a rare and potentially fatal side effect that can be difficult to diagnose early because of initial nonspecific clinical presentation including vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, and constipation. Some rare cases have been described in the literature reporting a frequent resistance to corticosteroids making it necessary to use other immunosuppressive therapy. Vedolizumab is an antibody (Ab) blocking integrin α4-β7 used to treat inflammatory bowel disease. We report the first three cases of ICI-induced CIPO-treated with vedolizumab after corticosteroid failure, with very limited benefits (only one patient with transitory improvement). Based on our results in three cases, vedolizumab does not currently appear to be a therapeutic option. Earlier administration with a standardized dose and frequency schedule may provide better outcomes."
"Describe how sports medicine clinicians support decision making about sport participation after concussion recovery with adolescent patients and their parents. Specific areas of inquiry related to how clinicians framed the decision, what factors they considered in how they approached the decision process, and how they navigated discordance within families."
"Since the discovery of fatty acid hydroxy fatty acids (FAHFAs), significant progress has been made in understanding their regulation, biochemistry, and physiological activities. Here, we contribute to this understanding by revealing that inflammation induces the production of fatty acid hydroxy stearic acids and fatty acid hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids in white adipose tissue depots and in adipocytes cocultured with macrophages. In lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced coculture systems, we confirm that adipose triglyceride lipase is required for inflammation-induced FAHFA generation and demonstrate that inflammation is necessary for producing hydroxy fatty acids. Chemically synthesized fatty acid hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids show anti-inflammatory activities in vivo, but only at supraphysiological concentrations. While endogenous FAHFAs are unlikely to be anti-inflammatory due to their low concentrations, conversion of proinflammatory hydroxy fatty acids into FAHFAs may dampen inflammation. Indeed, we demonstrate that proinflammatory lipids, such as hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) and leukotriene B4 (LTB4), can be converted by cells in culture to weakly anti-inflammatory FAHFAs."
"Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has long been recognized as an effective treatment for depression and suicidality. Virtual reality (VR) technology is widely used for cognitive training for conditions such as anxiety disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder, but little research has considered VR-based CBT for depressive symptoms and suicidality. We tested the effectiveness and safety of a VR-based CBT program for depressive disorders."
"Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a rare form of thoracic malignancy with a poor prognosis. Pleural effusion (PE) occurs in the majority of patients with MPM; however, its impact on MPM outcomes remains controversial. We searched for eligible patients from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, and clinicopathological information and outcomes were collected. Cox proportional hazard regression analyses were utilized to evaluate the association of PE and other factors with overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) in patients with MPM. A total of 4185 patients were extracted from the SEER database from 2000 to 2021. The median age of the cohort was 73 years, with a predominance of male patients and epithelioid MPM as the main histological subtype. Univariate Cox regression revealed associations between PE, age, sex, marital status, histology, stage, and treatment with both OS and CSS. Besides, multivariate analyses indicated that PE was independently associated with poorer OS and CSS in patients with MPM, regardless of age, sex, histology, stage, and treatment. Subgroup analyses suggested that PE has a remarkable impact on patients undergoing surgery. PE might serve as an independent prognostic factor in patients with MPM, especially in surgery recipients. Consequently, the development of pleural effusion in these patients should receive increased attention. Future studies are needed to validate these findings, particularly concerning the effect of PE in other clinical settings, such as immunotherapy."
"As conservation agricultural practices continue to spread, there is a need to understand how reduced tillage impacts soil microbes. Effects of no till (NT) and disk till (DT) relative to moldboard plow (MP) were investigated in a long-term experiment established on Chernozem. Results showed that conservation practices, especially NT, increased total, active and microbial biomass carbon. The effects on diversity measured through amplicon sequencing were greater for prokaryotes than for fungi. NT increased prokaryotic richness at both the lower and the higher taxonomic level, while for both microbial groups it tended to decrease Shannon index at the higher taxonomic level. No differences were observed between DT and MP. Conversely, tillage intensity induced a clear separation of both prokaryotic and fungal communities among all three practices. Comparing abundance of ecologically meaningful groups revealed more abundant saprotrophic fungi in MP and differences in the bacterial groups involved in the N cycle. Differential analysis showed relatively similar numbers of plant growth promoting prokaryotic taxa. However, it also revealed higher numbers of pathogenic fungal taxa that are enriched in NT. Overall, our findings illustrate that tillage changes the structure of both prokaryotic and fungal communities, including distribution of functional groups, without necessarily changing diversity."
"Large hemispheric infarction (LHI) is a severe form of stroke with high mortality and poor outcomes. Ultrasonic optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) is considered an effective indicator for intracranial hypertension. Our study aimed to validate the efficiency of ultrasonic ONSD and develop a nomogram to identify LHI patients who have 90-day mortality. We recruited 419 LHI patients (training cohort, n = 202; internal validation cohort, n = 86; and external validation cohort, n = 131) from six centers. Demographic, laboratory, computed tomography, and ultrasonic data were collected. At 90 days, 41.8% of patients died. Ultrasonic ONSD (odds ratio [OR], 7.026; 95% CI, 2.638-18.708; P < 0.001), male (OR, 8.620; 95% CI, 2.962-25.092; P < 0.001), midline shift (OR, 1.207; 95% CI, 1.085-1.342; P = 0.001), and infarction volume (OR, 1.020; 95% CI, 1.012-1.028; P < 0.001) were independent predictors. In identifying LHI patients prone to 90-day mortality, the nomogram developed using these predictors showed areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.897, 0.824, 0.833 in the training cohort, internal and external validation cohorts, respectively. Ultrasonic ONSD complement the midline shift and infarction volume to create a reliable multimodal method for monitoring prognosis in patients with LHI."
"Intramedullary nail fixation is a routine procedure for treatment of intertrochanteric fractures. Aseptic technique is vital for reducing postoperative complications, as intraoperative glove perforations increase the risk of surgical site infections. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of surgical glove perforation during intramedullary nailing of intertrochanteric fractures and to identify surgery-specific steps at risk. A prospective series of 148 short intramedullary nail implantations was analysed. Intraoperative glove perforations and causative events were recorded. All gloves from the scrubbed surgical team were collected and examined for micro- and macroperforations. 1771 gloves were tested. A total of 341 perforations in 309 gloves were detected, resulting in an overall glove perforation rate of 17%. Surgeon experience had no influence on the overall incidence of glove perforations. Usage of the awl and insertion of the proximal locking screw resulted in 33.9% of all detected glove perforations. Perforation rate significantly increased with operative time (p = 0.003). Regular glove changing after surgery-specific risk-steps and during longer surgeries could decrease the rate of glove perforations during intramedullary nailing of intertrochanteric fractures and reduce the risk of potential septic contamination or even disease transmission for both, the surgeon, and the patient."
"The aim of this study is to screen for, isolate and characterize a bacteriophage designated ɸEcM-vB1 with confirmed lytic activity against multidrug-resistant (MDR) E. coli. Methods done in this research are bacteriophage isolation, purification, titer determination, bacteriophage morphology, host range determination, bacteriophage latent period and burst size determination, genomic analysis by restriction enzymes, and bacteriophage total protein content determination."
"Transitional care management (TCM) visits have been shown to reduce 30-day readmissions, but it is unclear whether the decrease arises from the TCM visit itself or from clinic-level changes to meet the requirements of the TCM visits. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis using data from Northwell Health to examine the association between the type of post-discharge follow-up visits (TCM visits versus non-TCM visits based on billing) and 30-day readmission. Furthermore, we assessed whether being seen by a provider who frequently utilizes TCM visits or the TCM visit itself was associated with 30-day readmission. We included adult patients hospitalized to Medicine service and subsequent follow-up visits within two weeks of discharge between February 24, 2018, and February 24, 2020. We examined 1) post-discharge follow-up visit type (TCM visit versus non-TCM visit) and 2) provider characteristics (frequent TCM visit utilization or not). The primary outcome was unplanned hospital readmission within 30 days following hospital discharge. After propensity matching, TCM follow-up visits were associated with decreased 30-day readmissions (hazard ratio = 0.74 [0.63-0.88]) compared to non-TCM visits. Among patients with non-TCM follow-up visits, those seen by a provider who frequently used TCM visits had decreased odds (OR = 0.84 [0.71-0.99]) of 30-day readmission compared to those seen by providers who did not use TCM visits regularly. Among patients who followed up with providers who frequently use TCM visits, TCM visits were associated with decreased 30-day readmission compared to patients with non-TCM visits (OR = 0.78 [0.62-0.98]). The study has limitations, including the health system database not capturing all out-of-network follow-up visits. The reduction in 30-day readmission associated with TCM visits likely arises from both the visit itself and being seen by a provider who frequently uses TCM visits."
"Evidence indicates a negative link between glucosamine and age-related cognitive decline and sarcopenia. However, the causal relationship remains uncertain. This study aims to verify whether glucosamine is causally associated with cognitive function and sarcopenia."
"Omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) are widely used as supplements and pharmaceuticals because of their beneficial effects on human health. Triacylglycerols (TAG) and glycerophospholipids (GPL) comprise the primary chemical structures of DHA/EPA in marine sources. Furthermore, DHA/EPA-enriched glycerophospholipids (DHA/EPA-GPL) and lysoglycerophospholipids (DHA/EPA-LysoGPL) consumed through food and supplements are more effective than TAG in promoting health, which may be attributed to a specific underlying mechanism. However, the specific effects of DHA/EPA bound to GPL structure have been still unclear. The aim of this review is to clarify the significance of the binding of DHA/EPA to GPL in promoting the health benefits of DHA/EPA-GPL and DHA/EPA-LysoGPL. Additionally, the potential use of fishery by-products as sources of DHA/EPA-GPL and DHA/EPA-LysoGPL has been discussed."

"De novo shoot regeneration, characterized by the emergence of adventitious shoots from excised or damaged tissues or organs in vitro, is regulated by the complex interplay between genetic and epigenetic regulatory mechanisms. However, the specific effect of histone deacetylation on shoot regeneration remains poorly understood. This study investigated the effects of trichostatin A (TSA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor, on shoot regeneration in callus derived from root explants. TSA-treated root explants exhibited pronounced callus greening and substantially increasing in multiple shoot formations per callus compared with the control group. Additionally, TSA treatment upregulated shoot apical meristem-specific genes, including WUSCHELL (WUS), RELATED TO AP2.6 L (Rap2.6 L), SHOOT MERISTEMLESS (STM), CUP SHAPED COTYLEDON 2 (CUC2). Notably, TSA treatment enhanced the sensitivity to cytokinins, leading to increase expression of the cytokinin signaling reporter TCS::GFP in the callus. Concomitantly, type-B ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATOR (ARR) 10 and 12, which are key regulators of cytokinin signaling, were upregulated in TSA-treated callus, whereas the downstream targets of type-B ARRs, such as ARR5, ARR7, and ARR15, were significantly upregulated during shoot regeneration. Furthermore, mutants deficient in ARR10 and ARR12 showed diminished responsiveness to shoot regenerative capacity, a phenotype that was enhanced by TSA treatment. Our findings underscore the crucial role of histone deacetylation in mediating cytokinin responses and controlling de novo shoot regeneration in plants."
"This study uncovers the role of H4K8hib as an active epigenetic mark in rice that positively correlates with gene expression and enhances immune responses. Furthermore, HDA705 was identified as the key enzyme regulating H4K8hib. Mutation of HDA705 led to hyper-H4K8hib, which in turn activated the expression of defense-related genes and enhanced rice resistance to pathogens."

"Secondary hyperparathyroidism (sHPT) is a significant clinical complication of CKD leading to bone abnormalities and cardiovascular disease. Current treatment based on activating the parathyroid calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) using calcimimetics such as Cinacalcet, aims to decrease plasma PTH levels and inhibit the progression of parathyroid hyperplasia. In the present study, we found significant diurnal rhythmicity of Casr, encoding the Cinacalcet drug target in hyperplastic parathyroid glands (p = 0.006). In rats with sHPT, Cinacalcet treatment timed prior to the acrophase of Casr expression (chronotherapy: Cina1) was compared with the usual timing of treatment early in the active phase (conventional: Cina2). Without Cinacalcet treatment, induction of sHPT resulted in a significant increase in parathyroid proliferation in terms of Ki-67+ cells compared to that of control rats (p = 0.001). Conventional Cinacalcet treatment (Cina2) did not significantly reduce Ki-67 index compared to untreated rats with sHPT (p = 0.09). In contrast, chronotherapy treatment (Cina1) resulted in a marked inhibition of parathyroid proliferation by Ki-67+ cells compared to untreated rats with sHPT (p = 0.0001). We found significantly reduced parathyroid Ki-67 index using chronotherapy compared to conventional timing of Cinacalcet (Cina1 vs. Cina2: 0.92±0.14% vs. 2.46±0.37%, p = 0.006). Transcriptomic analysis showed that the reduced proliferation of Cina1 was associated with downregulation of genes involved in mitotic activity, together with an increased adaptive response of energy metabolism, as evident from upregulated pathways of Oxidative phosphorylation and TCA cycle compared to the untreated uremic group. Conclusively, it is shown that the inhibitory effect of Cinacalcet on parathyroid cell proliferation is markedly impacted by the timing of administration, suggesting a possible benefit of using chronotherapy in Cinacalcet treatment of sHPT."
"Bletilla striata polysaccharide (BSP) has attracted considerable interest due to its diverse biological activities. In this research, a novel low-molecular-weight water-soluble polysaccharide (BSP-182) was isolated and purified from Bletilla striata tubers, and its structure was characterized. The findings indicated that BSP-182 is predominantly composed of β-1,4-linked glucose (Glc) and β-1,4-linked mannose (Man) in a molar ratio of approximately 7.8:2.2. Additionally, hyaluronic acid (HA)/BSP-182 hydrogels were synthesized, and their physicochemical properties and structure were examined. Rheological analysis revealed that HA and BSP-182 form hydrogels via hydrogen bonding, with concentration-dependent enhancements in rheological properties, textural attributes, and thermal stability. The hydrogels displayed significant shear-thinning behavior and viscoelasticity, which are beneficial for food processing and texture modification, especially in the development of easy-to-swallow foods. This research offers valuable insights for the development of innovative BSP-based hydrogels for dysphagia management."

"Sooty moulds are saprophytic epiphytic fungi that grow mostly on insect secretions, but they can also be associated with plant secretions. In this study, we aimed to describe de interaction of Capnodium alfenasii sooty mould with the extrafloral shoot nectaries of Azadirachta indica. Anatomical and histochemical studies were carried out on serial sections of extrafloral shoot nectaries of A. indica without and with C. alfenasii infestation. The total soluble sugar content of the secreted nectar was determined, and the conidial germination of the fungus in distilled water and in dextrose and nectar solutions was evaluated. The shoot nectaries of A. indica are elongated structures that occur in pairs near the base of the petiole. The exuded nectar contains an average of 534.8 µg of total soluble sugars per µL of nectar and provides ideal conditions for conidial germination and fungal growth. C. alfenasii hyphae grow on the nectary, penetrate through breaks in the cuticle, travel under the cuticle and penetrate the secretory tissue by inter- and intracellular routes. The present report is the first to describe the interaction of C. alfenasii with the A. indica nectary, including the penetration of hyphae into nectariferous tissues and the plant defence mechanisms."
"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most prevalent endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age worldwide, and its related features like obesity, mental health issues and hyperandrogenism may contribute to inadequately investigated health problems such as sexual dysfunction (SD) and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Therefore, this study examined the impact of PCOS on sexual function (SF) and lower urinary tract in Syrian women by recruiting a total of 178 women of reproductive age, of whom 88 were diagnosed with PCOS according to the Rotterdam criteria and 90 without PCOS were considered as the control group. Female sexual function index (FSFI) and Bristol Female Lower Urinary Tract Symptom Questionnaire (BFLUTS) were used to assess SF and LUTS respectively. PCOS group had higher SD prevalence compared to control group (65.9% vs 48.9%, p = 0.016), and BMI showed an inverse correlation with the total FSFI score in PCOS group (p = 0.027, r = -0.235). Furthermore, PCOS group exhibited significantly lower scores in orgasm and satisfaction subdomains. Additionally, PCOS patients had significantly higher total BFLUTS score compared to control group (median 8 vs 5, p = 0.025). Thus, PCOS may be related to SD and LUTS, highlighting the importance of evaluating SF and urinary symptoms in PCOS patients."
"Receptor Interacting Serine/Threonine Kinase 1 (RIPK1) is widely expressed and integral to inflammatory and cell death responses. Autosomal recessive RIPK1-deficiency, due to biallelic loss of function mutations in RIPK1, is a rare inborn error of immunity (IEI) resulting in uncontrolled necroptosis, apoptosis and inflammation. Although hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has been suggested as a potential curative therapy, the extent to which disease may be driven by extra-hematopoietic effects of RIPK1-deficiency, which are non-amenable to HSCT, is not clear. We present a multi-centre, international review of an additional 5 RIPK1-deficient children who underwent HSCT. All patients presented with very early onset inflammatory bowel disease, 2 also suffered from inflammatory arthritis. Median age at transplant was 3 years (range 1-5 years); 1 received matched sibling marrow, 1 matched unrelated peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC), 2 TCRαβ/CD19-depleted PBSC from maternal-haploidentical donors, and 1 had TCRαβ/CD19-depleted PBSC from a mismatched unrelated donor. All received reduced-toxicity conditioning, based on treosulfan (n = 4) or busulfan (n = 1); 1 patient underwent a successful second transplant following autologous reconstitution. Four of five patients (80%) survived; 1 child died due to multi-drug resistant pseudomonas infection and multi-organ failure. With a median duration of 14 months follow-up, 2 survivors were disease-free, and 2 had substantially improving enteropathy. These findings demonstrated that HSCT is a potential curative therapy for RIPK1-deficiency."
"Obesity and its associated intestinal inflammatory responses represent a significant global challenge. (IF) is a dietary intervention demonstrating various health benefits, including weight loss, enhanced metabolic health, and increased longevity. However, its effect on the intestinal inflammation induced by high-fat diet (HFD) is still not fully comprehended. Thirty-four male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into three groups: Control (fed standard chow diet for 24 weeks); the HFD group (fed HFD for 24 weeks); and the HFD + IF group (fed HFD for 12 weeks, followed by an alternate day regimen of fasting and HFD for 12 weeks). The results revealed that IF significantly reduced body weight, food intake, and blood glucose levels compared to the HFD group. Furthermore, rats undergoing the intermittent fasting regimen exhibited a significant reduction in resting time, along with increased durations of grooming and exploration when compared to those on HFD. IF significantly reduced HFD-induced intestinal oxidative stress by lowering malondialdehyde levels and substantially increasing intestinal total antioxidant capacity, consistent with histopathological findings of gastric and intestinal tissues. The investigation of the underlying mechanisms revealed that IF significantly increased the intestinal expression of Farnesoid X receptor (FXR), glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), and melanocortin-4 receptors (MC4R), with a significant decrease in gastrointestinal peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) compared to the HFD group. The findings indicate that IF can mitigate HFD-induced intestinal inflammation via the FXR/GLP-1/MC4R/ PPAR-γ pathway. This highlights the need for further research to elucidate these mechanisms."

"BcABA3 is an unusual sesquiterpene synthase that lacks the conserved DDxxD and DTE/NSE motifs. Despite this, it can catalyze the conversion of farnesyl diphosphate to 2Z,4E-α-ionylideneethane. We used structure prediction, multiscale simulations, and site-directed mutagenesis experiments to investigate BcABA3 and its catalytic mechanism. BcABA3 has structural similarity to typical class I terpenoid cyclases in its active site. Based on simulation results, we identified two discontinuous glutamate residues, E124 and E88, which compensate for the absence of the aspartate-rich DDxxD motif. Quantum chemical calculations show that BcABA3 adopts a direct rotation mechanism for allyl cation isomerization rather than via the nerolidyl diphosphate. Then, it can achieve a successive proton transfer reaction, which is difficult to achieve by intramolecular rearrangement via the protruding outward carbonyl oxygen of A206. This reaction is then directed forward by two relatively stable intermediates containing a cation-conjugated double-bond structure. E124 is also proposed as the proton receptor in the final deprotonation to couple this step with 2Z,4E-α-ionylideneethane release. These findings provide valuable insight into the catalytic mechanisms of BcABA3 and can aid in its engineering, which will facilitate studies of abscisic acid biosynthesis."
"Bacterial persisters are a subpopulation of multidrug-tolerant cells capable of surviving and resuming activity after exposure to bactericidal antibiotic concentrations, contributing to relapsing infections and the development of antibiotic resistance. In this study, we challenge the conventional view that persisters are metabolically dormant by providing compelling evidence that an isogenic population of Escherichia coli remains metabolically active in persistence."
The opioid epidemic is leading to increased opioid use in adolescent populations. A growing body of evidence suggests that taking opioids during adolescence can disrupt normal development and impact future offspring. This study investigates the impact of paternal morphine exposure during adolescence on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and release of endorphins in the offspring.
This study aimed to identify a novel recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) capsid variant that can widely transfect the deep retina through intravitreal injection and to assess their effectiveness and safety in gene delivery.
"To synthesize the evidence on the efficacy and safety of teclistamab in treating relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). A systematic search for records published from inception until June 2024 was conducted on PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and Google Scholar databases. Five studies with 661 RRMM patients were included in the analysis. The pooled results showed that teclistamab led to an overall response rate (ORR) of 62.8% (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 58.6-66.8), a ≥ very good partial response or better (VGPR) of 52.1% (95% CI: 46.8-57.3), and a ≥ complete response or better (CR) of 29.5% (95% CI: 21.9-38.4). When the ORR was assessed in different subgroups, we found that patients with extramedullary disease (EMD) had considerably lower ORR than those without EMD (45% vs. 71%, p < 0.0001). The ORR was significantly lower in patients with prior (B-cell maturation antigen) BCMA-directed therapy (OR: 2.24, p = 0.002) and those with stage III disease (OR: 3.69, p = 0.0001). However, the subgroup analyses showed no considerable difference in the ORR between patients with high or standard-risk cytogenetics (OR: 1.05 p = 0.82) and those with penta-drug or triple-class-refractory disease (OR: 0.97 p = 0.89). Regarding the safety of teclistamab, the pooled results showed that the incidence of grade ≥ 3 adverse events was high (90.7%). However, grade ≥ 3 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxic events were low (1.5% and 2.2%, respectively). RRMM patients treated with teclistamab display good response rates."
"Correct measurement results from in vitro diagnostic (IVD) medical devices (MD) are crucial for optimal patient care. The performance of IVD-MDs is often assessed through method comparison studies. Such studies can be compromised by the influence of various factors. The effect of these factors must be examined in every method comparison study, for example, nonselectivity differences between compared IVD-MDs are examined. Historically, selectivity or nonselectivity has been defined as a qualitative term. However, a quantification of nonselectivity differences between IVD-MDs is needed. This paper fills this need by introducing a novel measure for quantifying differences in nonselectivity (DINS) between a pair of IVD-MDs. Assuming one of the IVD-MDs involved in the comparison exhibits high selectivity for the analyte, it becomes feasible to quantify nonselectivity in the other IVD-MD by employing this DINS measure. Our approach leverages elements from univariate ordinary least squares regression and incorporates repeatability IVD-MD variances, resulting in a normalized measure. We also introduce a plug-in estimator for this measure, which is notably linked to the average relative increase in prediction interval widths attributable to DINS. This connection is exploited to establish a criterion for identifying excessive DINS utilizing a proof-of-hazard approach. Utilizing Monte Carlo simulations, we investigate how the estimator relates to population characteristics like DINS and heteroskedasticity. We find that DINS impacts the mean, variance, and 99th percentile of the estimator, while heteroskedasticity affects only the latter two, and to a considerably smaller extent compared to DINS. Importantly, the size of the study design modulates these effects. We also confirm, when using clinical data, that DINS between pairs of IVD-MDs influence the estimator correspondingly to those of simulated data. Thus, the proposed estimator serves as an effective metric for quantifying DINS between IVD-MDs and helping to determine the quality of a method comparison study."
"A-to-I RNA editing is the most common non-transient epitranscriptome modification. It plays several roles in human physiology and has been linked to several disorders. Large-scale deep transcriptome sequencing has fostered the characterization of A-to-I editing at the single nucleotide level and the development of dedicated computational resources. REDIportal is a unique and specialized database collecting ∼16 million of putative A-to-I editing sites designed to face the current challenges of epitranscriptomics. Its running version has been enriched with sites from the TCGA project (using data from 31 studies). REDIportal provides an accurate, sustainable and accessible tool enriched with interconnections with widespread ELIXIR core resources such as Ensembl, RNAcentral, UniProt and PRIDE. Additionally, REDIportal now includes information regarding RNA editing in putative double-stranded RNAs, relevant for the immune-related roles of editing, as well as an extended catalog of recoding events. Finally, we report a reliability score per site calculated using a deep learning model trained using a huge collection of positive and negative instances. REDIportal is available at http://srv00.recas.ba.infn.it/atlas/."
It is still unknown if the double-femoral tunnel technique (Arciero [ARC]) provides better stability as compared with the single-femoral tunnel technique (modified Larson [LAR]) in posterolateral corner reconstruction. The ideal angle of fixation of the popliteofibular strand in ARC is also unknown.
"Burn wounds are challenging to treat due to considerable tissue damage and fluid loss. Creating wound dressings from natural and biological materials makes it possible to treat wounds and promote rapid epithelialization to speed healing and restore skin function. As a result, the ability of a collagen scaffold (Col) made from rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and putative bioactive phytochemical components from a Sargassum glaucescens (S. glaucescens) extract (SGE) to promote burn wound healing was assessed in this work. Synthesized collagen (40 mg/ml)/SGE (1-3 mg/ml) samples were then characterized physiochemically and physiologically. The physicochemical examination validated the bioactive component of SGE, the type of collagen (type I, α1, and α2), the successful incorporation of SGE into collagen scaffolds (Col/SGE), the thermal stability, and excellent hydrophilicity and water absorption capacity of produced scaffolds. Moreover, biological experiments approved the excellent antioxidant and antibacterial activity of SGE, structural stability improvement against degradation, and cell proliferation enhancement without cell toxicity. The results showed the Col/SGE 3 mg/ml sample also had the highest level of cell activity, according to the antibacterial and cell viability assays. Additionally, using Col/SGE in vivo on burn wounds in rat models demonstrated a quicker rate of wound healing with stronger re-epithelialization and dermal remodeling, fewer inflammatory cells, more fibroblast cells, and great collagen buildup. Therefore, since the collagen/SGE scaffold is structurally stable and can potentially promote cell proliferation without causing cell toxicity, the acquired results suggested that it may significantly impact wound healing."
"Tirapazamine (TPZ), an antitumor prodrug, can be activated in hypoxic environment. It specifically targets the hypoxic microenvironment of tumors and produces toxic free radicals. However, due to the tumor is not completely hypoxic, TPZ often fails to effectively treat the entire tumor tissue, resulting in suboptimal therapeutic outcomes. Herein, a low pathogenic Escherichia coli TOP10 is utilized to selectively colonize tumor tissues, disrupt blood vessels, and induce thrombus formation, leading to the expansion of hypoxic region and improving the therapeutic effect of TPZ. Additionally, a thermosensitive hydrogel is constructed by Pluronic F-127 (F127), which undergoes gelation in situ at the tumor site, resulting in sustained release of TPZ. To monitor the therapeutic process, it is genetically modified TOP10 by integrating the bioluminescent system luxCDABE (TOP10-Lux). The bioluminescent signal is associated with tumor hypoxia enhancement and thrombus formation, which is beneficial for therapeutic monitoring with bioluminescence imaging. In the murine colon cancer model, the TOP10-Lux combined with TPZ-loaded F127 hydrogel effectively suppressed tumor growth, and the treatment process is efficiently monitored. Together, this work employs genetically modified TOP10-Lux to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of TPZ and monitor the treatment process, providing an effective strategy for bacteria-based tumor-targeted chemotherapy and treatment monitoring."
"Anhedonia, a core symptom of depression, has been defined as the loss of pleasure or lack of reactivity to pleasurable stimuli. Considering the relevance of alpha asymmetry to MDD and anhedonia, we explored the effect of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) stimulation on frontal and posterior EEG alpha asymmetry (FAA and PAA, respectively), in this exploratory investigation. 61 participants randomly received sham (n = 11), bilateral (BS; n = 25), or unilateral stimulation (US; n = 25) of the DLPFC. The Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS) was administered. FAA and PAA were calculated by subtracting the natural log-transformed alpha power of the right (F8 or T6) from that of the left (F7 or T5) EEG channel. Furthermore, alpha peak was defined as the frequency where alpha power was at its maximum. BS and US both reduced anhedonia symptoms in the active compared to the sham group. Even non-responders in the BS group showed a decreased anhedonia. Interestingly in the BS group, only the patients who showed a right-lateralized FAA or PAA at baseline showed a reduction in anhedonia. However, in the US group, only patients with left-lateralized FAA or right-lateralized PAA showed a decrease in anhedonia. PAA at baseline predicted symptoms post treatment. Furthermore, a significant positive correlation between baseline alpha peak values and SHAPS scores post treatment were found in the BS group. PAA was a better predictor of anhedonia and reduction of depressive symptoms in both groups. BS may produce larger effects with regard to anhedonia."
"Osteoarthritis (OA) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are prevalent chronic conditions with emerging evidence suggesting a potential link.

"As digital healthcare evolves, the security of electronic health records (EHR) becomes increasingly crucial. This study presents the GPT-Onto-CAABAC framework, integrating Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT), medical-legal ontologies and Context-Aware Attribute-Based Access Control (CAABAC) to enhance EHR access security. Unlike traditional models, GPT-Onto-CAABAC dynamically interprets policies and adapts to changing healthcare and legal environments, offering customized access control solutions. Through empirical evaluation, this framework is shown to be effective in improving EHR security by accurately aligning access decisions with complex regulatory and situational requirements. The findings suggest its broader applicability in sectors where access control must meet stringent compliance and adaptability standards."
"While it is commonly known that patients with rheumatologic diseases can have esophageal dysfunction, this association is insufficiently understood. The aim is to determine the prevalence and characteristics of esophageal motility disorders in patients with rheumatic diseases. This is a single-center retrospective study of adults with rheumatologic disease who underwent high-resolution esophageal manometry (HREM). Those with and without a motility disorder (defined per Chicago classification CCv3.0 criteria, given the timing of the prior studies) were compared and multivariable logistic regression was used to determine odds of motility disorder by rheumatic disease. Of 289 patients, the mean age was 60.5 ± 13.8 years. Rheumatic diseases included Raynaud's (42%), rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (39%), Sjogren's (21%), systemic lupus erythematous (19%), systemic sclerosis (17%), and mixed connective tissue disease (13%). On HREM, 58% had an esophageal motility disorder: achalasia (5%), EGJ outflow obstruction (20%), jackhammer (8%), diffuse esophageal spasm (1%), ineffective esophageal motility (28%), and fragmented peristalsis (2%). Of note, 50% of the sample with a normal barium swallow had an esophageal dysmotility disorder on HREM. Those with psoriatic arthritis were less likely to have esophageal dysmotility (73% vs. 27%; P = 0.04). There was decreased odds of esophageal hypocontractility in those with RA (OR [95%CI]: 0.27 [0.12-0.58]) and increased odds (OR [95%CI]: 3.13 [1.16-8.41]) of esophageal hypocontractility among those with scleroderma. Esophageal motor disorders were found in more than half of patients with rheumatologic diseases who underwent HREM. HREM should be considered in patients with rheumatic conditions presenting with esophageal symptoms."
"Radioprotectors are synthetic compounds, natural products, or biological agents that are administered before irradiation to protect normal cells against ionizing radiation (IR)-induced injuries. We have designed novel hybrid (E)-kojyl-styryl-sulfones 10a-n by applying the pharmacophore hybridization strategy to combine key structural motifs of the natural antioxidant kojic acid and the emerging radioprotector Ex-RAD (recilisib sodium). These hybrids were successfully synthesized and characterized with (E)-geometry. In vitro radioprotective activity along with the corresponding O-benzylated and O-methoxylated derivatives (9a-n, 14, and 15) was evaluated on human foreskin fibroblast 1 (HFF-1) cells irradiated with a 10-Gy dose of X-rays. In particular, hybrids 10b, 10d, 10f, 10g, and 10n exhibited the highest radioprotection effect at the 10 µM concentration, more effective than the parent compounds. It should be noted that the 3,4,5-trimethoxystyryl analog 10n was the most effective compound. Surprisingly, the O-benzylated 3,4,5-trimethoxystyryl analog (9n) also showed an excellent radioprotective effect. Moreover, the antioxidant evaluation of these selected hybrids on the IR-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and lipid peroxidation in the HFF-1 cells revealed that they could significantly downregulate IR-induced oxidative stress in the HFF-1 cells, while mechanistically recilisib is not a well-established ROS scavenger. The obtained results suggest that these privileged (E)-kojyl-styryl-sulfones can serve as promising radioprotectors for further studies and development."

"Non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) is a relatively unknown complication of injecting sublingual Suboxone (buprenorphine/naloxone). Buprenorphine/naloxone should be taken as a sublingual tablet or a buccal film and not injected, so its effects from this mode of administration are not well known. While the differential diagnosis for chest pain is very broad, many practitioners do not associate chest pain with the use of buprenorphine/naloxone. We recommend considering serial electrocardiograms (ECGs) and high-sensitivity troponins for a patient who presents with chest pain after buprenorphine/naloxone use."
"Being the second leading cause of death globally, cancer has been a long-standing and rapidly evolving focus of biomedical research and practice in the world. Recently, there has been growing interest in cyanobacteria. This focus is particularly evident in developing innovative anticancer treatments to reduce reliance on traditional chemotherapy. This study investigates the anticancer potential of the Spirulina maxima extract nanoemulsion (SMNE) technique to improve the delivery, stability, and solubility of the S. maxima extract (SME). SMNE, prepared in three concentrations (SMNEC1, SMNEC2, SMNEC3), was characterized and confirmed to successfully load SME into silica-coated nanoparticles. Cytotoxicity tests on HepG2 and MCF-7 cell lines revealed a significant reduction in cell viability after 48-hour SMNE treatment, with IC50 values of 1488 µg/mL and 1721.936 µg/mL, respectively. SMNE also demonstrated efficacy in inhibiting tumor growth in mice with Ehrlich ascites carcinoma, normalizing alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels, and reducing oxidative stress markers such as catalase (CAT) and malondialdehyde (MDA). Histopathological examination showed that SMNEC3-treated groups had almost normal liver architecture. Additionally, SMNE downregulated oncogenic miR-221-3p and miR-222-3p, activating cancer suppression genes p27 and PTEN. The study concludes that SMNE, with its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties and ability to modulate key miRNAs, enhances SME delivery and shows promise as an effective cancer treatment."
"Phytochrome Interacting Factor 4 (PIF4) plays a central role in coordinating plant growth regulation by integrating multiple environmental cues. However, studies on whether and how PIF4 regulates plant immunity have inconsistent findings. In this study, we investigated the role of PIF4 in disease resistance against Pst DC3000 by characterizing its loss-of-function mutants using different inoculation strategies. Our findings reveal that pif4 mutants exhibit enhanced disease resistance with spray inoculation but not with infiltration inoculation compared to wild-type plants, and that mutants displayed more closed stomata apertures, indicating that PIF4 promotes stomatal opening. Importantly, expression of PIF4 by a guard-cell-specific promoter was sufficient to restore disease resistance to the wild-type level in the pif4 mutant. Additionally, PIF4 overexpression enhances disease symptom development independent of disease resistance and chlorophyll degradation, while the loss of PIF4 function leads to higher chlorophyll accumulation. Thus, our findings highlight a crucial function of PIF4 in regulating stomata-mediated disease resistance and chlorophyll accumulation, providing new insights into the connection of growth and defense in plants."
"This commentary adds elements of analysis from the new evolutionary sociology that might help to support the mythologic hypothesis.

"Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in fungi is less understood despite its significance in prokaryotes. In this study, we systematically searched for HGT events in 829 representative fungal genomes. Using a combination of sequence similarity and phylogeny-based approaches, we detected 20,093 prokaryotic-derived transferred genes across 750 fungal genomes, via 8,815 distinct HGT events. Notably, our analysis revealed that eight lifestyle-related traits significantly influence HGT diversity in fungi. For instance, parasites exhibited the highest estimated number of HGT-acquired genes, followed by saprotrophs, with symbionts showing the lowest. HGT-acquired genes were predominantly associated with metabolism and cellular functions and underwent purifying selection. Moreover, horizontally transferred genes with introns have significantly higher expression levels compared to intron-lacking genes, suggesting a probable role of intron gains in the adaptation of HGT-acquired genes. Overall, our findings highlight the influence of lifestyle on HGT diversity in fungi and underscore the substantial contribution of HGT to fungal adaptation."

"Noninferiority of omitting intraoperative defibrillation threshold (DFT) testing has been documented for transvenous implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD) whereas data for the subcutaneous-ICD (S-ICD) regarding the need for DFT testing, especially during S-ICD generator replacement, is not available."
Acute postsurgical pain after cardiac surgery is challenging to treat. Adverse effects related to the high dose opioids which have traditionally been used perioperatively in cardiac surgery have led to the adoption of alternative analgesic strategies. This review aims to highlight current evidence-based approaches to managing pain after cardiac surgery.
"Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of mortality among individuals with noncommunicable diseases worldwide. Obesity is associated with an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD). Mitochondria are integral to the cardiovascular system, and it has been reported that mitochondrial transfer is associated with the pathogenesis of multiple CVDs and obesity. This review offers a comprehensive examination of the relevance of mitochondrial transfer to cardiovascular health and disease, emphasizing the critical functions of mitochondria in energy metabolism and signal transduction within the cardiovascular system. This highlights how disruptions in mitochondrial transfer contribute to various CVDs, such as myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathies, and hypertension. Additionally, we provide an overview of the molecular mechanisms governing mitochondrial transfer and its potential implications for CVD treatment. This finding underscores the therapeutic potential of mitochondrial transfer and addresses the various mechanisms and challenges in its implementation. By delving into mitochondrial transfer and its targeted modulation, this review aims to advance our understanding of cardiovascular disease treatment, presenting new insights and potential therapeutic strategies in this evolving field."
Patient-reported outcomes reflecting quality of life (QOL) and hope are essential targets for in-home medical care. This study examined the association between the quality of patient-centred care and both QOL and hope.
"Small for gestational age is defined as birthweight <10th percentile on standardised age and sex-specific growth charts. Rapid catch-up growth seen post-natal is associated with adiposity and cardiometabolic syndromes later in life. Breastfeeding has positive effects on growth in premature and low-birthweight infants. Therefore, examining the impact of exclusive breastfeeding on growth parameters in small for gestational age infants is important."
"Lung fibrosis development utilizes alveolar macrophages, with mechanisms that are incompletely understood. Here, we fate map connective tissue during mouse lung fibrosis and observe disassembly and transfer of connective tissue macromolecules from pleuro-alveolar junctions (PAJs) into deep lung tissue, to activate fibroblasts and fibrosis. Disassembly and transfer of PAJ macromolecules into deep lung tissue occurs by alveolar macrophages, activating cysteine-type proteolysis on pleural mesothelium. The PAJ niche and the disassembly cascade is active in patient lung biopsies, persists in chronic fibrosis models, and wanes down in acute fibrosis models. Pleural-specific viral therapeutic carrying the cysteine protease inhibitor Cystatin A shuts down PAJ disassembly, reverses fibrosis and regenerates chronic fibrotic lungs. Targeting PAJ disassembly by targeting the pleura may provide a unique therapeutic avenue to treat lung fibrotic diseases."
"Embryonic hematopoietic cells develop in the fetal liver (FL), surrounded by diverse non-hematopoietic stromal cells. However, the spatial organization and cytokine production patterns of the stroma during FL development remain poorly understood. Here, we characterized and mapped the hematopoietic and stromal cell populations at early (E12.5-14.5) FL stages, revealing that while hepatoblasts were the primary source of hematopoietic growth factors, other stromal cells-including mesenchymal, mesothelial, and endothelial cells-also contributed to this signaling network. Using a dedicated image analysis pipeline, we quantified cell distances to tissue structures and defined neighbor relationships, uncovering that different hematopoietic progenitors exhibit distinct preferences for neighboring stromal cells and show developmental changes in spatial distribution. Notably, our data suggest that the sub-mesothelium region plays a prominent role in early fetal hematopoiesis. This approach offers a valuable tool for studying complex cellular interactions in biological systems, providing new insights into hematopoietic niche organization during development."

"Partnerships between Tribes and researchers in wildlife monitoring and application of Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) have taken a variety of forms, and some scholars have noted a need for culturally sensitive approaches. Guided by Indigenous Research Methodologies, this research is coupled with Yurok TEK, or hlkelonah 'ue-megetohl ('to take care of the earth'), enabling an applied, culturally sensitive approach in partnership with the Yurok Tribe. We present results from a molecular scatology study of wildlife within the ancestral territory of the Yurok Tribe. Scats were collected opportunistically on road transects. All samples (N = 132) were analysed via DNA barcoding and results matched to documented 'Oohl 'we-toh (Yurok language) names to determine the depositor species (N = 8). Though there were four focal mesocarnivore species in our study, only bobcat (Chmuuek; Lynx rufus) and gray fox (Wergers; Urocyon cinereoargenteus) were detected as depositor species. Post hoc analyses were conducted to explore distribution, habitat use and selection in a use-availability context, and food habits of these two species. We found almost complete separation of bobcat and gray fox use of transects, as well as indication of partitioning of vegetation cover types and food. We demonstrate an integrated framework of Western and Indigenous sciences that allows the Indigenous researcher to transcend structured academic disciplinary boundaries. Our approach can be modified for partnerships between Tribes, agencies, academics and students for wildlife monitoring in broader geographic regions in various research applications."

"Carbon fiber-reinforced plastics (CFRP) are leading functional materials with superior strength and low mass density compared to metal. Our previous factory site analyses found that CFRP processing generates fibrous debris and fine micro/nano-sized particles of various shapes. The present interventional study was conducted at a factory located in Japan and evaluated debris consisting of various-sized particles generated during the industrial processing of CFRP, such as cutting, grinding, and turning of CFRP pipes, using real-time particle monitoring devices of the following: PM4 Digital Dust Monitor (DDM), handled Optical Particle Counter (OPC), Condensation Particle Counter (CPC), and Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS). In addition, personal exposure of workers was evaluated using a novel wearable PM2.5-compatible device (P-sensor). First, we confirmed the presence of micro/nano particles in the dust generated during industrial processing of CFRP. Finer CFRP-generated particles were detected by the nanoparticle-compatible devices; CPC and SMPS, but not by OPC or DDM. The dynamic detection pattern of the P-sensor resembled that recorded by the nanoparticle-compatible devices. The novel wearable P-sensor can be used to measure finer particles generated by CFRP processing in occupational settings. Second, the exposure assessment was conducted twice and the levels of the micro/nano particles in the second survey were significantly (less than half) lower than that in the first survey. By avoiding immediate power-off of the exhaust system after operations, the scattering of particles was effectively reduced. Our results indicate that effective use of local exhaust ventilation system improves the workplace environment for particle exposure."
"In recent years, significant advances have been made in understanding the intricate details of the mechanisms underlying alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT). Studies of a specialized DNA strand break repair mechanism, known as break-induced replication, and the advent of telomere-specific DNA damaging strategies and proteomic methodologies to profile the ribonucleoprotein composition of telomeres enabled the discovery of networks of proteins that coordinate the stepwise homology-directed DNA repair and DNA synthesis processes of ALT. These networks couple mediators of homologous recombination, DNA template-switching, long-range template-directed DNA synthesis, and DNA strand resolution with SUMO-dependent liquid condensate formation to create discrete nuclear bodies where telomere extension occurs. This review will discuss the recent findings of how these networks may cooperate to mediate telomere extension by the ALT mechanism and their impact on telomere function and integrity in ALT cancer cells."

"Endocrine disruptors (EDs) can mimic or interfere with hormones in the body, leading to non-communicable diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. Susceptibility to EDs increases during prenatal and postnatal life, a critical time window. This review aims to summarize the latest evidence on the relation of early life exposure to some EDs with obesity and the other metabolic disorders.  RECENT FINDINGS: There is increasing evidence that early life exposure to EDs may impair adipogenesis by increasing the number and size of adipocytes, thereby increasing susceptibility to obesity in childhood. It is stated that exposure to EDs during the prenatal and postnatal period may raise the risk of type 2 diabetes in adulthood by disrupting glucose, lipid, and insulin homeostasis in the offspring. They can also accelerate the development of type 1 diabetes through various mechanisms, like immunomodulation, gut microbiota, and vitamin D pathways. There is a growing understanding that ED exposure during critical stages of life could play an important role in the development of obesity and metabolic disorders. We suggest setting national goals, global standards, and policies to reduce environmental exposure to pregnant and lactating women, and babies, considered sensitive populations."

Social media use has been shown to be effective in maintaining social connections and improving older adults' psychosocial outcomes. This study aimed to systematically review and synthesize current research on this topic.
"The Nipah virus (NiV) poses a pressing global threat to public health due to its high mortality rate, multiple modes of transmission, and lack of effective treatments. NiV glycoprotein G (NiV-G) emerges as a promising target for the discovery of NiV drugs because of its essential role in viral entry and membrane fusion. Therefore, in this study, we applied an integrated computational and biophysics approach to identify potential inhibitors of NiV-G within a curated dataset of Peruvian phytochemicals. The virtual screening results indicated that these compounds could represent a natural source of potential NiV-G inhibitors with ΔG values ranging from -8 to -11 kcal/mol. Among them, procyanidin B2, B3, B7, and C1 exhibited the highest binding affinities and formed the most molecular interactions with NiV-G. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed the induced-fit mechanism of NiV-G pocket interaction with these procyanidins, primarily driven by its hydrophobic nature. Non-equilibrium free energy calculations were used to determine binding affinities, highlighting Procyanidin B3 and B2 as the ligands with the most substantial interactions. In general, this work underscores the potential of Peruvian phytochemicals, particularly procyanidins B2, B3, B7, and C1, as lead compounds for developing anti-NiV drugs through an integrated computational biophysics approach."
"PEG10 is a retroelement-derived Mart-family gene that is necessary for placentation and has been implicated in neurological disease. PEG10 resembles both retrotransposon and retroviral proteins and forms virus-like particles (VLPs) that can be purified using iodixanol ultracentrifugation. It is hypothesized that formation of VLPs is crucial to the biological roles of PEG10 in reproduction and neurological health. Here, we describe the regulation of PEG10 VLP formation and release in human cells with a role for the related Mart gene RTL8. RTL8 resembles a truncated form of PEG10 that shares homology with the N-terminal gag-like capsid domain. Alone, RTL8 is unable to form VLPs, but was incorporated into PEG10-derived particles. RTL8 co-expression decreased the abundance of PEG10 VLPs and increased intracellular levels of PEG10, suggesting a model where RTL8 inhibits PEG10 VLP formation or release. Consistent with this model, RTL8 bound to the N-terminal domain of PEG10 capsid, and modulation of RTL8 influenced PEG10-derived VLP abundance in naturally producing cells. RTL8 is broadly expressed in many of the same tissues as PEG10, including in human brain. Taken together, these results describe a novel antagonistic relationship between two human retroelement-derived genes and have implications for our understanding of PEG10 biology and disease."

"Postoperative pseudomeningocele is a rare, but still existing, complication after spinal surgeries. It may be asymptomatic or presented with back pain, radicular pain or headaches. Many pseudomeningoceles resolve spontaneously, others require revision surgery with dural repair. We present a female patient who underwent duroplasty treatment for a massive postoperative lumbar pseudomeningocele measuring 22.57 cm in length after broad laminectomy. A 71-year-old female with previous thoracolumbar T10-L5 instrumentation surgery, underwent a L2-5 broad laminectomy due to severe canal stenosis at the L2-5 level. Intraoperatively, an accidental spotted durotomy occurred at the level of L4-5. Primary repair was not feasible, so artificial dura was placed. Postoperatively the patient presented with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak, which was treated with external lumbar drain and bedrest. Three months later, our patient presented to our outpatient clinic with a large 15 cm long bulging mass at the surgical site without any neurological deficit. A lumbar CT scan was conducted and a gigantic lumbar pseudomeningocele of 22.57 cm length and 6.29 cm width from the level of T11 to S2 was observed. We performed a revision surgery with duroplasty and there was no recurrence of CSF leak or pseudomeningocele after 7 months follow-up."
"Affordable and eco-friendly green spectrofluorometric (FL) methods can enhance the safety and cost-effectiveness of quality assurance and control in ascorbic acid (ASA) formulations. However, most current techniques for ASA analysis have faced challenges like complexity, delayed response times, low throughput, time-consuming procedures, and requirements for expensive equipment and hazardous chemicals for analyte modification. The study is aimed at producing natural carbon quantum dots (NACQDs) from pumpkin seed peels (PSPs), a natural waste material, using a rapid microwave-assisted method. A variety of techniques, including transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, were employed to characterize the PSP-based NACQDs. The NACQDs were used as probes for FL analysis of ASA, where the addition of ASA caused fluorescence quenching of the NACQDs. The developed method demonstrated good linearity (r = 0.996), sensitivity, accuracy (percentage recovery ranging from 99.36% to 100.35%), and precision (%RSD less than 0.21%) in the quantification of ASA in the range of 0.3-15 μg/mL. The method's LOD and LOQ values were 0.1 and 0.3 μg/mL, respectively. The successful analysis of ASA in tablet formulations demonstrated the practicality of the proposed method. Greenness assessment tools highlighted its superior eco-friendliness compared to reference techniques."

"Small-molecule biomacromolecules target tumor-specific antigens. They are employed as theranostic agents for imaging and treatment. Intravenous small-molecule radioligands exhibit rapid tumor uptake and excretion. However, systemic administration for peptide receptor radionuclide therapy still lacks the therapeutic index to completely treat solid tumors beyond palliation. We study intra-arterial delivery with tumor embolization of a small molecule as a means to deliver local intertumoral brachytherapy for curative internal ablation."
"αs1-Casein (αs1-CN) is the major allergen in cow milk; however, the understanding of its conformational epitopes remains limited due to the absence of a well-defined three-dimensional structure, which has impeded efforts to effectively reduce its antigenicity. This study employed molecular dynamics simulations (MD), ELISA, cell assays and peptidomes analysis to investigate the critical conformational epitopes of αs1-Casein. MD and immunological analyses identified a dominant conformational epitope encompassing the regions S55-E75 & Y154-T174 & F179-W199, which exhibited strong binding affinity to IgE and triggered the releasing of β-hexosaminidase, histamine and IL-6 in KU812 cells, thereby inducing allergic responses. Notably, the segments Y154-T174 and F179-W199 were particularly impactful. Furthermore, the presence of helical structures within the epitopes enhanced their binding to IgE to a certain extent. Peptidomes analysis further revealed that papain efficiently disrupted the key epitope (Y154-T174) by selectively cleaving the hotspot amino acid residues (Y154 and Y165), thereby significantly reducing the antigenicity of αs1-CN, decreasing IgE and IgG binding to 7.28 % and 10.39 %, respectively. These findings enhance the understanding of αs1-CN's antigenic epitopes and provides a theoretical and technical foundation for the targeted reduction of its antigenicity."

"Portal hypertension is a hemodynamic abnormality that complicates the course of cirrhosis, as well as other diseases that affect the portal venous circulation. The development of portal hypertension compromises prognosis, especially when it rises above a certain threshold known as clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH). In the consensus conference on Portal Hypertension promoted by the Spanish Association for the Study of the Liver and the Hepatic and Digestive diseases area of the Biomedical Research Networking Center (CIBERehd), different aspects of the diagnosis and treatment of portal hypertension caused by cirrhosis or other diseases were discussed. The outcome of this discussion was a set of recommendations that achieved varying degrees of consensus among panelists and are reflected in this consensus document. The six areas under discussion were: the relevance of CSPH and the non-invasive methods used for its diagnosis and that of cirrhosis, the prevention of the first episode of decompensation and its recurrence, the treatment of acute variceal bleeding and other complications of portal hypertension, the indications for the use of TIPS, and finally, the diagnosis and treatment of liver vascular diseases."

"The diversity observed in canine breed phenotypes, together with their risk for heritabily disorders of relevance to dogs and humans, makes the species an ideal subject for studies aimed at understanding the genetic basis of complex traits and human biomedical models. Dog10K is an ongoing international collaboration that aims to uncover the genetic basis of phenotypic diversity, disease, behavior, and domestication history of dogs. To best present and make the extensive data accessible and user friendly, we have established the Dog10K (http://dog10k.kiz.ac.cn/) database, a comprehensive-omics resource summarizing multiple types of data. This database integrates single nucleotide variants (SNVs) from 1987 canine genomes, de-novo mutations (DNMs) from 43 dog breeds with >40× sequence, RNA-seq data of 105057 single nuclei from hippocampus, 74067 single cells from leukocytes and 30 blood samples from published canid studies. We provide clear visualization, statistics, browse, searching, and downloading functions for all data. We have integrated three analysis tools, Selscan, LiftOver and AgeConversion, to aid researchers in custom exploration of the comprehensive-omics data. The Dog10K database will serve as a foundational platform for analyzing, presenting and utilizing canine multi-omics data."
"Chronic stress is associated with a higher risk for carcinogenesis as well as age-related diseases and immune dysfunction. There is evidence showing that psychological stress can contribute to premature immunosenescence. Therefore, the question arose whether chronic exposure to catecholamine could drive immune cells into senescence. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from whole blood. After repeated ex vivo treatment with isoproterenol, an epinephrine analog, well-established senescence biomarkers were assessed. We found (i) DNA double-strand break induction, (ii) telomere shortening, (iii) failure to proliferate, (iv) higher senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity, (v) decreases in caspases 3 and 7 activity, and (vi) strong upregulation of the proteoglycan versican accompanied by increased cellular adhesion suggesting the induction of a senescence-like phenotype. These results emphasize the complexity of the effect of isoproterenol on multiple cellular processes and provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of stress leading to immunosenescence."
"Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of metabolic abnormalities, including visceral obesity, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance. In this regard, visceral white adipose tissue (vWAT) plays a critical role, influencing energy metabolism, immunomodulation, and oxidative stress. Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) are key players in these processes within vWAT. While second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) have significantly improved treatments for mental health disorders, their chronic use is associated with an increased risk of MetS. In this study, we explored the impact of SGAs on ADSCs to better understand their role in MetS and identify potential therapeutic targets. Our findings reveal that olanzapine disrupts lipid droplet formation during adipogenic differentiation, impairing insulin receptor endocytosis, turnover, and signaling. SGAs also alter the endolysosomal compartment, leading to acidic vesicle accumulation and increased lysosomal biogenesis through TFEB activation. PKCζ is crucial for the SGA-induced nuclear translocation of TFEB and acidic vesicle formation. Notably, inhibiting PKCζ restored insulin receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, normalized receptor turnover, and improved downstream signaling following olanzapine treatment. This activation of PKCζ by olanzapine is driven by increased phosphatidic acid synthesis via phospholipase D (PLD), following G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling activation. Overall, olanzapine and clozapine disrupt endolysosomal homeostasis and insulin signaling in a PKCζ-dependent manner. These findings highlight SGAs as valuable tools for uncovering cellular dysfunction in vWAT during MetS and may guide the development of new therapeutic strategies to mitigate the metabolic side effects of these drugs."
Swedish undergraduate physiotherapy education lacks comprehensive integration of sustainable development in curricula. Factors related to educators' perspectives in preparing future physiotherapists for sustainable development and sustainable healthcare may shed light on this shortcoming.
"Ferroptosis is a form of regulated cell death, which is dependent on iron metabolism imbalance and characterized by lipid peroxidation. Ferroptosis plays a crucial role in various pathological processes. Studies have shown that the occurrence of ferroptosis is closely associated with the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Ferroptosis is involved in regulating the lipid metabolism, iron homeostasis, mitochondrial metabolism, and redox processes in HCC. Additionally, ferroptosis plays a key role in HCC tumor immunity by modulating the phenotype and function of various immune cells in the tumor microenvironment, affecting tumor immune escape and progression. Ferroptosis-induced lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress can promote the polarization of M1 macrophages and enhance the pro-inflammatory response in tumors, inhibiting immune suppressive cells such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells and regulatory T cells to disrupt their immune suppression function. The regulation of expression of ferroptosis-related molecules such as GPX4 and SLC7A11 not only affects the sensitivity of tumor cells to immunotherapy but also directly influences the activity and survival of effector cells such as T cells and dendritic cells, further enhancing or weakening host antitumor immune response. Targeting ferroptosis has demonstrated significant clinical potential in HCC treatment. Induction of ferroptosis by nanomedicines and molecular targeting strategies can directly kill tumor cells or enhance antitumor immune responses. The integration of multimodal therapies with immunotherapy further expands the application of ferroptosis targeting as a cancer therapy. This article reviews the relationship between ferroptosis and antitumor immune responses and the role of ferroptosis in HCC progression from the perspective of tumor immune microenvironment, to provide insights for the development of antitumor immune therapies targeting ferroptosis."
"The complex interplay between low- and high-level mechanisms governing our visual system can only be fully understood within ecologically valid naturalistic contexts. For this reason, in recent years, substantial efforts have been devoted to equipping the scientific community with datasets of realistic images normed on semantic or spatial features. Here, we introduce VISIONS, an extensive database of 1136 naturalistic scenes normed on a wide range of perceptual and conceptual norms by 185 English speakers across three levels of granularity: isolated object, whole scene, and object-in-scene. Each naturalistic scene contains a critical object systematically manipulated and normed regarding its semantic consistency (e.g., a toothbrush vs. a flashlight in a bathroom) and spatial position (i.e., left, right). Normative data are also available for low- (i.e., clarity, visual complexity) and high-level (i.e., name agreement, confidence, familiarity, prototypicality, manipulability) features of the critical object and its embedding scene context. Eye-tracking data during a free-viewing task further confirms the experimental validity of our manipulations while theoretically demonstrating that object semantics is acquired in extra-foveal vision and used to guide early overt attention. To our knowledge, VISIONS is the first database exhaustively covering norms about integrating objects in scenes and providing several perceptual and conceptual norms of the two as independently taken. We expect VISIONS to become an invaluable image dataset to examine and answer timely questions above and beyond vision science, where a diversity of perceptual, attentive, mnemonic, or linguistic processes could be explored as they develop, age, or become neuropathological."
"The development of bone adhesive materials is a research field of high relevance for the advancement of clinical procedures. Despite this, there are currently no material candidates meeting the full range of requirements placed on such a material, such as biocompatibility, sufficient mechanical properties and bond strength under biological conditions, practical applicability in a clinical setting, and no adverse effect on the healing process itself. A serious obstacle to the advancement of the field is a lack in standardized methodology leading to comparable results between experiments and different research groups. Natural bone samples are the current gold-standard material used to perform adhesive strength experiments, however they come with a number of drawbacks, including high sample variability due to unavoidable natural causes and the impossibility to reliably recreate test conditions to repeat experiments. This paper introduces a valuable auxiliary test method capable of producing large numbers of synthetic test specimens which are chemically similar to bone and can be produced in different laboratories so to repeat experiments under constant conditions across laboratories. The substrate is based on a hydroxyapatite forming cement with addition of gelatine as organic component. Crosslinking of the organic component is performed to improve mechanical properties. In order to demonstrate the performance of the developed method, various experimental and commercial bone/tissue adhesive materials were tested and compared with results obtained by established methods to highlight the potential of the test system."

"Erogenous sensation zones (ESZs) elicit sexual pleasure upon stimulation. General ESZ maps exist, but they do not assess internal areas of the body, differentiate between individual structures, or quantify the importance of individual ESZs to sexual pleasure. Maps of aversive sensation zones (ASZs), or bodily areas individuals dislike having touched during sex, have not been described."
"Between 1997 and 2012, the diagnoses of ankyloglossia and the indication for frenotomy increased by ˃800%. About 38% of diagnosed cases are surgically treated. Breastfeeding promotion includes evaluating maternal hereditary and personal history of breastfeeding, breast structure, endocrinological physiology, emotional well-being of the mother, breastfeeding technique, quality and quantity of milk, and the newborn's ability to latch on and suckle. Frenotomy would be indicated when restriction of tongue function causes difficulties that have not resolved after thorough evaluation and counseling to correct other causes. Frenotomy can have complications: feeding and respiratory difficulties, pain, weight loss, vascular or nerve damage, and delayed diagnosis of other underlying pathologies. It does not always solve breastfeeding difficulties. Interdisciplinary teamwork reduces the frequency of unnecessary frenotomies."
"A 58-year-old woman was referred for atrial flutter ablation after atrial fibrillation ablation. Linear and reinforcement mitral isthmus ablation failed to terminate the perimitral flutter. During vein of Marshall ethanol infusion (VOMEI), the flutter was terminated and followed by left atrial appendage (LAA) isolation. Voltage mapping showed that a large low voltage area was created in the superior and anterior wall of left atrium. During the waiting time, the LAA activation recovered. It would be necessary to keep in mind that VOMEI would lead to uncontrolled lesion of left atrium."
This study compared the effects of calcium oxalate stones and uric acid stones on male sexual function.
"The sellar region is an area in the base of the skull that is among the most common sites for tumors of the central nervous system. Surgical interventions are currently performed via different routes. While the optic chiasm occupies its expected position in 70% of the population, it can deviate from this position. In such cases, surgery involving this region becomes more difficult as the known surgical routes are narrowed. Advance awareness of these variations can help surgeons to identify the optimal route for safe surgical intervention in the sellar region. By performing simple measurements of both the lengths of the optic nerves and the angle between them, a surgeon can predict the location of the chiasm."
"Speech-in-noise perception is consistently reported to be impaired in learning disorders, which stresses the importance of documenting its developmental course in young children. In this cross-sectional study, ninety children (41 females, 5.5-11.6 years old) and nineteen normal-hearing adults (15 females, 20-30 years old) were tested with a newly developed closed-set speech perception in babble-noise test, combining two levels of phonological difficulty and two noise levels. Results showed that speech-in-babble-noise perception takes a definite maturation step around 7 years of age (d = 1.17, grade effect) and is not mature at 10 years of age when compared to young adults (d = 0.94, group effect). Developmental trajectories of both accuracy and response times were evaluated, with influences of psycholinguistic factors, to foster the development of adequate screening tests."
"Abdominal aortic aneurysm poses a significant risk of rupture, with mortality rates of 80% to 90% if untreated. Management focuses on identifying and repairing the aneurysm before rupture, considering factors like size, type and symptoms. We report successful anaesthetic management in a case of intertrochanteric fracture of femur of an elderly patient who was to undergo elective surgery for abdominal aortic aneurysm. Few cases detail abdominal aortic aneurysm management during non-cardiac surgery, emphasising careful anaesthesia titration. This case report underscores the importance of precise intraoperative anaesthesia management in emergency non-cardiac surgery for abdominal aortic aneurysm patients."
"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) remains a major global health concern for which accurate viral load monitoring is essential for the management of HIV infection. The advent of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has transformed once-fatal HIV disease into a manageable chronic condition that now makes the need for VL testing which aims to satisfy international suppression targets 95-95-95 al l the more essential. Therefore, considering the complexity and diversity of HIV infection, it is essential to develop rapid diagnostic technologies suitable for different clinical situations. Here, we report on a multiplexed PCR device developed for simple and efficient quantification of HIV-1 or HIV-2 viral loads using finger-pricked whole blood from rural decentralized settings. This device is comprised of a previously developed RNA extraction module combined with an optimized real-time PCR amplification system. Together, these combine to simultaneously detect and differentiate HIV-1 & 2; as well are adopting a testing control of RNase P allowing for full diagnostic analysis from one sample. Our device also includes an intuitive user interface and is completely autonomous so it can serve individuals in remote areas who are unfamiliar with the field of medical testing. They get the results in a very short time of around 70 min and hence save on testing times without leaving accuracy behind. The efficiency and effectiveness of the device were validated through the analysis of 30 clinical samples, yielding a sensitivity of 100% for both HIV-1 and HIV-2. The specificity was found to be 100% for HIV-1 and 90.91% for HIV-2, demonstrating high diagnostic accuracy. One of the most attractive things about this device is that it comes in comparison to all other counterparts. Given that you can run the assay for less than $10, it could be an economically viable way to use this as a broadscale test in regions where healthcare budgets don't allow others. Hence it is quite a useful device to aid HIV management in resource-limited settings, where conventional laboratory facilities are out of reach due its simplicity and affordability with rapid output. The point-of-care test is an effective, low-cost, high quality diagnostic tool-promoting rapid testing for HIV-inexpensively overcoming the barriers to efficient control of and care in resource-limited settings."
"Proper torque control is crucial to the outcome of orthodontic treatment. This study aimed to employ finite element analysis to compare the torque capabilities of a novel spherical self-ligating bracket with a lock-hook system against those of commonly used passive self-ligating and conventional bracket systems, as well as to reveal the biomechanical changes in the periodontal ligament (PDL) during torque expression."
"Transgender or gender diverse patients present with health care needs as it relates to gender-affirming care, psychosocial support, and medication access. Considering this, medical education strategies should be implemented to train the next generation of Internal Medicine physicians in this area."
"Hyponatremia is the most common hydroelectrolyte disorder in hospitalized patients. It is unclear whether there are differences between severe hyponatremia (<125 mEq/L) and very severe hyponatremia (<115 mEq/L) in terms of etiology, response to therapy, and mortality."
"Human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae forms multiple epigenetically and phenotypically distinct intra-populations by invertase PsrA-driven inversions of DNA methyltransferase hsdS genes in the colony opacity-determinant (cod) locus. As manifested by phase switch between opaque and transparent colonies, different genome methylation patterns or epigenomes confer pathogenesis-associated traits, but it is unknown how the pathogen controls the hsdS inversion orientations. Here, we report our finding of the SpxA1-TenA toxin-antitoxin (TA) system that regulates the orientations of hsdS inversions, and thereby bacterial epigenome and associated traits (e.g., colony opacity) by targeting pneumococcal protein synthesis. SpxA1 and TenA were found to constitute a highly conserved type II TA system in S. pneumoniae, primarily based on the observation that overexpressing toxin TenA led to growth arrest in E. coli and enhanced autolysis in S. pneumoniae, and the antitoxin SpxA1 repressed the transcription of the spxA1-tenA operon. When the transcription of tenA was de-repressed by a spontaneous AT di-nucleotide insertion/deletion in the promoter region of the spxA1-tenA operon, TenA bound to the ribosome maturation factor RimM, and thereby reduced the cellular level of alternative sigma factor ComX (known for the activation of natural transformation-associated genes). Attenuation of ComX expression in turn enhanced the transcription of the invertase gene psrA, which favored the formation of the transparent colony phase-associated hsdS allelic configurations in the cod locus. Phenotypically, moderate expression of TenA dramatically reshaped pneumococcal epigenome and colony opacity. Because spontaneous variations frequently occur during bacterial growth in the number of the AT di-nucleotides in the promoter region of the spxA1-tenA operon, this locus acts as a programmed genetic switch that generates pneumococcal subpopulations with epigenetic and phenotypic diversity."
"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly aggressive malignancy with limited therapeutic options and poor prognosis. Recent advances in targeted therapies have opened new avenues for intervention in PDAC, focusing on key genetic and molecular pathways that drive tumor progression."
"The purpose of this study is to establish a deep learning automatic assistance diagnosis system for benign and malignant classification of mediastinal lesions in endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) images. EBUS images are in the form of video and contain multiple imaging modes. Different imaging modes and different frames can reflect the different characteristics of lesions. Compared with previous studies, the proposed model can efficiently extract and integrate the spatiotemporal relationships between different modes and does not require manual selection of representative frames. In recent years, Vision Transformer has received much attention in the field of computer vision. Combined with convolutional neural networks, hybrid transformers can also perform well on small datasets. This study designed a novel deep learning architecture based on hybrid transformer called TransEBUS. By adding learnable parameters in the temporal dimension, TransEBUS was able to extract spatiotemporal features from insufficient data. In addition, we designed a two-stream module to integrate information from three different imaging modes of EBUS. Furthermore, we applied contrastive learning when training TransEBUS, enabling it to learn discriminative representation of benign and malignant mediastinal lesions. The results show that TransEBUS achieved a diagnostic accuracy of 82% and an area under the curve of 0.8812 in the test dataset, outperforming other methods. It also shows that several models can improve performance by incorporating two-stream module. Our proposed system has shown its potential to help physicians distinguishing benign and malignant mediastinal lesions, thereby ensuring the accuracy of EBUS examination."

This study examined the mediation effects of hypertension in associations between household wealth and diabetes in eight sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries."
"Omalizumab, an anti-IgE monoclonal antibody, is effective in treating antihistamine-refractory chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU). However, tapering strategies for omalizumab are currently not well-studied, and patients may be treated longer than needed. Here, we present the rationale and design of the EXtending Omalizumab Treatment Intervals in patients with Chronic spontaneous urticaria trial, a multicentre, randomised, open-label, non-inferiority clinical trial. The objective of this trial is to investigate if patients with well-controlled CSU, achieved by standard treatment of 300 mg omalizumab administered subcutaneously every 4 weeks (Q4W) for 12 weeks, can maintain disease control with every 6 weeks (Q6W) dosing interval."
"Despite advances in therapies and educational initiatives, pediatric allergy disorders, including asthma, allergic rhinitis, and eczema, continue to pose substantial health challenges. Understanding the social determinants of health (SDoH) linked with these conditions is a critical area of research due to their multifactorial nature. This study aimed to assess the SDoH influencing pediatric allergy disorders in central Florida, specifically examining four groups of children: with asthma only, with eczema only, with both asthma and eczema, and a control group without these conditions."
"Accurate musculoseletal ultrasound (MSKUS) image segmentation is crucial for diagnosis and treatment planning.

Sijilmassi et al. offer a myth-based framework that is particularly useful in understanding the rising tide of Hindu nationalism in contemporary India. We propose that the success of these myths lies partly in drawing upon the evolved human capacity for prestige-based status to induce a sense of belonging and identification with high-prestige Hindu social groups.
"Many glial biologists consider glia the neglected cells of the nervous system. Among all the glia of the central and peripheral nervous system, satellite glia may be the most often overlooked. Satellite glial cells (SGCs) are located in ganglia of the cranial nerves and the peripheral nervous system. These small cells surround the cell bodies of neurons in the trigeminal ganglia (TG), spiral ganglia, nodose and petrosal ganglia, sympathetic ganglia, and dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Essential SGC features include their intimate connections with the associated neurons, their small size, and their derivation from neural crest cells. Yet SGCs also exhibit tissue-specific properties and can change rapidly, particularly in response to injury. To illustrate the range of SGC functions, we will focus on three types: those of the spiral, sympathetic, and DRG, and consider both their shared features and those that differ based on location."
"We evaluated the co-occurrence of arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), and lead (Pb) in 10 categories of processed foods intended for infants and young children (<2 years old) and adapted methodology to characterise and evaluate the impact of correlations on toxic element (TE) concentrations in these foods. Co-occurrence was assessed by calculating the frequency of samples having concentrations above the limit of detection (LOD) among TE sets (i.e. As-Cd, As-Pb, Cd-Pb, and As-Cd-Pb). Pairwise correlations were evaluated using two statistical approaches adapted to censored data: (i) non-parametric Kendall's tau and (ii) parametric Bayesian modelling. Nonparametric and parametric correlation analyses showed similar results. We found positive correlations among one or more pairs of the TEs (As, Pb, and Cd) in 9 of the 10 categories of foods intended for infants and young children and a negative correlation for one TE pair for a single food category. Where positive correlations are observed, removing samples with high concentrations of a given TE reduces the mean of the other TEs in that food. We also explored the impact of correlations among TEs on the fraction of the supply below maximum levels. Positive correlations among TEs have the potential to reduce the impact on the supply when setting multiple maximum levels."
"Nasoseptal flaps are a frequently used and well characterized means of reconstruction following endoscopic endonasal approach surgery (EEA). However, there are alternative means of reconstruction, including the extracranial pericranial flap (ePCF), that while used infrequently fulfill a specialized need in larger or salvage reconstructions. This review aims to better characterize long-term outcomes using ePCF where there is currently a paucity of objective data on use and outcomes."
"Fibrous dysplasia (FD) is a self-limiting benign disease with slow progression in which the normal bone is replaced by dysplastic fibrous tissue. The craniofacial skeleton is one of the most commonly affected areas, and it can create unique challenges in dental implant therapy. This case aims to report an unusual presentation of FD localized in the alveolar crest bone of the edentulous site, causing special obstacles to implant placement, and provide a diagnostic and treatment process that may be referenced."
"The same object can be described at multiple levels of abstraction (""parka"", ""coat"", ""clothing""), yet human observers consistently name objects at a mid-level of specificity known as the basic level. Little is known about the temporal dynamics involved in retrieving neural representations that prioritize the basic level, nor how these dynamics change with evolving task demands. In this study, observers viewed 1080 objects arranged in a three-tier category taxonomy while 64-channel EEG was recorded. Observers performed a categorical one-back task in different recording sessions on the basic or subordinate levels. We used time-resolved multiple regression to assess the utility of superordinate-, basic-, and subordinate-level categories across the scalp. We found robust use of basic-level category information starting at about 50 ms after stimulus onset and moving from posterior electrodes (149 ms) through lateral (261 ms) to anterior sites (332 ms). Task differences were not evident in the first 200 ms of processing but were observed between 200-300 ms after stimulus presentation. Together, this work demonstrates that the object category representations prioritize the basic level and do so relatively early, congruent with results that show that basic-level categorization is an automatic and obligatory process."
"Lack of or use of suboptimal cold chain equipment (CCE) is a major barrier to optimal immunization coverage and equity. Gavi established the CCE optimization platform (CCEOP) in 2015 to help eligible countries modernize their cold chain systems. However, there are limited data on CCE deployment at country level. We present lessons learnt from deploying CCE from the Gavi CCEOP in Cameroon."
"We report a case of pulseless electrical activity (PEA) associated with profound hypermagnesemia immediately after cementation of a novel magnesium-based cement in spine surgery. During T8 to T12 posterior instrumentation and decompression laminectomy for vertebral metastasis secondary to lung cancer, a 61-year-old Chinese woman developed sudden hypotension and went into PEA immediately after injection of a novel magnesium-based cement. Intraoperative fluoroscopic imaging did not show any notable cement extravasation. Resuscitation using intravenous epinephrine with five doses of 1-mg epinephrine in 1:10,000 dilution was instituted, and the patient had return of spontaneous circulation after 5 minutes. After successful resuscitation, surgery was expedited and completed. Intraoperative and postoperative investigations were notable for profound hypermagnesemia and hyperphosphatemia requiring diuresis. No echocardiographic or computerized tomographic evidence of pulmonary embolism was found. The patient was transferred to the surgical intensive care unit and remained on dual inotropic support over the next few days. She subsequently weaned off inotropic support and electrolyte imbalances resolved before making a full recovery. This case report demonstrates the severe magnesium toxicity and PEA related to the use of novel magnesium-based cement in spine surgery. Further studies need to be conducted to understand the potential complications related to its use and compare them to the standard bone cement implantation syndrome."
"Granulomatous mastitis (GM) poses challenges in diagnosis and treatment due to its similarities with other breast diseases like cancer. The comparative study evaluated the efficacy and safety of a vacuum-assisted biopsy device with minimally invasive excisions compared to traditional wide local excisions. The vacuum-assisted biopsy device technique offers benefits such as precise tissue removal, reduced damage to healthy tissue, shorter surgery and recovery times, and lower postoperative complication risks. The study found that the vacuum-assisted biopsy device had comparable efficacy to traditional wide local excision in treating GM with an overall effectiveness rate of 92.9% and a recurrence rate of 9.52%. The vacuum-assisted biopsy device group showed advantages in reduced hospitalization duration (2.83 days vs. 7.52 days), lower costs, and better cosmetic outcomes, with a 100% patient satisfaction rate compared to 80% in the control group. This study fills existing clinical evidence gaps regarding the effectiveness and safety of vacuum-assisted biopsy device in GM treatment. By providing evidence-based guidelines, it aims to assist clinicians in choosing the most appropriate treatment for GM patients, ultimately improving their quality of life and mental well-being. The research contributes valuable insights into GM therapy, potentially revolutionizing treatment approaches and enhancing patient outcomes."
"With the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, its applications in medical imaging have become increasingly extensive. This review aimed to analyze the current development status and future direction of intelligent imaging technology by investigating its application in various medical departments. To achieve this, we conducted a comprehensive search of various data sources up to 2024, including PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, based on the principle of comprehensive search. A total of 332 articles were screened, and after applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 56 articles were selected for this study. According to the findings, intelligent imaging technology exhibits robust image recognition capabilities, making it applicable across diverse medical imaging modalities within hospital departments. This technology offers an efficient solution for the analysis of various medical images by extracting and accurately identifying complex features. Consequently, it significantly aids in the detection and diagnosis of clinical diseases. Its high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity render it an indispensable tool in clinical diagnostics and related tasks, thereby enhancing the overall quality of healthcare services. The application of intelligent imaging technology in healthcare significantly enhances the efficiency of clinical diagnostics, resulting in more accurate and timely patient assessments. This advanced technology offers a faster and more precise diagnostic approach, ultimately improving patient care and outcomes. This review analyzed the socioeconomic changes brought about by intelligent imaging technology to provide a more comprehensive evaluation. Also, we systematically analyzed the current shortcomings of intelligent imaging technology and its future development directions, to enable future research."
Metabolic syndrome (MS) is responsible for the increased cardiovascular risk in patients with type 2 diabetes. Few studies have focused on MS in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM).
"Lynch syndrome, one of the most common genetic syndromes predisposing to cancer, is associated with a series of malignant conditions, among which the most frequent is colorectal cancer, but gynecologic cancers (especially endometrial) are also quite common. Despite the significant progress made in understanding this condition over time, there are still aspects in managing this condition that have not demonstrated clear benefits. This article aims to summarize the recommendations of international societies and present the latest developments in managing Lynch syndrome, focusing on gynecologic cancer screening and possible prevention strategies. Advances in genetic testing procedures and discoveries related to the association between oncological pathology frequency and the affected pathogenic variant type will probably lead to personalized medicine focused on the individual patient in the coming years. Although various screening methods for gynecological cancers in patients with Lynch syndrome have been used over time, they have not shown significant survival benefits. This highlights the need for studying and implementing new screening and diagnostic methods, which have been under investigation in recent years and are mentioned in this article."
"Allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) is safe and effective for adolescents and adults with inborn errors of immunity (IEI) with severe disease manifestations of their disease. The haematopoietic cell transplantation comorbidity index (HCT-CI) score predicts transplant survival in non-malignant diseases, including IEIs. We hypothesised that immune dysregulation pre-transplant may also influence transplant outcomes. We calculated the pre-transplant immune dysregulation and disease activity score (IDDA v2.1) for 82 adolescent and adult IEI patients (aged ≥ 13 years). Three-year overall survival (OS) for the whole cohort was 90% (n = 82) with a median follow up of 44.7 months (range 8.4 to 225.8). Events were defined as acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) grades II or above, chronic GvHD of any grade, graft failure, or death from any cause. Three-year event free survival (EFS) for the whole cohort was 72%. In multivariable analysis the IDDA v2.1 score pre-transplant and HCT-CI score significantly impacted OS (hazard ratio 1.08, p = 0.028) and EFS (hazard ratio 1.04, p = 0.0005). Importantly, 35% of this cohort had a high IDDA v2.1 score (≥ 15) and low HCT-CI score (< 3) suggesting that the risks of alloHSCT may be underestimated in a proportion of patients with IEI if the HCT-CI score is used alone. These findings support the potential for improved outcomes following successful modulation of immune dysregulation pre-transplant. The IDDA v2.1 score has utility as an objective measurement of pre-transplant immune dysregulation providing additional information reagrding the risks and potential complications of alloHSCT in an individual IEI patient."
The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the association between the utilization of metformin and the occurrence and survival rate of esophageal cancer (EC) in individuals with diabetes.
"Scholars have asserted and provided evidence on the developmental benefits of prosocial behaviors on later academic performance and well-being. However, research directly examining these links in US Latine early adolescents and work that explains the positive link between prosocial behaviors and academic outcomes is scarce. The present study investigated whether social skills and self-efficacy mediate the positive relations between prosocial behaviors and US Latine early adolescents' educational performance."
"Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is the second most common skin manifestation reported in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We performed a single-institution, retrospective study to summarize the clinical features and examine effective treatment regimens and outcomes of PG in IBD patients. We identified 45 patients who presented to our institute between January 1, 2002 and December 31, 2021 with the following criteria: (1) diagnosed with an active PG (ICD9: 686.01, ICD10: L88) during the specified period, (2) aged at least 18 years at the time of diagnosis, (3) had the diagnosis of IBD, and (4) documented treatment regimens/outcomes. In our cohort, 56% of the patients had PG at the site of stoma. Intralesional and oral steroids were the most utilized therapies for peristomal PG (PPG) and non-peristomal PG (NPPG) in 60% and 62% of the patients, respectively. The bowel manifestations were under control at the time of PG diagnosis in 76% of PPG patients, compared to 43% of NPPG patients. Our findings demonstrated that PPG in IBD patients could be managed locally with intralesional steroids only, as the bowel manifestations of PPG patients tend to be under control, compared to those of NPPG patients."
"The objective of this scoping review is to identify interventions to promote well-being that have been tried or proven effective to prevent or address burnout in rural health care professionals and trainees (HCPTs).

"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines are effective in reducing the prevalence of this disease. However, some patients develop autoimmune diseases after vaccination. We herein report a case of elderly onset intestinal Behçet's disease (BD) with trisomy 8 following COVID-19 vaccination in which the disease was exacerbated by COVID-19 infection. The patient developed refractory stomatitis and genital ulcers two weeks after receiving the second vaccination and presented with bloody stool two years later. Intestinal BD with trisomy 8, exacerbated by COVID-19, was treated with high-dose glucocorticoids and infliximab; however, surgical intervention was required. The findings of this case suggest that the COVID-19 vaccination may induce BD."
"This research delved into the feasibility of utilizing three nanochitin-chitin nanocrystal (CNC), chitin nanofiber (CNF), and chitin nanosphere (CNS) in complexation with whey protein isolate (WPI) to fabricate complex coacervation and create microcapsules for probiotic encapsulation. The results showed that CNC, CNF, and CNS exhibited notable differences in morphologies, dimensions, and properties due to the respective synthesis methodologies. Nevertheless, all of them maintained a positive charge and were capable of assembling into microcapsules with WPI via electrostatic interactions at optimal pHs. The inclusion of Lactobacillus casei (L. casei) during the complex coacervation phase engendered a shell-like formation around the bacterium within the microcapsule, which enhanced probiotic viability and increased colony-forming unit count. Additionally, these probiotic-loading microcapsules were also processed into tablets, displaying robust structural integrity, augmented protective capabilities, and a distinctive sustained-release profile compared to the microcapsules alone. In summary, this study pioneered the employment of nanochitin formulations in complex coacervation to encapsulate L. casei, spearheading an innovative approach to the creation of a compressed probiotic supplement and contributing to the advancement in the design and fabrication of encapsulation vehicles for active ingredients."

"Blood flow restriction training (BFRT) with low intensity resistance or aerobic exercise can improve muscle strength and aerobic capacity, respectively. Furthermore, low intensity BFRT with resistance or aerobic exercise can be as effective as training at higher intensities without BFR in healthy adult populations. The clinical use of BFRT is therefore becoming increasingly common, particularly in otherwise healthy adults recovering from musculoskeletal injury or orthopedic surgery, for whom training at high intensities is not indicated. People with neurologic conditions may also benefit from training at lower intensities, as many individuals with neurologic conditions may not tolerate higher intensities for a variety of reasons, including advanced mobility restrictions, extreme weakness, severe fatigue, and/or pain. Indeed, more and more rehabilitation clinicians are beginning to use BFRT with their patients who have neurologic conditions even though there is very little evidence to support its safety, feasibility, or efficacy in those populations. In this perspective, we propose that BFRT can be an important alternative to conventional exercise training approaches for some individuals with neurologic conditions, and in the right circumstances can be delivered both safely and effectively. This perspective will also provide considerations and decision-making strategies that can help inform clinical decisions for rehabilitation practitioners considering the use of BFRT in their patients with neurologic conditions."
"As one type of vaccine policy, the effectiveness and spillover effects of the US CDC vaccine recommendations are inadequately evaluated. This study aims to fully evaluate its impacts on male adults, in addition to children, using better data."
"PARP1 is a critical enzyme involved in DNA damage repair. It belongs to a superfamily of proteins and catalyzes poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARylation). PARP1 inhibitors are effective to treat tumors that have homologous recombination deficiency such as those with BRCA1/2 mutations. The PARP1 inhibitors that have been approved by FDA inhibit both PARP1 and PARP2. PARP2 has also been suggested to play a similar function in DNA repair as PARP1. In addition to inhibiting PARP1 enzymatic activities, PARP1 inhibitors cause the PARP1 enzyme to be ""trapped"" on DNA, stalling the DNA replication fork and eventually causing double-strand DNA breaks and cell death. Here, we report a PARP1 inhibitor, Senaparib, which has a novel chemical structure and high potency inhibiting PARP1/2 enzymes. Senaparib was highly potent in cell viability tests against tumor cells with BRCA1/2 mutations. It was efficacious in cell line-derived and patient-derived xenograft models in tumors harboring BRCA1/2 mutations. In combination studies, Senaparib used with temozolomide had shown strong synergistic cytotoxicity in both in vitro and in vivo experiments. Senaparib represents a novel class of PARP1 inhibitors that can be used for the treatment of cancer. A phase III clinical study of Senaparib for maintenance treatment following first-line chemotherapy in patients with advanced ovarian cancer has met its primary endpoint, and a new drug application of Senaparib has been accepted by the National Medical Products Administration of China for review."
"The COVID-19 pandemic significantly increased the global burden of respiratory morbidity and mortality. In Spain, 2020 saw a 68.5% surge in deaths from respiratory diseases compared to 2019, largely due to COVID-19. This study aims to describe respiratory disease mortality in Spain from 2019 to 2022, focusing on the intersection of COVID-19, pre-existing respiratory conditions, and specific health determinants."
"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused global devastations in social, economic and health systems of every nation, but disproportionately of nations in Africa. In addition to its grave effects on the global systems, there is continuation or development of new symptoms among individuals who have contracted the virus, with the potential to further stress the health systems on the continent. Therefore, the aim of this scoping review was to collate and summarise the existing research evidence on the prevalence and health effects of post-COVID-19 conditions in Africa."
"The stable lignocellulose structure in the straw is the main obstacle for methane production during its anaerobic digestion, and the residual chlorophenols in the straw further increase the difficulty. In this study, the anaerobic digestion of corn straw containing 4-chlorophenol was enhanced by the addition of Phanerochaete chrysosporium and biochar. The results revealed that P. chrysosporium significantly increased the soluble COD concentration and total COD removal efficiency in the anaerobic digestion of corn straw, which initially contained a small amount of residual oxygen (4.1-4.5 mg/L). The accumulative methane production of the P. chrysosporium-coupled biochar (PC-BC) group and the PC group with P. chrysosporium alone were 232.9 ± 3.0 mL and 201.7 ± 5.1 mL, respectively, which were significantly higher than the control group (19.4 ± 1.0 mL) with the sterilized P. chrysosporium. The presence of biochar increased 4-CP removal rate to 93.3 %, which was 15.2 % higher than the control. Additionally, FTIR analysis indicated that the addition of P. chrysosporium and biochar enhanced the decomposition of lignocellulose structure. Moreover, the sludge capacitance and electron transfer capacity were highest in the PC-BC group. Also, microbial community analysis showed that biochar could enrich dechlorinating bacteria (e.g., Sedimentibacter) and electroactive microorganisms, which further enhanced dechlorination and methanogensis."
"StarTrack is a powerful multicolor genetic tool designed to unravel cellular lineages arising from neural progenitor cells (NPCs). This innovative technique, based on retrospective clonal analysis and built upon the PiggyBac system, creates a unique and inheritable ""color code"" within NPCs. Through the stochastic integration of 12 distinct plasmids encoding six fluorescent proteins, StarTrack enables precise and comprehensive tracking of cellular fates and progenitor potentials. The versatility of this tool is further enhanced by the potential of combining multiple promoters. Whether through the use of fluorescent integrable constructs or driving the expression of the PiggyBac transposase, StarTrack broadens the horizons for lineage tracing from progenitors of multiple origins.StarTrack revolutionized our understanding of cellular origins and lineages, offering an invaluable resource for researchers in the field of neural development and lineage tracing. This protocol provides a comprehensive overview of the technique's capabilities and applications, shedding light on its significance within the scientific community."
"Patients with lateral lymph node metastasis (LLNM) may experience higher locoregional recurrence rates and poorer prognoses compared to those without LLNM, highlighting the need for effective preoperative stratification to reliably assess risk LLNM. In this study, we collected PTMC samples from Peking Union Medical College Hospital and employed data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry proteomics technique to identify protein profiles in PTMC tissues with and without LLNM. Pseudo temporal analysis and single sample gene set enrichment analysis were conducted in combination with The Cancer Genome Atlas Thyroid Carcinoma for functional coordination analysis and the construction of a prediction model based on random forest. Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) clustering was utilized to classify molecular subtypes of PTMC. Our findings revealed that the differential activation of pathways such as MAPK and PI3K was critical in enhancing the lateral lymph node metastatic potential of PTMC. We successfully screened biomarkers via machine learning and public databases, creating an effective prediction model for metastasis. Additionally, we explored the mechanism of metastasis-associated PTMC subtypes via NMF clustering. These insights into LLNM mechanisms in PTMC may contribute to future biomarker screening and the identification of therapeutic targets."

"The subfamily Phlebotominae comprises 1028 species of sand fly, of which only 90 are recognized as vectors of pathogenic agents such as Trypanosoma, Leishmania, and Bartonella. In Thailand, leishmaniasis-a sand fly-borne disease-is currently endemic, with 36 documented sand fly species. However, many cryptic species likely remain unidentified. To improve our understanding of the distribution, habitat preferences, and role in disease transmission of these sand flies, further research is necessary."
"Peptide-drug conjugates (PDCs) have emerged as a promising class of targeted therapeutics with substantial pharmaceutical advantages and market potentials, which is a combination of a peptide (selective to the disease-relevant target), a linker (stable in circulation but cleavable at target site) and a cytotoxic/radioactive drug (efficacious/traceable for disease). Among existing PDCs, those based on radiopharmaceuticals (a.k.a. radioactive drugs) are valued due to their accurate imaging and targeted destruction of disease sites. It's demanded to accumulate the biological activity and pharmaceutical information of PDCs. Herein, a database PDCdb was thus constructed to systematically describe these valuable data. Particularly, biological activities for 2036 PDCs were retrieved from literatures, which resulted in 1684, 613 and 2753 activity data generated based on clinical trial, animal model and cell line, respectively. Furthermore, the pharmaceutical information for all 2036 PDCs was collected, which gave the diverse data of (a) ADME property, plasma half-life and administration approach of a PDC and (b) chemical modification, primary target, mode of action, conjugating feature of the constituent peptide/linker/drug. In sum, PDCdb systematically provided the biological activities and pharmaceutical information for the most comprehensive list of PDCs among the available databases, which was expected to attract broad interest from related communities and could be freely accessible at: https://idrblab.org/PDCdb/."
"Rare monogenic disorders often exhibit significant phenotypic variability among individuals sharing identical genetic mutations. Bruck syndrome (BS), a prime example, is characterized by bone fragility and congenital contractures, although with a pronounced variability among family members. BS arises from recessive biallelic mutations in FKBP10 or PLOD2. FKBP65, the protein encoded by FKBP10, collaborates with the LH2 enzyme (PLOD2) in type I collagen telopeptide lysine hydroxylation, crucial for collagen cross-linking. To identify potential modifier genes and to investigate the mechanistic role of FKBP10 in BS pathogenesis, we established an fkbp10a knockout zebrafish model. Mass-spectrometry analysis in fkbp10a-/- mutants revealed a generally decreased type I collagen lysyl hydroxylation, paralleled by a wide skeletal variability similar to human patients. Ultrastructural examination of the skeleton in severely affected mutants showed enlarged type I collagen fibrils and disturbed elastin layers. Whole-exome sequencing of 7 mildly and 7 severely affected mutant zebrafish siblings, followed by single nucleotide polymorphism-based linkage analysis, indicated a linked region on chromosome 13, which segregates with phenotypic severity. Transcriptome analysis identified 6 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between mildly and severely affected mutants. The convergence of genes within the linked region and DEGs highlighted bmpr1aa as a potential modifier gene, as its reduced expression correlates with increased skeletal severity. In summary, our study provides deeper insights into the role of FKBP10 in BS pathogenesis. Additionally, we identified a pivotal gene that influences phenotypic severity in a zebrafish model of BS. These findings hold promise for novel treatments in the field of bone diseases."
"Assessment and the associated feedback from those assessments are powerful factors in the development of students' learning. We have seen a shift within the Higher Education sector to conceptualise assessment as being more than summative assessment 'of' learning. Instead, there has been a greater emphasis on assessment 'as' learning, or assessment 'for' learning, through the enhanced use of formative assessments. Centralising assessment within the learning process highlights that assessment IS learning and cannot be separated from other elements of the learning process. In particular, assessment has a vital role to play in the development of students' self-regulated learning skills and the development of independence in learners. However, for assessments to effectively support learning, they need to be meaningful, engaging, well-integrated into the learning activities and 'student-focused'. Placing student skills development and personal development at the centre of assessment design has the potential to empower students through assessment. This review focuses on the potential of assessment to support student learning and development, using the 'Equity, Agency, Transparency' ('EAT') framework as a lens for effective assessment and feedback practices. We suggest ways in which we can make our assessment and feedback practices more inclusive, meaningful and authentic to the students' learning needs."
Both depressive symptoms and neurotransmitter changes affect the characteristics of functional brain networks in clinical patients. We sought to explore how brain functional grading is organized among patients with mild cognitive impairment and depressive symptoms (D-MCI) and whether changes in brain organization are related to neurotransmitter distribution.
"Cancer rehabilitation and exercise oncology (CR/EO) have documented benefits for people living with and beyond cancer. The authors examined proximity to CR/EO programs across the United States with respect to population density, race and ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and cancer incidence and mortality rates."
"We aimed to determine the persisting effects of various exercise modalities and intensities on functional capacity after periods of training cessation in older adults. A comprehensive search was conducted across the Cochrane Library, PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science Core Collection up to March 2024 for randomized controlled trials examining residual effects of physical exercise on functional capacity in older adults ≥ 60 years. The analysis encompassed 15 studies and 21 intervention arms, involving 787 participants. The exercise and training cessation periods ranged from 8 to 43 weeks and 4 to 36 weeks, respectively. Meta-analyses were performed using change scores from before the physical exercise to after the training cessation. The effect sizes (ES) were calculated as the standardized mean differences between the intervention and control groups' change scores. Subgroup analyses and meta-regressions explored the influence of participant characteristics, the magnitude of the effect produced by the initial training program, various exercise modalities (resistance and multicomponent training) and intensities (high and low), and subdomains of functional capacity (agility, balance, standing ability, walking ability, and stair walking). The findings revealed that exercise interventions had a significant effect on preserving functional capacity after training cessation (ES = 0.87; p < 0.01). This protective effect was consistent across various exercise modalities and intensities (ES ≥ 0.67; p ≤ 0.04). The benefits obtained during the training program were positively associated with the residual effects observed after training cessation (β = 0.73; p < 0.01), while age negatively influenced the persisting adaptations (β = -0.07; p < 0.01). Current evidence suggests that exercise-based interventions, irrespective of modality and intensity, are highly effective in preventing functional declines after training cessation among older adults."
"Successful goal-directed behavior requires the maintenance and implementation of abstract task goals on concrete stimulus information in working memory. Previous working memory research has revealed distributed neural representations of task information across cortex. However, how the distributed task representations emerge and communicate with stimulus-specific information to implement flexible goal-directed computations is still unclear. Here, leveraging electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in human participants along with state space analyses, we provided converging evidence in support of a low-dimensional neural geometry of goal information congruent with a designed task space, which first emerged in frontal cortex during goal maintenance and then transferred to posterior cortex through frontomedial-to-posterior theta coherence for implementation on stimulus-specific representations. Importantly, the fidelity of the goal geometry was associated with memory performance. Collectively, our findings suggest that abstract goals in working memory are represented in an organized, task-congruent neural geometry for communications from frontal to posterior cortex to enable computations necessary for goal-directed behaviors."
"Interviewers' judgements play a critical role in competency-based assessments for selection such as the multiple-mini-interview (MMI). Much of the published research focuses on the psychometrics of selection and the impact of rater subjectivity. Within the context of selecting for entry into specialty postgraduate training, we used an interpretivist and socio-constructivist approach to explore how and why interviewers make judgments in high stakes selection settings whilst taking part in an MMI."
The authors sought to quantify the role of social media-related academic activity through use of the Altmetric score (a composite score based on social media attention from a variety of sources) and investigate its potential impact on the number of citations received at 3 years postpublication (articles published between January 2019 and December 2019).
"Pineal apoplexy, alternatively referred to as pineal hemorrhage or pineal gland hemorrhagic stroke, is an infrequent pathologic condition characterized by bleeding within the pineal gland. In this review, we encompass the primary factors contributing to this uncommon ailment."
"Ferroptosis and autophagy are two main forms of regulated cell death (RCD). Ferroptosis is a newly identified RCD driven by iron accumulation and lipid peroxidation. Autophagy is a self-degradation system through membrane rearrangement. Autophagy regulates the metabolic balance between synthesis, degradation and reutilization of cellular substances to maintain intracellular homeostasis. Numerous studies have demonstrated that both ferroptosis and autophagy play important roles in cancer pathogenesis and cancer therapy. We also found that there are intricate connections between ferroptosis and autophagy. In this article, we tried to clarify how different kinds of autophagy participate in the process of ferroptosis and sort out the common regulatory pathways between ferroptosis and autophagy in cancer. By exploring the complex crosstalk between ferroptosis and autophagy, we hope to broaden horizons of cancer therapy."
"Viral infections are major modulators of marine microbial community assembly and biogeochemical cycling. In coral reefs, viral lysis controls bacterial overgrowth that is detrimental to coral health. However, methodological limitations have prevented the identification of viral hosts and quantification of their interaction frequencies. Here, we reconstructed an abundance-resolved virus-bacteria interaction network in the oligotrophic coral reef waters of Curaçao by integrating direct microscopy counts with virus-host links obtained from proximity-ligation, prophage integration, and CRISPR spacers. This network of 3013 individual links (97 unique species-level interactions) revealed that the abundance of free viral particles was weakly related to host abundance and viral production, as indicated by the cell-associated virus-to-host ratio (VHR). The viruses with the highest free and cell-associated VHR, interpreted here as highly productive viruses, formed links with intermediate-to-low abundance hosts belonging to Gammaproteobacteria, Bacteroidia, and Planctomycetia. In contrast, low-production viruses interacted with abundant members of Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria enriched in prophages. These findings highlight the decoupling between viral abundance and production and identify potentially active viruses. We propose that differential decay rates and burst sizes may explain the decoupling between free viral abundance and production and that lysogenic infections play an important role in the ecology of high-abundance hosts."
"Malaria remains a major cause of preventable deaths among children worldwide, despite the availability of several interventions for controlling and eliminating the disease. The WHO recommended the first malaria vaccine, RTS, S/AS01 in October 2021 to immunize children in sub-Saharan Africa. In this study, we set out to evaluate the knowledge, awareness and acceptability of the malaria vaccine among mothers of under 5 in south-west Nigeria before the vaccine's rollout in Nigeria."

"Pediatric sarcomas are bone and soft tissue tumors that often exhibit high metastatic potential and refractory stem-like phenotypes, resulting in poor outcomes. Aggressive sarcomas frequently harbor a disrupted p53 pathway. However, whether pediatric sarcoma stemness is associated with abrogated p53 function and might be attenuated via p53 reactivation remains unclear."
"The latest World Health Organization Classification of Tumors, Fifth Edition, recognizes the invasive encapsulated follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (IEFVPTC) as a distinct malignant entity rather than a subtype of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). This reclassification highlights the need to explore potential prognostic differences between IEFVPTC and classic PTC. This study utilized the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database to compare prognoses of patients diagnosed with IEFVPTC and classic PTC between 2004 and 2019. Propensity score matching (PSM) was employed to adjust for confounding variables and reduce selection bias. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox regression models were used to evaluate overall survival (OS) between the two groups. A total of 1,530 IEFVPTC and 81,508 classic PTC patients were analyzed. Before PSM, significant differences were noted in race, T-stage, N-stage, M-stage, laterality, radiotherapy, surgical modality, tumor size, and income. Post-PSM, these differences were not statistically significant (p > 0.05). Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression models showed no significant differences in OS between IEFVPTC and classic PTC both before and after PSM. This PSM analysis revealed no significant differences in overall survival between patients with IEFVPTC and classic PTC, suggesting that the reclassification of IEFVPTC does not translate into distinct prognostic outcomes."
"Bayesian borrowing analyses have an important role in the design and analysis of pediatric trials. This paper describes use of a prespecified Pharmacometrics Enhanced Bayesian Borrowing (PEBB) analysis that was conducted to overcome an expectation for reduced statistical power in the pediatric DINAMO trial due to a greater than expected variability in the primary endpoint. The DINAMO trial assessed the efficacy and safety of an empagliflozin dosing regimen versus placebo and linagliptin versus placebo on glycemic control (change in HbA1c over 26 weeks) in young people with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Previously fitted pharmacokinetic and exposure-response models for empagliflozin and linagliptin based on available historical data in adult and pediatric patients with T2D were used to simulate participant data and derive the informative component of a Bayesian robust mixture prior distribution. External experts and representatives from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration provided recommendations to determine the effective sample size of the prior and the weight of the informative prior component. Separate exposure response-based Bayesian borrowing analyses for empagliflozin and linagliptin showed posterior mean and 95% credible intervals that were consistent with the trial results. Sensitivity analyses with a full range of alternative weights were also performed. The use of PEBB in this analysis combined advantages of mechanistic modeling of pharmacometric differences between adults and young people with T2D, with advantages of partial extrapolation through Bayesian dynamic borrowing. Our findings suggest that the described PEBB approach is a promising option to optimize the power for future pediatric trials."
"A 7 wk old female spayed domestic shorthair was evaluated for 3 days of lethargy and anorexia 1 wk after ovariohysterectomy. On presentation, she was weak, dehydrated, and hypotensive. Blood work showed azotemia, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hyperproteinemia. Ingestion of a nephrotoxic substance was unlikely, there was no evidence of infection on urinalysis, and an abdominal ultrasound showed normal renal architecture with no evidence of ureteral ligation. A diagnosis of hypoadrenocorticism was established based on low baseline cortisol and aldosterone concentrations and lack of response to synthetic adrenocorticotropic hormone administration. Treatment was initiated with IV fluid therapy, corticosteroids, and subcutaneous desoxycorticosterone pivalate. After 3 mo of treatment, the cat continued to do clinically well with a decreasing dose of glucocorticoids. Owing to owner concerns with frequent veterinary visits and medication cost, the decision was made to extend the mineralocorticoid dose interval while closely monitoring clinical status and electrolyte concentrations. The cat's electrolytes remained normal and medications were discontinued. Repeat baseline cortisol and aldosterone concentrations and response to adrenocorticotropic hormone administration 18 days after discontinuing all medication revealed that adrenal function had recovered. This is the first report of transient hypoadrenocorticism in this species."
"The members of the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC; https://insdc.org) have built systems to collect, archive and disseminate sequence data for more than four decades. The three collaborating organizations, the National Library of Medicine, National Center for Biotechnology Information (NLM-NCBI) in the United States, Research Organization of Information and Systems, National Institute of Genetics (ROIS-NIG) in Japan; and the European Molecular Biology Laboratory-European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) formalized their relationship through the adoption of an arrangement which documents their commitment to free and open access to genomic sequences. The INSDC is committed to expand the collaboration to be more representative of the global community of sequences and users. Diversifying participation through new membership will advance open science and data sharing and, in turn, drive innovation. This expansion will additionally benefit the INSDC and its broad user base by providing additional diverse perspectives as it explores emerging areas of data management, including federation, attribution and management."
"Mental fatigue, a psychobiological state induced by prolonged and sustained cognitive tasks, impairs both cognitive and physical performance. Several studies have investigated strategies to counteract mental fatigue. However, potential health risks and contextual restrictions often limit these strategies, which hinder their practical application. Due to its noninvasive and portable nature, music has been proposed as a promising strategy to counteract mental fatigue. However, the effects of music on performance decrements vary with different music styles. Synthesizing studies that systematically report music style and its impact on counteracting performance decrements is crucial for theoretical and practical applications."
"Numerous studies have explored the role of vitamin D in various cancers; however, its impact on advanced biliary tract cancers (BTC) within a prospective cohort remains to be investigated. This preplanned subgroup analysis of the NIFTY trial evaluated the prognostic implications of serum vitamin D levels in patients with advanced BTC undergoing second-line chemotherapy."
"Uremic leontiasis ossia (ULO) is a rare manifestation of renal osteodystrophy in) patients with end-stage chronic kidney disease (CKD) and secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPTH). It occurs due to increased osteoclastic activity secondary to high plasmatic parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. This leads to bone deformation with thickening and massive enlargement of the cranial vault, resulting in a leonine face appearance. Imaging such as CT scans of the head and neck can reveal bone remodeling, which aids in diagnosing ULO in patients with elevated PTH. Treatment requires a multidisciplinary approach, including medical management of SHPTH, parathyroidectomy, and osteoplasty under a maxillofacial surgery specialist to correct anatomical abnormalities."
"Despite the fact that canagliflozin (Cana), a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, is an anti-diabetic medication with additional effects on the kidney, there is limited experimental data to deliberate its hepato-reno-protective potentiality. Acetaminophen (APAP) overdose remains one of the prominent contributors to hepato-renal damage."
"The African hunting dog (Lycaon pictus, 2n = 78) once ranged over most sub-Saharan ecosystems except its deserts and rainforests. However, as a result of (still ongoing) population declines, today they remain only as small fragmented populations. Furthermore, the future of the species remains unclear, due to both anthropogenic pressure and interactions with domestic dogs, thus their preservation is a conservation priority. On the tree of life, the hunting dog is basal to Canis and Cuon and forms a crown group with them, making it a useful species for comparative genomic studies. Here, we present a diploid chromosome-level assembly of an African hunting dog. Assembled according to Vertebrate Genomes Project guidelines from a combination of PacBio HiFi reads and HiC data, it is phased at the level of individual chromosomes. The maternal (pseudo)haplotype (mat) of our assembly has a length of 2.38 Gbp, and 99.36% of the sequence is encompassed by 39 chromosomal scaffolds. The rest is included in only 36 unplaced short scaffolds. At the contig level, the mat consists of only 166 contigs with an N50 of 39 Mbp. BUSCO (Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologue) analysis showed 95.4% completeness based on Carnivora conservative genes (carnivora_odb10). When compared with other available genomes from subtribe Canina, the quality of the assembly is excellent, typically between the first and third depending on the parameter used, and a significant improvement on previously published genomes for the species. We hope this assembly will play an important role in future conservation efforts and comparative studies of canid genomes."
"Exosomes are nanoscale vesicles derived from various cell types and tissues that have many potential applications, generating great interest from researchers. One particularly intriguing application of exosomes is their use as a direct therapeutic for aesthetic indications. Several studies and case reports have explored the impact of exosomes for numerous cosmetic concerns but a consensus on the outcomes of these studies has not been established."
"Heart failure (HF) often occurs in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), with a major impact on prognosis. Few data are available on the effect of integrated treatment strategies to improve prognosis in patients with AF. We aimed to evaluate the association between HF (according to left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF]), HF optimal medical therapy and adherence to the Atrial Fibrillation Better Care pathway, and major outcomes in patients with AF."
"In recent years there has been a sustained rise in the number of international migrants, and scholarship and practice have increasingly focused on the relationship between health and migration. However, the entitlement to state-subsidized services for migrants with precarious or irregular legal status, often fleeing distressing living conditions, is typically limited to emergency lifesaving health treatment, with nonstate programs attempting to complement this constrained approach. This paper asks whether a primary health care (PHC) approach could serve as a blueprint for institutional priority-setting and for the realization of human rights obligations to help states meet their core international commitments regarding migrant health rights. I look at the multi-actor response in Colombia-where almost three million Venezuelans have sought to settle and many more have transited during the last nine years-as a case study to explore the possibility of a meaningful PHC-oriented right to health in the migration context. Using human rights law standards and commentaries, I suggest that, with some qualifications, this approach holds promise."
"Endophytes can be a promising alternative for sustainable agronomic practices. In this study, we report for the first time a root-colonizing fungal strain (Sl27) of the genus Leptobacillium as a tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) endophyte, with no clear homology to any known species. Performed analyses and assays, including morphological and physiological characterization of the fungal isolate, provided insights into the ecological niche and potential agronomical and industrial applications of the fungal isolate. The ability of Sl27 to establish a symbiotic relationship with the host plant was assessed through experiments under controlled conditions in the growth chamber and greenhouse. Seed-inoculation showed no detrimental effects in the three tomato genotypes studied (TH-30, ADX2, MO-10). The influence of Sl27 on growth parameters of the host plant was dependent on the tomato genotype, with TH-30 showing the most prominent improved phenotype. Moreover, chlorophyll and lycopene content in fruits were enhanced. These findings provide a basis for further studies on the potential application of this new isolate for improving crop performance."
"Knee crepitus, the audible crackling or grinding noise during knee movement, can be experienced across the lifespan and create concern for underlying pathology. Our systematic review aims to provide a summary estimate of knee crepitus prevalence and its association with structural pathology among the general population and across knee conditions."
"Mozambique is one of the countries with the highest prevalence of schistosomiasis, although there is little data on the prevalence of disease and associated morbidity in the adult population. This study aimed to describe and characterize the morbidity associated with schistosomiasis in the adult population of Chókwè district and to explore the use of anamnestic questionnaires and urine dipsticks, as well as point-of-care ultrasound for urinary related findings, to better characterize disease prevalence and morbidity."
"The development of a dual V1a/V2 antagonist compound is a complex and challenging task. Conivaptan is up to now the only known V1a/V2 antagonist which was approved for the treatment of euvolemic hyponatremia. Previously, we reported RGH-122, a novel selective V1a antagonist compound. Herein, we describe several promising dual antagonist compounds, which are derived from RGH-122 by using modifications in its tail region. These modifications can result in excellent binding affinity on both V1a and V2 receptors."
"Secondary sclerosing cholangitis (SSC) represents a disease with a poor prognosis increasingly diagnosed in clinical settings. Notably, SSC in critically ill patients (SSC-CIP) is the most frequent cause. Variables associated with worse prognosis remain unclear. The primary aim of this study was to identify factors associated with transplant-free survival in SSC-CIP patients using readily available data."
"Atrial septal defect (ASD) is a prevalent congenital heart condition in adults that leads to pulmonary hypertension (PAH) and right heart failure if left untreated. During a routine follow-up of adult ASD-PAH patients, the suitability of shunt closure depends on the invasive right heart catheterization (RHC). Nevertheless, performing RHC at every follow-up is impractical and may be harmful. The present retrospective cross-sectional study was designed to investigate which echocardiographic variables were associated with pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) in adult ASD-PAH patients and propose a model using these variables to screen for patients with a correctable shunt."
"The prevalence of age-related eye disorders is increasing with the aging of the global population. Community-based visual health education for the elderly has become a crucial intervention. With the advancement of technology, the application of extended reality (XR), such as virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), in health education has become more popular. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of educating the elderly about common age-related eye disorders through a novel AR-based health education workshop."
"The omission of sentinel lymph node biopsy in low-risk elderly breast cancer patients has been introduced in several guidelines. Despite evidence to support its safety, this recommendation has not been implemented by many clinicians. We have examined two aspects of this recommendation that may explain why sentinel lymph node biopsy continues to be performed in most of these patients. Firstly, we quantified the proportion of patients diagnosed with axillary metastases postoperatively. Secondly, we examined adherence to antihormonal therapy in the same group of patients."
"The need to understand subjective health has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, given its substantial impact on lifestyle habits and perceptions. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the trends and association of subjective health with demographic and behavioral factors, primarily focusing on the change when the COVID-19 pandemic emerged. This study used data from the Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey, comprising 1,190,468 adolescents aged 12-18 years (female, 48.49%). We investigated the trends and association of subjective health with demographic and behavioral factors from 2006 to 2023. A weighted linear regression and joinpoint regression were conducted to evaluate the trend in adolescent subjective health, while logistic regression was used to assess associated factors. A stratification analysis was performed for subgroups to determine variations across different demographic and behavioral groups. The prevalence of reporting high subjective health increased throughout the years before the COVID-19 pandemic; however, subjective health exhibited a decreasing trend during the pandemic. Regarding demographic factors, female sex (ratio of odds ratio [ROR], 0.85 [95% CI, 0.83-0.87]), low-income households (ROR, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.64-0.69]), and low academic achievement (ROR, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.81-0.85]) were associated with less likelihood of reporting high subjective health. Healthier behavioral factors (ROR, breakfast consumption, 1.13 [95% CI, 1.10-1.16]; sufficient fruit intake, 1.12 [95% CI, 1.09-1.15]; sufficient physical activity, 2.02 [95% CI, 1.95-2.09]) were associated with higher subjective health, and the disparities increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. To address the observed decline in subjective health among adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic, targeted interventions aimed at promoting healthy behaviors among particularly vulnerable demographics are crucial."
"Cisplatin is a chemotherapeutic drug, which exhibits undesirable side effects. Chitosan nanoparticles are promising for drug delivery. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of the brown alga Turbinaria triquetra ethyl acetate fraction and polysaccharides, either loaded on chitosan nanoparticles or free, against podocyturia and cisplatin nephrotoxicity in rats. Sixty-six male rats were distributed into 11 equal groups: untreated control, chitosan (CSNPs), ethyl acetate fraction (EAE), polysaccharide (PS), EAE loaded on chitosan nanoparticles (EAE-CSNPs), PS loaded on chitosan nanoparticles (PS-CSNPs), Cisplatin or cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (CDDP), CDDP + EAE, CDDP + PS, CDDP + EAE-CSNPs, and CDDP + PS-CSNPs. Serum urea, creatinine, creatinine clearance, renal malondialdehyde, nitric oxide, paraoxonase 1, renal nephrin, and podocin, and their renal mRNA gene expressions, as well as urinary nephrin and podocin were determined. The results indicated that the ethyl acetate fraction and polysaccharides, either free or loaded, efficiently attenuated podocyturia and cisplatin nephrotoxicity compared to the Cis group. However, the improvement was higher in the nephrotoxic groups treated with EAE-CSNPs and PS-CSNPs. The current study revealed that chitosan nanoencapsulation showed ameliorative effects against podocyturia and cisplatin nephrotoxicity in rats compared to free extracts, offering a new therapeutic strategy for attenuating podocyturia and CDDP-induced nephrotoxicity."

"High-grade gliomas are the most frequent primary brain tumors, yet extraneural metastasis is exceedingly rare. This is in part secondary to the relatively poor survival of these patients and likely the shielding effect of the blood-brain barrier. Given the rarity of extraneural metastasis, the pathophysiology and imaging appearance of extraneural metastasis is under-reported and poorly understood. In this case series we present 6 patients with pathology-confirmed high-grade glioma and extraneural head and neck metastasis. We highlight imaging features of metastasis on CT, MRI, and PET/CT. We also explore potential correlations and pathophysiology of high-grade glioma metastasis to the head and neck region."
"The diagnosis of systemic amyloidosis relies on the detection of amyloid deposition in the tissue, often utilizing biopsy specimens from the abdominal skin owing to their minimal invasiveness. Several amyloid staining methods, including Congo Red, Direct Fast Scarlet (DFS), and Thioflavin T (ThT), have been employed for visualization. Lipomembranous fat necrosis (LFN) is a non-specific reaction pattern of adipose tissue to injury, typically derived from blood insufficiency across a wide range of clinical conditions or diseases. It is characterized by the presence of eosinophilic, crenulated, and/or serpiginous membranes in fat lobules. We encountered a patient in whom ThT yielded suspiciously positive results in amyloidosis screening tests. Furthermore, our retrospective observations suggested that ThT staining was positive for LFN, whereas DFS and Congo red staining yielded negative results. The awareness that LFN can result in false-positive ThT staining during amyloid screening is crucial to avoiding the misdiagnosis of systemic amyloidosis. Furthermore, skin samples should not be collected from areas prone to developing lipomembranous changes. The use of more than two different stains for skin biopsy specimens is recommended."
"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) poses a significant health burden due to its high incidence, and current treatment effectiveness is hindered by drug resistance. Thus, investigation of novel therapeutic approaches derived from natural sources is crucial for improving patient outcomes."
"Recently, a new bacterial disease was detected on cucumber stalks. In order to study the pathogenesis of this disease, the pathogenic bacteria were isolated and identified on the basis of morphological and molecular characteristics, and further analyzed for pathogenicity and antagonistic evaluation. Pathogenicity analysis showed that HlJ-3 caused melting decay and cracking in cucumber stems, and the strain reisolated from re-infected cucumber stalks was morphologically identical to HlJ-3 colonies, which is consistent with the Koch's postulates. The pathogenic strain HlJ-3 was identified as having similar morphological characteristics to Bacillus subtilis. Meanwhile, its internal transcribed spacer sequence (ITS) and DNA gyrase A subunit (gyrA) were both more than 99% homologous and clustered on the same branch with B. subtilis. Therefore, combined with morphological and molecular biological features, strain HlJ-3 was identified as B. subtilis. In addition, B. subtilis, which has a wide range of hosts, was able to infest other common crop species, including potato, tomato, pepper, melon, and radish. Furthermore, antagonistic evaluation confirmed that strain HlJ-3 strongly inhibited the mycelial growth of Colletotrichum coccodes and Alternaria tenuissima in vitro, with antagonistic effects of 69.92% and 68.08%, respectively. In conclusion, our results showed that strain HlJ-3 is B. subtilis, which is pathogenic to cucumber in vivo and can infect plants of Solanaceae, Cucurbitaceae and Brassicaceae with a wide range of hosts. In addition, this strain has good biocontrol effects against C. coccodes and A. tenuissima in vitro. The findings of this research will help to prevent and control the occurrence of this pathogen and regulate its use as a biocontrol agent."
"This study examined nurse faculty members' teaching, scholarship, and professional development interests across Southeastern Conference (SEC) nursing schools, and evaluated differences in these needs associated with years in academia, tenure status, faculty rank, and Accountable Health Communities (AHC) versus non-AHC settings."
"Tamoxifen, an oral medication that blocks estrogen activity, is frequently prescribed for the treatment of advanced breast cancer and as an additional therapy following surgical removal of early stage disease. A 45-year-old female with a history of breast carcinoma treated with tamoxifen presented with sudden onset bilateral visual impairment for 4 days. On ocular examination, the patient exhibited optic disc edema with hyperemia and bilateral anterior pathway defects in visual evoked potentials. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a thickened right optic nerve sheath with patchy enhancement of the left optic nerve sheath. The patient was diagnosed with bilateral optic neuritis and treated with intravenous methylprednisolone, which resulted in significant improvement in visual acuity and resolution of optic disc edema. This case underscores the importance of vigilant ophthalmological monitoring in patients undergoing tamoxifen therapy to facilitate the early detection and management of ocular complications."

"Recent global popularity of social media content about dissociative identity disorder (DID) has coincided with increased self-diagnosis among children and young people who have formed large online communities and presented in clinical settings seeking to affirm their self-diagnoses. We situate this phenomenon within a broader trend toward self-diagnosis due to the widespread visibility and accessibility of mental health content on social media. Social media propelled self-diagnosis raises particular questions for the study and treatment of DID due to long-standing debates over whether the condition is traumagenic, sociogenic, or iatrogenic. This paper draws from the current state of knowledge about psychiatric self-diagnosis, the influence of social media on youth mental health, and the authors' clinical experience to present preliminary conceptualizations of DID self-diagnosis and its significance for clinical practice. Established etiological models for DID acknowledge the role of sociocultural and contextual factors in shaping and reinforcing the elaboration of DID self-states. We hypothesize that multiple forms of online sociality and interaction encourage such elaborations. Social media content regarding DID, however, is routinely unreliable and low quality, often mischaracterizing the condition's symptoms and minimizing associated suffering and disability. This paper considers the likelihood that the self-diagnosing DID cohort includes genuine, genuine but exaggerated, imitative, and malingering cases, and underscores the importance of careful and personalized assessment and diagnosis."
"Ecotoxicology is essential for the evaluation and comprehension of the effects of emergency pollutants (EP) such as heavy metal ions on the natural environment. EPs pose a substantial threat to the health of humans and the proper functioning of the global ecosystem. The primary concern is the exposure of humans and animals to heavy metal ions through contaminated water. The presence of heavy metal ions in drinking water ought to be monitored in accordance with World Health Organization regulations. Among the numerous harmful metal ions, copper ions are responsible for a variety of human diseases."
"This study aimed to investigate the epidemiological trends of Pediatric Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) in Brazil over the period 2008-2022, with a focus on understanding the incidence, mortality rates, and associated healthcare costs. The study explored potential associations between patient characteristics and the occurrence of crises in pediatric SCD cases."
"The use of siblings to infer the factors influencing complex traits has been a cornerstone of quantitative genetics. Here, we utilise siblings for a novel application: the inference of genetic architecture, specifically that relating to individuals with extreme trait values (e.g. in the top 1%). Inferring the genetic architecture most relevant to this group of individuals is important because they are at the greatest risk of disease and may be more likely to harbour rare variants of large effect due to natural selection. We develop a theoretical framework that derives expected distributions of sibling trait values based on an index sibling's trait value, estimated trait heritability, and null assumptions that include infinitesimal genetic effects and environmental factors that are either controlled for or have combined Gaussian effects. This framework is then used to develop statistical tests powered to distinguish between trait tails characterised by common polygenic architecture from those that include substantial enrichments of de novo or rare variant (Mendelian) architecture. We apply our tests to UK Biobank data here, although we note that they can be used to infer genetic architecture in any cohort or health registry that includes siblings and their trait values, since these tests do not use genetic data. We describe how our approach has the potential to help disentangle the genetic and environmental causes of extreme trait values, and to improve the design and power of future sequencing studies to detect rare variants."
Hospitalised patients are at risk of deterioration and death. Delayed identification and transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU) are known to be associated with increased mortality rates. The Risk-stratification of Emergency Department suspected Sepsis (REDS) score was derived and validated in emergency department patients with suspected sepsis. It is unknown if the REDS score would risk-stratify undifferentiated hospitalised patients who deteriorate.
"The prolonged exposure to multiple spaceflight stressors during long-duration missions to the Moon and Mars will be challenging to the physical and mental health of the astronauts. Ground-based studies have reported that attentional set-shifting task (ATSET) performance is impaired after space radiation (SR) exposure. At certain times during deep-space missions, astronauts will likely have to contend with the combined impacts of SR and sleep perturbation. In rats, poor quality, fragmented sleep adversely impacts performance in multiple cognitive tasks, including the ATSET task. While both SR and sleep perturbations independently cause cognitive performance deficits, the incidence, severity and exact nature of those decrements following combined exposure to these flight stressors is largely unknown. This study established the impact that a single night of fragmented sleep has on ATSET performance in both male and female rats exposed to 10 cGy of galactic cosmic ray simulation (GCRsim). The GCRsim beam is a complex beam that mimics the mass and energy spectra of the SR particles that an astronaut will be exposed to within the spacecraft. Rats that had no obvious ATSET performance decrements when normally rested were subjected to fragmented sleep and their ATSET performance reassessed. Sleep fragmentation resulted in significant ATSET performance decrements in GCRsim-exposed rats, with specific performance decrements being observed in stages where attention or cue shifting is extensively used. Performance decrements in these stages are rarely observed after SR exposure. While both male and female rats exhibited latent sleep-related performance decrements, these were sex dependent, with male and female rats exhibiting different types of performance decrements (either reduced processing speed or task completion efficiency) in different stages of the ATSET task. This study suggests that SR-induced cognitive impairment may not be fully evident in normally rested rats, with an underestimation of both the incidence and nature of performance decrements that could occur when multiple space flight stressors are present. These data suggest that that there may be synergistic interactions between multiple space flight stressors that may not be easily predicted from their independent actions."
"With the approval of disease-modifying treatments for 5q-spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), there is an increasing need for biomarkers for disease course and therapeutic response monitoring. Radially sampled Averaged Magnetization Inversion Recovery Acquisitions (rAMIRA) MR-imaging enables spinal cord (SC) gray matter (GM) delineation and quantification in vivo. This study aims to assess SC GM atrophy in patients with 5q-SMA and its associations with clinical disability."
"Pit latrines-the simplest on-site sanitation system-have been extensively used in developing countries in Asia for a long time. However, pit latrines are pollution and health risk hotspots that can cause widespread contamination. It is preferable to upgrade them to septic tanks, which are more advanced, effective, and simple alternatives. This study encourages the transition from pit latrines to septic tanks by making people aware of the health and environmental risks associated with the use of pit latrines. As decisions about sanitation technologies are mostly made by individual households, it is important to find communication tools for the average household to understand the basic information to make informed decisions. To this end, this study used augmented reality as a communication tool. A survey was conducted with Sri Lankan households that use pit latrines, and experiments were carried out in a university laboratory in Japan. The use of augmented reality increased people's understanding of the environmental and health risks of pit latrines. This understanding was retained for some time because people found the use of augmented reality 'enjoyable'. Hence, our findings contribute to the promotion of the transition from pit latrines to septic tanks in low- and middle-income countries."

"Different Guided Tissue Regeneration (GTR) procedures, such as membranes, bone substitute materials, and Autologous Platelet Concentrates (APCs), have been applied after surgical root canal treatment (SRCT), which produce different outcomes. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of regenerative procedures on the healing process following SRCT."
"Enhanced glycolysis and elevated lactic acid (LA) production are observed during sudden death syndrome (SDS) in broilers. However, the mechanism underlying LA-induced cardiomyocyte damage and heart failure in fast-growing broilers remains unclear. In this study, chicken embryo cardiomyocytes (CECs) were cultured and treated with LA to investigate LA-induced CEC injury and its mechanism, aiming to develop strategies to prevent LA-induced SDS in broilers. Results showed that LA inhibited CEC proliferation and contraction whereas inducing apoptosis. Furthermore, LA disrupted mitochondrial ultrastructure, reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, activated mitophagy, and disturbed mitochondrial dynamics. Treatment with Mdivi-1, a selective Drp1 inhibitor, improved CEC viability, restored mitochondrial network integrity, reduced reactive oxygen species production, and inhibited LA-induced apoptosis. These findings suggest that LA-induced cardiomyocyte injury during SDS in broilers is associated with mitochondrial damage and increased mitochondrial fission. The inhibition of mitochondrial hyperfission by Mdivi-1 effectively preserves CEC morphology, structure, and function, playing a critical role in preventing LA-induced damage. This study provides a foundation for strategies to prevent and control SDS in broilers."
Hyperammonaemia (HA) is a metabolic disorder characterized by increased ammonia levels in the blood and is associated with severe neurological impairments. Some previous findings have shown the involvement of the nitric oxide pathway in HA-induced neurological impairments. The current study explored the impact of tadalafil on neurological impairments induced by HA in a zebrafish larval model due to its reported indirect interactions with the nitric oxide pathway.
"Porcupines, members of the Hystricidae family, represent a unique group of herbivorous mammals. This study details the identification of a newly discovered mandible fragment of Hystrix primigenia, along with a right cheek tooth series from the middle Turolian Kemiklitepe-A fossil locality. While Hystrix fossils are found in numerous localities, the materials are often limited to a few dental fragments or isolated teeth, posing challenges to systematic investigations. The examination of this lower tooth series prompted a comprehensive review of all H. primigenia findings across Eurasia, shedding light on its adaptive characteristics over time and space. Our paleobiogeographical analysis indicates the absence of H. depereti in Late Miocene Türkiye, while the dispersal range of H. primigenia is broader than that of H. depereti in Eurasia. Additionally, the study delves into the discussion of H. primigenia and H. depereti findings in Eurasia, ultimately refining the categorization of Late Miocene Hystrix discoveries in Türkiye to two species: H. primigenia and H. kayae. Our review suggests the possibility of an additional H. kayae finding from Samos, Greece."
"Taiwanese oolong tea is renowned for its excellent quality and enjoys a prestigious reputation both domestically and internationally. In recent years, there has been an issue with imported Taiwanese-style oolong tea being sold as genuine Taiwanese oolong tea, which has adversely affected the brand value of Taiwanese oolong tea. In this study, samples of domestic oolong tea (Taiwanese oolong tea) and Taiwanese-style oolong tea produced abroad (including China, Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand, etc.) were collected. A multi-elements analysis method was applied to establish an elemental database of tea leaf samples. Subsequently, various widely used classification methods were employed to develop a discrimination model for identifying the origin of Taiwanese oolong tea. Utilizing the discrimination model established from a database of 727 samples to determine whether the tea leaves were Taiwanese or external, the statistical performances of classification models such as LDA, Ridge, Random Forest, Boosting, and SVM are nearly consistent. These models achieved an accuracy rate of 97.1%-97.8%, a recall rate (true positive rate) for Taiwanese origin of 98.4%-99.0%, and a precision value for predicting Taiwanese origin of 97.3%-97.8%. This identification technology has become an officially recognized and publicly recommended testing method in Taiwan (TFDAF0032.00, released on November 5, 2021) and has been effectively utilized in official administrative inspections for identification of origin, as well as providing evidence for investigative cases."
"Duck Tembusu virus (DTMUV), a novel positive-sense RNA virus, has caused significant economic losses in the poultry industry of Eastern and Southeast Asia since its outbreak in 2010. Furthermore, the rapid transmission and potential zoonotic nature of DTMUV pose a threat to public health safety. In this study, a 4D-DIA quantitative proteomics approach was employed to identify differentially expressed cellular proteins in DTMUV-infected DF-1 cells, which are routinely used for virus isolation and identification for DTMUV, as well as the development of vaccines against other poultry viruses. One hundred fifty-seven differentially expressed cellular proteins were identified, including 84 upregulated and 73 downregulated proteins at 48 h post-infection, among which CXCL8, DDX3X, and TRPV2 may play crucial roles in viral propagation. Notably, for the upregulated protein TRPV2, the DTMUV replication was inhibited in TRPV2-low-expressing DF-1 cells. In summary, our research represents the application of 4D-DIA quantitative proteomics to analyze the proteomic landscape of DTMUV-infected poultry cells. These findings may provide valuable insights into understanding the interaction mechanism between DTMUV and poultry cells, as well as the identification of disease-resistant host factors in poultry breeding research."
Few reports have shown Quality-of-Life long-term outcomes in children with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) who received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support.

"Urinalysis is a commonly performed test for the diagnosis and prognosis of kidney disease in hospitalized patients. It involves examining the chemical composition of the urine and microscopy to examine the cells and casts. In clinical settings, urinalysis is frequently delayed by several hours after sample collection and held at room temperature. The purpose of this study is to investigate the changes in urine composition over set time intervals to confirm the reliability of urinalysis when there are delays in performing the tests."
"Bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) is a disease characterized by airway obstruction and fibrosis that can occur in all age groups. Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) is a clinical manifestation of BO in patients who have undergone lung transplantation or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Persistent inflammation and fibrosis of small airways make the disease irreversible, eventually leading to lung failure. The pathogenesis of BO is not entirely clear, but immune disorders are commonly involved, with various immune cells playing complex roles in different BO subtypes. Accordingly, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recently approved several new drugs that can alleviate chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) by regulating the function of immune cells, some of which have efficacy specifically with cGVHD-BOS. In this review, we will discuss the roles of different immune cells in BO/BOS, and introduce the latest drugs targeting various immune cells as the main target. This study emphasizes that immune dysfunction is an important driving factor in its pathophysiology. A better understanding of the role of the immune system in BO will enable the development of targeted immunotherapies to effectively delay or even reverse this condition."
"Compared to the general population of Hawai'i, Native Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders (NHPI) shoulder a disproportionately high risk for obesity-related cardiometabolic disorders, such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The gut microbiome is an area of rapid research interest for its role in regulating adjacent metabolic pathways, offering novel opportunities to better understand the etiology of these health disparities. Obesity and the gut microbiome are influenced by regional, racial-ethnic, and community-specific factors, limiting the generalizability of current literature for understudied populations. Additionally, anthropometric and directly measured obesity indices are variably predictive of adiposity and metabolic health risk in this diverse population. Thus, further NHPI-inclusive research is required to adequately characterize community-specific factors in the context of obesity-related disease etiology. Culturally responsible research ethics and scientific communication are crucial to conducting such research, especially among indigenous and understudied populations. In this review, we explore these limitations in current literature, emphasizing the urgent need for NHPI-inclusive research to assess community-specific factors accurately. Such accuracy in Indigenous health research may ensure that findings relevant to individual or public health recommendations and/or policies are meaningful to the communities such research aims to serve."

"Breast cancer among women is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of death worldwide. There many advances in diagnosing and treating this disease, early diagnosis and treatment are still a significant challenge in the early stages. In recent years, microRNAs have attracted much attention in cancer diagnosis and treatment. However, the role of miR-146a in breast cancer is still controversial. We aimed to investigate the roles of miR-146a in apoptosis in breast cancer cells."
"Recent studies have demonstrated an association between hypoglycemic medications and neuroprotective action in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease (PD). Therefore, in this meta-analysis, our objective was to evaluate the efficacy of these medications, compared to placebo, as disease-modifying therapy in patients with PD."
"Available evidence suggests that various medical/rehabilitation treatments evoke multiple effects on blood hemostasis. It was therefore the aim of our study to examine whether fascial manipulation, vibration exercise, motor imagery, or neuro-muscular electrical stimulation can activate the coagulation system, and, thereby, expose patients to thrombotic risk. Ten healthy young subject were enrolled in the study. Blood samples were obtained pre and posttreatment. Besides standard laboratory methods, calibrated automated thrombography (CAT) and thrombelastometry (TEM) were used allowing sensitive detection of hyper- and hypocoagulable states. Application of fascial manipulation, motor imagery, or neuro-muscular electrical stimulation had vitually no effect whereas a single bout of vibration exercise caused significant coagulation activation. For example, TEM-derived coagulation times were significantly shortened (209 ± 34 vs. 187 ± 41 s, p = 0.0098) and CAT-derived thrombin peaks were significantly higher (235 ± 88 vs. 268 ± 82 nM, p = 0.0020) in post compared with preexercise samples. Moreover, vibration exercise, motor imagery, and neuro-muscular electrical stimulation caused significant plasma expansion (6.15%, 7.53%, and 3.88% plasma volume changes, respectively). We conclude that vibrational exercise apparently represents a potential procoagulant stimulus, and ongoing studies have to clarify whether VE should be applied particularly to patients with an elevated risk for thrombosis."
"Elderly acute kidney injury (AKI) occurring in the intensive care unit (ICU), particularly when caused or accompanied by sepsis, is linked to extended hospital stays, increased mortality rates, heightened prevalence of chronic diseases, and diminished quality of life. This study primarily utilizes a comprehensive critical care database to examine the correlation of albumin corrected anion gap (ACAG) levels with short-term prognosis in elderly patients with AKI caused or accompanied by sepsis, thus assisting physicians in early identification of high-risk patients."
Behavioural Parent Training (BPT) is an evidence-based psychosocial intervention for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children. The use of online technologies significantly increases the accessibility of these interventions. This study aimed to assess the relative efficacy of face-to-face and online training in the use of parenting strategies taught. We also explored the impact of parental ADHD symptom levels.
"Lead (Pb) is one of the most common heavy metals with toxicological effects on many tissues in humans as well as animals. In order to counteract the toxic effects of this metal, the administration of synthetic or natural antioxidants is thus required. The aim of this study was to examine the beneficial effect of the aqueous extract of Ononis natrix (AEON) against lead acetate-induced damage from a behavioral, biochemical, and histological point of view. Forty-eight male mice were divided into four equal groups: Ctr (control); Pb (lead acetate 1g/l); Pb + On 100 mg/kg (lead acetate 1 g/l + AEON 100 mg/kg); Pb + On 500 mg/kg (lead acetate 1 g/l + AEON 500 mg/kg). AEON was administered orally from day 21 after the start of lead exposure up to the end of the experiment. The results revealed that lead induced behavioral disorders, increased serum levels of liver markers (AST, ALT, and bilirubin), as well as kidney markers (urea and creatinine). At the same time, levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) increased significantly. Moreover, Pb caused structural changes in the liver and kidneys of Pb-exposed mice. However, AEON administration significantly improved all lead-induced brain, liver, and kidney dysfunctions. Our results suggest that AEON could be a source of molecules with therapeutic potential against brain, liver, and kidney abnormalities caused by lead exposure."
"Many children on the autism spectrum engage in challenging behaviors, like aggression, due to difficulties communicating and regulating their stress. Identifying effective intervention strategies is often subjective and time-consuming. Utilizing unobservable internal physiological data to predict strategy effectiveness may help simplify this process for teachers and parents. This study examined whether heart rate data can predict strategy effectiveness. Teachers and coders from the research team recorded behavioral and heart rate data over three months for each participating student on the autism spectrum using the KeepCalm app, a platform that provides in-the-moment strategy suggestions based on heart rate and past behavioral data, across 226 instances of strategy interventions. A binary logistic regression was performed to assess whether heart rate reduction, time to return to heart rate baseline, and documented skills and challenging behaviors predicted strategy effectiveness. Results suggested that heart rate reduction may be a significant predictor, and supported the existing practice of using behavioral patterns as proxies for strategy effectiveness. Additional analyses indicate proactive strategies are more effective and are associated with greater reduction in heart rate, relative to reactive strategies. Further exploration of how internal physiological data can complement observable behaviors in assessing intervention strategy effectiveness is warranted given the novelty of our findings."
"Plumbagin is a naphthoquinone from the roots of the Plumbago species and exhibits anticancer activity. Translational usage of plumbagin in biomedical sciences is restricted due to its poor solubility and bioavailability. Therefore, pH-responsive plumbagin-loaded vaginal nanoformulations with polylactic acid (PLA)-chitosan polymeric coat were fabricated by inotropic gelation technique. Among the four (F1, F2, F3, F4) nanoformulations prepared, F3 exhibited good interaction of polymers with plumbagin as evidenced by FTIR, XRD, and thermal analysis. The positive zeta potential (48.4 ± 5.57 mV), optimal size (694 ± 65.76 nm), low PDI (0.157), and good encapsulation efficiency (77.8 ± 3.62%) of F3 were significant. The indirect method of drug loading (58.35 ± 5.00%) confirmed the drug content of about 495.44 ± 5.00 µg of plumbagin in 1 mg of F3. The drug loading pattern was confirmed by TEM analysis, and the spherical morphology of the nanocomposite was confirmed by SEM analysis. F3 formulation showed 46% and 25.2% of drug release in 24 h in simulated vaginal fluid at pH 4.5 and 7 respectively with sustained release and hydrolyses of lactic acid from PLA. Among all the nanoformulations evaluated, nanoformulation F3 with promising physicochemical properties showed good antifungal and antibacterial activity against various fungal and bacterial strains. F3 exhibited potent cytotoxicity with an IC50 of 3.6 ± 0.12 µg/ml for HeLa and an IC50 of 0.81 ± 0.01 µg/ml for SiHa cells. Altogether, the nanoformulation F3 exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against vaginal infections and cytotoxicity against cervical cancer cell lines."
"Fixation methods for posterior malleolar fracture (PMF) are a source of great controversy. This study aims to compare complications, clinical, and radiological outcomes between PA screws and posterior plate in PMF using current literature. A systematic search strategy was conducted following the PRISMA protocol. Medline (PubMed), Embase (Elsevier), and Lilacs databases were used to identify complication rates (infection, nonunion, loss of reduction, osteoarthrosis, and sural nerve injury) and to compare reported functional outcomes. The level of evidence in the articles was assessed using the GRADE tool. The studies eligible for meta-analysis were processed using The Review Manager version 5.4.1 software. Twelve articles met the inclusion criteria; 5 articles were included for subgroup meta-analysis. Overall infection rate, loss of reduction and sural nerve injury were each 2%. Osteoarthritis rate was 10%. There was no difference in risk reduction for infection rate (RD = 0.01; 95% CI: -0.03 to 0.06; p = .50), loss of reduction (RD = -0.00; 95% CI: -0.03 to 0.03; p = .88), sural nerve injury (RD = 0.01; 95% CI: -0.03 to 0.04; p = .70), osteoarthrosis (RD = -0.00; 95% CI: -0.09 to 0.09; p = .97), functional (MD = 0.70; 95% CI: -1.06 to 2.45; p = .44) or pain scores (MD = 0.12; 95% CI: -0.31 to 0.55; p = .58), nor deficit in dorsiflexion (MD= -0.26; 95% CI: -1.64 to 1.12; p = .71). There were no clinical nor radiological significant differences when comparing fixation of PMF with plates or PA screws. With current literature it is not possible to establish the superiority of either fixation."
"Acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is an inflammatory response arising from lung and systemic injury with diverse causes and associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. To date, no fully effective pharmacological therapies have been established and the relevant underlying mechanisms warrant elucidation, which may be facilitated by multi‑omics technology. The present review summarizes the application of multi‑omics technology in identifying novel diagnostic markers and therapeutic strategies of ALI/ARDS as well as its pathogenesis."
"Triamcinolone acetonide (TA) is a corticosteroid, and widely used in the treatment of eye diseases such as macular edema, proliferative vitreoretinopathy, and chronic uveitis. It's also used in diseases such as osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Despite the width of its usage, it has toxicity in the eye. Nanogels are advantageous in applying toxic and low bioavailability drugs thanks to their swelling ability and stability. In the presented study, to minimize the disadvantages of TA, and to reach the drug into the back segment of the eye, TA-loaded chitosan (CS) nanogel (CS-TA Nanogel) has been prepared, and in vitro characterized. CS-TA nanogels were prepared by ionic gelation and characterized by SEM, FTIR, and TGA. Drug release profile, and in vitro cytotoxicity was determined to evaluate the efficacy of nanogels for intravitreal eye applications. DNA damage, and oxidative stress caused by nanogels in eye endothelial cells were investigated. CS and CS-TA nanogels were synthesized in the sizes range 200-300 nm with an overall positive charge surface. The loading efficiency of TA on nanogels was determined as 50%. Cells exposed to 250 µg/ml free TA showed 74% viability, while this rate was 90% in cells exposed to CS-TA nanogels. 8-OHdG levels were determined as 54.93 ± 1.118 ng/mL in control cells and 92.47 ± 0.852 ng/mL in cells exposed to 250 µg/ml TA. TA both induces oxidative stress and causes DNA damage in HRMEC cells. However, administration of TA with carrier increased cell viability, total antioxidant capacity, and reduced oxidative DNA damage."
"The outcomes of total hip arthroplasty (THA) are highly dependent upon the restoration of native hip biomechanics and optimal component positioning. Robotic technologies for THA have rapidly improved the accuracy of component positioning and maintaining the planned center of rotation. While robotic-assisted THA (RA-THA) has primarily been employed in surgically intricate cases, its potential benefits in scenarios of diminished surgical complexity remain less explored. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess the odds of developing systemic and joint complications following RA-THA in cases of reduced surgical complexity."
"After a cryptogenic stroke, patients often will require prolonged cardiac monitoring; however, the subset of patients who would benefit from long-term rhythm monitoring is not clearly defined."
"Taxol is the first-line chemo-drug for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but it frequently causes acquired resistance, which leads to the failure of treatment. Therefore, it is critical to screen and characterize the mechanism of the taxol-resistance reversal agent that could re-sensitize the resistant cancer cells to chemo-drug."
The effectiveness of early surgery in preventing complications in elderly Japanese hip fracture patients and the impact of weekend hospitalization need further investigation. The purpose of this study was to determine whether weekend hospitalization affects the incidence of various sequelae and death during hospitalization in elderly hip fracture patients using a comprehensive Japanese hip fracture case database.
"This study used ultra-widefield swept-source optical coherence tomography angiography (UWF SS-OCTA) to analyze and compare choroidal blood flow and anatomical changes in eyes affected by central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC), pachychoroid neovasculopathy (PNV), and uncomplicated pachychoroid (UCP). The findings revealed distribution patterns of vortex veins across the three patient groups and provided initial findings insights into the origin of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in PNV. A total of 44 patients with CSC, 38 with PNV, and 46 with UCP were included in the analysis. Three-dimensional data were obtained from scans measuring 20 mm vertically by 24 mm horizontally with a scan depth of 6 mm, covering nine subfields. The results showed that CSC groups exhibited significantly higher choroidal vessel volume per unit area (mCVV/a), choroidal vascularity index (CVI), and choroidal thickness (CT) compared to the PNV and UCP groups. While the PNV and UCP groups shared similar choroidal vascular characteristics, the PNV group exhibited slightly higher choroidal vessel volume and notably the lowest foveal choriocapillaris density. These findings suggest that PNV and CSC may represent a continuous pathological spectrum, while UCP might be considered a precursor to CSC or a stage following its resolution. Additionally, further analysis indicated that CNV in PNV could be attributed to choriocapillaris occlusion and ischemia resulting from mechanical compression by hypertrophic choroidal vessels. These findings enhance our understanding of choroidal structure and hemodynamics within pachychoroid spectrum diseases (PSD), shedding light on shared etiological mechanisms and advancing the characterization of their pathophysiology."
"Despite increased recruitment of Latina medical students, the percentage of Latina physicians has remained stagnant, suggesting unique retentive barriers affecting this population. Discriminatory experiences involving bias may contribute to difficulties in the retention and advancement of Latinas in medicine. This qualitative analysis aimed to explore thematic barriers prevalent among Latinas throughout their medical training in the United States."
"Malware is a common word in modern era. Everyone using computer is aware of it. Some users have to face the problem known as Cyber crimes. Nobody can survive without use of modern technologies based on computer networking. To avoid threat of malware, different companies provide antivirus strategies on a high cost. To prevent the data and keep privacy, companies using computers have to buy these antivirus programs (software). Software varies due to types of malware and is developed on structure of malware with a deep insight on behavior of nodes. We selected a mathematical malware propagation model having variable infection rate. We were interested in examining the impact of memory effects in this dynamical system in the sense of fractal fractional (FF) derivatives. In this paper, theoretical analysis is performed by concepts of fixed point theory. Existence, uniqueness and stability conditions are investigated for FF model. Numerical algorithm based on Lagrange two points interpolation polynomial is formed and simulation is done using Matlab R2016a on the deterministic model. We see the impact of different FF orders using power law kernel. Sensitivity analysis of different parameters such as initial infection rate, variable adjustment to sensitivity of infected nodes, immune rate of antivirus strategies and loss rate of immunity of removed nodes is investigated under FF model and is compared with classical. On investigation, we find that FF model describes the effects of memory on nodes in detail. Antivirus software can be developed considering the effect of FF orders and parameters to reduce persistence and eradication of infection. Small changes cause significant perturbation in infected nodes and malware can be driven into passive mode by understanding its propagation by FF derivatives and may take necessary actions to prevent the disaster caused by cyber crimes."
This study aimed to assess the usefulness of thyroglobulin (Tg) after radioiodine (RAI) therapy in predicting excellent response (ER) to therapy in postoperative differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC).
"Traditional methods of treating allergies primarily revolve around avoiding allergens and promptly using rescue medications when allergic symptoms occur. However, this approach is known for its inefficiency and limited success in achieving long-term relief. Our aim was to conduct a comprehensive analysis of previously published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that explore the effectiveness and safety of epicutaneous immunotherapy (EPIT) as a means to manage food allergies in children."
Telephone instructions are commonly used to improve cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) by lay bystanders. This usually implies an audio but no visual connection between the provider and the emergency medical telecommunicator. We aimed to investigate whether video-guided feedback via a camera drone enhances the quality of CPR.
"Previous studies indicate differences in experiences of loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic but are constricted by limited timeframes and absence of key risk factors. This study explores temporal and inter-individual variations of loneliness in Canadians over the pandemic's first year (April 2020-2021), by identifying loneliness trajectories. It then seeks to provide information about groups overrepresented in high and persistent loneliness trajectories by examining their associations with risk factors: social isolation indicators (living alone, adherence to health measures limiting in-person contacts, and online contacts), young adultood, and the interactions between these factors. Data comes from a large longitudinal study with a representative Canadian sample (n = 1763) and 11 measurement times. Analyses consist of (1) a group-based modelling approach to identify trajectories of loneliness and (2) multinomial logistic regressions to test associations between risk factors and trajectory membership. Varied experiences of loneliness during the pandemic were revealed as five trajectories were identified: moderate-unstable (38.5%), high-stable (26.7%), low-unstable (20.5%), very low-stable (8.6%), and very high-decreasing (5.7%). Individuals living alone associated with higher trajectories. Contrary to our expectations, adhering to social distancing measures and having fewer online contacts associated with lower trajectories. Age and interactions were not significant in regard to loneliness trajectories."
"Emerging evidence demonstrates an opportunity for using probiotics to support bone health, but findings in humans are limited. This systematic review investigated if probiotic supplementation improves bone mineral density (BMD) and bone structure in rodent models compared to no supplementation. Studies (n = 71) examining the effect of oral consumption of any probiotic strain on BMD or bone structure in rodents were included. Meta-analyses were conducted separately by study model (intact, ovariectomized) and bone site (femur, tibia, spine) to determine the probiotic effect (standardized mean difference, SMD) on volumetric BMD (vBMD), bone volume fraction (BV/TV), and cortical thickness (Ct.Th). Reasons for heterogeneity were explored (probiotic genus, sex, type of rodent). In intact rodents, probiotics resulted in greater vBMD (SMD = 0.43, 95% CI [0.13, 0.74], I2 = 3%, p < 0.05) and higher BV/TV (SMD = 0.63, 95% CI [0.25, 1.02], I2 = 57%, p < 0.05) at the femur without changes in cortical bone structure. In ovariectomized models, probiotic supplementation resulted in greater vBMD (femur: SMD = 1.28, 95% CI [1.01, 1.55], I2 = 3%, p < 0.05; tibia: SMD = 1.29, 95% CI [0.52, 2.05], I2 = 67%, p < 0.05; and spine: SMD = 1.47, 95% CI [0.97, 1.97], I2 = 26%, p < 0.05) as well as higher BV/TV (femur: SMD = 1.16, 95% CI [0.80, 1.52], I2 = 56%, p < 0.05; tibia: SMD = 2.13, 95% CI [1.09, 3.17], I2 = 79%, p < 0.05; spine: SMD = 2.04, 95% CI [1.17, 2.90], I2 = 76%, p < 0.05) and Ct.Th at the tibia (SMD = 2.35; 95% CI [0.72, 3.97], I2 = 82%, p < .0.05) but not at the femur versus control. The syntheses support probiotics as a strategy to improve bone outcomes in rodent models."
"The absence of an accurate reference test complicates the evaluation of tuberculosis (TB) diagnostic tests among people living with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (PLWHIV). The objective of this study was to estimate (using Bayesian latent class models [BLCM]) the sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp) and negative and positive predictive values (NPV and PPV) of sputum smear microscopy (SSM), Xpert Ultra and lipoarabinomannan antigen (LAM) tests for TB among PLWHIV in Nairobi, Kenya. This cross-sectional study enrolled a total of 190 patients aged ≥ 18 years with presumptive TB seeking treatment at the Kibra Community Health Center Comprehensive Care Centre (CCC) clinic between September 2022 and March 2023. The diagnostic data obtained from the three tests were analysed using a BLCM framework to derive accuracy estimates of the three diagnostic tests. The Xpert Ultra assay registered a higher Se (85.0; 95% PCI [41.4-99.4]) compared to LAM (26.8; 95% PCI [4.7-67.6]) and SSM (56.7 [16.4-97.4]). However, SSM had the highest Sp (99.6; 95% PCI [97.7-100.0]). The Xpert Ultra assay yielded the highest overall combination of Se and Sp at 80.8% (95% PCI [37.0-96.5]). On predictive values, SSM recorded the highest PPV at 84.5% (95% PCI [38.4-99.4]). Nonetheless, all the tests exhibited noticeably high NPVs (>96%). The Xpert Ultra assay recorded the highest Se of the three tests. Nevertheless, the SSM test registered the highest Sp and correspondingly the highest PPV. On NPVs, the tests had similar estimates. Consequently, a two-test serial testing strategy, entailing an initial screening with the more sensitive Xpert Ultra assay followed by retesting of any positives with the more specific SSM test, could be most optimal in this low-burden TB setting."
"In critically ill patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), standard treatment algorithms might not be applicable. Emergency departments (ED) play a crucial role in implementing individualized treatment approaches. The aim of this study was to assess the association of lactate and cardioversion success rates in AF patients presenting to an ED. This was a retrospective single-center study analyzing 3535 AF episodes between 2012 and 2022. The main outcome was cardioversion (CV) to sinus rhythm (SR) depending on serum lactate levels (mmol/L). Lactate levels were divided into quintiles (lac < 1.1, 1.1-1.3, 1.4-1.7, 1.8-2.3 and > 2.3 mmol/L). Overall CV success declined with rising lactate levels (SR: lac < 1.1 79% (n = 547), 1.1-1.3 76% (n = 579), 1.4-1.7 73% (n = 562), 1.8-2.3 66% (n = 447), > 2.3 mmol/L 61% (n = 393); p < 0.001). Electrical CV (eCV) was conducted in 1021 (SR 95%), medical CV (mCV) in 706 (SR: 72%), facilitated CV in 523 (SR: 88%) and spontaneous conversion was observed in 591 (46% of all patients without treatment) cases. ECV was effective independent of lactate levels (SR: lac < 1.1 96% (n = 225), 1.1-1.3 93% (n = 253), 1.4-1.7 97% (n = 228), 1.8-2.3 92% (n = 154), > 2.3 mmol/L 95% (n = 106); p = 0.716). However, for mCV, conversion success decreased with increasing lactate levels (SR: lac < 1.1 84% (n = 95), 1.1-1.3 80% (n = 109), 1.4-1.7 75% (n = 115), 1.8-2.3 67% (n = 93), > 2.3 mmol/L 59% (n = 97); p < 0.001). Overall cardioversion success was less likely with rising lactate levels; especially medical cardioversion success rates decreased. Therefore, AF in critically ill may benefit from either electrical cardioversion, treatment of the underlying condition, or primary rate control."
"Age-related changes in body composition such as muscle loss can lead to sarcopenia, which is closely associated with frailty. However, the effect of body fat accumulation on frailty in old age remains unclear. In particular, the association between the combination of these two conditions, known as sarcopenic obesity, and frailty in older adults is unclear."
"Rehabilitation after anterior cruciate ligament ACL reconstruction (ACLR) is crucial for safe return to play (RTP) and reducing the chances of a reinjury. Yet, there is no consensus on the ideal functional tests to assess rehabilitation progress in soccer players after ACLR."
"The Solanaceae family, which includes economically important crops such as tomatoes, potatoes and peppers, has experienced a rapid expansion in genomic data due to advancements in sequencing technologies. However, existing databases are limited by incomplete species representation, a lack of comprehensive comparative genomic tools and the absence of systematic pan-genomic analyses. To address these gaps, we developed the Solanaceae Information Resource (SoIR, https://soir.bio2db.com), a comprehensive genomics database for the Solanaceae family. SoIR integrates genomic data from 81 species and transcriptomic data from 41 species, encompassing a total of 3 908 408 gene annotations derived from Gene Ontology, nonredundant protein, Pfam, Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL databases. The resource also includes 3 437 115 CRISPR guide sequences, 212 395 transcription factors and 19 086 genes associated with methylation modification. In addition to species-specific analyses, SoIR provides extensive bioinformatics tools for investigating gene family evolution, phylogenetic relationships and karyotype reconstruction across 25 fully sequenced genomes. With advanced tools such as Blast, Synteny and Sequence Alignment, the platform provides users with interactive and intuitive visualizations for conducting cross-species comparative genomics. As the first comprehensive pan-genomic resource for the entire Solanaceae family, SoIR facilitates in-depth cross-species analysis, supporting global research initiatives in plant evolution, functional genomics and crop improvement."
"Gene transfection is a fundamental technique in the fields of biological research and therapeutic innovation. Due to their biocompatibility and membrane-mimetic properties, lipid vectors serve as essential tools in transfection. The successful delivery of genetic material into the cytoplasm is contingent upon the fusion of the vector and cellular membranes, which enables hydrophilic polynucleic acids to traverse the hydrophobic barriers of two intervening membranes. This review examines the critical role of membrane fusion in lipofection efficiency, with a particular focus on the molecular mechanisms that govern lipoplex-membrane interactions. This analysis will examine the key challenges inherent to the fusion process, from achieving initial membrane proximity to facilitating final content release through membrane remodeling. In contrast to viral vectors, which utilize specialized fusion proteins, lipid vectors necessitate a strategic formulation and environmental optimization to enhance their fusogenicity. This review discusses recent advances in vector design and fusion-promoting strategies, emphasizing their potential to improve gene delivery yield. It highlights the importance of understanding lipoplex-membrane fusion mechanisms for developing next-generation delivery systems and emphasizes the need for continued fundamental research to advance lipid-mediated transfection technology."
"While cardiovascular and neurological diseases induced by obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) hypoxia are well established, the association between neuro-otological diseases and OSAS is not entirely understood. Vestibular and audiological tests have been used to evaluate the degeneration of neurons in the brainstem caused by recurrent hypoxia."
"Mutations are acquired frequently, such t`hat each cell's genome inscribes its history of cell divisions. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) accumulates throughout the genome, offering large encoding capacity for phylogenetic inference of cell lineage.In this chapter, we demonstrate a method, using single-cell RNA sequencing, for reconstructing cell lineages from inferred LOH events in a Bayesian manner, annotating the lineage with cell phenotypes, and marking developmental time points based on X-chromosome inactivation. This type of retrospective analysis could be incorporated into scRNA-seq pipelines and was initially developed to investigate Emx1+ cortical projection neuron and glia lineages from C57Bl/6J (B6) and CAST/EiJ (CA) interstrain F1 mice, describing progenitor cells giving rise to multiple cortical cell types through stereotyped expansion and distinct waves of neurogenesis."
"Semaglutide, a novel long-acting GLP-1RA, stimulates insulin and suppresses islet-secreted glucagon to reduce glucose levels. It has been unveiled that m6A mRNA modification plays a pivotal role in regulating β cell function. However, it remains unclear whether semaglutide can elicit protective effects through manipulating m6A modification and the underlying mechanism. We aimed to elucidate the role played by semaglutide in m6A modification, and to explore its specific regulatory targets. Furthermore, we also delve into its effects on gut microbiota."
"Cathelicidins are a diverse family of antimicrobial peptides found across many vertebrate species, playing a pivotal role in the innate immune system. These peptides exhibit a variety of structural motifs, including α-helices, β-hairpins, and random coils, contributing to their broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. The structural diversity of cathelicidins allows them to interact with a wide range of microbial targets, thereby enhancing their antimicrobial efficacy. Distinct species produce specific cathelicidins, each adapted to meet their unique immune requirements. Cathelicidins primarily function by disrupting microbial membranes, leading to cell lysis. Beyond their direct antimicrobial action, they possess immunomodulatory properties that bolster host defense mechanisms. These properties include promoting chemotaxis, enhancing phagocytosis, and inducing cytokine production, thereby modulating the host immune response. The therapeutic potential of cathelicidins is significant, especially in light of the growing challenge of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). As conventional antibiotics lose efficacy, cathelicidins emerge as promising alternatives due to their unique mechanisms of action and reduced likelihood of inducing resistance. Recent research underscores their potential in treating infections, inflammatory diseases, and even cancer. Advances in synthetic biology offer promising prospects for effective cathelicidin-based therapies in the future. This review summarizes the diversity, modes of action, and clinical prospects of cathelicidins specific to farm animals."
"The diagnosis of lumbosacral radiculopathy includes the exclusion of common musculoskeletal conditions that can cause similar symptoms. Neurology and physiatry physicians use history taking and physical examination findings to develop a differential diagnosis. Appropriate diagnostic testing is then utilized to narrow down this differential diagnosis to determine a working hypothesis of the cause of a patient's symptoms, leading to a treatment plan. There are stark limitations of patient symptoms and physical examination findings in making the diagnosis of lumbosacral radiculopathy and added value of a combination of symptoms and signs to distinguish patients with lumbosacral radiculopathy from patients with mimic disorders. Diagnostic tests have variable strengths and limitations in helping to confirm this diagnosis, contrasting the high sensitivity and lower specificity of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with the high specificity but lower sensitivity of electromyography (EMG). Further complexity is added to the task of making a diagnosis and setting a treatment plan by the fact that these disorders are common and interact with each other; they are present concomitantly in up to 25% of patients presenting for electrodiagnostic evaluation. A companion paper will review common musculoskeletal mimics of lumbosacral radiculopathy and provide tools to anchor testing for those conditions to the traditional neurological evaluation of lumbosacral radiculopathy."
"Finding optimal parameters for detailed neuronal models is a ubiquitous challenge in neuroscientific research. In recent years, manual model tuning has been gradually replaced by automated parameter search using a variety of different tools and methods. However, using most of these software tools and choosing the most appropriate algorithm for a given optimization task require substantial technical expertise, which prevents the majority of researchers from using these methods effectively. To address these issues, we developed a generic platform (called Neuroptimus) that allows users to set up neural parameter optimization tasks via a graphical interface, and to solve these tasks using a wide selection of state-of-the-art parameter search methods implemented by five different Python packages. Neuroptimus also offers several features to support more advanced usage, including the ability to run most algorithms in parallel, which allows it to take advantage of high-performance computing architectures. We used the common interface provided by Neuroptimus to conduct a detailed comparison of more than twenty different algorithms (and implementations) on six distinct benchmarks that represent typical scenarios in neuronal parameter search. We quantified the performance of the algorithms in terms of the best solutions found and in terms of convergence speed. We identified several algorithms, including covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy and particle swarm optimization, that consistently, without any fine-tuning, found good solutions in all of our use cases. By contrast, some other algorithms including all local search methods provided good solutions only for the simplest use cases, and failed completely on more complex problems. We also demonstrate the versatility of Neuroptimus by applying it to an additional use case that involves tuning the parameters of a subcellular model of biochemical pathways. Finally, we created an online database that allows uploading, querying and analyzing the results of optimization runs performed by Neuroptimus, which enables all researchers to update and extend the current benchmarking study. The tools and analysis we provide should aid members of the neuroscience community to apply parameter search methods more effectively in their research."

"Whereas immunotherapies have revolutionized the treatment of different solid and hematologic cancers, their efficacy in nodal peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL) is limited, due to a lack of understanding of the immune response they trigger. To fully characterize the immune tumor microenvironment (TME) of PTCL, we performed spectral flow cytometry analyses on 11 angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphomas (AITL), 7 PTCL, not otherwise specified (PTCL, NOS) lymph node samples, and 10 non-tumoral control samples. The PTCL TME contained a larger proportion of regulatory T cells and exhausted CD8+ T cells, with enriched expression of druggable immune checkpoints. Interestingly, CD39 expression was up-regulated at the surface of most immune cells, and a multi-immunofluorescence analysis on a retrospective cohort of 43 AITL patients demonstrated a significant association between high CD39 expression by T cells and poor patient prognosis. Together, our study unravels the complex TME of nodal PTCL, identifies targetable immune checkpoints, and highlights CD39 as a novel prognostic factor."
"The success of gene therapy hinges on the effective encapsulation, protection, and compression of genes. These processes deliver therapeutic genes into designated cells for genetic repair, cellular behavior modification, or therapeutic effect induction. However, quantifying the encapsulation efficiency of small molecules of interest like DNA or RNA into delivery carriers remains challenging. This work shows how super-resolution microscopy, specifically direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM), can be employed to visualize and measure the quantity of DNA entering a single carrier. Utilizing pNIPAM/bPEI microgels as model nano-carriers to form polyplexes, DNA entry into the carrier is revealed across different charge ratios at temperatures below and above the volume phase transition of the microgel core. The encapsulation efficiency also depends on DNA length and shape. This work demonstrates the uptake of the carrier entity by primary derived macro-phages and showcases the cell viability of the polyplexes. The study shows that dSTORM is a potent tool for fine-tuning and creating polyplex microgel carrier systems with precise size, shape, and loading capacity at the individual particle level. This advancement shall contribute significantly to optimizing gene delivery systems."
"Preclinical mouse models are extensively used in biomedical research to gain insight into disease mechanisms and to test new drug treatments. Glucose and insulin tolerance tests are simple experimental tests frequently used worldwide to assess glucose metabolism in mice. Various guidelines and methodological considerations have been published to help researchers standardize procedures and optimize research outcomes. Yet, there is still important experimental heterogeneity in the way these simple procedures are performed, with no real consensus on what the best practices are to achieve high-quality research and reproducible results. Here we critically examine several published guidelines and recent technical reports on how to perform these metabolic tests in laboratory mice and discuss the influence of various confounding factors on test results. We hope this work will help scientists establish more consensual guidelines for maximizing the relevance and clinical translation of studies using mouse models in metabolic research."
"In metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), improvements in survival from combining leucovorin/fluorouracil/oxaliplatin/irinotecan (FOLFOXIRI) with bevacizumab have come at the risk of increased rates of high-grade toxicities.

"Patient-centered, interprofessional occupational therapy is feasible in complex patients in the early phase of rehabilitation, and it contributes to meet needs in the domains of self-care, productivity, and leisure, promoting social role. We planned this single-center single-blind two-arm parallel individual patient randomized controlled trial, to verify the superiority of interprofessional experimental occupational therapy (EOT) compared to standard rehabilitation (SR) in producing higher levels of patients' social participation assessed by the Reintegration to Normal Living Index. EOT is a patient-centered, hospital/home-based rehabilitation intervention based on the Canadian Model of Occupational Performance and Engagement. This appropriately powered study will provide evidence regarding the effectiveness of EOT on the recovery of social participation in the critical transition of complex patients from hospital to the home setting."

"Guidelines are powerful tools that support evidence-based care in a patient population that is increasingly complex and in systems that are rapidly evolving. When high quality guidelines are implemented well, they can improve patient outcomes, decrease clinician workload and even reduce disparities in care. Guidelines, however, are only as good as the evidence used to create them and are their effectiveness relies on the quality and completeness of their implementation. Guidelines have a lifespan and require redevelopment and reimplementation to achieve their greatest value."
"Antibiotics are fundamental in sepsis management; however, the optimal empirical treatment remains debated. Despite anaerobes rarely being the causative pathogen of sepsis, antibiotics targeting them are frequently used, which might lead to unintended consequences. Multiple studies have shown that depletion of commensal anaerobic gut microbes by anti-anaerobic antibiotics influences systemic immunity and is associated with increased mortality in patients with sepsis. However, this knowledge has not yet been translated into clinical practice. When considering empirical coverage of anaerobic pathogens in sepsis, most physicians advocate for a better-safe-than-sorry approach. In this Viewpoint, we argue that anti-anaerobic antibiotics could often result in being sorry rather than safe. We provide an overview of the limited necessity of anaerobic coverage and the potential detrimental effects of anaerobic depletion in sepsis. We aim to raise anaerobic awareness to reduce the unnecessary use of anti-anaerobic antibiotics in empirical sepsis treatment and improve patient outcomes."

"Along with the progress of society, human life expectancy has been increasing, and late marriage and late childbearing are the current trend. Since reproductive aging affects fertility, ovarian aging in women has become a major reproductive health issue in the current society. During ovarian aging, DNA methylation levels may change. The ten-eleven translocation (TET) protein family proteins TET1, TET2, and TET3 are important DNA demethylation enzymes, and differential expression of TET1, TET2, and TET3 may affect the proliferation and apoptosis of aging ovarian cells. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of TET1 in the regulation of ovarian aging."
"Sarcopenia is an age-related degenerative skeletal muscle disorder characterized by the loss of skeletal muscle mass and function during aging.Sarcopenia can impair the elderly's ability to perform daily activities and is associated with high risks of falls,fractures,and hospitalization.It seriously affects the quality of life of the elderly and becomes one of the major health problems in the aging society.Skeletal muscle stem cells,also known as muscle satellite cells,play a key role in supporting muscle regeneration and homeostasis maintenance.Studies have suggested that muscle satellite cell functions are tightly regulated by microenvironment signals in the skeletal muscle.Of note,skeletal muscle fibers,serving as an immediate niche of muscle satellite cells,regulate their activation,proliferation,and self-renewal.This article reviews the research progress in the regulatory roles of skeletal muscle stem cells and their microenvironment in sarcopenia during aging,providing theoretical support for potential treatment of sarcopenia via modifying skeletal muscle microenvironment and regulating muscle satellite cell functions."
"The study of large protein sets (proteomics) involved in the immunological reaction is known as immunoproteomics. The methodology of immunoproteomics plays a major role in identifying possible vaccine candidates that could protect against pathogenic infection. The study of immunogenic proteins that are expressed during the outset of infection is the focus of the crosstalk between proteomics and immune protection antigens utilizing serum. Peptide presentation by MHC provides the new 'window' into changes that occur in the cell. Thus, there is strong, intense pressure on the pathogen that has been mutated in such an unusual manner that it can bypass the MHC peptide presentation by the MHC molecule. The pathogen's ability to evade the immune system is strongly restricted by the two unique distinct properties of MHC molecules, i.e., polygenic and polymorphic properties. MHC-I restriction epitope identification has traditionally been accomplished using genetic motif prediction. The study of immune system proteins and their interactions is the main emphasis of the specialist field of immunoproteomics within proteomics. Methodologies include mass spectrometry (MS), SRM assay, MALDI-TOF, Chromatography, ELISA, 2DG PAGE, and bioinformatics tools. Challenges are the complexity of the immune system, protein abundance and dynamics, sample variability, post-translational modifications (PTMs), and data integration. Current advancements are enhanced mass spectrometry techniques, single-cell proteomics, artificial intelligence and machine learning, advanced protein labeling techniques, integration with other omics technologies, and functional proteomics. However, the recently emerging field of immunoproteomics has more promising possibilities in the field of peptide-based vaccines and virus-like particle vaccines. The importance of immunoproteomics technologies and methodologies, as well as their use in the field of vaccinomics, are the main topics of this review. Here, we have discussed immunoproteomics in relation to a step towards the future of vaccination."
"In multiple sclerosis (MS), microglia and macrophages within the central nervous system (CNS) play an important role in determining the balance among demyelination, neurodegeneration, and myelin repair. Phagocytic and regenerative functions of these CNS innate immune cells support remyelination, whereas chronic and maladaptive inflammatory activation promotes lesion expansion and disability, particularly in the progressive forms of MS. No currently approved drugs convincingly target microglia and macrophages within the CNS, contributing to the lack of therapies aimed at promoting remyelination and slowing disease progression for individuals with MS. Here, we found that the protein kinase C (PKC)-modulating drug bryostatin-1 (bryo-1), a CNS-penetrant compound with an established human safety profile, shifts the transcriptional programs of microglia and CNS-associated macrophages from a proinflammatory phenotype to a regenerative phenotype in vitro and in vivo. Treatment of microglia with bryo-1 stimulated scavenger pathways, phagocytosis, and secretion of factors that prevented the activation of neuroinflammatory reactive astrocytes while also promoting neuroaxonal health and oligodendrocyte differentiation. In line with these findings, systemic treatment of mice with bryo-1 augmented remyelination after a focal demyelinating injury. Our results demonstrate the potential of bryo-1 and possibly a wider class of PKC modulators as myelin-regenerative and supportive agents in MS and other neurologic diseases."
"Unscheduled R-loops usually cause DNA damage and replication stress, and are therefore a major threat to genome stability. Several RNA processing factors, including the conserved THO complex and its associated RNA and DNA-RNA helicase UAP56, prevent R-loop accumulation in cells. Here, we investigate the function of ALYREF, an RNA export adapter associated with UAP56 and the THO complex, in R-loop regulation. We demonstrate that purified ALYREF promotes UAP56-mediated R-loop dissociation in vitro, and this stimulation is dependent on its interaction with UAP56 and R-loops. Importantly, we show that ALYREF binds DNA-RNA hybrids and R-loops. Consistently, ALYREF depletion causes R-loop accumulation and R-loop-mediated genome instability in cells. We propose that ALYREF, apart from its known role in RNA metabolism and export, is a key cellular R-loop coregulator, which binds R-loops and stimulates UAP56-driven resolution of unscheduled R-loops during transcription."
"This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasonography in assessing the response of clipped axillary lymph nodes to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Between February 2022 and September 2023, 43 patients who underwent axillary lymph node marking for targeted axillary dissection were retrospectively analyzed. Ultrasonography parameters such as the number, size, shape, cortical thickness, hilum status, and treatment response of the clipped lymph node were assessed. Post-surgery pathology results served as the gold standard. Ultrasonography revealed 70% complete and 30% partial response, while pathology results showed 51% complete response, 9% micro-metastases, and 40% macro-metastases. The diagnostic accuracy of ultrasonography was 81.4%, with 61.9% sensitivity and 100% specificity. A significant correlation was found between clipped node response in ultrasound and pathology. Additionally, a notable association was observed between clipped node response on ultrasonography, molecular subtype of the breast mass, and the mass's response to NAC. Assessing the treatment response of clipped lymph nodes with preoperative ultrasound, followed by surgical excision using needle wire localization, can be a viable alternative to axillary dissection, offering low false-negative rates."

"Malignant gliomas constitute the most common type of primary malignant brain tumors. Most previous studies have evaluated the epidemiology of malignant gliomas in developed countries. Hence, there is a lack of evidence in this regard from developing countries. This study is the first epidemiological report on the status of malignant glioma in Iran between 2009 and 2017."
"Individuals are often exposed to information regarding previously witnessed events. The misinformation effect occurs when inaccurate post-event information impairs accuracy on a subsequent test of memory for the original event. The misinformation effect is increased when a test is given prior to exposure to post-event information, a phenomenon termed Retrieval Enhanced Suggestibility (RES). In two experiments, we investigated the value of general warnings prior to retrieval towards reducing RES, in situations where reconsolidation due to test related activation was likely. In both experiments, participants were exposed to an original event, and after a 24-hour retention interval either took a test about that original event or were not tested before being exposed to a narrative that included misleading details about the original event. In Experiment 1, a warning about the quality of the post-event narrative was then given followed by the final test. In Experiment 2, the warning and final test were delayed by 24 h. We found that warnings were effective in Experiment 1 in reducing RES, suggesting that even when initial testing supported learning of PEI, original details remained accessible. However, in Experiment 2, when warnings were delayed, participants were no longer able to effectively use them to reduce RES. These results suggest that warnings are most effective when given in close temporal proximity to misinformation."

"Accurate distinction between stroke etiologic subtypes is critical for physicians to provide tailored treatment. The triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index, a marker of insulin resistance, has been associated with stroke risk but its role in distinguishing stroke etiologic subtypes remains unclear.

"Computerized adaptive testing for cognitive diagnosis (CD-CAT) achieves remarkable estimation efficiency and accuracy by adaptively selecting and then administering items tailored to each examinee. The process of item selection stands as a pivotal component of a CD-CAT algorithm, with various methods having been developed for binary responses. However, multiple-choice (MC) items, an important item type that allows for the extraction of richer diagnostic information from incorrect answers, have been underemphasized. Currently, the Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) index introduced by Yigit et al. (Applied Psychological Measurement, 2019, 43, 388) is the only item selection method exclusively designed for MC items. However, the JSD index requires a large sample to calibrate item parameters, which may be infeasible when there is only a small or no calibration sample. To bridge this gap, the study first proposes a nonparametric item selection method for MC items (MC-NPS) by implementing novel discrimination power that measures an item's ability to effectively distinguish among different attribute profiles. A Q-optimal procedure for MC items is also developed to improve the classification during the initial phase of a CD-CAT algorithm. The effectiveness and efficiency of the two proposed algorithms were confirmed by simulation studies."

This report lays out good practices and practical recommendations for developing or updating HTA guidelines to ensure successful implementation."
"To improve the emulsion gel system of single soybean isolate protein (SPI) and to broaden the application field of hemp protein isolate (HPI), ultrasonic treatment and HPI were introduced to improve the properties of SPI emulsion gel and to explore the mechanism. The results showed that the gel strength (218.6 g) and water-holding capacity (86.24 %) of the emulsion gels were improved under ultrasonic treatments when the ratio of SPI:HPI was >6:4, and the reticulation structure of the gels was enhanced. When the ratio of SPI:HPI was <6:4, the gel structure was loose and formless. Ultrasonic treatment has a significant effect on the emulsion gel with the ratio of SPI:HPI was >6:4. Appropriate ultrasonic treatment (400 W) changed the protein structure, improved the rheological properties of emulsion gels to form the protein-oil-coated network structure. However, excessive ultrasonic treatment (600 W) will destroy the conformation of the protein, reducing the stability of the structure. The effect of ultrasonic treatment on emulsion gels with the ratio of SPI:HPI was <6:4 is low, but improved the gel protein digestibility. This study provides a theoretical basis for the application of ultrasonic in composite protein emulsion gels systems and the development and application of HPI."
"The unsustainable use of wildlife is a primary driver of global biodiversity loss. No comprehensive global dataset exists on what species are in trade, their geographic origins, and trade's ultimate impacts, which limits our ability to sustainably manage trade. The United States is one of the world's largest importers of wildlife, with trade data compiled in the US Law Enforcement Management Information System (LEMIS). The LEMIS provides the most comprehensive publicly accessible wildlife trade database of non-the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) listed species. In total, 21,097 species and over 2.85 billion individuals were traded over the past 22 y (2000-2022). When LEMIS data are combined with CITES records, the United States imported over 29,445 wild species, including over 50% of all globally described species in some taxonomic groups. For most taxa, around half of the individuals are declared as sourced from the wild. Although the LEMIS provides the only means to assess trade volumes for many taxa, without any associated data on most wild populations, it is impossible to assess the impact on biodiversity, sustainability of trade, or any potential risk of pest or pathogen spread. These insights underscore the considerable underestimation of trade and the urgent need for other countries to adopt similar mechanisms to accurately record trade."
"Lebanon continues to experience dramatic changes in its medical demography following the ongoing economic crisis of 2019, including brain drain of physicians across different specialties. This paper assesses the landscape of physicians in Lebanon in 2024 to highlight gaps and propose solutions."

"When humans shift between tasks, they initially show slower responses in the new task than in the previous one. Persisting attentional settings are increasingly recognized as a source for these shifting costs. However, the extent to which specific mechanisms underlying information selection and interference control contribute to this phenomenon remains less clear. Here, we use time-frequency analyses of human electroencephalogram (EEG) data to explore the aftereffects of two such mechanisms: target amplification and distracter inhibition. Participants completed a set-shifting task in which interference during switch trials could either result from the persisting amplification of previous target colors or the persisting inhibition of previous distracter colors. In a first set of analyses, we focused on frontal midline theta (FMT) as a time-continuous marker of overall interference. Compared to a control condition, we found transient peaks of FMT in both experimental conditions that matched the effects of persisting target amplification and distracter inhibition predicted by a computational model of the task. In a second set of analyses we used steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs) as a direct measure of the attentional resources allocated to target and distracter colors. However, SSVEP amplitudes did not differ reliably between stimulation frequencies during switch trials, preventing us from drawing further conclusions on the origins of the interference processes reflected in FMT dynamics. Implications for theories of selective attention and potential limitations of frequency tagging in the context of mental set-shifting research are discussed."
"This study focused on the unexplored bioactive proteins derived from the flower of Clitoria ternatea. The profiling of blue and white C. ternatea flowers was compared. After extraction, the samples underwent ultrafiltration and the isolation of the protein peptides was done by using four different buffers. The highest yield was found in the case of phosphate buffered-based extracts in blue C. ternatea flower. The single HPLC peak at 220 nm with a high area percentage confirmed the presence of peptides in all the 3 kDa filtrates of C. ternatea. These 3 kDa filtrates were concentrated by using a C-18 zip tip method, with alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as a substrate for MALDI-TOF-MS-based peptide mass analysis. To determine the antioxidant activity of the peptides, four different assays including DPPH, ABTS, FRAP and NOS were used and it was observed that the blue C. ternatea flower exhibited the potential activity when compared to the white C. ternatea flower. Among all, the phosphate buffer filtrate exhibited the highest antioxidant activity. The binding affinity of the identified protein peptides APCPNR, LGLFR, LIPQE and SISWSS from blue and white flower were evaluated against amyloid beta (Aβ) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) targets of Alzheimer's disease by in silico analysis."

"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), recognized for their self-renewal and multi-lineage differentiation capabilities, have garnered considerable wide attention since their discovery in bone marrow. Recent studies have underscored the potential of MSCs in immune regulation, particularly in the context of autoimmune diseases, which arise from immune system imbalances and necessitate long-term treatment. Traditional immunosuppressive drugs, while effective, can lead to drug tolerance and adverse effects, including a heightened risk of infections and malignancies. Consequently, adjuvant therapy incorporating MSCs has emerged as a promising new treatment strategy, leveraging their immunomodulatory properties. This paper reviews the immunomodulatory mechanisms of MSCs and their application in autoimmune diseases, highlighting their potential to regulate immune responses and reduce inflammation. The immunomodulatory mechanisms of MSCs are primarily mediated through direct cell contact and paracrine activity with immune cells. This review lays the groundwork for the broader clinical application of MSCs in the future and underscores their significant scientific value and application prospects. Further research is expected to enhance the efficacy and safety of MSCs-based treatments for autoimmune diseases."
"The Trabecular Metal Total Ankle Implant differs from other newer-generation implants in the transfibular approach, multiplanar external frame for alignment, tantalum trabecular metal interfaces, curved geometry, and shallow resection depths.

"Critical illness is a complex condition that can have a devastating impact on health and quality of life. Nutritional support is a crucial component of critical care that aims to maintain or restore nutritional status and muscle function. A one-size-fits-all approach to the components of nutritional support has not proven beneficial. Recent randomized controlled trials challenge the conventional strategy and support the safety and potential benefits of below-usual calorie and protein intakes at the early, acute phase of critical illness. Further research is needed to define optimal nutritional support throughout the intensive care unit stay. Individualized nutritional strategies relying on risk assessment tools or biomarkers deserve further investigation in rigorously designed, large, multicenter, randomized, controlled trials. Importantly, although nutritional support is crucial, it might not be sufficient to enhance the recovery of critically ill patients. Thus, achieving the greatest efficacy may require individualized nutritional support combined with early, prolonged physical rehabilitation within a multimodal, holistic care program throughout the patient's recovery journey."
"The most common functional challenge after Ivor-Lewis esophagectomy is delayed emptying of the gastric conduit. One of the primary endoscopic treatment strategies is performing a pyloric dilatation. However, the effects of dilation have never been scientifically proven. A novel method to detect pyloric distensibility (DI) is the endoluminal functional lumen imaging probe (EndoFlip™). The purpose of this study is to analyze the effects of pyloric dilatation using an EndoFlip™ measurement. Forty-nine patients after Ivor-Lewis esophagectomy were included retrospectively from June 2021 to August 2023 at University Hospital Cologne, Germany. All patients suffered from early delayed emptying of the gastric conduit (DGCE). DI was measured before and after endoscopic dilatation using EndoFlip™ at 40, 45, and 50 mL balloon filling. The Student's t-test and Chi-Squared test were used. All tests were two-sided, with statistical significance set at P ≤ 0.05. EndoFlip™ measurement and pyloric dilatation were feasible in all patients and no adverse events were recorded. DI proved to be smaller in patients before dilatation compared to patients after dilatation. For 40, 45, and 50 mL balloon filling, the mean DI was 5.0 versus 10.0, 4.5 versus 9.1, and 4.0 and 7.5 mm2/mmHg before versus after dilatation. The differences were significant in all balloon fillings. Endoscopic dilatation of the pylorus is the primary endoscopic treatment strategy in patients suffering from DGCE. Currently, the success of dilatation can only be measured with clinical data. This study could demonstrate that EndoFlip™ can be used as an additional diagnostic tool to rate the success of pyloric dilatation."
"Destabilization of heme proteins is recognized to play a role in acute kidney injury (AKI). Hemopexin (Hpx), known for its role in binding heme, mitigates free heme toxicity. Despite this, the potential adverse effects of Hpx deposition in kidney tissues and its impact on kidney function are not fully understood. Deferoxamine (DFO) chelates iron released from heme and mitigates associated kidney damage. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate whether Hpx contributes to kidney injury in an ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) induced AKI model and to investigate if DFO could alleviate this damage. Mice were categorized into five groups: Sham-Vehicle, Sham-Hpx, IRI-Vehicle, IRI-Hpx, and IRI-Hpx-DFO. Decline in kidney function was observed exclusively in the IRI group, independent of Hpx injection. Serum Hpx levels remained comparable across all groups, and administration of Hpx did not alter serum Hpx levels or kidney function after 24 hours. Although increased Hpx deposition in kidneys was noted in both the IRI and Hpx groups, this accumulation did not correlate with impaired kidney function. Additionally, DFO did not exhibit a protective effect against kidney injury. In summary, Hpx does not directly induce kidney injury and cannot be considered a biomarker for kidney damage caused by IRI."
Liver is one of the most preferred destinations for distant metastasis of gastric cancer (GC) and liver metastasis usually predicts poor prognosis. The achievement of liver metastasis requires continued cross-talk of complex members in tumor microenvironment (TME) including tumor associated macrophages (TAMs).
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic and lethal interstitial lung disease (ILD) of unknown origin, characterized by limited treatment efficacy and a fibroproliferative nature. It is marked by excessive extracellular matrix deposition in the pulmonary parenchyma, leading to progressive lung volume decline and impaired gas exchange. The chemokine system, a network of proteins involved in cellular communication with diverse biological functions, plays a crucial role in various respiratory diseases. Chemokine receptors trigger the activation, proliferation, and migration of lung-resident cells, including pneumocytes, endothelial cells, alveolar macrophages, and fibroblasts. Around 50 chemokines can potentially interact with 20 receptors, expressed by both leukocytes and non-leukocytes such as tissue parenchyma cells, contributing to processes such as leukocyte mobilization from the bone marrow, recirculation through lymphoid organs, and tissue influx during inflammation or immune response. This narrative review explores the complexity of the chemokine system in the context of IPF and the bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis mouse model. The goal is to identify specific chemokines and receptors as potential therapeutic targets. Recent progress in understanding the role of the chemokine system during IPF, using experimental models and molecular diagnosis, underscores the complex nature of this system in the context of the disease. Despite advances in experimental models and molecular diagnostics, discovering an effective therapy for IPF remains a significant challenge in both medicine and pharmacology. This work delves into microarray results from lung samples of IPF patients and murine samples at different stages of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. By discussing common pathways identified in both IPF and the experimental model, we aim to shed light on potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Dysregulation caused by abnormal chemokine levels observed in IPF lungs may activate multiple targets, suggesting that chemokine signaling plays a central role in maintaining or perpetuating lung fibrogenesis. The highlighted chemokine axes (CCL8-CCR2, CCL19/CCL21-CCR7, CXCL9-CXCR3, CCL3/CCL4/CCL5-CCR5, and CCL20-CCR6) present promising opportunities for advancing IPF treatment research and uncovering new pharmacological targets within the chemokine system."

"Classical preimplantation embryo culture is performed in static fluid environments. Whether a dynamic fluid environment, like the fallopian tube, is beneficial for embryo development remains to be determined across mammalian species. Objectives of these proof-of-concept studies were to determine if controllable dynamic microfluidic culture would enhance preimplantation murine, bovine, and human embryo development compared to static culture. This prospective randomized controlled trial tested static versus controlled dynamic culture of preimplantation mouse (n = 397), bovine (n = 242), and human (n = 512) zygotes to blastocyst stages with outcome measures of embryo cleavage, cellular fragmentation, apoptosis, and blastocyst conversion rates. Dynamic culture of mouse and bovine zygotes with microfluidics significantly improved embryo development. Mouse placental imprinted gene expression was significantly different between embryos derived in vivo, by static culture, and by dynamic culture. Using human sibling zygotes, this dynamic microfluidic culture system increased the number of blastomeres per cleavage-stage embryo, reduced cellular fragmentation or apoptosis, improved blastocyst conversion rates, and enhanced blastocyst developmental stages. In conclusion, species-specific longitudinal studies demonstrated that dynamic microfluidic culture significantly improved embryo development, independent of culture media composition, temperature, and gaseous environment. These cellular indicators represent improved embryo development that can translate into higher pregnancy rates in transgenics, domestic livestock and endangered species and treating human infertility."
"Lineage tracing has significantly advanced our comprehension in many areas of biology, such as development or immunity, by precisely measuring cellular processes like migration, division, or differentiation across labeled cells and their progeny. Traditional recombinase-based prospective lineage tracing is limited by the need for a priori cell type information and is constrained in the numbers of clones it can simultaneously track. In this sense, clonal lineage tracing with integrated random barcodes offers a robust alternative, enabling researchers to label and track a vast array of cells and their progeny over time. Moreover, clonal lineage tracing can be combined with single-cell omics technologies to study cell states and their maintenance over time. Key steps in these protocols include stable barcode integration, cell division to expand clones, and simultaneous capture of cellular properties with barcode information. Here, we comment on those steps and summarize important parameters to take into account during the design of single-cell lineage tracing experiments. Also, we present the main features for various available lentiviral libraries of expressed barcodes than can be captured alongside the transcriptome of individual cells. We cover other crucial aspects of experimental design, such as the optimization of cellular sampling, library diversity, and the minimization of clonal dropouts. Regarding sequencing data analysis, we provide some tips based on our experience, as well as available computational tools for the assignment of clonal identities and the identification of fate determinants. We finally discuss limitations of current methodologies and use an example step-by-step protocol to illustrate key points during the process. In sum, we provide a roadmap for considering and implementing single-cell lineage tracing studies to comprehensively explore fate determinants and their mechanisms."

"Visuo-attentional dyslexia has been associated with impaired simultaneous visual processing of multiple items made of separable features (i.e. symbols). We designed a visual search screening test, consisting to find the (unique) black circle among circles of various colours versus among circles combined with a bar of various length and location. We evaluated its reliability and its validity to detect visuo-attentional deficit prone to affect reading. RESULTS OF STUDY 1: Assessment of 2015 children between 3 and 11 years old established that the screening test was feasible from kindergarten, and that our index contrasting visual search performance for symbols relative to colours (the Temporal Gap) decreased with age. Satisfactory test-retest reliability of the standardised index (independent from age) was found on a sample of 69 individuals. RESULTS OF STUDY 2: Reading speed and inaccuracy assessed for 769 4th and 5th grades children were significantly correlated to the Temporal Gap. A Temporal Gap above 75th centile predicted reading efficiency deficit above 95th percentile with 63 % sensitivity and 71 % specificity."
"Steady-State Visually Evoked Potential (SSVEP) signals can be decoded by either a traditional machine learning algorithm or a deep learning network. Combining the two methods is expected to enhance the performance of an SSVEP-based brain-computer interface (BCI) by exploiting their advantages. However, an efficient strategy for integrating the two methods has not yet been established. To address this issue, we propose a classification framework named eTRCA + sbCNN that combines an ensemble task-related component analysis (eTRCA) algorithm and a sub-band convolutional neural network (sbCNN) for recognizing the frequency of SSVEP signals. The two models are first trained separately, then their classification score vectors are added together, and finally the frequency corresponding to the maximal summed score is decided as the frequency of SSVEP signals. The proposed framework can effectively exploit the complementarity between the two kinds of feature signals and significantly improve the classification performance of SSVEP-based BCIs. The performance of the proposed method is validated on two SSVEP BCI datasets and compared with that of eTRCA, sbCNN and other state-of-the-art models. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method significantly outperform the compared algorithms, and thus helps to promote the practical application of SSVEP- BCI systems."

This study aimed to generate a map of local recurrences after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiation (total neoadjuvant therapy [TNT]) followed by surgical resection for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Such recurrence patterns will serve to inform radiation treatment planning volumes that should be given in the neoadjuvant setting.
"A correlation between inflammation and cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) has been hypothesized by earlier observational research, while this correlation has not been well established. Considering the significant clinical value of this causality determination, Mendelian randomization (MR) was implemented to investigate the causality between inflammatory cytokines and CSVD radiological lesions."
"Irrigation with contaminated wastewater is a common practice in cultivation of crops and vegetables in many developing countries due to the scarcity of available fresh water. The present study has investigated the transfer and mobilization trends of heavy metals in different crops and vegetables plants grown in contaminated soil and waterbody. The translocation patterns of metals from polluted sources into different organs of plants bodies such as roots and edible parts and associated health risks have been evaluated simultaneously. Total of 180 different environmental samples including food plants, agricultural soil, and irrigation water were collected and analyzed. Heavy metal concentrations (Fe, Ni, Mn, Pb, Cu, Cd, As) in water, soil, and different parts of crops and vegetable plants were compared with the permissible levels reported by FAO/WHO, EU, and USEPA. Different metals contents within the food plants were found to be in the order of Fe > Mn > Ni > Cu > Pb > Cd > As. Pollution load index (PLI) data indicate that soil is highly polluted with Cd as well as moderately contaminated by As and Cu. Bioconcentration factor (BCF) analysis showed excessive accumulation of some heavy metals in crops and vegetables. Target hazard quotient (THQ) and target carcinogenic risk (TCR) analysis data showed higher carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risks for both adult and children from the consumption of metal-contaminated food items. The results of metal pollution index (MPI), estimated daily intake (EDI), and hazard index (HI) analyses demonstrated the patterns of metals pollution in different food plants."
"Recent epidemiological studies have increasingly highlighted the antitumor efficacy of IgE owing to the increased malignancy rate in IgE-deficient patients. The purpose of this study, the largest for children, was to determine whether malignant diagnoses in children are associated with IgE deficiency (IgE <2.5 kIU/L). A total of 6821 pediatric patients were reviewed, focusing on patients with IgE below 2.5 kIU/L (n = 599). The causes of IgE testing were evaluated by categorizing them as having cancer, allergies, suspected or diagnosed immunodeficiency, and other conditions. In all but one patient with malignancy, IgE levels were measured after the diagnosis of the disease. Malignancies were observed much more frequently in the low IgE group than in the normal group (10/599, 1.7% and 7/6222, 0.11%; OR = 15.07; 95% CI: 5.72-39.75; p <.0001). According to our analysis, 70% of the patients had leukemia/lymphoma, which is consistent with studies showing that hematologic malignancies are the most frequent cancers linked to IgE deficiency. No increase in the prevalence of cancer was observed in IgE-deficient patients with suspected or diagnosed immunodeficiency. In conclusion, we observed a higher rate of previous malignancy (particularly hematologic cancer) in children with low serum IgE levels. Larger investigations would offer insightful information about the function of low IgE levels in predicting malignancy risk and improving the present diagnostic procedures."

"Erectile dysfunction (ED) is considered the tip of the iceberg for cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, there is still conflicting evidence regarding their relationship. Recently, a validated tool for the Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD) risk score has provided a key opportunity to delve deeper into the relationship between ED and CVD. Therefore, we intended to assess the relationship between ED and 10-year ASCVD risk score."
"Recombinant antibodies and, more recently, T cell receptor (TCR)-engineered T cell therapies represent two immunological strategies that have come to the forefront of clinical interest for targeting intracellular neoantigens in benign and malignant diseases. T cell-based therapies targeting neoantigens use T cells expressing a recombinant complete TCR (TCR-T cell), a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) with the variable domains of a neoepitope-reactive TCR as a binding domain (TCR-CAR-T cell) or a TCR-like antibody as a binding domain (TCR-like CAR-T cell). Furthermore, the synthetic T cell receptor and antigen receptor (STAR) and heterodimeric TCR-like CAR (T-CAR) are designed as a double-chain TCRαβ-based receptor with variable regions of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains (VH and VL) fused to TCR-Cα and TCR-Cβ, respectively, resulting in TCR signaling. In contrast to the use of recombinant T cells, anti-neopeptide MHC (pMHC) antibodies and intrabodies neutralizing intracellular neoantigens can be more easily applied to cancer patients. However, different limitations should be considered, such as the loss of neoantigens, the modification of antigen peptide presentation, tumor heterogenicity, and the immunosuppressive activity of the tumor environment. The simultaneous application of immune checkpoint blocking antibodies and of CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing tools to engineer different recombinant T cells with enhanced therapeutic functions could make T cell therapies more efficient and could pave the way for its routine clinical application."

This study utilized computer software to simulate the osteotomy procedure, predict orthopedic outcomes, and assist in preoperative planning."
"Graphical models have been widely used to explicitly capture the statistical relationships among the variables of interest in the form of a graph. The central question in these models is to infer significant conditional dependencies or independencies from high-dimensional data. In the current literature, it is common to assume that the high-dimensional data come from a homogeneous source and follow a parametric graphical model. However, in real-world context the observed data often come from different sources and may have heterogeneous dependencies across the whole population. In addition, for time-dependent data, many work has been done to estimate discrete correlation structures at each time point but less work has been done to estimate global correlation structures over all time points. In this work, we propose finite mixtures of functional graphical models (MFGM), which detect the heterogeneous subgroups of the population and estimate single graph for each subgroup by considering the correlation structures. We further design an estimation method for MFGM using an iterative Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm and functional graphical lasso (fglasso). Numerically, we demonstrate the performance of our method in simulation studies and apply our method to high-dimensional electroencephalogram (EEG) dataset taken from an alcoholism study."
"The ability to estimate numerical magnitude is essential for decision-making and is thought to underlie arithmetic skills. In humans, neural populations in the frontoparietal regions are tuned to represent numerosity. However, it remains unclear whether their response properties are fixed to a specific numerosity (i.e., absolute code) or dynamically scaled according to the range of numerosities relevant to the context (i.e., relative code). Here, using functional magnetic resonance imaging combined with multivariate pattern analysis, we uncover evidence that representations of relative numerosity coding emerge gradually as visual information processing advances in the frontoparietal regions. In contrast, the early sensory areas predominantly exhibit absolute coding. These findings indicate a hierarchical organization of relative numerosity representations that adapt their response properties according to the context. Our results highlight the existence of a context-dependent optimization mechanism in numerosity representation, enabling the efficient processing of infinite magnitude information with finite neural resources."
"Bone readiness for implant placement is typically evaluated by bone quality/density on 2-dimensional radiographs and cone beam computed tomography at an arbitrary time between 3 and 6 months after tooth extraction and alveolar ridge preservation (ARP). The aim of this study is to investigate if high-frequency ultrasound (US) can classify bone readiness in humans, using micro-CT as a reference standard to obtain bone mineral density (BMD) and bone volume fraction (BVTV) of healed sockets receiving ARP in humans."
"To better understand environmental attributes associated with cycling, it is necessary to identify an area within which such attributes are measured. Various sizes of a ""buffer"" drawn from home have been used for this purpose. The distances adults cycle to/from their homes may inform the determination of empirically supported buffer sizes. We examined the distribution of cycling distances using Australian travel survey data collected between 2012 and 2020. We used a Random Forest model to identify the relative importance of factors influencing participant's cycling distance and then reported variations in cycling distances by the most important factors. Of the 73,142 survey participants who were aged between 20 and 74 and reported at least one trip on the survey day, 1676 (67% men) reported 3446 home-based cycling trips, with a median distance of 3.5 km. The most important factor was trip purpose, followed by gender. The median distances were 1.8 km for utilitarian, 5.3 km for commuting and 3.7 km for recreational cycling trips. Men cycled longer distances than women, particularly for commuting and recreational cycling. The significant variation in cycling distance by trip purpose implies the need for having purpose-specific spatial scales in identifying environmental attributes associated with cycling more accurately."
The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential use of simulated radiation doses from a dual-split CT scan for dose optimization by comparing their lesion detectability to dose-matched single-energy CT acquisitions at different radiation dose levels using a mathematical model observer.

"Mounting evidence indicates that individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) face a heightened risk of severe outcomes upon contracting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Current medications for COVID-19 often carry side effects, necessitating alternative therapies with improved tolerance.

"Sine oculis homeobox homolog 1 (SIX1) is a new identified cancer driver in the development of prostate cancer (PC). However, the upstream regulatory mechanisms for SIX1 reactivation in cancer remains elusive. Here, we found that Ku70 robustly interacts with SIX1 in the nucleus of PC cells. The HD domain of SIX1 and the DBD domain of Ku70 are required for formation of Ku70-SIX1 complex. 20 groups of hydrogen bonds were identified in this complex by molecular dynamics simulation. Depletion of Ku70/SIX1 notably abrogates the proliferation and migration of PC. Further studies revealed that SIX1 is recruited to the promoter region on glutamate-pyruvate transaminase 2 (GPT2). Ku70 enhances the SIX1-mediated transcriptional activation on GPT2, thereby facilitating the generation of alpha-ketoglutarate (α-KG). In addition, formation of the Ku70-SIX1 complex promotes GPT2-dependent cell proliferation and migration in PC. Moreover, the expression of GPT2 is upregulated and strongly correlated with the expression of Ku70/SIX1 in PC tissues. In summary, our findings not only provide insight into the mechanistic interactions between Ku70 and SIX1, but also highlight the significance of the Ku70-SIX1-GPT2 axis for α-KG metabolism and PC carcinogenesis."
"Pathogenic variants in the RYR1 gene have been associated with a variety of conditions, ranging from congenital myopathy to adult manifestations.

"Wearable accelerometers are widely used as an ecologically valid and scalable solution for long-term at-home sleep monitoring in both clinical research and care. In this study, we applied a deep learning domain adversarial convolutional neural network (DACNN) model to this task and demonstrated that this new model outperformed existing sleep algorithms in classifying sleep-wake and estimating sleep outcomes based on wrist-worn accelerometry. This model generalized well to another dataset based on different wearable devices and activity counts, achieving an accuracy of 80.1% (sensitivity 84% and specificity 58%). Compared to commonly used sleep algorithms, this model resulted in the smallest error in wake after sleep onset (MAE of 48.7, Cole-Kripke of 86.2, Sadeh of 108.2, z-angle of 57.5) and sleep efficiency (MAE of 11.8, Cole-Kripke of 18.4, Sadeh of 23.3, z-angle of 9.3) outcomes. Despite being around for many years, accelerometer-alone devices continue to be useful due to their low cost, long battery life, and ease of use. Improving the accuracy and generalizability of sleep algorithms for accelerometer wrist devices is of utmost importance. We here demonstrated that domain adversarial convolutional neural networks can improve the overall accuracy, especially the specificity, of sleep-wake classification using wrist-worn accelerometer data, substantiating its use as a scalable and valid approach for sleep outcome assessment in real life."

"Immediate breast reconstruction (IBR) in locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) (stage 3A and above) is widely debated, both in terms of delay of adjuvant therapy and oncological safety. This study aims to systematically review and evaluate the long-term oncological safety of IBR in patients with LABC undergoing mastectomy."
"Long-term exposure to lead is associated with an increased risk of diabetic kidney disease (DKD). However, limited data exist on global trends in DKD burden attributable to lead exposure, especially across diverse regions categorized by socioeconomic level. We aimed to assess the spatiotemporal changes in DKD burden attributable to lead exposure from 1990 to 2019 across 204 countries and regions with varying socio-demographic index (SDI) metrics. This retrospective analysis utilized data from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 (GBD2019) database. We estimated the burden of DKD attributable to lead exposure using the age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) and age-standardized disability-adjusted life year rate (ASDR), accounting for sex, age, nationality, and SDI. The annual percentage change (APC) and average annual percentage change (AAPC) were calculated using the Joinpoint model to evaluate trends in the ASMR and ASDR attributable to lead exposure from 1990 to 2019. Gaussian process regression was used to model the relationship between the SDI and ASMR/ASDR. Globally, the burden of DKD attributable to lead exposure has significantly increased since 1990, especially among elderly men and in regions such as Asia, Central Latin America, North Africa, the Middle East, and low-SDI regions. In 2019, the ASMR and ASDR of DKD attributable to lead exposure were 0.68 (95% CI: 0.40, 0.98) per 100,000 people and 15.02 (95% CI: 8.68, 22.26) per 100,000 people, respectively. From 1990 to 2019, the global ASMR and ASDR attributable to lead-associated DKD changed by 15.45% and -1.78%, respectively. The global AAPCs of the ASMR and ASDR were 0.55 (95% CI: 0.45, 0.65) and -0.01 (95% CI: -0.12, 0.1), respectively. Significant declining trends were observed in the high-income Asia Pacific region, eastern sub-Saharan Africa, North Africa, the Middle East, and other regions with high SDIs. Over this 30-year study period, the global burden of DKD attributable to lead exposure has increased, particularly in regions with low SDI. Lead exposure remains a significant concern in the global burden of diabetic kidney disease."
"Wilson's disease (WD) is a hereditary condition marked by abnormalities in copper metabolism, which precipitate a spectrum of neurological symptoms and cognitive impairments. Emerging research has highlighted ferroptosis (FPT) as a distinct type of programmed cell death, potentially linked to various cognitive dysfunctions. Nevertheless, the connection between FPT and cognitive impairment in Wilson's disease (WDCI) remains largely enigmatic. In our study, we utilized a multifaceted approach, combining reverse network pharmacology, data mining, and molecular docking techniques to explore the potential for treating WDCI via FPT-related pathways. This thorough analysis revealed a series of proteins, including P38[Formula: see text], GSK3[Formula: see text], P53, GPX4, and PTGS2, as pivotal targets for WDCI treatment. Notably, Diosgenin (DG) has been identified as a prospective core component in this therapeutic framework. In the WD copper-loaded rat model, evaluations using the Morris water maze (MWM), Y maze, hematoxylin and eosin staining, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and immunofluorescence (IF) detection showed that DG significantly enhanced cognitive function recovery, reduced structural damage to hippocampal neurons, and protected mitochondrial integrity. In addition, Western blot (WB) and quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis showed that DG significantly upregulated the expression levels of proteins and mRNA such as P38[Formula: see text], GSK3[Formula: see text], P53, GPX4, and PTGS2 in animal and cell models. Furthermore, DG effectively reversed the dysregulated expression of oxidative stress markers, including [Formula: see text], malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and reactive oxygen species (ROS). This study elucidates the neuroprotective effect of DG on hippocampal neurons by activating the P38[Formula: see text]-mediated FPT pathway, highlighting its efficacy as a potent monomer in traditional Chinese medicine and illuminating its potential role in the clinical treatment of WDCI."
"Chlorophyll metabolism has evolved during plant evolution. The strictly light-dependent nature of chlorophyll biosynthesis found in angiosperms requires tight coordination of chlorophyll biosynthesis and breakdown to achieve chlorophyll homeostasis. However, the specific control mechanisms remain largely unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the scaffold protein BALANCE OF CHLOROPHYLL METABOLISM1 (BCM1) has co-evolved with the carboxy-terminal domains of specific enzymes involved in chlorophyll biosynthesis and breakdown, including GENOMES UNCOUPLED 4 (GUN4) and Mg-dechelatase 1 (SGR1). We found that the land plant-specific interaction of BCM1 with the carboxy-terminal domains of GUN4 and SGR1 is indispensable for concurrent stimulation of chlorophyll biosynthesis and suppression of chlorophyll breakdown. The land plant-specific carboxy-terminal domain is essential for the membrane docking and turnover of GUN4, whereas it is key for proteolysis of SGR1. More importantly, we identified the metallopeptidase Gravitropism-deficient and Yellow-green 1 (EGY1) as the proteolytic machinery responsible for BCM1-mediated proteolysis of SGR1. In summary, this study reveals the BCM1-EGY1 module has evolved to maintain chlorophyll homeostasis by the post-translational control of the balance between chlorophyll biosynthesis and breakdown. This mechanism thus represents an evolutionary response to the metabolic demands imposed on plants in terrestrial environments."
"Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) that arises following total knee arthroplasty (TKA) can usually be resolved through surgical and antimicrobial therapy. However, in approximately 5% of cases, an infection that is chronic and persistent will require treatment by above-knee amputation (AKA). This study seeks to provide an enhanced understanding of patient functionality and satisfaction following this devastating complication of one of the most commonly performed surgeries in the world."
"Solitary fibrous tumours (SFTs) are rare soft tissue masses that are often clinically silent until they cause mass effect. A paraneoplastic syndrome manifesting as persistent hypoglycaemia, termed Doege-Potter syndrome (DPS), can be associated with these lesions. Surgical treatment is recommended for the management of these tumours.A case of a man in his 60s who was admitted for altered mental status and hypoglycaemia is herein described. Physical examination revealed a distended, asymmetric abdomen with a firm palpable mass in the left upper quadrant. Imaging demonstrated a 24 cm abdominal mass, confirmed to be an SFT on pathology. Biochemical evaluation was consistent with DPS. Surgical excision was performed; however, its large size and retroperitoneal location complicated intraoperative visualisation, ultimately requiring aortic reconstruction, multiple extremity fasciotomy, nephrectomy and prolonged intensive care unit stay.Few publications describe DPS. While tumour excision can be curative, this case report describes challenges that may arise with surgical management."
"Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(H)) and its metabolites function as crucial regulators of physiological processes, allowing cells to adapt to environmental changes such as nutritional deficiencies, genotoxic factors, disruptions in circadian rhythms, infections, inflammation, and exogenous substances. Here, we investigated whether elevated NAD(H) levels in oocytes enhance their quality and improve developmental competence following in vitro fertilization (IVF). Bovine cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were matured in a culture medium supplemented with 0-100 μM nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), a precursor of NAD(H). The addition of NMN caused an increase in intracellular NAD(H) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate levels, leading to enhanced competence for development to the blastocyst stage after IVF. The increase in intracellular NAD(H) levels led to changes in the expression of mitochondria function-related genes. As a result, NMN supplementation increased the ratio of MitoTracker Orange fluorescence to nonyl acridine orange fluorescence, as well as adenosine triphosphate levels, while decreasing reactive oxygen species levels in the oocytes. NMN also lowered chromosome lagging during anaphase. These results suggest that increased NAD(H) levels in oocytes following NMN treatment enhances post-fertilization developmental competence through improved mitochondrial function."
"In addition to supporting patients and their loved ones at critical times, chaplains have long understood that caring for their health care colleagues is an important part of their practice. The Covid-19 pandemic prompted conversations among chaplains about how best to address the stress they were observing in health care workers. Our team conducted a scoping review in PubMed and CINAHL of peer reviewed literature describing chaplaincy care for health care workers. We started with 364 unique articles and found 59 that met criteria for the review. Five themes surfaced in analysis of these articles, with two themes emerging as most important: (1) descriptions of care for staff as part of the chaplain's role, especially when staff are making difficult decisions and (2) reports of the effects of chaplain care for staff, both indirect and direct. We discovered that research was limited, and more research is needed regarding chaplain care for health care colleagues."
"Cord compression by the ligamentum flavum (CCLF) has been reported to adversely affect the clinical outcomes of anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF). While indirect decompression does occur for foraminal stenosis with ACDF, whether ACDF could improve CCLF with the distraction of disc space remains unclear. This study aimed to identify 1) whether indirect decompression occurs for CCLF with ACDF, and 2) risk factors that hinder the improvement of CCLF."
"More than a decade following the discovery of Calreticulin (CALR) mutations as drivers of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), advances in the understanding of CALR-mutant MPN continue to emerge. Here, we summarize recent advances in mehanistic understanding and in targeted therapies for CALR-mutant MPN."
"A decline in mitochondrial functions associated with ageing is the key factor of free radical generation which contributes to age-related pathologies. Protecting healthy functional mitochondrial networks with antioxidants is critical in promoting healthy ageing. This study aimed to investigate the protective effect of ergothioneine (EGT)-rich Lentinula edodes extract (LE-ETH) against tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP) assaulted senescent HT22 cells. Mitochondrial function was evaluated by measuring mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), ATP levels and mitochondrial toxicity. The protective mechanisms were elucidated via the exploration of antioxidant and mitochondrial biogenesis signalling pathways. Our results revealed that a low dose of t-BHP increases mitochondrial toxicity. The pretreatment with 100 µg/mL of LE-ETH and the equimolar concentration of EGT for 8 h significantly improve the mitochondrial function and reduced inflammation. Through gene expression studies, we demonstrated that pretreatment of LE-ETH significantly improves the antioxidant and mitochondrial biogenesis pathway via Nrf2 signaling axis. However, the downstream genes of the mitochondrial biogenesis pathway were unaffected by equimolar EGT concentration. Gas chromatography-mass spectrum (GC-MS) analysis was carried out to identify the bioactive compounds that are present in LE-ETH extract which contributed to its efficacy in improving the mitochondrial functions. A total of 23 compounds consisting of phenols, fatty acids, and sterols were identified in the ethanolic extract. Pentanoic acid was the major compound identified in LE-ETH. These findings demonstrated that EGT-rich L.edodes mushroom is a potential neuroprotective agent which could serve as a potential therapeutic strategy for the preservation of mitochondrial functions in healthy ageing explorations."
"The rapid development of spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies has enabled transcriptome-wide profiling of gene expression in tissue sections. Despite the emergence of single-cell resolution platforms, most ST sequencing studies still operate at a multicell resolution. Consequently, deconvolution of cell identities within the spatial spots has become imperative for characterizing cell-type-specific spatial organization. To this end, we developed Spatial Deconvolution Explorer (SpatialDeX), a regression model-based method for estimating cell-type proportions in tumor ST spots. SpatialDeX exhibited comparable performance to reference-based methods and outperformed other reference-free methods with simulated ST data. Using experimental ST data, SpatialDeX demonstrated superior performance compared with both reference-based and reference-free approaches. Additionally, a pan-cancer clustering analysis on tumor spots identified by SpatialDeX unveiled distinct tumor progression mechanisms both within and across diverse cancer types. Overall, SpatialDeX is a valuable tool for unraveling the spatial cellular organization of tissues from ST data without requiring single-cell RNA-seq references. Significance: The development of a reference-free method for deconvolving the identity of cells in spatial transcriptomics datasets enables exploration of tumor architecture to gain deeper insights into the dynamics of the tumor microenvironment."
"The convergence of nanotechnology with bioinformatics and the study of plant secondary metabolites hold remarkable potential for transformative scientific breakthroughs. Synergy enables a deeper understanding of the biosynthesis and functions of plant secondary metabolites, unlocking avenues to engineer novel applications in areas like pharmaceuticals, agriculture, and sustainable materials. The present study was conducted to check the effect of plant-mediated selenium nanoparticles to improve the bioactive compounds in sesame. Three varieties of sesame (TS-5, TH-6, and Till-18) were sown and got treated with different concentration of selenium nanoparticles. On the basis of antioxidant, biochemical, and physiological parameters, best performing seed samples from crop were selected and subjected to UHPLC analysis. From all 276 identified metabolites, the top 20 differentially expressed bioactive, medicinally important compounds were subjected to Swiss target prediction, KEGG, and Metascape analysis to reveal drug targets, gene targets, cell targets, and disease targets. Swiss target prediction revealed that most of the drug targets had kinases as the highest target in all the bioactive metabolites, followed by nuclear transporters, cytochrome P450, and proteins associated with electrochemical channels. Metascape analysis revealed that most of the compounds had highest enrichment in non-canonical activation of NOTCH3 followed by regulation of hormone levels. Furthermore, DisGeNET analysis revealed that most of the metabolites had strong association with impaired glucose tolerance followed by myocardial ischemia and neuralgia. Tissue and cell accumulation analysis by PaGeneBase revealed the highest accumulation in the small intestine, colon, ovary, and DRG cells. The study concluded that selenium nanoparticles has an ability to improve certain medicinally important metabolites in sesame, coupled with bioinformatics tools which revealed a great insight into the potential of those compounds, and the information can further be used in future studies."
"Colonialism has left biological and social legacies that damage health. The resulting racialized health inequities re-enact past harms and are a profound social injustice. In response, this article brings together reparatory justice and health equity. Understandings of reparatory justice have evolved from a focus on compensation for past wrongs to the need for a more sustained and expansive politics of repair. This seeks to recognize the history and legacies of harm while diminishing the likelihood that such harms are repeated. Addressing racialized health inequities in the UK, and working with this articulation of reparatory justice, this article argues for the repair of bodies that continue to be damaged by historically rooted harms. Social determinants of health research has long linked socio-economic inequalities to poor health outcomes, and promoting health equity by addressing these inequalities can be an important element of the work to repair the past. This response acknowledges the moral case for both reparatory justice and health equity, while potentially addressing problems faced by traditionally articulated reparatory claims. Finally, exploring law's role in addressing racialized health inequities can help us better understand how law is a determinant of health and its role in advancing health equity."
"In this article, we propose a new term, ""intergenerationology."" Intergenerationology is proposed as a unified term to describe the numerous research and practice models concerning many aspects of circular movement between generations. We define the term intergenerational, with historical context related to research, practice, and policy in the social, behavioral, and health sciences. We also describe how different disciplines have interacted with regard to generations from different yet complementary points of view. Having the term intergenerationology will (a) enable the acceleration and unification of intergenerational studies and practice across disciplines by promoting easy communication among disciplines, (b) encourage more research from diverse science disciplines by giving a name to a popular area of study within them, and (c) provide a recognized term for researchers and practitioners to define their specific teaching, practice, and research interests."
"Growing evidence suggests that serotonin is an important mediator in the cross-talk between immune and bone cells, playing a role in the pathogenesis of various types of inflammatory arthritis (IA). However, the relationship between circulating serotonin and different outcomes in three most prevalent IA - rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), remains limited and requires further investigation. This study was performed to evaluate variations in serotonin serum levels among RA, PsA, and axSpA and to explore the utility of this biochemical marker in the assessment of disease activity and health status measurements provided by the Multi-Dimensional Health Assessment Questionnaire (MDHAQ). This was a cross-sectional study using data from the PolNorRHEUMA registry. Demographic and clinical data, as well as blood samples, were collected during routine visits to the rheumatology outpatient clinic. We included 60 patients (20 with RA, 20 with PsA, and 20 with axSpA) and 45 healthy controls, with a mean age of 49 years and 56.2% female. A reliable liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS) method was used for the quantitative determination of serotonin in blood serum. Analysis of serotonin levels, based on 105 observations and adjusted for age, SSRI/SNRI intake and physical activity, revealed a significant elevation in the patient groups compared with the controls (p < 0.001): 134.00 ng/mL in healthy controls vs. 176.00 ng/mL in RA, 183 ng/mL in PsA, and 184.00 ng/mL in axSpA, with no statistically significant differences between the respective forms of IA. We found no significant correlation between the serotonin concentration and disease activity composite scores. A sample of 51 patients revealed a significant positive correlation between the serotonin concentration and global MDHAQ scores (β = 0.01, p = 0.009), indicating that an increase in serotonin levels is associated with worsening patient-reported health status. The serotonin serum concentration was higher in patients with RA, PsA, and axSpA than in controls, indicating its potential as a biomarker of inflammation and worse health status. The LC-MS method was successfully applied for the analysis of serum."
Transcatheter valve-in-valve (VIV) or valve-in-ring (VIR) therapies for degenerated mitral bioprosthetic valves and rings are still evolving. We aimed to characterize short- and long-term outcomes of these procedures.

"Implicit, unconscious biases in medicine are personal attitudes about race, ethnicity, gender, and other characteristics that may lead to discriminatory patterns of care. However, there is no consensus on whether implicit bias represents a true predictor of differential care given an absence of real-world studies. We conducted the first real-world pilot study of provider implicit bias by evaluating treatment parity in prostate cancer using unstructured data-the most common way providers document granular details of the patient encounter."

"Osteoarthritis (OA) is among the most prevalent degenerative joint disorders worldwide, particularly affecting the aging population and imposing significant disability and economic burdens. The disease is characterized by progressive degradation of articular cartilage and chronic inflammation, with no effective long-term treatments currently available to address the underlying causes of its progression. Conventional therapies primarily manage symptoms such as pain and inflammation but fail to repair damaged tissues. Emerging biotherapies and regenerative medicine approaches offer promising alternatives by addressing cartilage repair and inflammation control at the molecular level. This review explores the recent advancements in biotherapeutic strategies, including mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy, growth factors, and tissue engineering, which hold the potential for promoting cartilage regeneration and modulating the inflammatory microenvironment. Additionally, the integration of nanotechnology has opened new avenues for targeted drug delivery systems and the development of innovative nanomaterials that can further enhance the efficacy of biotherapies by precisely targeting inflammation and cartilage damage. This article concludes by discussing the current clinical applications, the ongoing clinical trials, and the future research directions necessary to confirm the safety and efficacy of these advanced therapies for OA management. With these advancements, biotherapies combined with nanotechnology may revolutionize the future of OA treatment by offering precise and effective solutions for long-term disease management and improved patient outcomes."

"The quality and safety of tea food production is of paramount importance. In traditional processing techniques, there is a risk of small foreign objects being mixed into Pu-erh sun-dried green tea, which directly affects the quality and safety of the food. To rapidly detect and accurately identify these small foreign objects in Pu-erh sun-dried green tea, this study proposes an improved YOLOv8 network model for foreign object detection. The method employs an MPDIoU optimized loss function to enhance target detection performance, thereby increasing the model's precision in targeting. It incorporates the EfficientDet high-efficiency target detection network architecture module, which utilizes compound scale-centered anchor boxes and an adaptive feature pyramid to achieve efficient detection of targets of various sizes. The BiFormer bidirectional attention mechanism is introduced, allowing the model to consider both forward and backward dependencies in sequence data, significantly enhancing the model's understanding of the context of targets in images. The model is further integrated with sliced auxiliary super-inference technology and YOLOv8, which subdivides the image and conducts in-depth analysis of local features, significantly improving the model's recognition accuracy and robustness for small targets and multi-scale objects. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to the original YOLOv8 model, the improved model has seen increases of 4.50% in Precision, 5.30% in Recall, 3.63% in mAP, and 4.9% in F1 score. When compared with the YOLOv7, YOLOv5, Faster-RCNN, and SSD network models, its accuracy has improved by 3.92%, 7.26%, 14.03%, and 11.30%, respectively. This research provides new technological means for the intelligent transformation of automated color sorters, foreign object detection equipment, and intelligent sorting systems in the high-quality production of Yunnan Pu-erh sun-dried green tea. It also provides strong technical support for the automation and intelligent development of the tea industry."

"The impact of wearing a face mask for an extended duration is unknown. This study aimed to determine if wearing a face mask for 10 h impacts blood pressure (BP) and arterial stiffness. Subjects received an ambulatory blood pressure cuff and were asked to wear it for 10 h while readings were taken every 15 min. During the face mask trial, subjects wore an N95 mask for 10 h. During the control, subjects did not wear a mask. Subjects were randomized to start their trial. An accelerometer was given to ensure no physical activity differences. Linear mixed models were used to determine group differences, and McNemar test was used to assess frequency differences when determining BP load. Twelve college-aged (20.5 ± 1.5 years) male ( n  = 5) and female ( n  = 7) individuals with normal BP participated in this study. There were no differences in time spent in any physical activity domain (all P  > 0.05). There was no difference in brachial SBP ( P  = 0.688), brachial DBP ( P  = 0.063), central SBP ( P  = 0.875), central DBP ( P  = 0.246), heart rate ( P  = 0.125), and augmentation pressure ( P  = 0.158) between conditions. During mask condition, augmentation pressure was reduced by 5.2 ± 3.1% compared to control ( P  < 0.001). There were no frequency differences in the number of BP readings above 140 mmHg for SBP ( P  = 0.479) and >90 mmHg for DBP ( P  = 0.212). The current study found that wearing an N95 mask for 10 h did not affect brachial or central BP but significantly decreased augmentation pressure."
"Evidence suggests that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a significant role in autism. Herein, we explored the functional role and possible molecular mechanisms of NEAT1 in valproic acid (VPA)-induced autism spectrum disorder (ASD). A VPA-induced ASD rat model was constructed, and a series of behavioral tests were performed to examine motor coordination and learning-memory abilities. qRT-PCR and western blot assays were used to evaluate target gene expression levels. Loss-and-gain-of-function assays were conducted to explore the functional role of NEAT1 in ASD development. Furthermore, a combination of mechanistic experiments and bioinformatic tools was used to assess the relationship and regulatory role of the NEAT1-YY1-UBE3A axis in ASD cellular processes. Results showed that VPA exposure induced autism-like developmental delays and behavioral abnormalities in the VPA-induced ASD rat model. We found that NEAT1 was elevated in rat hippocampal tissues after VPA exposure. NEAT1 promoted VPA-induced autism-like behaviors and mitigated apoptosis, oxidative stress, and inflammation in VPA-induced ASD rats. Notably, NEAT1 knockdown improved autism-related behaviors and ameliorated hippocampal neuronal damage. Mechanistically, it was observed that NEAT1 recruited the transcription factor YY1 to regulate UBE3A expression. Additionally, in vitro experiments further confirmed that NEAT1 knockdown mitigated hippocampal neuronal damage, oxidative stress, and inflammation through the YY1/UBE3A axis. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that NEAT1 is highly expressed in ASD, and its inhibition prominently suppresses hippocampal neuronal injury and oxidative stress through the YY1/UBE3A axis, thereby alleviating ASD development. This provides a new direction for ASD-targeted therapy."
"In 2023, 35,000 new cases of breast cancer were diagnosed, becoming the first type of tumour diagnosed in Spain. This tumour and its treatments generate important changes in the patient's quality of life. Alterations in the range of motion, pain and both physical and psychological disability are some of the effects that breast cancer generates in patients. Physical prehabilitation could be an opportunity to prevent some of these adverse effects."
"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the abnormal proliferation of immature myeloid blast cells in the bone marrow. Currently, there are no universally recognized biomarkers for the early diagnosis, prognosis and effective treatment of AML to improve the overall survival of patients. Recent studies, however, have demonstrated that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are promising targets for the early diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of AML. A critical review of available data would be important to identify study gaps and provide perspectives. In this review, we explored comprehensive information on the potential use of lncRNAs as targets for the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of AML. LncRNAs are nonprotein-coding RNAs that are approximately 200 nucleotides long and play important roles in the regulation, metabolism and differentiation of tissues. In addition, they play important roles in the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of different cancers, including AML. LncRNAs play multifaceted roles as oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes. Recently, deregulated lncRNAs were identified as novel players in the development of AML, making them promising prognostic indicators. Given that lncRNAs could have potential diagnostic marker roles, the lack of sufficient evidence identifying specific lncRNAs expressed in specific cancers hampers the use of lncRNAs as diagnostic markers of AML. The complex roles of lncRNAs in the pathophysiology of AML require further scrutiny to identify specific lncRNAs. This review, despite the lack of sufficient literature, discusses the therapeutic, diagnostic and prognostic roles of lncRNAs in AML and provides future insights that will contribute to studies targeting lncRNAs in the diagnosis, treatment, and management of AML."
"The evolutionary relationships between species are typically represented in the biological literature by rooted phylogenetic trees. However, a tree fails to capture ancestral reticulate processes, such as the formation of hybrid species or lateral gene transfer events between lineages, and so the history of life is more accurately described by a rooted phylogenetic network. Nevertheless, phylogenetic networks may be complex and difficult to interpret, so biologists sometimes prefer a tree that summarises the central tree-like trend of evolution. In this paper, we formally investigate methods for transforming an arbitrary phylogenetic network into a tree (on the same set of leaves) and ask which ones (if any) satisfy a simple consistency condition. This consistency condition states that if we add additional species into a phylogenetic network (without otherwise changing this original network) then transforming this enlarged network into a rooted phylogenetic tree induces the same tree on the original set of species as transforming the original network. We show that the LSA (lowest stable ancestor) tree method satisfies this consistency property, whereas several other commonly used methods (and a new one we introduce) do not. We also briefly consider transformations that convert arbitrary phylogenetic networks to another simpler class, namely normal networks."
"Radioactive iodine (RAI) is commonly used in the management of differentiated thyroid cancers (DTCs). However, the long-term efficacy and the risk of tumor recurrence associated with it remain unclear. In particular, the comparison between recombinant human thyrotropin (rhTSH) and thyroid hormone withdrawal (THW) in terms of medium- and long-term recurrence rate in DTC patients has not been fully elucidated."
"A central tenet of cognitive neuroscience is that humans build an internal model of the external world and use mental simulation of the model to perform physical inferences. Decades of human experiments have shown that behaviors in many physical reasoning tasks are consistent with predictions from the mental simulation theory. However, evidence for the defining feature of mental simulation - that neural population dynamics reflect simulations of physical states in the environment - is limited. We test the mental simulation hypothesis by combining a naturalistic ball-interception task, large-scale electrophysiology in non-human primates, and recurrent neural network modeling. We find that neurons in the monkeys' dorsomedial frontal cortex (DMFC) represent task-relevant information about the ball position in a multiplexed fashion. At a population level, the activity pattern in DMFC comprises a low-dimensional neural embedding that tracks the ball both when it is visible and invisible, serving as a neural substrate for mental simulation. A systematic comparison of different classes of task-optimized RNN models with the DMFC data provides further evidence supporting the mental simulation hypothesis. Our findings provide evidence that neural dynamics in the frontal cortex are consistent with internal simulation of external states in the environment."
"Medical hyperbaric sessions for Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy, conducted at 2.4-2.5 ATA for 80 to 120 minutes, expose staff to increased risk of DCS due to the inhalation of compressed air, which increases gas solubility in body fluids as per Henry's Law. This study evaluates the incidence and risk factors of decompression sickness (DCS) among medical personnel in a hyperbaric centre over a 25-year period. Decompression sickness, characterized by gas bubble formation in tissues during planned decompression, was documented in 6 cases among 41,507 sessions. Symptoms varied from mild cutaneous to severe neurological manifestations, dependent on bubble size and location. Risk factors identified include age, physical condition, dehydration, and BMI. Preventative measures included adherence to decompression protocols, hydration, oxygen pre-breathing, and physical fitness maintenance. Despite these precautions, the occurrence of DCS underscores the inherent occupational risk faced by hyperbaric medical staff. The study advocates for stringent safety protocols and continuous monitoring to mitigate this risk."
"Cork University Hospital, Ireland's largest teaching hospital, faced challenges in maintaining consistent handover processes in its Acute Mental Health Unit (AMHU).

"Neurogastroenterology and motility disorders are complex gastrointestinal conditions that are prevalent worldwide, particularly affecting women and younger individuals. These conditions significantly impact the quality of life of people suffering from them. There is increasing evidence linking these disorders to cirrhosis, with a higher prevalence compared to the general population. However, the link between neurogastroenterology and motility disorders and cirrhosis remains unclear due to undefined mechanisms. In addition, managing these conditions in cirrhosis is often limited by the adverse effects of drugs commonly used for these disorders, presenting a significant clinical challenge in the routine management of patients with cirrhosis. This review delves into this connection, exploring potential pathophysiological links and clinical interventions between neurogastroenterology disorders and cirrhosis."
"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a global medical concern and has a lasting impact on brain activity with high risks of mortality. Current treatments are inadequate for repairing damaged brain cells or correcting cognitive and behavioral disabilities in TBI patients. Mounting evidence links TBI to the activation of the Integrated Stress Response (ISR) signaling in the brain. A novel small molecule, ISRIB, is an effective inhibitor of the ISR pathway, offering potential advantages for brain health. Here, we investigated how ISRIB affects brain transcriptome and behavior in zebrafish TBI model evoked by telencephalic brain injury. Overall, while TBI diminished memory and social behavior in zebrafish, administering ISRIB post-injury markedly reduced these behavioral deficits, and modulated brain gene expression, rescuing TBI-activated pathways related to inflammation and brain cell development. Collectively, this supports the role of brain ISR in TBI, and suggests potential utility of ISRIB for the treatment of TBI-related states."
"This paper delves into the unexplored area of Advance Directives (ADs) in maritime surroundings, diving into the moral and legal quandaries that crop up when these directives are used at sea. ADs, which include durable powers of attorney and living wills, are essential documents that indicate a person's wishes for healthcare in the event of incapacitation. Global variations in legal recognition pose ethical questions, particularly in non-regulated jurisdictions. The maritime context introduces unique challenges, questioning the ethical applicability and binding of ADs at sea. Despite international and European laws ensuring medical assistance, the absence of specific provisions for ADs raises uncertainties. The paper advocates for a balanced approach respecting autonomy while addressing practical challenges, proposing solutions and a standardized international framework. This exploration seeks to uphold individual healthcare preferences, whether on solid ground or navigating the open sea."
"In the field of muscle fatigue models (MFMs), the prior research has demonstrated success in fitting data in specific contexts, but it falls short in addressing the diverse efforts and rapid changes in exertion typical of soccer matches. This study builds upon the existing model, aiming to enhance its applicability and robustness to dynamic demand shifts. The objective is to encapsulate the complexities of soccer dynamics with a streamlined set of parameters. Our refined model achieved a slight improvement in the R2 score in the maximum hand-grip test, increasing from 0.87 to 0.89 compared to the existing model. It also demonstrated dynamic change robustness in a soccer-specific 1 min drill and 15 min treadmill protocol extracted from the literature. Through individualized fitting on a 10-repetition 80 m sprint test for a soccer player, the model exhibited R2 scores between 0.62 and 0.80. Furthermore, when tested with actual soccer match data, it maintained a robust performance, with the average R2 scores ranging from 0.70 to 0.72. The proposed approach holds the potential to advance the understanding of tactical decisions by correlating them with real-time physical performance, offering opportunities for more informed strategies and ultimately enhancing team performance."
"Multi-cancer early detection (MCED) through a single blood test significantly advances cancer diagnosis. However, most MCED tests rely on a single type of biomarkers, leading to limited sensitivity, particularly for early-stage cancers. We previously developed SPOT-MAS, a multimodal ctDNA-based assay analyzing methylation and fragmentomic profiles to detect five common cancers. Despite its potential, SPOT-MAS exhibited moderate sensitivities for early-stage cancers. This study investigated whether integrating hotspot mutations into SPOT-MAS could enhance its detection rates."
"Somatic mosaic variants, and especially somatic single nucleotide variants (sSNVs), occur in progenitor cells in the developing human brain frequently enough to provide permanent, unique, and cumulative markers of cell divisions and clones. Here, we describe an experimental workflow to perform lineage studies in the human brain using somatic variants. The workflow consists in two major steps: (1) sSNV calling through whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of bulk (non-single-cell) DNA extracted from human fresh-frozen tissue biopsies, and (2) sSNV validation and cell phylogeny deciphering through single nuclei whole-genome amplification (WGA) followed by targeted sequencing of sSNV loci."
"This reflection follows the work of a ""Freud basher,"" Frederick Crews, elucidating some of Sigmund Freud's limitations and errors. It argues that a flawed Freud is preferable to the myth of a godlike genius and recommends ways in which to ground the future of psychoanalytic thinking."
"Porcine astrovirus (PoAstV), porcine sapovirus (PoSaV), porcine norovirus (PoNoV), and porcine rotavirus A (PoRVA) are newly discovered important porcine diarrhea viruses with a wide range of hosts and zoonotic potential, and their co-infections are often found in pig herds. In this study, the specific primers and probes were designed targeting the ORF1 gene of PoAstV, PoSaV, and PoNoV, and the VP6 gene of PoRVA. The recombinant standard plasmids were constructed, the reaction conditions (concentration of primers and probes, annealing temperature, and reaction cycle) were optimized, and the specificity, sensitivity, and reproducibility were analyzed to establish a quadruplex real-time quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) assay for the detection of these four diarrheal viruses. The results demonstrated that the assay effectively tested PoAstV, PoSaV, PoNoV, and PoRVA without cross-reactivity with other swine viruses, and had limits of detection (LODs) of 138.001, 135.167, 140.732, and 132.199 (copies/reaction) for PoAstV, PoSaV, PoNoV, and PoRVA, respectively, exhibiting high specificity and sensitivity. Additionally, it displayed good reproducibility, with coefficients of variation (CVs) of 0.09-1.24% for intra-assay and 0.08-1.03% for inter-assay. The 1578 clinical fecal samples from 14 cities in Guangxi Province, China, were analyzed via the developed assay. The results indicated that the clinical samples from Guangxi Province exhibited the prevalence of PoAstV (35.93%, 567/1578), PoSaV (8.37%, 132/1578), PoNoV (2.98%, 47/1578), and PoRVA (14.32%, 226/1578), and had a notable incidence of mixed infections of 18.31% (289/1578). Simultaneously, the 1578 clinical samples were analyzed with the previously established assays, and the coincidence rates of these two approaches exceeded 99.43%. This study developed an efficient and precise diagnostic method for the detection and differentiation of PoAstV, PoSaV, PoNoV, and PoRVA, enabling the successful diagnosis of these four diseases."
Cannabis sativa and constituent cannabinoids are in widespread use for the treatment of sleep disorders where many patients desire pharmacotherapy. Previous reviews highlight a lack of high-quality evidence to support the efficacy and long-term safety of cannabinoids in various conditions. We aim to provide an update of recent original research evaluating cannabinoid-based therapeutics in sleep disorders.
"The SPACe 2: STAR trial is a multicenter trial in children with an autism spectrum disorder, divided over nine centers in the Netherlands. However, it is challenging to include enough participants due to various factors, including the varying status of the disorder and willingness of parents and children."
"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has revolutionized treatment of aggressive large B-cell lymphoma (aLBCL). Patients with transformed indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (tiNHL) were included in key CAR trials, but outcomes of CAR for this distinct, historically high-risk group are poorly understood. We conducted a multicenter retrospective study of 1182 patients with aLBCL receiving standard-of-care CAR T between 2017 and 2022, including 338 (29%) with tiNHL. Rates of grade ≥ 3 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) were similar between tiNHL and de novo cohorts (7% vs. 8%, p = 0.6), while grade ≥ 3 immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome was lower in tiNHL (21% vs. 27%, p = 0.02). Overall response rate was similar in both cohorts (83% vs. 81%, p = 0.3), while complete response rate was higher in tiNHL (67% vs. 59%, p = 0.017). With a median follow-up of 22.3 months, the progression/relapse-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were similar between the tiNHL and de novo cohorts (24-month PFS 41% [95% CI: 35%-46%] vs. 38% [95% CI: 35%-42%]; 24-month OS 58% [95% CI: 52%-63%] vs. 52% [95% CI: 48%-56%], respectively). After adjusting for key risk factors, there was a trend toward a lower hazard of disease progression, relapse or death post-CAR for tiNHL patients compared to de novo aLBCL patients (HR: 0.84 [95% CI: 0.69-1.0], p = 0.07). Elevated LDH, advanced stage, prior bendamustine within 12 months of CAR, receipt of bridging therapy, CNS involvement, and ≥ 3 prior lines of therapy were each associated with inferior PFS. In conclusion, CAR T therapy is highly effective with an acceptable toxicity profile in patients with tiNHL."
"To compare rates of revision surgery between primary endoscopic carpal tunnel release (ECTR) and open carpal tunnel release (OCTR). In addition, we aimed to assess the influence of fellowship training on revision rates. We hypothesized that ECTR would not be associated with higher rates of revision surgery."
"Flavonoids are plant-derived compounds that have several health benefits, including antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, anti-mutagenic, and anti-carcinogenic effects. Quercetin is a flavonoid that is widely present in various fruits, vegetables, and drinks. Accurate determination of quercetin in different samples is of great importance for its potential health benefits. This review, is an overview of sample preparation and determination methods for quercetin in diverse matrices. Previous research on sample preparation and determination methods for quercetin are summarized, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of each method and providing insights into recent developments in quercetin sample treatment. Various analytical techniques are discussed including spectroscopic, chromatographic, electrophoretic, and electrochemical methods for the determination of quercetin and its derivatives in different samples. UV-Vis (Ultraviolet-visible) spectrophotometry is simple and inexpensive but lacks selectivity. Chromatographic techniques (HPLC, GC) offer selectivity and sensitivity, while electrophoretic and electrochemical methods provide high resolution and low detection limits, respectively. The aim of this review is to comprehensively explore the determination methods for quercetin and quercetin glycosides in diverse matrices, with emphasis on pharmaceutical and biological samples. The review also provides a theoretical basis for method development and application for the analysis of quercetin and quercetin glycosides in real samples."
"Sadness is commonly perceived as an affective state with negative valence. However, studies on the psychological and physiological effects of sadness have yielded mixed results. We proposed a systematic analysis of sadness, taking into account an additional dimension - the intensity of approach motivation, understood as an urge to move toward. We induced low and high approach motivation sadness while measuring electrical brain activity (EEG). We predicted that low approach motivation sadness and high approach sadness would evoke different patterns of frontal alpha activity. In our study, 41 participants were randomly assigned to a low or high approach motivation sadness induction. A significant interaction was observed when comparing low and high approach motivation sadness across the presented stories, as measured by the frontal alpha asymmetry index. To furtherly explore this effect, we conducted cluster-based permutation analysis on individual alpha peak-centered spectra, which revealed a more centrally diffused effect over the frontal areas in both hemispheres as well a significant activation over the occipital region. Low approach motivation sadness was associated with reduced alpha power over frontal areas, while high approach motivation sadness was associated with increased alpha power in the same region, both in comparison to neutral condition. These results might reflect Default Mode Network activation or the projection from occipital area. Based on these results, we propose a new perspective on sadness as a heterogeneous state that should be evaluated based on the intensity of approach motivation, rather than solely on its valence."
"Our interpretation of photosynthetically active radiation in plants has evolved since the 1970s with new data explaining the underlying mechanisms. To update McCree's founding work, this study explored the spectral response of photosynthesis in young tomato (Solanum lycopersicum cv. Beefsteak) and lettuce (Lactuca sativa cv. Breen) plants using a narrow-spectrum light unit and a portable photosynthesis system equipped with a whole plant chamber. Highly resolved spectral photosynthesis curves using 1-nm increments at 10 nm full width at half maximum (FWHM) were generated. Results show that the lowest quantum yields were observed at 450 nm and 660 nm, two wavelengths commonly used to improve photosynthesis in research. Different trends and amplified peaks were observed among the spectral quantum yield curves of tomato and lettuce plants and those of earlier studies with red and blue light. An opposing phenomenon was observed, where blue light is more efficient than red light. This is based on the narrower wavelength data acquired in both experimental plant species. Findings represent the most detailed and highly resolved spectral photosynthesis and quantum yield curves to date using experimental model plants (tomato and lettuce)."
"Clonorchiasis is an important foodborne parasitic disease in China caused by Clonorchis sinensis. Accurate and rapid diagnosis of this disease is vital for treatment and control. Traditional fecal examination methods, such as the Kato-Katz (KK) method, are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and have limited acceptance. The FA280, an advanced automated fecal analyzer, increases efficiency while significantly reducing labor load. This study aims to evaluate its performance, applicability, and scalability in clonorchiasis diagnosis to explore its potential application in the future."
Timely detection of dementia enables early access to dementia-specific care services and interventions. Various stakeholders brought together to refine Singapore's dementia care strategy identified a lack of a standardised cognitive screening tool and the absence of a comparative review of existing tools. We hence conducted a rapid review to evaluate the diagnostic performance of brief cognitive screening tools in identifying possible dementia among community-dwelling older adults in Singapore.
"The IPD-MHC Database project (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ipd/mhc/) serves as a comprehensive and expertly curated repository for major histocompatibility complex (MHC) sequences from non-human species, providing the necessary infrastructure and tools to study the function and evolution of this highly polymorphic genomic region. In its latest version, the IPD-MHC database has expanded both in content and in the tools for data visualization and comparison. The database now hosts over 18 000 MHC alleles from 125 species, organized into eleven taxonomic groups, all manually curated and named by the Comparative MHC Nomenclature Committee. A cetacean section has recently been included, offering researchers valuable data to study the immune system of whales, dolphins, and porpoises, as well establishing the official nomenclature platform for the Cetacea Leukocyte Antigens (CeLA). In response to user demand and reflecting broader trends in bioinformatics and immunogenetics, IPD-MHC now includes the predicted tertiary structure of over 8000 alleles and allows comparison and visualisation of allele variation within and between species at single residue resolution. These latest developments maintain the critically important link between official nomenclature of curated alleles and the ability to analyse this complex polymorphism using the most up to date methods within a single repository."
"Blood pressure (BP) phenotypes, as determined by the consistency between office BP (OBP) and ambulatory BP (ABP) measurements, enhance risk assessment during pregnancy. However, diagnostic criteria for hypertension in pregnancy are based on data from non-pregnant populations regarding long-term cardiovascular risks. This study aimed to identify adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs; including maternal/fetal outcomes)-related BP thresholds to refine risk assessment in pregnant women. We analyzed 967 high-risk pregnant women who underwent simultaneous OBP and ABP measurements at an average gestational age of 29.6 ± 8.0 weeks. All hypertension phenotypes were associated with an increased risk of maternal and fetal outcomes, except white coat hypertension, which showed no association with fetal outcomes. Using an XGBoost algorithm, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve-derived daytime diastolic BP (DBP) thresholds of 81.5 mmHg for maternal and 82.5 mmHg for fetal outcomes were identified as the BP parameters most strongly linked to APOs. Incorporating these thresholds into the BP phenotype-based model improved the area under the curve for APOs and the net reclassification index for maternal and fetal outcomes. Decision curve analysis demonstrated a consistent positive net benefit after incorporating BP thresholds into the phenotype-based model for maternal and composite outcomes. In conclusion, in a Chinese pregnancy cohort, we identified daytime DBP as the most influential parameter for APOs, significantly enhancing the predictive performance of BP phenotype-based models. This study underscores the importance of ABP monitoring in high-risk pregnancies and the need for further research to establish optimal BP monitoring criteria for pregnancy."
"This study presents the development and validation of the Sexual Boredom Inventory (SBI), a 6-item measure assessing sexual boredom as a temporary, context-dependent state. Initial items were drafted from data obtained through qualitative analysis, and the SBI was tested using exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) with a sample of adults reporting on their sexual experiences in the past month. A single-factor model was found to be the best fit, with four items dropped during refinement. The SBI demonstrated good internal consistency (Cronbach's α = .88) and evidence of discriminant validity, with significant negative correlations to sexual pleasure and well-being. Additionally, the SBI was positively correlated with attention difficulties and impulsivity, highlighting a link between sexual boredom and ADHD. Findings suggest that sexual boredom, as a transient experience, is associated with negative sexual outcomes. Further research should confirm these relationships and potential interventions. The SBI can serve as a valuable tool for assessing recent sexual boredom and differentiating it from other sexual concerns."

The functional connectivity (FC) has emerged as a valuable tool for comprehending the cerebral operational mechanism. Understanding the FC changes in patients with chronic ankle instability (CAI) helps reveal the underlying central nervous system mechanisms of the disease and provides clues for developing personalized treatment plans.
"Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) is a phenomenon in which antibodies enhance subsequent viral infections rather than preventing them. Sub-optimal levels of neutralizing antibodies in individuals infected with dengue virus are known to be associated with severe disease upon reinfection with a different dengue virus serotype. For Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus type-2 infection, three types of ADE have been proposed: (1) Fc receptor-dependent ADE of infection in cells expressing Fc receptors, such as macrophages by anti-spike antibodies, (2) Fc receptor-independent ADE of infection in epithelial cells by anti-spike antibodies, and (3) Fc receptor-dependent ADE of cytokine production in cells expressing Fc receptors, such as macrophages by anti-nucleocapsid antibodies. This review focuses on the Fc receptor-dependent ADE of cytokine production induced by anti-nucleocapsid antibodies, examining its potential role in severe COVID-19 during reinfection and its contribution to the post-acute sequelae of COVID-19, i.e., prolonged symptoms lasting at least three months after the acute phase of the disease. We also discuss the protective effects of recently identified anti-spike antibodies that neutralize Omicron variants."
"Data quality for and about American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) people is undermined by deeply entrenched, colonial practices that have become standard in US federal data systems. This article draws on cases of maternal mortality and COVID-19 to demonstrate the ethical and clinical need for inclusive, diverse, and accurate data when researching AI/AN health trends. This article further argues that epidemiologists specifically must challenge implicit bias, question methods and practices, and recognize colonial, racist reporting practices about AI/AN people that have long undermined data collection, analytical, and dissemination practices that are fundamental to epidemiological research."
"Even though Denmark has the highest contraceptive use (42%) of the Nordic countries, 19% of all pregnancies in Denmark end in termination. Various contraceptive options are available, and unwanted pregnancies therefore ought to be avoidable. This study aimed to investigate if women received counselling and prescriptions for contraception during their termination and if this or other factors impacted their risk of repeat termination."
Controversy remains about the ideal construct for certain olecranon fractures. The purpose of this study was to compare cost-effectiveness with the value driven outcomes tool between fixation strategies of olecranon fractures.
"The aperiodic exponent of the power spectrum of signals in several neuroimaging modalities has been found to be related to the excitation/inhibition balance of the neural system. Leveraging the rich temporal dynamics of resting-state pupil fluctuations, the present study investigated the association between the aperiodic exponent of pupil fluctuations and the neural excitation/inhibition balance in attentional processing. In separate phases, we recorded participants' pupil size during resting state and assessed their attentional orienting using the Posner cueing tasks with different cue validities (i.e., 100% and 50%). We found significant correlations between the aperiodic exponent of resting pupil fluctuations and both the microsaccadic and behavioral cueing effects. Critically, this relationship was particularly evident in the 50% cue-validity condition rather than in the 100% cue-validity condition. The microsaccadic responses mediated the association between the aperiodic exponent and the behavioral response. Further analysis showed that the aperiodic exponent of pupil fluctuations predicted the self-rated hyperactivity/impulsivity trait across individuals, suggesting its potential as a marker of attentional deficits. These findings highlight the rich information contained in pupil fluctuations and provide a new approach to assessing the neural excitation/inhibition balance in attentional processing."
"The global aging demographic trend has led to an increased demand for home care services among older people. We measured the preferences and willingness to pay (WTP) of older adults in China for home care services using a discrete choice experiment (DCE) design. A total of 496 valid responses from older adults were included. The analysis was performed using conditional logit and mixed logit models to estimate utility parameters, WTP, and uptake rates. The attributes for home care services included the following: home care service content, service quality, supervision, and feedback collection during service provision, and out-of-pocket payment. The findings indicated that respondents were willing to pay RMB 197.487 more per month for medical care services, RMB 76.227 more per month for higher quality services, and RMB 134.397 more for services with supervision. Improving these attributes could increase the likelihood of older adults using home care services by 29.33%. Policymakers should reduce the economic burden on older adults, enhancing service content as well as supervision and quality to improve the acceptability and sustainability of home care services."
"Single-particle tracking (SPT) has become a powerful tool to monitor the dynamics of membrane proteins in living cells. However, permanent labeling strategies for SPT suffer from photobleaching as a major limitation, restricting observation times, and obstructing the study of long-term cellular processes within single living cells. Here, we use exchangeable HaloTag Ligands (xHTLs) as an easy-to-apply labeling approach for live-cell SPT and demonstrate extended observation times of individual living cells of up to 30 minutes. Using the xHTL/HaloTag7 labeling system, we measure the ligand-induced activation kinetics of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in single living cells. We generate spatial maps of receptor diffusion in cells, report non-uniform distributions of receptor mobility, and the formation of spatially confined 'hot spots' of EGFR activation. Furthermore, we measured the mobility of an ER-luminal protein in living cells and found diffusion coefficients that correlated with the ER nano-structure. This approach represents a general strategy to monitor protein mobility in a functional context and for extended observation times in single living cells."
"This article explores current global research on voluntarily stopping eating and drinking (VSED) and presents a detailed, deidentified case study of a patient who elected VSED in a hospice setting in the Southeastern United States. It highlights the collaborative efforts of health care professionals in effectively supporting the patient and family, sharing multiple perspectives from various health care team members who cared for the patient and family. It offers evidence-based recommendations to guide health care teams through the ethical, medical, and emotional challenges of VSED, ensuring compassionate and competent care. The article emphasizes the importance of structured protocols and empathetic care in hospice settings, advocating for the education and preparation of health care teams and families to address the complex challenges associated with VSED. By promoting open communication, interdisciplinary collaboration, and comprehensive support, hospices can respect the autonomy of patients and families choosing VSED, ensuring a compassionate and dignified end-of-life experience."

"Identifying clusters of multiple long-term conditions (MLTCs), also known as multimorbidity, and their associated burden may facilitate the development of effective and cost-effective targeted healthcare strategies. This study aimed to identify clusters of MLTCs and their associations with long-term health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in two UK population-based cohorts."
"The aim of this study was to investigate the associations among in-water vertical jump and various dry-land physical measures by taking the law of Archimedes into consideration, and by normalizing the dry-land measures both to body density and body mass. Seventeen elite water polo players from Hungarian first league were tested for dry-land counter movement and squat jump mechanical impulse, isometric squat force, and in-water vertical jump height. Body density was estimated by anthropometric measurements. Body density alone did not influence in-water vertical jump height. Both the impulse of counter movement jump normalized to body mass (9.42±0.86 N·s/kg) and impulse of counter movement jump normalized to body density (773.92±109.68 N·s/kg/g/cm3) correlated with the in water vertical jump height (69.37±6.12 cm) (p≤0.05), but the magnitudes of the correlation coefficients 0.49 vs. 0.50 were not statistically different (p = 0.480, z = 0.04). Neither the impulse of squat jump normalized to body mass (7.07±0.59 N·s/kg) nor impulse of squat jump normalized to body density (577.87±89.16 N·s/kg/g/cm3) correlated with the in water vertical jump height (both p>0.05). The correlation between the force of the maximum voluntary isometric contraction normalized to body density (1052.13±244.65 N/kg/g/cm3) and the in water vertical jump height only approached the level of significance (p = 0.077). We concluded that dry-land reactive strength determines the ability to jump out of water, but players' body density does not seem to contribute to jump height."
"Salvia miltiorrhiza is a model medicinal plant that is typically used to treat cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. The primary active medicinal ingredients of S. miltiorrhiza are salvianolic acids and tanshinones. Jasmonate (JA) is a vital phytohormone that regulates secondary metabolism. The exogenous application of methyl jasmonate (MeJA) can promote the accumulation of active ingredients in S. miltiorrhiza. Here, we identified a MeJA-responsive SmbHLH59 gene that encodes for a bHLH IIIe family transcription factor. The overexpression of SmbHLH59 in S. miltiorrhiza increased the contents of salvianolic acids and tanshinones, while the opposite effect was observed when SmbHLH59 was knocked out via CRISPR. Meanwhile, SmbHLH59 was observed to activate the expressions of SmPAL1, SmC4H1, SmHPPR1, SmCPS1, and SmKSL1 genes by binding to the E/G-box elements of their promoters. Further investigations demonstrated that SmJAZ1 and SmJAZ8 interacted with SmbHLH59 to inhibit its activation of these five genes. In summary, a JA signaling pathway component (SmbHLH59) was identified that strongly enhanced the accumulation of salvianolic acids and tanshinones through the direct activation of multiple enzyme genes in their biosynthetic pathways. Consequently, this study enriches our knowledge toward further elucidating the molecular mechanisms behind the regulation of JA in the secondary metabolism of S. miltiorrhiza."
To assess the geographical equity in Ethiopian infants' exclusive breastfeeding at 5 months and dietary diversity at 12 months and whether social factors explained the spatial inequities.
"Inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) encompass a variety of disease phenotypes and are known to display both clinical and genetic heterogeneity. A further complexity is that for several IRD-associated genes, pathogenic variants have been reported to cause either autosomal dominant (AD) or autosomal recessive (AR) diseases. The possibility of dual inheritance can create a challenge for variant interpretation as well as the genetic counselling of patients. This review aims to determine whether the molecular mechanisms behind the dual inheritance of each IRD-associated gene is well established, not yet properly understood, or if the association is questionable. Each gene is discussed individually in detail due to different protein structures and functions, but there are overlapping characteristics. For example, eight genes only have a limited number of reported pathogenic variants or a hotspot region implicated in the second inheritance pattern. Whereas CRX and RP1 display distinct spatial patterns for AR and AD pathogenic variants based on the variant type and/or location. The genes with a questionable dual inheritance, namely AIPL1, CRB1, and RCBTB1 highlight the importance of carefully considering allele frequency data. Finally, the crucial role relevant functional studies in animal and cell models play in validating a variant's biochemical or molecular effect is emphasised."

"Critically ill patients frequently require mechanical ventilation and often receive sedation to control pain, reduce anxiety, and facilitate patient-ventilator interactions. Weaning from mechanical ventilation is intertwined with sedation management. In this review, we analyze the current evidence for sedation management during ventilatory weaning, including level of sedation, timing of sedation weaning, analgesic and sedative choices, and sedation management in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)."
"Neuron as a charged body, it is easily disturbed by the external electromagnetic field, which changes the electrical activities of the neurons. In fact, the interference of external electric or magnetic field is the process of energy injection of neurons, the injection of energy will redistribute the field energy inside the neurons, and the redistribution of energy will change the electrical activities of the neurons. Therefore, we design a neuron model with double memristors to explore the external electromagnetic field on the regulation of neural electrical activity. The dimensionless equations of the model with double memristors and its energy function are obtained based on the Kirchhoff's and the Helmholtz's theorems. The electrical activities of the neuron model under the external electromagnetic field distribution are researched by applying the nonlinear analysis methods, and the coherence resonance of the neuron is explored under the external noise electromagnetic field. The results indicate that the electrical activities of the model are controlled by the external electromagnetic field. This neuron model can be used to study the synchronization between magnetic field coupled or electric field coupled neurons."
"Regulating volatile compounds release through protein structural modification can influence food sensory properties. This study investigated the effects of controlled enzymatic hydrolysis (CEH) on the release of off-flavor compounds identified in soybean protein isolate (SPI) and revealed its potential mechanism of influence. CEH treatment significantly reduced the release of aldehydes, particularly (E, E)-2,4-decadienal, by inducing the unfolding of SPI unfolding. This structural modification exposed additional binding sites, thereby increasing the affinity of SPI for aldehyde compounds and effectively limiting aldehyde volatility. Multi-spectroscopic techniques, surface hydrophobicity, and dynamic light scattering (DLS) analyses confirmed these structural changes. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) analysis suggested that non-covalent interactions, dominated by hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions, were the primary factors driving these changes, as further confirmed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and independent gradient model (IGM) analysis. Additionally, proteomics revealed that covalent binding, including Michael addition and Schiff base reactions, also influenced the aldehydes release."
"Deep learning-based image segmentation has allowed for the fully automated, accurate, and rapid analysis of musculoskeletal (MSK) structures from medical images. However, current approaches were either applied only to 2D cross-sectional images, addressed few structures, or were validated on small datasets, which limit the application in large-scale databases. This study aimed to validate an improved deep learning model for volumetric MSK segmentation of the hip and thigh with uncertainty estimation from clinical computed tomography (CT) images. Databases of CT images from multiple manufacturers/scanners, disease status, and patient positioning were used. The segmentation accuracy, and accuracy in estimating the structures volume and density, i.e., mean HU, were evaluated. An approach for segmentation failure detection based on predictive uncertainty was also investigated. The model has improved all segmentation accuracy and structure volume/density evaluation metrics compared to a shallower baseline model with a smaller training database (N = 20). The predictive uncertainty yielded large areas under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curves (AUROCs ≥ .95) in detecting inaccurate and failed segmentations. Furthermore, the study has shown an impact of the disease severity status on the model's predictive uncertainties when applied to a large-scale database. The high segmentation and muscle volume/density estimation accuracy and the high accuracy in failure detection based on the predictive uncertainty exhibited the model's reliability for analyzing individual MSK structures in large-scale CT databases."
"Family conflict has been demonstrated as a risk factor impacting children's mental health and behaviors; however, the mechanisms underlying these connections are unclear. Focusing on 1622 children from low-income families (51.4% boys, 38.3% White, 35.5% Hispanic/Latino, 22.1% African American, 4.1% other), the current study examines the role that maternal depression and parenting behaviors play in the associations between family conflict in early childhood and children's internalizing and externalizing behaviors in early adolescence. Family conflict was positively associated with maternal depression at age 3 and detached parenting at age 5; however, maternal depression was linked to increased child internalizing and externalizing behaviors, and detached parenting was associated with decreased behavioral outcomes. Maternal depression at age 3 and intrusive parenting at age 5 successively mediated the association between family conflict and child externalizing. Multi-group analysis indicated different indirect paths of parenting behaviors in boys and girls. Specifically, in boys, the indirect effect of detached parenting on the links between family conflict and externalizing and internalizing behaviors was sustained. In girls, maternal depression and intrusive parenting sequentially explained the link between family conflict and externalizing behaviors.

"Patients with cancer who receive allogeneic red blood cell transfusions are at risk of adverse reactions of varying severity. One of these reactions is immunomodulation, also known as transfusion-related immunomodulation. With the exact mechanism of transfusion related immunomodulation being unclear, storage lesions (both the cellular and cytokine component) are considered a major contributor. Leucocytes are believed to be implicated in storage lesions and immunomodulation. However, the efficacy of leucodepletion in reducing immunomodulation is controversial. The theoretical link between these three interconnected events - storage lesions, immunomodulation and cancer progression remain controversial and poorly understood. This article summarizes the available evidence on efficacy of leucodepletion, storage lesions and transfusion related immunomodulation, while rationalizing the possible association between an immunomodulation triggering transfusion 'dose' in cancer patients and subsequent cancer recurrence."
"This cross-sectional study investigated the mental health outcomes and associated factors among Bangladeshi migrants in Thailand. A sample of 360 participants completed questionnaires assessing depressive symptoms, anxiety, and stress using the DASS-21 scale, along with sociodemographic and acculturative factors. Results revealed that 35.8%, 42.2%, and 17.8% of participants experienced symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress, respectively. Lower education levels were associated with increased risk of all three mental health outcomes. Unexpectedly, assimilation as an acculturation strategy and higher Thai language proficiency were linked to poorer mental health. Experiences of discrimination and low social support significantly increased the likelihood of mental health issues. Difficulty accessing healthcare services was also associated with worse mental health outcomes. These findings highlight the complex interplay between acculturation, social factors, and mental health among migrant populations, emphasizing the need for culturally sensitive mental health services and policies to support Bangladeshi migrants in Thailand."
"Metastatic breast cancers are frequently encountered in cytology and require immunocytochemistry (ICC). In this study, traditional and multiplex ICC (mICC) for GATA-binding protein 3 (GATA3), gross cystic disease fluid protein 15 (GCDFP15), and mammaglobin (MMG) were performed with the aim of validating mICC in cell blocks, with further single-cell expression pattern analysis to identify the single markers and combinations of markers most sensitive in subtypes of breast cancer."
"The use of ultrasound (US) in the perioperative clinical management should be goal-directed, rapid, and reproducible. Thoracic US enables detailed examinations of vital structures, such as the airway, lung, pleural space, diaphragm, and heart. This chapter focuses on the value of US as a bedside tool to assess anatomy, guide procedures, and monitor vital organ function in patients undergoing thoracic surgery."
"In the mammalian genome, most CpGs are methylated. However, CpGs within the CpG islands (CGIs) are largely unmethylated, which are important for gene expression regulation. The mechanism underlying the low methylation levels at CGIs remains largely elusive. KDM2 proteins (KDM2A and KDM2B) are H3K36me2 demethylases known to bind specifically at CGIs. Here, we report that depletion of each or both KDM2 proteins, or mutation of all their JmjC domains that harbor the H3K36me2 demethylation activity, leads to an increase in DNA methylation at selective CGIs. The Kdm2a/2b double knockout shows a stronger increase in DNA methylation compared with the single mutant of Kdm2a or Kdm2b, indicating that KDM2A and KDM2B redundantly regulate DNA methylation at CGIs. In addition, the increase of CGI DNA methylation upon mutations of KDM2 proteins is associated with the chromatin environment. Our findings reveal that KDM2A and KDM2B function redundantly in regulating DNA methylation at a subset of CGIs in an H3K36me2 demethylation-dependent manner."
"Endotracheal tubes (ETTs) are life-supporting devices that are designed to maintain a patent airway in patients who are unable to sustain an airway due to illness or injury. Patients with small airways, such as neonates and pediatrics, have unique structural and functional features, making it essential that ETT design considers and executes on these particular needs. Though uncuffed ETTs have historically been preferred for patients younger than eight years of age, advances in cuffed ETT design and construction can be utilized to manufacture ETTs that are optimized for the smallest, most fragile airways. The purpose of this article is to discuss certain design features of cuffed ETTs in respect to small airways."
"Glial cells are known to influence neuronal functions through glia-neuron communication. The present study aims to elucidate the mechanism behind peroxisome-mediated glia-neuron communication using Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ) as a model system. We observe a high abundance of peroxisomes in the abdominal NMJ of adult Drosophila. Interestingly, glia-specific knockdown of peroxisome import receptor protein, Pex5, significantly increases axonal area and volume and leads to axon swelling. The enlarged axonal structure is likely deleterious, as the flies with glia-specific knockdown of Pex5 exhibit age-dependent locomotion defects. In addition, impaired peroxisomal ether lipid biosynthesis in glial cells also induces axon swelling. Consistent with our previous work, defective peroxisomal import function upregulates pro-inflammatory cytokine upd3 in glial cells, while glia-specific overexpression of upd3 induces axonal swelling. Furthermore, motor neuron-specific activation of the JAK-STAT pathway through hop overexpression results in axon swelling. Our findings demonstrated that impairment of glial peroxisomes alters axonal morphology, neuroinflammation, and motor neuron function."
"Breast cancer is the second leading cause of death in women globally, and it remains a health burden due to poor therapy response, cancer cell drug resistance, and the debilitating side effects associated with most therapies. One approach to addressing the need to improve breast cancer therapies has been to elucidate the mechanism(s) underpinning this disease to identify key drivers that can be targeted in molecular therapies. The T-box transcription factor, TBX3, is upregulated in breast cancer, in which it contributes to important oncogenic processes, and it has been validated as a potential therapeutic target. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms that upregulate TBX3 in breast cancer, and we show that it involves transcriptional activation by c-Myc, post-translational modification by AKT1 and AKT3, and interaction with the molecular chaperone Hsc70. Together, the results from this study provide evidence that c-Myc, AKT, Hsc70, and TBX3 form part of an important oncogenic pathway in breast cancer and thus reveal versatile ways of interfering with the oncogenic activity of TBX3 for the treatment of this neoplasm. Implications: Targeting the c-Myc/AKT/TBX3/Hsc70 signaling axis may be an effective treatment strategy for TBX3-driven breast cancer."

"COVID-19 vaccines, including mRNA-1273, have been rapidly developed and deployed. Establishing the optimal dose is crucial for developing a safe and effective vaccine. Modeling and simulation have the potential to play a key role in guiding the selection and development of the vaccine dose. In this context, we have developed an immunostimulatory/immunodynamic (IS/ID) model to quantitatively characterize the neutralizing antibody titers elicited by mRNA-1273 obtained from three clinical studies. The developed model was used to predict the optimal vaccine dose for future pediatric trials. A 25-μg primary vaccine series was predicted to meet non-inferiority criteria in young children (aged 2-5 years) and infants (aged 6-23 months). The geometric mean titers and geometric mean ratios for this dose level predicted using the IS/ID model a priori matched those observed in the pediatric clinical study. These findings demonstrate that IS/ID models represent a novel approach to guide data-driven clinical dose selection of vaccines."
"Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder characterized by physical, cognitive, and behavioral impairments. The PSP Rating Scale (PSPRS) is a widely used and validated, clinical scale to monitor disease progression. Here we show the modification of PSPRS to improve clinical meaningfulness and sensitivity. A conceptual framework was used to select meaningful items. Datasets were analyzed to improve the psychometric properties, understand factor structure, and develop a scoring algorithm. Fifteen items of the PSPRS were selected based on whether the items reflect concepts specific to the disease and those responsive to change over 12 months. Some items were rescored to reflect meaningful changes and to improve discrimination and reliability. The rescored 15-item PSPRS was more interpretable and sensitive to disease progression over 12 months. The approach to develop the 15-item PSPRS provides an example of how to modify an existing clinical outcome assessment for use as a primary endpoint in a clinical trial of a progressive neurological disorder."
"The study was to explore the efficacy and safety of sivelestat (SV) in the treatment of severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). A total of 102 SAP patients diagnosed and treated in the Emergency Intensive Care Unit of the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University from January 2021 to August 2024 were selected. The changes of disease outcome, hospital stays and mortality were compared between the two groups. A total of 102 patients were recruited to control group (n = 56) or SV group (n = 46) according to whether SV was applied or not. There was no significant difference in baseline data at admission between the two groups. After 1 week of treatment, all the indexes in both groups improved. The duration of ventilator use (p = 0.0400) and ICU stays (p  = 0.0495) in SV group was shorter than that in control group, but there was no significant difference in mortality between the two groups. Although SV did not reduce the mortality of patients with SAP, it reduced the length of ventilator use and ICU stay."
"This study investigates the Y-chromosome genetic diversity of the Turkmen population in Turkmenistan, analyzing 23 Y-STR loci for the first time in a sample of 100 individuals. Combined with comparative data from Turkmen populations in Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Russia, and Uzbekistan, this analysis offers insights into the genetic structure and relationships among Turkmen populations across regions across Central Asia and the Near East. High haplotype diversity in the Turkmen of Turkmenistan is shaped by founder effects (lineage expansions) from distinct haplogroups, with haplogroups Q and R1a predominating. Subhaplogroups Q1a and Q1b identified in Turkmenistan trace back to ancient Y-chromosome lineages from the Bronze Age. Comparative analyses, including genetic distance (RST), median-joining network, and multidimensional scaling (MDS), highlight the genetic proximity of the Turkmen in Turkmenistan to those in Afghanistan and Iran, while Iraqi Turkmen display unique characteristics, aligning with Near Eastern populations. This study underscores the Central Asian genetic affinity across most Turkmen populations. It demonstrates the value of deep-sequencing Y-chromosome data in tracing the patrilineal history of Central Asia for future studies. These findings contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of Turkmen genetic ancestry and add new data to the ongoing study of Central Asian population genetics."

"This review delves comprehensively into the nutritional profiles and diverse biological activities of different berries. So far 19 different types of berries have been identified for human consumption and studied for their nutritional and biological activities. Among them, acai berry, blueberry, blackberry, black currant, boysenberry, and bilberry have been summarized in this review (Part I). These berries are reported to possess various biological activities including anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antioxidant, antimutagenic, anti-neurodegenerative, and antimicrobial properties. The key to these health-promoting effects lies in the rich array of bioactive compounds present in these berries, including flavonoids, phenolics, anthocyanins, tannins, stilbenes, and phenolic acids which makes these berries promising candidates as sources for functional food ingredients and nutraceuticals."
"Dairy farmers are grappling with serious business challenges, including rising operational costs, labour shortages, unstable milk prices, changing consumer preferences, long hours with minimal downtime and unstable weather patterns due to climate change impacts. Using a telephone-based representative survey and interviews with 147 Australian dairy farmers conducted in 2023, we employed a mixed-method approach combining quantitative and qualitative analysis to determine the challenges and primary concerns of the participants, as well as to explore potential solutions. Four key variables that contributed significantly to a binary logistic regression model of transition intentions were identified, namely: level of satisfaction with dairy farming, openness to exploring other agricultural alternatives to dairy farming, preference to receive financial and/or other support to remain in the industry and preference to receive financial and/or other support to transition into a different form of farming or business. This model accurately predicted the probability that farmers were considering transitioning away from dairy farming and the probability that they were considering staying in dairy farming. This deepens our understanding of the challenges faced by farmers in the Australian dairy industry, and provides policymakers, industry stakeholders and researchers with critical insights to facilitate transition pathways that will enhance farmers' future sustainability."
"Addition of fluorine atoms into chemical compounds is a validated strategy to enhance their physical, chemical and biological properties. In this study, FL118, a novel camptothecin-related small molecule known for its unique mechanism of action and superior antitumor efficacy, was utilized as a foundational drug platform. By replacing the hydrogen atom at position 7 of FL118 with a fluoroaryl group, a diverse array of FL118 derivatives were synthesized. Our investigations revealed that the majority of these newly synthesized compounds exhibited improved cytotoxicity compared to FL118, with some demonstrating enhanced in vivo antitumor efficacy. Among these derivatives, compound 7h stood out and was subjected to detailed analysis. Compound 7h demonstrated a remarkable ability to inhibit colorectal cancer (CRC) cell colony formation and cell migration, while also promoting reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and CRC cell apoptosis. Notably, our studies unveiled that the presence of DDX5 could modulate Topoisomerase I (Top1) activity, a process effectively reversed by a low concentration of 7h, but not SN38. Moreover, only 7h was able to decrease DDX5 expression, SN38 was not. Molecular docking studies further supported the binding of 7h to DDX5. Interestingly, although both 7h and SN38 exhibited similar inhibitory effects on Top1 activity, only 7h, and not SN38, could inhibit DDX5. These findings not only pave the way for deeper mechanistic explorations of FL118 and its derivatives in cancer research but also position the identified compound 7h as a promising candidate for further development."

"Understanding the underlying mechanism of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has led to the discovery of novel biomarkers to help predict, treat and monitor leukemia. DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase 3 A (DNMT3A) is considered a prognostic and therapeutic epigenetic target in AML patients with a hotspot mutation of R882. R882 mutation is associated with impaired differentiation of Hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow and disease progression. The prevalence of R882 mutation varied in different ethnicities and countries, and similarly, its prognostic impact differed among numerous studies. Nevertheless, the co-occurrence of mutations in R882 with NPM1 and FLT3 has been reported more frequently and is associated with a worse prognosis. These studies also suggest diverse results regarding bone marrow transplantation response as a treatment, while chemoresistance is reached as a conclusive outcome These findings highlight the crucial need for an in-depth discussion on the significance of the R882 mutation in AML patients. Understanding its impact on leukemic transformation, prognosis, and treatment is vital for advancing clinical implications."

"Heavy alcohol consumption is a known risk factor for type 2 diabetes (T2D), However, the moderating effect of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels remains unclear. This study explores the relationship between alcohol intake and T2D risk across FPG strata in a Japanese cohort. Data from 15,453 participants in the NAGALA cohort were analyzed over 5.4 years. Baseline assessments included alcohol consumption and FPG, categorizing individuals into elevated FPG (EFPG, 100-125 mg/dL) and normal FPG (NFPG, < 100 mg/dL). Cox proportional hazards regression assessed alcohol intake levels and T2D risk, stratified by FPG. Among EFPG individuals, heavy drinkers (Men > 280 g/week, Women > 140 g/week) had an 88% increased T2D risk (HR 1.88, 95% CI 1.24-2.84). Conversely, in NFPG, heavy alcohol intake did not significantly affect T2D risk (HR 1.10, 95% CI 0.48-2.53). Men with EFPG and heavy alcohol intake had an HR of 1.83 (95% CI 1.08-3.08), supported by propensity score matching (HR 1.94, 95% CI 1.13-3.34). No significant relationships were found in NFPG. Heavy alcohol consumption significantly raises T2D risk in Japanese men with EFPG but not in women or those with NFPG. Further studies are warranted for validation and gender-specific insights."
"Women from sub-Saharan Africa, including Ethiopia, are underrepresented in biomedical research due in part to limited access to high-quality research training and mentorship. Tuberculosis (TB) is a major public health problem in Ethiopia, with a limited number of female Ethiopian scientists engaged in TB-related research. To improve access to TB-related research training among junior women scientists, our NIH Fogarty International Center-funded D43 program released an all-women request for applications (RFA), which substantially increased the number of women applying for research training and the number of women trained in our program. The impact of the all-women cohort was also bolstered by prominent female representation in mentor teams, program leadership, and program alumnae. Sustained increases in applications from women were seen in subsequent RFAs that included both women and men. Targeted leadership, mentorship, and recruitment efforts were effective in promoting improved gender equity in biomedical research training."

"Sweet syndrome (SS), or acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis, is a dermatologic, auto-inflammatory disorder of unclear origin, often accompanied by systemic inflammation affecting various tissues, including the eyes. Common ocular manifestations include conjunctivitis but can extend to other ocular tissues. Orbital apex syndrome (OAS) involves damage to several cranial nerves transversing the orbital apex, leading to ophthalmoplegia and vision loss. This case report describes a rare case of OAS secondary to SS. A woman in her 50s with a history of SS presented with right eye loss of vision and ophthalmoplegia. Following treatment with high-dose systemic corticosteroids, her vision and ocular motility were restored. This case highlights the importance of recognising SS as a potential cause of OAS, especially when OAS is accompanied by the characteristic skin lesions noted in SS and that high-dose corticosteroids can treat this condition rapidly and effectively."

This retrospective study evaluates factors affecting mortality, morbidity, and hospital stay in elderly patients diagnosed with AC who presented to the emergency department and underwent PC."
"The history of life's formation and the origin of its stereochemistry are nearly as multifaceted as the life itself. In this review, we focus on analyzing the step-by-step path leading to what we can define as ""life"" in parallel to what we know about the emergence of enantiomeric imbalance and subsequent transition to full homochirality. We start at the level of assembly of the building blocks of life from inorganic molecules and build up to the polymerization and formation of nucleic acids and peptides. We report and analyze different theories at various stages of this development and try to elucidate the most plausible theory."
"Eukaryotic genes can encode multiple distinct transcripts through the alternative splicing (AS) of genes. Interest in the AS mechanism and its evolution across different species has stimulated numerous studies, leading to several databases that provide information on AS and transcriptome data across multiple eukaryotic species. However, existing resources do not offer information on transcript conservation and evolution between genes of multiple species. Similarly to genes, identifying conserved transcripts-those from homologous genes that have retained a similar exon composition-is useful for determining transcript homology relationships, studying transcript functions and reconstructing transcript phylogenies. To address this gap, we have developed TranscriptDB, a database dedicated to studying the conservation and evolution of transcripts within gene families. TranscriptDB offers an extensive catalog of conserved transcripts and phylogenies for 317 annotated eukaryotic species, sourced from Ensembl database version 111. It serves multiple purposes, including the exploration of gene and transcript evolution. Users can access TranscriptDB through various browsing and querying tools, including a user-friendly web interface. The incorporated web servers enable users to retrieve information on transcript evolution using their own data as input. Additionally, a REST application programming interface is available for programmatic data retrieval. A data directory is also available for bulk downloads. TranscriptDB and its resources are freely accessible at https://transcriptdb.cobius.usherbrooke.ca."
"Spontaneous tumor regression is a recognized phenomenon across various cancer types. Recent research emphasizes the alterations in autoantibodies against carbonic anhydrase I (CA I) (anti-CA I) levels as potential prognostic markers for various malignancies. Particularly, autoantibodies targeting CA I and II appear to induce cellular damage by inhibiting their respective protein's catalytic functions. Our study illuminates the profound impact of anti-CA I autoantibodies from patient serum on the esterase activity of human CA I, exhibiting inhibitory effects akin to the acetazolamide inhibitor. Concurrently, our newly synthesized mouse monoclonal IgG antibody, mAb 2B8, against human CA I showcased a potent inhibitory action. An in-depth exploration into mAb 2B8's binding dynamics with its target enzyme was undertaken. Leveraging epitope extraction and phage display library techniques, we identified the amino acid sequence DFWTYP (positions 191-196 of CA I) as crucial for mAb 2B8's interaction. In 3-D structural analysis, this sequence is spatially adjacent to a previously identified epitope (DFWTYP) that interacts with patient-derived autoantibodies. Critically, mAb 2B8 demonstrated an ability to infiltrate eukaryotic cells, engaging specifically with its intracytoplasmic target. This positions mAb 2B8 as a promising model for future studies aimed at tumor cell eradication."

"Medulloblastoma is a heterogeneous embryonal tumor of the cerebellum comprised of four distinct molecular subgroups that differ in their developmental origins, genomic landscapes, clinical presentation, and survival. Recent characterization of the human fetal cerebellum at single-cell resolution has propelled unprecedented insights into the cellular origins of medulloblastoma subgroups, including those underlying previously elusive groups 3 and 4. In this review, the molecular pathogenesis of medulloblastoma is examined through the lens of cerebellar development. In addition, we discuss how enhanced understanding of medulloblastoma origins has the potential to refine disease modeling for the advancement of treatment and outcomes."
"Riparian ecosystems harbour unique biodiversity because of their close interconnections with adjacent aquatic ecosystems. Yet, how aquatic ecosystems influence terrestrial biodiversity over different spatial scales is poorly understood, particularly in the tropics. We conducted field campaigns to collect 235 terrestrial invertebrate assemblages along 150 m transects from 47 streams in both Brazil and the UK, compiling one of the largest known datasets of riparian invertebrate community composition at multiple spatial scales. Invertebrate densities increased towards water in both regions. In Brazil, this was driven by an increase in spiders, with a corresponding decrease in non-predators, resulting in higher predator : prey ratios near water. In the UK, non-predator densities increased towards water, decreasing predator : prey ratios. While pairwise dissimilarity increased with distance from water in both regions, β-diversity was significantly higher in tropical assemblages, with more β-diversity explained by turnover. Spider community composition was significantly structured by distance from water in the Brazilian sites, suggesting tropical assemblages were influenced more by emerging aquatic prey, with a distinct spider community replacing other predators, with possible top-down control of terrestrial prey. High turnover-driven dissimilarity among tropical assemblages suggests that Brazilian riparian ecosystems are better managed at the landscape scale, with an emphasis on in-stream measures preventing disruption of aquatic resource subsidies."

"Nutrient limitation is a universal phenomenon in terrestrial ecosystems. Root and mycorrhizal are critical to plant nutrient absorption in nutrient-limited ecosystems. However, how they are modified by N and P limitations with advancing vegetation successions in karst forests remains poorly understood. The present study compared the diversity indices, composition, and co-occurrence network of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) between grassland, shrubland, shrub-tree forest, and tree forest in subtropical karst forests, as well as soil nutrients and fine root functional traits (e.g., specific root length (SRL), specific root area (SRA), diameter, biomass, and N and P contents)."
"Deletion of the short arm of chromosome 1 (1p) increases recurrence rates in meningiomas by up to 33%, regardless of tumor grade, correlating with absence of intracellular alkaline phosphatase enzyme activity. Current screening methods for 1p deletion like fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis are resource-intensive. This study evaluated AlkaPhos, a novel fluorescent probe, for detecting alkaline phosphatase in meningioma cells and compared findings with FISH, LOH, and histochemical analysis. AlkaPhos sensitivity in detecting alkaline phosphatase on BEN-MEN-1 cells and primary meningioma cultures was assessed via microscopic fluorescent ratio measurements. FISH and LOH were conducted on the same tumors to detect 1p deletions. Histochemical analysis served as a reference. AlkaPhos results were compared with FISH, LOH, and histochemical analysis. AlkaPhos effectively indicated alkaline phosphatase activity in BEN-MEN-1 cells and correctly identified 1p deletion in 8/14 primary meningioma cultures, matching FISH and LOH findings, respectively. AlkaPhos showed potential superiority over histochemical analysis in identifying tumors with 1p deletion and LOH of 1p. AlkaPhos bears potential as a future diagnostic tool for identifying alkaline phosphatase absence in meningiomas, indicative of 1p deletion. Further evaluation on a larger sample size is necessary for routine clinical application."

"We present a case of insatiable appetite and harmful overeating in a hospice patient that showcases the burden of hypothalamic hyperphagia, a rare complication of brain cancer. While confounders exist such as progression of disease and prior tapering of dexamethasone, in this case the initiation of metformin was associated with substantial appetite reduction and resolution of our patient's debilitating food-seeking behaviors. We will explore metformin as a potential cost-effective option for palliation in a hospice setting and explore some of the physiologic mechanisms involved."
"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) represents a significant global health threat, with a disproportionately high disease burden in low and middle-income regions (LMIRs). Estimating the prevalence of RSV infection at the community levels remains a huge challenge, particularly in LMIRs where clinical data are scarce. In this study, we first detected RSV RNA in the fecal samples from 300 patients to understand the fecal shedding patterns of RSV. Meanwhile, we conducted sewage surveillance of RSV in four geographically distinct LMIRs in China from April 2023 to June 2024. Real-time reverse transcription quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) was employed to monitor the dynamics of sewage RSV concentration in a typical sewershed from Yingkou, Xi'an, Nanchang, and Nanning, respectively. Subsequent amplicon sequencing was conducted to understand the genotype and mutations of sewage RSV. Through RT-qPCR, we observed two RSV epidemics that lasted from late April to May and October to February in both Yingkou and Xi'an. For Nanchang, only one RSV epidemic was observed which emerged from September to February. Notably, in Nanning, a prolonged RSV epidemic was observed from August to April, suggesting RSV vaccination in Nanning faced more challenges. Amplicon sequencing revealed that sewage RSV found in four LMIRs is genetically distinct, highlighting the need for local initiatives for wastewater monitoring of RSV. This study filled the gaps in previous assessment of suitability of RSV vaccination in LMIRs based on clinical surveillance, demonstrating the effectiveness of wastewater surveillance in guiding public health interventions."
"Recent smooth muscle cell (SMC)-lineage tracing and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) experiments revealed a significant role of SMC-derived cells in atherosclerosis development. Further, thrombospondin-1 (TSP1), a matricellular protein, and activation of its receptor cluster of differentiation (CD) 47 have been linked with atherosclerosis. However, the role of vascular SMC TSP1-CD47 signaling in regulating VSMC phenotype and atherogenesis remains unknown."
"Conversational repair has been proposed as a universal system for maintaining mutual understanding during social interactions. The repair system has been studied extensively in offline synchronous interactions (e.g., face-to-face, phone calls) and has been observed across cultures and languages. However, the prevalence of conversational repairs is unclear in online asynchronous text-based interactions. Online interactions are increasingly important for public deliberation, and it is therefore important to understand how conversational repairs manifest in different online contexts. To address this gap, we conducted two analyses of Other-initiated repairs in 25 English-language Reddit communities (subreddits), covering a diverse range of topics and communication norms. Analysis 1 examines the frequency of repair initiations across subreddits, finding them to be widespread (in every subreddit) and frequent (58.48% of interactions experience a repair initiation). Analysis 2 examines the emergence of repairs, finding that a repair initiation becomes increasingly likely the longer a comments thread progresses (Median time-to-repair = 6 turns). These results suggest that the prevalence and emergence of repair initiations in online interactions are comparable to offline contexts. However, we also find 44.80% of initiations receive no reply, precluding the possibility of a repair completion. Thus, conservatively, nearly half of the repair initiations in our data went uncompleted. This suggests that the online medium alters the way initiations are completed compared to offline interactions. We discuss the implications of this finding and avenues for future research."

"Peyronie's disease (PD) is a disorder characterized by fibrous plaque formation in the penile tissue that leads to curvature and complications in advanced stages. In this study, we aimed to compare four injectable induction agents for the establishment of a robust rat model of PD: transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), fibrin, sodium tetradecyl sulfate (STS) combined with TGF-β1, and polidocanol (POL) combined with TGF-β1. The results showed that injection of TGF-β1 or fibrin into the tunica albuginea induced pathological endpoints without causing penile curvature. The STS + TGF-β1 combination resulted in both histological and morphological alterations, but with a high incidence of localized necrosis that led to animal death. The POL + TGF-β1 combination produced pathological changes and curvature comparable to STS + TGF-β1 and led to fewer complications. In conclusion, fibrin, STS + TGF-β1, and POL + TGF-β1 all induced PD with a certain degree of penile curvature and histological fibrosis in rats. The POL + TGF-β1 combination offered comparatively greater safety and clinical relevance and may have the greatest potential for PD research using model rats."
"Sexual health communication between general practitioners (GPs) and individuals with chronic diseases is well documented as an important component of sexual well-being. However, a notable gap exists in understanding factors that contribute to sexual health communication in the endometriosis context. Endometriosis-related research has focused on the assessment of sexual functioning and its role in influencing health-related quality of life, with a limited understanding of the management of sexual well-being in primary healthcare settings."
"The clinical diagnosis of dermatophytosis and identification of dermatophytes face challenges due to reliance on culture-based methods. Rapid, cost-effective detection techniques for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have been developed for other microorganisms, but their application to dermatophytes is limited. This study explores using VOCs as diagnostic markers for dermatophytes. We compared VOC profiles across different dermatophyte taxa using solid-phase microextraction (SPME) and advanced analytical methods: gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC×GC-TOFMS). We analyzed 47 dermatophyte strains from 15 taxa grown on sheep wool, including clinically significant species. Additionally, we examined phylogenetic relationships among the strains to correlate genetic relatedness with metabolite production. Our results showed that GC×GC-TOFMS offered superior resolution but similar differentiation of VOC profiles compared to GC-MS. VOC spectra allowed reliable distinction of taxonomic units at the species level and below, however, these distinctions showed only a slight correlation with phylogenetic data. We identified pan-dermatophyte and species- or strain-specific VOC profiles, indicating their potential for rapid, non-invasive detection of dermatophyte infections, including epidemic strains. These patterns could enable future taxa-specific identification. Our study highlights the potential of VOCs as tools for dermatophyte taxonomy and diagnosis."
"Japanese guidelines recommend angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) as first-line therapy in hypertensive patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and proteinuria, but calcium channel blockers in patients with stage G4-5 CKD aged ≥75 years; however, the implementation of these guidelines in clinical practice is unclear. We investigated the actual use of these agents in this patient population. We conducted a cross-sectional study using the DeSC database, which includes anonymous information from various health insurance systems in Japan. A total of 34,362 hypertensive patients aged <75 years with CKD stage G1-G5 with urinary protein ≥1+ or aged ≥75 years with CKD stage G1-G3 with urinary protein ≥1+, for whom Japanese guidelines recommend first-line ARBs/ACEIs, were included in the analysis. Prescription rates of ARBs and ACEIs were calculated overall and separately for each age group and glomerular filtration rate category. The mean participant age was 65.8 ± 14.8 years, including 24,585 patients (72%) <75 years and 9777 (28%) ≥75 years. Of these, 9529 were prescribed ARBs/ACEIs (prescription rate 28%). The prescription rate was lower in patients aged <75 years with CKD stage G1-G5 (prescription rate 23%) compared with patients aged ≥75 years old with CKD stage G1-G3 (prescription rate 41%) (p < 0.001). Patients with CKD stage G1 had the lowest prescription rates for ARBs/ACEIs in both age categories. These results indicate that, despite guideline recommendations, ARBs/ACEIs are insufficiently prescribed for patients with hypertension associated with CKD with proteinuria. ARBs and ACEIs were only used in 28% of hypertensive patients aged<75 years (CKD stage G1-G5) or aged ⩾75 years (CKD stage G1-G3), with urinary protein ⩾1+, for whom Japanese guidelines recommend ARBs/ACEIs. The prescription rate was lower in the younger compared with the older patients."
"The increase in the population of immunocompromised patients due to advances in management of end-stage diseases and transplants poses challenges in treating infections caused by multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogens. Cefiderocol (FDC), a siderophore cephalosporin, has shown efficacy against carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria."
"Assessing the nutritional value of muscle food (MF) necessitates comprehensive component analysis. Traditional chemical analytical methods are often time-intensive, destructive, and environmentally detrimental, requiring specialized laboratory expertise. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) emerges as an innovative technique that effectively integrates spectral and spatial information to enable rapid, nondestructive, and multidimensional predictions of nutritional parameters in MF. This Review examines the cutting-edge advancements in HSI technology, elucidating its novel technical and methodological dimensions. It systematically explores the principles and methodologies of HSI, presenting recent research and diverse applications in predicting MF nutritional parameters, and evaluates HSI's significant advantages and current limitations while addressing field-specific challenges and prospective research trends, ultimately positioning HSI as a potentially transformative tool in ensuring meat industry quality and safety."
"Glioblastoma, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-wildtype is the most aggressive glioma with poor outcomes. The authors explored survival rates and factors associated with long-term survival in patients harboring a glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype."
"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells represent a novel targeted approach to overcome deficits in the ability of the host immune system to detect and subsequently eradicate tumors. The identification of antigens expressed specifically on the surface of tumor cells is a critical first step for a targeted therapy that selectively targets cancer cells without affecting normal tissues. 5T4 is a tumor-associated antigen expressed on the cell surface of most solid tumors. However, very little is known about its expression in hematologic malignancies. In this study, we assess the expression of 5T4 in different types of leukemias, specifically acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). We also provide an in vitro assessment of safety and efficacy of 5T4-targeting CAR T cells against HSCs and AML tumor cell lines. 5T4 expression was seen in about 50% of AML cases; AML with mutated nucleophosmin 1, AML-myelodysplasia-related, and AML not otherwise specified showed the highest percentage of 5T4+ cases. 5T4 CAR T cells efficiently and specifically killed AML tumor cell lines, including leukemic stem cells. Coculture of 5T4 CAR T cells with HSCs from healthy donors showed no impact on subsequent colony formation, thus confirming the safety profile of 5T4. A proof-of-concept study using a murine model for AML demonstrated that CAR T cells recognize 5T4 expressed on cells and can kill tumor cells both in vitro and in vivo. These results highlight 5T4 as a promising target for immune intervention in AML and that CAR T cells can be considered a powerful personalized therapeutic approach to treat AML."
"Ventricular septal defect (VSD) is a serious complication of myocardial infarction (MI), with its global incidence significantly reduced in recent years due to advances in coronary reperfusion techniques. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, there was an unexpected rise in the incidence of post-MI VSD, likely driven by delays in seeking treatment. This study retrospectively analyzed 10 cases of post-MI VSD treated at our hospitals from March 2018 to August 2023, comparing incidence rates across pre-pandemic, pandemic, and post-pandemic periods. The findings revealed a notable increase in VSD cases during the pandemic, with six cases occurring in two years, compared to only two cases in each of the pre-pandemic and post-pandemic periods. Despite these fluctuations, surgical intervention remained a crucial and effective treatment, with 60% of patients surviving the 30-day follow-up. The study underscores the impact of delayed treatment on VSD incidence during the pandemic and highlights the critical need for timely medical intervention to manage severe MI complications effectively."
"We aimed to systematically evaluate the clinical and radiological outcomes reported in comparative studies evaluating combined arthroscopic microfracture and mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) injection versus isolated microfracture for osteochondral lesions of the talus (OLT). A total of 5 studies were included. Demographics, American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score, Tegner activity scale score, Foot and Ankle Outcome Scale (FAOS), visual analogue scale (VAS), and Magnetic Resonance Observation of Cartilage Repair Tissue Score (MOCART) were analyzed. A total of 348 patients were evaluated, 171 of whom underwent combined microfracture and MSC injection and 177 of whom underwent isolated microfracture. The frequency-weighted mean ages were 38.9 ± 13.5 and 36.9 ± 11.4 years and the mean follow-up were 36.7 ± 13.3 and 36.2 ± 16.2 months in the combined microfracture and MSC injection and isolated microfracture groups, respectively. The combined microfracture and MSC injection group showed significantly better postoperative AOFAS score (81.5 ± 7.4 vs 68.2 ± 5.1, p < .001), and MOCART score (74.3 ± 16.3 vs 63.9 ± 15.5, p < .001) with differences beyond the minimum clinically important difference. The combination of arthroscopic microfracture and MSC injection significantly improved functionality and radiological outcomes compared to those of isolated microfracture for OLT."
"Primary aldosteronism (PA) and diabetes mellitus (DM) may coexist. We previously found that DM and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) may decrease the efficiency of the aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR) for screening PA. Thus, we wanted to determine appropriate ARR cut-off values for screening PA in patients with hypertension with DM and IGT. Data from 736 patients with hypertension were collected. They were divided into PA (77 cases), PA with DM (27 cases), PA with IGT (44 cases), hypertension without PA (353 cases), hypertension with DM (without PA, 127 cases), and hypertension with IGT (without PA, 108 cases). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to identify the appropriate ARR cut-off values in different conditions. Screening efficiencies of these cut-off values were evaluated across different groups. ARR cut-off values for screening PA in hypertensive patients without DM and IGT, with DM, and with IGT were 29.65, 23.15, and 26.9, respectively. All cut-off values demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity: 92.2% and 88.7%, 92.6% and 79.5%, and 88.6% and 85.2%, respectively, and areas under the ROC curves were 0.941, 0.904, and 0.909, respectively. Our results suggest that extra ARR cut-off values may be necessary for effective screening PA in hypertensive patients with DM and IGT, particularly in those with DM."
"Staphylococcus aureus has multiple mechanisms to evade the host's immune system and antibiotic treatment. One such mechanism is the invasion of the osteocyte lacuno-canalicular network (OLCN), which may be particularly important in recurrence of infection after debridement and antibiotic therapy. The aim of this study was to develop an ex vivo model to facilitate further study of S. aureus invasion of the OLCN and early-stage testing of antibacterial strategies against bacteria in this niche. The diameter of the canaliculi of non-infected human, sheep, and mouse bones was measured microscopically on Schmorl's picrothionin stained sections, showing a large overlap in canalicular diameter. S. aureus successfully invaded the OLCN in all species in vitro as revealed by presence in osteocyte lacunae in Brown and Brenn-stained sections and by scanning electron microscopy. Murine bones were then selected for further experiments, and titanium pins with either a wild-type or ΔPBP4 mutant S. aureus USA300 were placed trans-cortically and incubated for 2 weeks in tryptic soy broth. Wild-type S. aureus readily invaded the osteocyte lacunae in mouse bones while the ΔPBP4 showed a significantly lower invasion of the OLCN (p = 0.0005). Bone specimens were then treated with gentamicin, sitafloxacin, R14 bacteriophages, or left untreated. Gentamicin (p = 0.0027) and sitafloxacin (p = 0.0280) significantly reduced the proportion of S. aureus-occupied lacunae, whilst bacteriophage treatment had no effect. This study shows that S. aureus is able to invade the OLCN in an ex vivo model. This ex vivo model can be used for future early-stage studies before proceeding to in vivo studies."
"Several donor-specific factors influence the functional recovery and long-term outcomes of liver grafts. This study investigated the association between donor fasting glucose (DFG) and recipient outcomes after living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) in 950 cases at a single center. Patients were divided into two groups: low-DFG (< 85 mg/dL, n = 120) and control (≥ 85 mg/dL, n = 830). The five-year graft survival rate was significantly lower in the low-DFG group (71.5%) compared to the control group (80.0%) (P = 0.02). Multivariable Cox regression analysis showed that low DFG was independently associated with graft loss (hazard ratio 1.72, 95% CI 1.15-2.56, P = 0.008). In propensity score-matched groups, the low-DFG group also had lower survival rates (71% vs. 83.1%, P = 0.004). The presence of additional risk factors, such as low graft-to-recipient weight ratio, older donor age, and longer cold ischemic time, further reduced graft survival in the low-DFG group. A DFG level < 85 mg/dL is associated with higher risk of graft failure after LDLT, especially when combined with other risk factors. Low DFG should be considered a prognostic marker in LDLT planning, with potential to improve patient outcomes as further research clarifies the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms."
"The mammalian early embryo development requires translation of maternal mRNA inherited from the oocyte. While poly(A) tail length influences mRNA translation efficiency during the oocyte-to-embryo transition (OET), molecular mechanisms regulating maternal RNA poly(A) tail length are not fully understood. In this study, we identified MARTRE, a previously uncharacterized protein family (MARTRE1-MARTRE6), as regulators expressed during mouse OET that modulate poly(A) tail length. MARTRE inhibits deadenylation through the direct interaction with the deadenylase CCR4-NOT, and ectopic expression of Martre stabilized mRNA by attenuating poly(A) tail shortening. Deletion of the Martre gene locus results in shortened poly(A) tails and decreased translation efficiency of actively translated mRNAs in mouse zygotes, but does not affect maternal mRNA decay. MARTRE proteins thus fine-tune maternal mRNA translation by negatively regulating the deadenylating activity of CCR4-NOT. Moreover, Martre knockout embryos show delayed 2-cell stage progression and compromised preimplantation development. Together, our findings highlight protection of long poly(A) tails from active deadenylation as an important mechanism to coordinate translation of maternal mRNA."
"Studies have shown an association between the clinical severity of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and sociodemographic and clinical variables in older adults. However, few studies have described the explanatory factors of the relationship between these variables and the clinical severity of COVID-19 using structural equation modeling."
"Radiology departments are increasingly tasked with managing growing demands on services including long waitlists for scanning and interventional procedures, human health resource shortages, equipment needs, and challenges incorporating advanced imaging solutions. The burden of system inefficiencies and the overuse of ""low-value"" imaging causes downstream impact on patients at the individual level, the economy and healthcare system at the societal level, and planetary health at an overarching level. Low value imaging includes those performed for an inappropriate clinical indication, with little to no value to the management of the patient, and resulting in healthcare resource waste; it is estimated that up to a quarter of advanced imaging studies in Canada meet this criterion. Strategies to reduce low-value imaging include the development and use of referral guidelines, use of appropriateness criteria, optimization of existing protocols, and integration of clinical decision support tools into the ordering provider's workflow. Additional means of optimizing system efficiency such as centralized intake models, improved access to electronic medical records and outside imaging, enhanced communication with patients and referrers, and the utilization of artificial intelligence will further increase the value of radiology provided to patients and care providers."
"The perspectives and practices of healthcare professionals regarding ototoxicity in individuals with head and neck cancers are important for the implementation of ototoxicity monitoring. The current study aims to explore the oncologist's awareness and perspectives of ototoxicity and ototoxicity monitoring for individuals with head and neck cancer in a South-Indian district, using qualitative semi-structured interviews."
"Faecal samples were obtained from 77 first season grazers from 20 Norwegian dairy herds in autumn 2020 for analysis of Cooperia oncophora and Ostertagia ostertagi infection. Strongylid eggs per gram of faeces (EPG) were determined for each sample and the samples underwent larval culture. DNA was extracted from the faeces at different stages of the culture preparation: from faecal slurry (FS), direct extraction before culture (DBC), and direct extraction after culture (DAC). Extracted DNA was subject to molecular assay for both C. oncophora and O. ostertagi using both a published ddPCR assay and a modified qPCR duplex assay targeting the ITS-2 gene. For C. oncophora, DBC samples contained significantly less ITS-2 copies than DAC and FS samples (p ≤ 0.0001 for both) for qPCR, but not between DAC and FS samples (p = 0.339). Droplet digital PCR with DBC samples yielded significantly fewer ITS-2 copies than DAC and FS samples (p ≤ 0.0001). For O. ostertagi, the ITS-2 copies in DBC samples differed significantly from levels in DAC and FS samples on the qPCR platform (p=0.002 and 0.044, respectively) as was the case with ddPCR (p ≤ 0.0001 and 0.0137). Overall, across the various processing techniques, C. oncophora results obtained on both ddPCR and qPCR platforms correlated with EPG better than was found for equivalent results for O. ostertagi and results are strongly indicative of poor correlation when EPG counts are low. Results from this study suggest that DAC faecal processing was of limited practical use."
"The optimal definition and risk stratification approach to identify high-risk patients with prediabetes and stable coronary heart disease has not been well studied to date. The objective of the current study is to compare the prognostic value of different definitions of prediabetes, and to explore the role of ""very-high-risk"" (VHR) criteria according to the 2018 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology cholesterol guideline in the risk stratification of patients with prediabetes and stable coronary heart disease."
"Male infertility may influence fertilization rates, embryo morphology, and implantation rates in in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles. Oocyte competence plays a major role in embryo development, but there is a limited understanding of the connection between sperm quality, embryo development, and morphokinetic parameters using donor oocytes. The study evaluated if sperm quality may influence the morphokinetic parameters in IVF cycles."
"Loss and functional failure of pancreatic β-cells results in disruption of glucose homeostasis and progression of diabetes. Although whole pancreas or pancreatic islet transplantation serves as a promising approach for β-cell replenishment and diabetes therapy, the severe scarcity of donor islets makes it unattainable for most diabetic patients. Stem cells, particularly induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), are promising for the treatment of diabetes owing to their self-renewal capacity and ability to differentiate into functional β-cells. In this review, we first introduce the development of functional β-cells and their heterogeneity and then turn to highlight recent advances in the generation of β-cells from stem cells and their potential applications in disease modeling, drug discovery and clinical therapy. Finally, we have discussed the current challenges in developing stem cell-based therapeutic strategies for improving the treatment of diabetes. Although some significant technical hurdles remain, stem cells offer great hope for patients with diabetes and will certainly transform future clinical practice."
"Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) improve prognosis in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Nilotinib and ponatinib, second- and third-generation TKIs, respectively, have been reported to cause adverse vascular occlusive events such as myocardial infarction and peripheral arterial disease. However, little is known about the risk of cerebral infarction associated with severe cerebrovascular stenosis, which is a late complication of TKIs. Herein, we report two cases of cerebrovascular stenosis associated with TKIs for CML."
"The Mental Capacity Act 2005 in England and Wales and Singapore's Mental Capacity Act 2008 (which substantially transplants provisions from the former statute) might appear to be twins on paper, but they have gone on to lead very different lives. In this article, we examine how two broadly identical laws have taken on divergent identities within their respective jurisdictions when implemented and interpreted in the courtroom. We reveal and analyse differences in parliamentary intent concerning at what stage a person's decision-making agency is putatively empowered; judicial development of central concepts; underlying socio-cultural commitments; and outline opportunities for bi-directional learning in mental capacity law across both jurisdictions."
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are environmental contaminants that can cause a variety of health problems. This study sought to determine whether there was a relationship between PAHs and current asthma in adults.
To establish a formal diagnosis in infectious disease is not an easy task. Our aim was to characterize diagnostic uncertainty (DU) in patients for whom blood cultures were positive (PBC) and to determine its impact on both the antibiotic therapy and the outcome.
"Aromatase deficiency (ORPHA:91; OMIM: 613,546) is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder due to loss of function mutations in the CYP19A1 gene, described in both genders with an estimated incidence below 1/1000000. While in female the clinical manifestations generally occur at birth or in early infancy, and mainly involve sexual characteristics, in men clinical signs of aromatase deficiency mostly occur in puberty and especially in late puberty, so that diagnosis is generally established after the second decade due to tall stature, unfused epiphyses and reduced bone mass. Here we review the available information concerning the skeletal and extraskeletal phenotype and the clinical management of bone health in patients with aromatase CYP19A1 gene mutations."
"The Systemic Inflammation Response Index (SIRI), a marker used to assess systemic inflammation, is associated with lower patient survival rates in various cancer types. Factors contributing to the recurrence of colorectal cancer (CRC) have been examined previously using the preoperative SIRI. Herein, we investigated the association between the preoperative SIRI level and both the recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients diagnosed with CRC. We retrospectively analyzed the case of 406 patients who underwent curative surgery for Stage I-III CRC at a single institution during 2012- 2017. Based on their SIRI levels, we categorized the patients into a low-SIRI group (≤ 1700) and a high-SIRI group (> 1700). Multivariable analyses revealed that a high-SIRI level was an independent risk factor for 5-year RFS (p = 0.045) and OS (p = 0.048) in CRC patients. A Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated significantly poorer 5-year RFS and OS outcomes in the high-SIRI group compared to the low-SIRI group (p = 0.0001, p = 0.017 respectively). These findings suggest that the high-SIRI level is significantly associated with a poorer prognosis in patients diagnosed with CRC."
"COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has spread globally, presenting a significant public health challenge. Vaccination has played a critical role in reducing severe disease and deaths. However, the waning of immunity after vaccination and the emergence of immune-escape variants require the continuation of vaccination efforts, including booster doses, to maintain population immunity. This study models the dynamics of COVID-19 in the Basque Country, Spain, aiming to characterize the population's immunity profile and assess its impact on the severity of outbreaks from 2020 to 2022."
"Radiation protection in dental radiography can be achieved by adjusting the image field size, exposure, and filtration parameters, and using protective lead shields. The aim of this study is to assess the radiation dose delivered to the thyroid in a phantom irradiated by an orthopantomogram (OPG) system using Geant4 simulation toolkit. Recently, researchers have been trying to find an alternative material to the lead thyroid shield so that the OPG image has minimal metal artifacts. In this study, several materials were introduced as alternatives to lead thyroid shields. The results showed that Pb, Bi, Bi2O3, stainless steel, polyurethane-Bi2O3 (50%-50% mixture), and polyurethane-W (50%-50% mixture) shields provide a thyroid dose reduction of up to 12.0%, 12.3%, 12.0%, 11.6%, 11.8%, and 12.0%, respectively. For the truncated thyroid shields, these values are up to 10.5%, 10.3%, 10.3%, 9.80%, 10.0%, and 10.1%, respectively. Therefore, Bi and Bi2O3 can be suitable alternatives to lead thyroid shields."
"Vascular calcification is highly prevalent and associated with mortality in hemodialysis patients. However, extreme splanchnic arterial calcification in calciphylaxis with poor prognosis raises questions regarding the reliability of previous vascular calcification scoring methods. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the distribution characteristics of abdominal aortic branch calcification and identify a more reliable predictor of mortality in hemodialysis patients."
"Fungal keratitis (FK) usually develops to a poor clinical prognosis due to the fungal invasion and excessive inflammatory reaction. In order to enhance the therapeutic effect of natamycin (NAT), we used the anti-inflammatory biological polysaccharide bletilla striata polysaccharide (BSP) combined with NAT to prepare a new eye drop -- oxidized bletilla striata polysaccharide-natamycin (OBN)."
"We have shown that men aged 50 years+ at high risk of type 2 diabetes treated with testosterone together with a lifestyle program reduced the risk of type 2 diabetes at 2 years by 40% compared to a lifestyle program alone. To develop a personalized approach to treatment, we aimed to explore a prognostic model for incident type 2 diabetes at 2 years and investigate biomarkers predictive of the testosterone effect."
"The unprecedented loss of global biodiversity is linked to multiple anthropogenic stressors. New conservation technologies are urgently needed to mitigate this loss. The rights, knowledge and perspectives of Indigenous peoples in biodiversity conservation-including the development and application of new technologies-are increasingly recognised. Advances in germplasm cryopreservation and germ cell transplantation (termed 'broodstock surrogacy') techniques offer exciting tools to preserve biodiversity, but their application has been underappreciated. Here, we use teleost fishes as an exemplar group to outline (1) the power of these techniques to preserve genome-wide genetic diversity, (2) the need to apply a conservation genomic lens when selecting individuals for germplasm cryobanking and broodstock surrogacy and (3) the value of considering the cultural significance of these genomic resources. We conclude by discussing the opportunities and challenges of these techniques for conserving biodiversity in threatened teleost fish and beyond."
"The objective of this study was to determine the nomenclature for friction knots commonly used by veterinary surgeons. Veterinary surgeons certified by the American College of Veterinary Surgeons (ACVS) or the European College of Veterinary Surgeons (ECVS) were recruited through email listings available on the websites of veterinary schools and the ACVS to participate in a survey on this subject. Participation was also solicited through the ACVS Facebook page, the Society of Veterinary Soft Tissue Surgery, and the Veterinary Orthopedic Society. The survey included questions about 4 knot-tying videos. Complete responses were received from 160 veterinary surgeons. Familiarity with the knots ranged from 26% (constrictor knot) to 54% (miller's knot). The modified miller's knot and the miller's knot were correctly named by a majority of surgeons (61% and 63%, respectively). There was no consensus for the constrictor knot, with the greatest number of respondents identifying it as the constrictor knot (38%) or the miller's knot (31%). There was also no consensus for the strangle knot, with respondents split among identifying it as the miller's knot (39%), modified miller's knot (34%), or strangle knot (21%). There is apparent disagreement on the names of surgical friction knots among veterinary surgeons. Many participants indicated that they were not familiar with the knots demonstrated in the videos. Inconsistent terminology may impede educational efforts and hinder clear communication about types of knots."
To examine microscopically the distribution of the lymphatic channels in comparison with the blood vessels in the upper eyelid.
"During development, cells undergo a sequence of specification events to form functional tissues and organs. To investigate complex tissue development, it is crucial to visualize how cell lineages emerge and to be able to manipulate regulatory factors with temporal control. We recently developed TEMPO (Temporal Encoding and Manipulation in a Predefined Order), a genetic tool to label with different colors and genetically manipulate consecutive cell generations in vertebrates. TEMPO relies on CRISPR to activate a cascade of fluorescent proteins which can be imaged in vivo. Here, we explain the steps to design, generate, and express TEMPO constructs in zebrafish and mice."
"Accurate and fast extraction of step parameters from video recordings of gait allows for richer information to be obtained from clinical tests such as Timed Up and Go. Current deep-learning methods are promising, but lack in accuracy for many clinical use cases. Extracting step parameters will often depend on extracted landmarks (keypoints) on the feet. We hypothesize that such keypoints can be determined with an accuracy relevant for clinical practice from video recordings by combining an existing general-purpose pose estimation method (OpenPose) with custom convolutional neural networks (convnets) specifically trained to identify keypoints on the heel. The combined method finds keypoints on the posterior and lateral aspects of the heel of the foot in side-view and frontal-view images from which step length and step width can be determined for calibrated cameras. Six different candidate convnets were evaluated, combining three different standard architectures as networks for feature extraction (backbone), and with two different networks for predicting keypoints on the heel (head networks). Using transfer learning, the backbone networks were pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, and the combined networks (backbone + head) were fine-tuned on data from 184 trials of older, unimpaired adults. The data was recorded at three different locations and consisted of 193 k side-view images and 110 k frontal-view images. We evaluated the six different models using the absolute distance on the floor between predicted keypoints and manually labelled keypoints. For the best-performing convnet, the median error was 0.55 cm and the 75% quartile was below 1.26 cm using data from the side-view camera. The predictions are overall accurate, but show some outliers. The results indicate potential for future clinical use by automating a key step in marker-less gait parameter extraction."
"With increasing prevalence of obesity and cardiovascular diseases, there is a growing interest in the use of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) as an adjunct therapy in type 1 diabetes (T1D). The GLP-1RAs are currently not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of T1D in the absence of randomized controlled trials documenting efficacy and safety of these agents in this population. The Diabetes Technology Society convened a series of three consensus meetings of clinicians and researchers with expertise in diabetes technology, GLP-1RA therapy, and T1D management. The project was aimed at synthesizing current literature and providing conclusions on the use of GLP-1RA therapy as an adjunct to automated insulin delivery (AID) systems in adults with T1D. The expert panel members met virtually three times on January 17, 2024, and April 24, 2024, and August 14, 2024, to discuss topics ranging from physiology and outcomes of GLP-1RAs in T1D to limitations of current sensors, algorithms, and insulin for AID systems. The panelists also identified research gaps and future directions for research. The panelists voted to in favor of 31 recommendations. This report presents the consensus opinions of the participants that, in adults with T1D using AID systems, GLP-1RAs have the potential to (1) provide effective adjunct therapy and (2) improve glycemic and metabolic outcomes without increasing the risk of severe hypoglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis."
"The authors assessed the feasibility, acceptability, and impact on cancer worry of a cancer screening program using multicancer early detection (MCED) tests and whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (WBM) in individuals at high cancer risk because of family history or germline variants in cancer-susceptibility genes."
"The limited water solubility of active compounds remains a significant challenge for efficient dermal drug delivery, particularly for BCS class IV drugs such as curcumin. This study aimed to enhance curcumin's dermal penetration using two strategies: extracellular vesicles (EVs) and plantCrystals derived from soybeans. EVs were isolated using classical methods. However, plantCrystals containing extracellular vesicles (PCEVs) were formed during the preparation of plantCrystals through bead milling. Curcumin was either added after PCEVs were formed, resulting in curcumin-added PCEVs, or added to the soybean dispersion before bead milling, forming curcumin-loaded PCEVs. The formulations were characterized for their physicochemical properties and assessed for dermal penetration efficacy using quantitative dermatokinetic and semi-quantitative ex vivo porcine ear models. The results indicated that curcumin-loaded PCEVs achieved higher penetration efficacy compared to curcumin-added PCEVs and curcumin-loaded EVs, with approximately 1.5-fold and 2.7-fold increases in penetration efficacy, respectively. Additionally, curcumin-loaded PCEVs showed superior penetration depth, while curcumin from the curcumin-loaded EVs remained in the stratum corneum. These findings suggest that the plantCrystals strategy via bead milling offers a more effective approach than the classical EVs strategy for improving the topical delivery of class IV drugs like curcumin."
"Simulations are an essential tool in all areas of population genetic research, used in tasks such as the validation of theoretical analysis and the study of complex evolutionary models. Forward-in-time simulations are especially flexible, allowing for various types of natural selection, complex genetic architectures, and non-Wright-Fisher dynamics. However, their intense computational requirements can be prohibitive to simulating large populations and genomes. A popular method to alleviate this burden is to scale down the population size by some scaling factor while scaling up the mutation rate, selection coefficients, and recombination rate by the same factor. However, this rescaling approach may in some cases bias simulation results. To investigate the manner and degree to which rescaling impacts simulation outcomes, we carried out simulations with different demographic histories and distributions of fitness effects using several values of the rescaling factor, Q, and compared the deviation of key outcomes (fixation times, allele frequencies, linkage disequilibrium, and the fraction of mutations that fix during the simulation) between the scaled and unscaled simulations. Our results indicate that scaling introduces substantial biases to each of these measured outcomes, even at small values of Q. Moreover, the nature of these effects depends on the evolutionary model and scaling factor being examined. While increasing the scaling factor tends to increase the observed biases, this relationship is not always straightforward; thus, it may be difficult to know the impact of scaling on simulation outcomes a priori. However, it appears that for most models, only a small number of replicates was needed to accurately quantify the bias produced by rescaling for a given Q. In summary, while rescaling forward-in-time simulations may be necessary in many cases, researchers should be aware of the rescaling procedure's impact on simulation outcomes and consider investigating its magnitude in smaller scale simulations of the desired model(s) before selecting an appropriate value of Q."
"Extraskeletal osteosarcoma (ESOS) is a very rare malignant tumor. This study aimed to provide more evidence about the natural history and clinical features of ESOS, and clarify the impact of chemotherapy (CT) and radiotherapy (RT) on patient survival and postoperative recurrence for the sake of gaining a better understanding about the disease. Patient/tumor characteristics, recurrence, treatment, and follow-up durations were collected by searching studies in PubMed, Web of Science, Ovid, Elsevier, SpringerLink, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and WAN FANG Data before June 30, 2023. Data were analyzed by SPSS-26. Altogether 1287 patients diagnosed with ESOS were retrieved from the literature. Of them, follow-up data were available in 981 patients, in whom 78 patients (7.6%) had metastases and 730 patients (74.5%) had localized disease at the time of diagnosis. Of the 730 patients with localized disease, 682 (93.4%) received surgical resection. The 5-year OS in all 981 patients, 78 metastatic patients, and 682 patients with localized disease was 33.40%, 4.9% and 41.1%, respectively. Of the 682 surgical patients, 367 patients underwent surgical resection alone, 170 received surgical resection + CT, 82 patients received surgical resection + RT, and 58 patients received both adjuvants. In addition, 348 (51%) of the 682 patients developed recurrence, including local recurrence (n = 102), metastasis (n = 130), and both (n = 116). Univariate analysis of 5-year PFS and 5-year OS showed that age, tumor size, CT, metastasis, and local recurrence were significant prognostic factors in the 682 patients with localized disease. There was no significant difference in 5-year OS between osteosarcoma-type and soft tissue-type regimens (P = 0.273). Multivariate analysis of 431 patients showed that postoperative recurrence and metastasis were significant prognostic factors for survival, and CT was not a significant prognostic factor, though CT decreased the incidence of local recurrence in ≤ 45-year age group (P = 0.047). RT reduced the incidence of local recurrence in patients ≤ 45years (P = 0.035) and patients with tumors > 5 cm (P = 0.044). So, we recommend that CT should be used for patients aged ≤ 45years, and RT can be used for patients ≤ 45years or those with tumors > 5 cm for the sake of decreasing the incidence of local recurrence, which we believe would indirectly benefit the survival of ESOS patients."
"Solitude is a common experience that can elicit both positive (e.g., relaxation) and negative (e.g., loneliness) emotions. But can changing the way we think about solitude improve its emotional effects? In a previous study, our team found that positively reframing solitude buffers against a reduction in positive affect when alone. Yet, it is unknown whether people who are lonely-and thus more likely to experience solitude negatively-benefit from modifying their beliefs about being alone."
"The European Chemical Biology Database (ECBD, https://ecbd.eu) serves as the central repository for data generated by the EU-OPENSCREEN research infrastructure consortium. It is developed according to FAIR principles, which emphasize findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability of data. This data is made available to the scientific community following open access principles. The ECBD stores both positive and negative results from the entire chemical biology project pipeline, including data from primary or counter-screening assays. The assays utilize a defined and diverse library of over 107 000 compounds, the annotations of which are continuously enriched by external user supported screening projects and by internal EU-OPENSCREEN bioprofiling efforts. These compounds were screened in 89 currently deposited datasets (assays), with 48 already being publicly accessible, while the remaining will be published after a publication embargo period of up to 3 years. Together these datasets encompass ∼4.3 million experimental data points. All public data within ECBD can be accessed through its user interface, API or by database dump under the CC-BY 4.0 license."
"Proteome profiling of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens has gained traction for the analysis of cancer tissue for the discovery of molecular biomarkers. However, reports so far focused on single cancer entities, comprised relatively few cases and did not assess the long-term performance of experimental workflows. In this study, we analyze 1220 tumors from six cancer entities processed over the course of three years. Key findings include the need for a new normalization method ensuring equal and reproducible sample loading for LC-MS/MS analysis across cohorts, showing that tumors can, on average, be profiled to a depth of >4000 proteins and discovering that current software fails to process such large ion mobility-based online fractionated datasets. We report the first comprehensive pan-cancer proteome expression resource for FFPE material comprising 11,000 proteins which is of immediate utility to the scientific community, and can be explored via a web resource. It enables a range of analyses including quantitative comparisons of proteins between patients and cohorts, the discovery of protein fingerprints representing the tissue of origin or proteins enriched in certain cancer entities."
"Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRBs) and dissimilatory iron-reducing bacteria (DIRBs) are recognized as significant contributors to the occurrence of elevated arsenic (As) levels in groundwater. However, the precise effects and underlying mechanisms of their interactions on As behavior within sediments remain poorly understood. In this investigation, we compared the impacts and mechanisms of DIRBs, SRBs, and mixed bacterial consortia on the migration behavior of As and Fe/S species. Our findings revealed that during the initial phase of the reaction (0-8 days, Stage 1), the mixed bacterial consortium facilitated As release by intensifying the reduction of Fe (III) and sulfate, resulting in a maximum As concentration 1.5 times higher than that observed with either DIRBs or SRBs in isolation. Subsequently, in the intermediate phase (8-20 days, Stage 2), the mixed consortium suppressed the synthesis of sulfate reductase and the secretion of toxic substances (e.g., o-Methyltoluene) associated with steroid degradation pathways. This inhibition consequently reduced the formation of secondary Fe minerals and the fixation of As. Finally, in the latter stage (20-30 days, Stage 3), the system responded to the threat of toxic substances by secreting significant amounts of organic acids to facilitate their decomposition. However, this process also led to the re-decomposition of iron oxides, resulting in the release of As. These observations shed light on the intricate interplay between DIRBs and SRBs within bacterial consortia, elucidating their coordinated actions in inducing the migration and transformation of arsenic."
"There are multiple surgical approaches for treating symptomatic simple renal cysts (SSRCs). The natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) approach has gradually been applied as an emerging minimally invasive approach for the treatment of SSRCs. However, there are no clear indicators for selecting the NOTES approach for patients with SSRCs. We aimed to investigate the preoperative clinical determinants that influence the selection of the NOTES approach in patients with SSRCs and to construct a prediction model to assist the surgeons in selecting the NOTES approach."

"Germination is an essential phenomenon in the life cycle of plants, and a variety of external and internal factors influence it. Fire and the produced smoke have been vital environmental stimulants for the germination of seeds in many plant species, like Leucospermum cordifolium and Serruria florida. These plants do not germinate at all if fire and smoke are not present. This phenomenon of germination in plant species has existed in the ecosystem since ancient times. Various studies to study the response of seeds to smoke and its extracts have been undertaken for stimulation of germination by burning various plant materials and bubbling the smoke produced through water. The application of plant-derived smoke and smoke water is well known for promoting germination, breaking dormancy, and checking abiotic stress. This significantly indicates that plant-derived smoke contains some bioactive metabolites responsible for the physiological metabolism of seed germination and is involved in enhancing seed vigor. The present review deals with the ancient use of smoke and smoke extracts for seed priming, the cost-efficient method of its preparation, the mode of action of karrikins relating to its perception by plants, and its significant effects on various crops, including its ability to check biotic and abiotic stresses."
"The upgrade of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) in Grenoble, France to an Extremely Brilliant Source (EBS) is expected to enable time-resolved synchrotron serial crystallography (SSX) experiments with sub-millisecond time resolution. ID29 is a new beamline dedicated to SSX experiments at ESRF-EBS. Here, we report experiments emerging from the initial phase of user operation at ID29. We first used microcrystals of photoactive yellow protein as a model system to exploit the potential of microsecond pulses for SSX. Subsequently, we investigated microcrystals of cytochrome c nitrite reductase (ccNiR) with microsecond X-ray pulses. CcNiR is a decaheme protein that is ideal for the investigation of radiation damage at the various heme-iron sites. Finally, we performed a proof-of-concept subsecond time-resolved SSX experiment by photoactivating microcrystals of a myxobacterial phytochrome."
"Glucosylceramidase beta 1 (GBA1) mutations are a genetic risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD), though most carriers do not develop the disease.

"Chronic pain affects approximately 1.5 billion people worldwide, representing the leading cause of disability and a significant financial burden on healthcare systems. Conventional treatments, such as opioids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, are frequently linked to adverse effects, including dependency and gastrointestinal issues, and often offer limited long-term relief. This review explores the potential of psychedelics, including psilocybin, LSD, and ketamine, as alternative therapeutic agents in chronic pain management."
"Primary acquired nasolacrimal duct obstruction (PANDO) is a condition in which tear ducts are blocked, leading to epiphora and dacryocystitis. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to measure the ability of transcanalicular dacryocystorhinostomy (TC-DCR) as an alternative approach to PANDO compared to traditional external dacryocystorhinostomy (EX-DCR)."
"Both minimal change disease (MCD) and focal segmental glomerular sclerosis (FSGS) are the pathological types of primary nephrotic syndrome (PNS) and cannot be readily distinguished owing to their highly similar clinical presentations. Currently, methods for clinical MCD and FSGS diagnosis still rely on invasive renal biopsy which impede rapid and accurate diagnosis for timely treatment management. In this study, a novel diagnostic strategy by introducing the dyes with spironolactone structure into the metal-organic cage to construct three dye@MOCs composites has been developed and employed as fluorescence sensor array for assisting in the auxiliary differential diagnosis of MCD and FSGS based on the distinguishable biothiols in urine. Through the statistical analysis technique for the interpretation of response patterns, the weak fluorescent of dye@MOCs sensor array exhibited unique patterns of fluorescence enhancement when biothiols appeared, forming the unique ""off-on"" sensor array. Additionally, dye@MOCs sensor array exhibited excellent selectivity and good stability, indicating their potentially actual applications. Outstandingly, as an important example, it was demonstrated for the first time that dye@MOCs sensor array can be applied to the auxiliary differential diagnosis of MCD and FSGS patients based on the differentiable biothiols level in urine using non-invasively methods, potentially avoiding invasive renal biopsy diagnosis and overcoming the limitations of conventional urine examinations, illustrating its potential applications in the auxiliary differential diagnosis and research of related diseases in the forthcoming era. And moreover, this opens new avenues for reliable disease auxiliary diagnosis and differentiation, setting a new benchmark for accuracy and reliability in medical assessments."
"Pharmacists nationwide may play a critical role in expanding naloxone access after several states enacted legislation to allow pharmacist prescribing of opioid antagonists. This created a unique opportunity for inpatient pharmacists to participate in combating the opioid epidemic by prescribing naloxone at hospital discharge. A multifaceted intervention was developed to identify and educate hospitalized patients eligible for naloxone prescribing. After implementation, 22 of 40 eligible patients (55 percent) were prescribed naloxone by inpatient pharmacists during the 3-month study period. With this pharmacist-driven intervention, there was an 848 percent increase in the number of hospitalized chronic opioid patients with naloxone prescriptions on discharge."
"Effective plant defense against pathogens relies on highly coordinated regulation of immune gene expression. Enhancers, as cis-regulatory elements, are indispensable determinants of dynamic gene regulation, but the molecular functions in plant immunity are not well understood. In this study, we identified a novel enhancer, CORE PATTERN-INDUCED ENHANCER 35 (CPIE35), which is rapidly activated upon pathogenic elicitation and negatively regulates antifungal resistance through modulating WRKY15 expression. During immune activation, CPIE35 activates the transcription of WRKY15 by forming chromatin loops with the promoter of WRKY15 in a WRKY18/40/60-, WRKY33-, and MYC2-dependent manner. WRKY15 directly binds to the promoters of PAD3 and GSTU4, suppressing their expression and leading to reduced camalexin synthesis and resistance. Interestingly, CPIE35 region is evolutionarily conserved among Brassicaceae plants, and the CPIE35-WRKY15 module exerts similar functions in Brassica napus to negatively regulate antifungal resistance. Our work reveals the ""enhancer-promoter-transcription factor"" regulatory mechanism in maintenance of immune homeostasis, highlighting the importance and conserved role of enhancers in fine-tuning immune gene expression in plants."
"The 2024 Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections featured new and impactful findings about neuropsychiatric complications in people with HIV and other infections. Reports included new evidence from low- and middleincome countries, HIV persistence in the central nervous system, aging-related complications (including cerebrovascular disease), additional data relevant to pathogenesis, and therapeutics. Also included were new evidence of active HIV RNA transcription in cells from cerebrospinal fluid and the brain during virally suppressive antiretroviral therapy as well as links between neuropsychiatric complications or brain imaging findings in people with HIV and a) carotid artery inflammation and cerebrovascular disease, b) Alzheimer's disease genetic risk, c) social determinants of health, including exposure to pollution, and d) epigenetic aging. New therapeutic findings were presented on the cerebrospinal fluid inhibitory quotient, the effects of polypharmacy, and clinical trials of tesamorelin and telmisartan. This review summarizes these and other new findings and highlights new research directions for the neuro-HIV field."
"Particles, ranging from submicron to nanometer scale, can be broadly categorized into biological and non-biological types. Submicron-to-nanoscale bioparticles include various bacteria, viruses, liposomes, and exosomes. Non-biological particles cover various inorganic, metallic, and carbon-based particles. The effective manipulation of these submicron to nanoparticles, including their separation, sorting, enrichment, assembly, trapping, and transport, is a fundamental requirement for different applications. Acoustofluidics, owing to their distinct advantages, have emerged as a potent tool for nanoparticle manipulation over the past decade. Although recent literature reviews have encapsulated the evolution of acoustofluidic technology, there is a paucity of reports specifically addressing the acoustical manipulation of submicron to nanoparticles. This article endeavors to provide a comprehensive study of this topic, delving into the principles, apparatus, and merits of acoustofluidic manipulation of submicron to nanoparticles, and discussing the state-of-the-art developments in this technology. The discourse commences with an introduction to the fundamental theory of acoustofluidic control and the forces involved in nanoparticle manipulation. Subsequently, the working mechanism of acoustofluidic manipulation of submicron to nanoparticles is dissected into two parts, dominated by the acoustic wave field and the acoustic streaming field. A critical analysis of the advantages and limitations of different acoustofluidic platforms in nanoparticles control is presented. The article concludes with a summary of the challenges acoustofluidics face in the realm of nanoparticle manipulation and analysis, and a forecast of future development prospects."

"A growing literature within the field of air pollution exposure assessment addresses the issue of environmental justice. Leveraging the increasing availability of exposure datasets with broad spatial coverage and high spatial resolution, a number of works have assessed inequalities in exposure across racial/ethnic and other socioeconomic groupings. However, environmental justice research presents the additional need to evaluate exposure inequity-inequality that is systematic, unfair, and avoidable-which may be framed in several ways. We discuss these framings and describe inequality and inequity conclusions provided from several contrasting approaches drawn from recent work. We recommend that future work addressing environmental justice interventions include complementary ""Exposure-driven"" and ""Socially weighted"" metrics, taking an intersectional view of areas and social groups that are both disproportionately impacted by pollution and are impacted by additional health risks resulting from structural racism and consider implications for environmental justice beyond distributional equity."

"The incidence of head impacts in rugby has been a growing concern for player safety. While rugby headgear shows potential to mitigate head impact intensity during laboratory simulations, evaluating its on-field effectiveness is challenging. Current rugby-specific laboratory testing methods may not represent on-field conditions. This study aimed to create a machine-learning model capable of matching head impacts recorded via wearable sensors to the nearest match in a pre-existing library of laboratory-simulated head impacts for further investigation. Separate random forest models were trained, and optimised, on a training dataset of laboratory head impact data to predict the impact location, impact surface angle, neck inclusion, and drop height of a given laboratory head impact. The models achieved hold-out test set accuracies of 0.996, 1.0, 0.998, and 0.96 for the impact location, neck inclusion, impact surface angle, and drop height respectively. When applied to a male and female youth rugby head impact dataset, most impacts were classified as being to the side or rear of the head, with very few at the front of the head. Nearly 80% were more similar to laboratory impacts that included the neck with an impact surface angled at 30 or 45° with just under 20% being aligned with impacts onto a flat impact surface, and most were classified as low drop height impacts (7.5-30cm). Further analysis of the time series kinematics and spatial brain strain resulting from impact is required to align the laboratory head impact testing with the on-field conditions."
"Thyroid hormones play an important morphogenetic role during the fetal and neonatal periods and regulate numerous metabolic processes. In the central nervous system, they control myelination and overall brain development, regional gene expression, and regulation of oxygen consumption. Their deficiency in the fetal and neonatal periods causes severe mental retardation, due to lack of thyroid function, or to iodine deficiency. At the same time, nitric oxide is an atypical neurotransmitter that also has special relevance in neuronal development and plasticity and functions as a vasodilator, regulating cerebral blood flow. Although under physiological conditions it functions as a neuroprotector, in excess it can be neurotoxic. We have studied, by immunocytochemical and Western blot techniques, the evolution of the expression of neuronal and inducible isoforms of the enzyme nitric oxide synthase, and of nitrotyrosine as a marker of protein nitration produced by the presence of nitric oxide, during the early stages of postnatal brain development. We induced hypothyroidism by administering mercaptomethylimidazole to pregnant mothers, from the seventh day of gestation until the sacrifice of the offspring. The results show a delay in the evolution of the expression of the two isoforms of the enzyme nitric oxide synthase in hypothyroid animals, followed by an anomalous overexpression in later stages. Finally, the expression of nitrotyrosine follows an evolution that is synchronized with that shown by both isoenzymes in control and hypothyroid animals."
"Systolic blood pressure (SBP) time in target (TTR) over months were associated with lower risk of adverse clinical outcomes in hypertensive patients, whether short-term of 24-h SBP TTR was effective in predicting heart failure (HF) risk in the general population remained unclear. This prospective study aimed to investigate the association of 24-h SBP TTR with HF in the real-world settings. Based on Kailuan study, 24-h SBP target range defined as 110-140 mmHg was calculated with linear interpolation. Among 5152 participants included in the analysis, 186 (3.61%) cases of incident HF occurred during a median follow-up of 6.96 years. Compared with participants with SBP TTR of 0 to <25%, those with TTR of 75% to 100% had 47% lower risk of HF (hazard ratio [HR], 0.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.32-0.89). The restricted spline curve depicted an inverse relationship between SBP TTR and incident HF. Additionally, the addition of SBP TTR, rather than mean SBP and SBP variation, to a conventional risk model had an incremental effect on the predictive value for HF, with integrated discrimination improvement value of 0.31% (P = 0.0003) and category-free net reclassification improvement value of 19.79% (P = 0.0081). Higher SBP TTR was associated with a lower risk of incident HF. Efforts to attain SBP within 110 to 140 mmHg may be an effective strategy to prevent HF."

"Cancer-targeted therapies are progressively pivotal in oncological care. Observational studies underscore the emergence of cancer therapy-related cardiovascular toxicity (CTR-CVT), impacting patient outcomes. We aimed to investigate the causal relationship between different types of cancer-targeted therapies and cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes through a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study."
"Pollen, a pivotal stage in the plant reproductive cycle, is highly sensitive to temperature fluctuations, impacting seed quality and quantity. While the importance of understanding pollen temperature limits (Tmin, Topt, Tmax - collectively PTLs) is recognized, a comprehensive synthesis of underlying drivers is lacking. Here, we examined PTLs, correlating them with vegetative tissue thermotolerance and assessing variability at the intra- and interspecific levels across 191 species with contrasting phylogeny, cultivation history, growth form and ecology. At the species level, the PTLs range from 9.0 to 42.4°C, with considerable differences among individual species. Vegetative tissue showed greater tolerance to both low and high temperatures than pollen. A significant, though weak, correlation was observed between PTLs and leaf temperature tolerance. Pollen heat tolerance was independent of that in leaves and stems. The greatest intraspecific variability was observed in pollen cold tolerance (Tmin), followed by Topt and Tmax. Phylogenetic analysis revealed family-level conservation in all three pollen temperature tolerance measures. Climate emerged as a significant PTL driver of pollen cold tolerance, with species from colder and stable climates exhibiting enhanced cold tolerance. Cultivated and wild species did not differ in their pollen temperature tolerances. Herbaceous plants showed higher tolerance to high temperatures compared to shrubs and trees, potentially reflecting divergent thermal conditions during anthesis. This study provides the first formal analysis of complex relationships between pollen temperature limits, plant characteristics and environmental factors, providing crucial insights into climate change impacts on plant reproduction."

"The neonatal period is a critical phase for the development of the intestinal immune system, marked by rapid adaptation to the external environment and unique nutritional demands. Breast milk plays a pivotal role in this transition, yet the mechanisms by which it influences neonatal mucosal immunity remain unclear. This review examines the potential mechanisms by which cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in breast milk may impact neonatal immune development, particularly through Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) signalling and gut microbiota interactions. We propose that cfDNA in breast milk interacts with TLR9 on the apical surface of neonatal intestinal epithelial cells, potentially serving as an initial anti-inflammatory stimulus before the establishment of commensal bacteria. This hypothesis is supported by the high concentration and stability of cfDNA in breast milk, as well as the known activation of TLR9 by mitochondrial DNA in breast milk. The review emphasises the need for further empirical research to validate these interactions and their implications for neonatal health, suggesting that understanding these dynamics could lead to improved strategies for neonatal care and disease prevention."

"Maximal isometric contraction time (MICT) is critical for most motor tasks and depends on skeletal muscle blood flow at < 40% of maximal voluntary strength (MVC). Whether limb work positions associated with reduced perfusion pressure and facilitated vessel compression affect MICT is largely unknown. In 14 healthy young men we therefore assessed bilateral handgrip MICT at 15, 20, 30, 40, and 70% of MVC in horizontal forearm positions of 0.0, + 27.5 or - 27.5 cm relative to heart level. Forearm blood flow (FBF, venous occlusion plethysmography) and brachial blood pressure were measured repetitively. MICT at 15% MVC was significantly shorter by 66.3 and 86.2 s with forearm position + 27.5 cm (389.6 ± 23.3 s) as compared to 0.0 cm (455.9 ± 34.1 s) and - 27.5 cm (475.8 ± 35.0 s) while MICT at 20-70% MVC was unaffected. Peak FBF at 15% MVC was significantly lower in position + 27.5 cm (11.11 ± 0.92 ml/min/100 ml) compared to 0.0 cm (15.55 ± 0.91 ml/min/100 ml) or - 27.5 cm (14.21 ± 0.59 ml/min/100 ml) and vascular resistance significantly higher in position + 27.5 vs 0.0 or - 27.5 cm. Working position above, but not below heart level may limit MICT at 15% MVC possibly through blood flow reduction arising from increased vascular resistance beside reduced perfusion pressure. Local isometric endurance warrants (re)evaluation regarding hydrostatic/gravitational or other hemodynamic limitations."
"Attentional focus strategies, especially external focus, are associated with improvements in mechanisms of postural control. This can be important in reducing sports injuries in practices such as running, which has seen an increase in adherence. However, the impacts of these strategies on postural control in runners are unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effects of internal and external focus strategies on postural control performance with different bases of support tasks in runners. A total of 19 young adults (18-38 years old) were divided into a running group (n = 9) and a control group (n = 10). Posturography tests were performed on stable and unstable surfaces, under control, and internal and external focus conditions. The distance, mean velocity, and total velocity of the center of pressure were analyzed (p ≤ .05). There was a reduction in oscillation under external focus compared to internal and control conditions, as well as under internal focus compared to the control condition. A Group × Surface × Focus interaction for the variables distance and mean velocity in the mediolateral direction was found only for the control group. However, no significant effects were found between groups for postural control performance. Attentional focus strategies were able to reduce postural sway, with external focus condition being the most effective. Practitioners can benefit from these strategies to increase postural control performance to help reduce the number of injuries and improve sports performance. It is speculated that the effects of attentional control strategies on postural control may differ depending on the specific adaptations of each sport."
"Value-based care models are health care economic frameworks that aim to prioritize and financially incentivize quality of care, provider performance, and patient experience. The focus on value-based care metrics will undoubtedly lead to a greater weight placed on economic analyses in arthroplasty. Authors of cost analyses in arthroplasty often use the term ""cost"" in ways that have vastly different underlying meanings. It is imperative that surgeons understand the different characteristics of cost data, where they come from, and how to interpret them. There are three types of costs: 1) costs to the health care providers; 2) costs to the payer; and 3) costs to society. In this review, we evaluate where each type of cost data comes from, what are the appropriate conclusions to be drawn from them, and examples of how they are used in the literature."
"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most prevalent hematologic malignancy in adults. In 2022, the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) has updated its prognostic system that incorporates cytogenetics and molecular genetics based on data from patients undergoing intensive chemotherapy (IC). Recently, a risk stratification framework has been established for hypomethylating agents (HMA)-based low-intensity treatment (LIT) to fill the gaps in stratification for this treatment modality, but this needs further refinement. Venetoclax (VEN), a BH3 mimetic, targets BCL-2 to modulate apoptosis and metabolism in AML cells. Its combination with HMA or low-dose cytarabine (LDAC) has been shown to enhance the response rates and prolong the survival outcomes of older or unfit patients with AML. In this review, we delved into the prognostic significance of FLT3-ITD and IDH mutations when used in combination with VEN and HMA, as well as in conjunction with their specific inhibitors. We also explored the role of VEN in NPM1-mutated AML and its efficacy in splicing factor mutations AML. Additionally, we examined the response rates and survival outcomes of CBF-AML when treated with a VEN-based regimen. Moving forward, it is imperative that risk stratification for LIT becomes more nuanced to better align with the requirements of personalized diagnosis and treatment strategies."
"The ability of cancer cells to change and adapt poses a critical challenge to identifying curative solutions. Tumor evolution has been extensively studied from a genetic perspective, to guide clinicians in selecting the most appropriate therapeutic option based on a patient's mutational profile. However, several studies reported that tumors can evolve toward more aggressive stages or become resistant to therapies without changing their genetic makeup. Indeed, several cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic mechanisms contribute to tumor evolution. In this viewpoint, I focus on how chromatin, epigenetic, and transcriptional changes contribute to tumor evolution, allowing cancer cells to transition to different cell states and bypass response to therapies. Although tumor nongenetic evolution is harder to trace and predict, understanding its principles might open new therapeutic opportunities."
"Angiocentric glioma (AG), a benign tumor identified within the last two decades, was officially included in the 2007 WHO Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System, WHO grade I. The tumor is relatively rare, with only approximately 100 cases reported. We aim to complement the characteristics and long-term prognosis of AG, as well as to detect MYB-QKI fusions."
"The click beetles (Elateridae) represent the major and well-known group of the polyphagan superfamily Elateroidea. Despite a relatively rich fossil record of Mesozoic Elateridae, only a few species are described from the Upper Cretaceous Burmese amber. Although Elateridae spend most of their lives as larvae, our knowledge on immature stages of this family is limited, which is especially valid for the fossils. So far, only a single larval click beetle has been reported from Burmese amber. Here, we describe two larval specimens from the same deposit which based on their morphology unambiguously belong to the predominantly Southern Hemisphere subfamily Pityobiinae, being the most similar to the representatives of tribe Tibionemini. However, since the larvae of the closely related bioluminescent Campyloxenini have not yet been described, we place our specimens to Tibionemini only tentatively. One species of Pityobiinae was recently described from Burmese amber based on adults, and we discuss if it can be congeneric with the here-reported larvae. Recent representatives of the Tibionemini + Campyloxenini clade are known from South America and New Zealand, and this group is hypothesized to have a Gondwanan origin. Hence, the newly discovered Burmese amber larvae may further contribute to a recently highly debated hypothesis that biota of the resin-producing forest on the Burma Terrane, which was probably an island drifting northward at the time of amber deposition, had at least partly Gondwanan affinities. The discovery of enigmatic click beetle larvae in the Upper Cretaceous Burmese amber sheds further light on the palaeodiversity and distribution of the relatively species-poor Gondwanan clade of click beetles, which contain a recent bioluminescent lineage, as well as on the taxonomic composition of the extinct Mesozoic ecosystem."
"Evidence suggests nasal airflow resistance reduces after rapid maxillary expansion (RME). However, the medium-term effects of RME on upper airway (UA) airflow characteristics when normal craniofacial development is considered are still unclear. This retrospective cohort study used computer fluid dynamics (CFD) to evaluate the medium-term changes in the UA airflow (pressure and velocity) after RME in two distinct age-based cohorts."
"Avian coccidiosis is one of the many disorders that seriously harm birds' digestive systems. Nowadays the light is shed on using Phytochemical/herbal medicines as alternative natural anti-coccidial chemical-free standards. Consequently, this study aimed to investigate the impact of lawsonia inermis powder (LIP), and Acacia nilotica aqueous extract (ANAE), on growth performance, serum biochemical, antioxidant status, cytokine biomarkers, total oocyst count and intestinal histopathology of broiler chickens challenged with coccidiosis. Two hundred and forty-one-day-old Ross chicks were randomly distributed into 8 groups, four were challenged with coccidia, while the other four were unchallenged. Each group consisted of 3 replicates of 10 chicks each. The birds were challenged with Eimeria species orally on day 14 of age. Group 1B was unchallenged, and Group 2 A was challenged with coccidiosis and both were fed the basic diet without additives. Groups 3 A, 4 A, and 5 A were challenged and fed on the basic diet supplemented with LIP (40 g/kg of diet), ANAE (5 g/kg of diet), and LIP + ANAE combination, respectively. Groups 3B, 4B, and 5B were unchallenged and fed on the basic diet supplemented with LIP (40 g/kg of diet) and ANAE (5 g/kg of diet) and LIP + ANAE combination, respectively. The best results of growth performance parameters were recorded in G5B, and G5A followed by the group fed on ANAE and then the group fed on LIP compared with the control. All challenged broilers had higher aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), urea, creatinine, glucose, MDA, IL-4 &TNF-α levels compared to all unchallenged broilers. Challenged broilers had lower serum cholesterol, triglycerides, total protein, albumin, globulin, SOD, GPX & IL-10 levels compared to non-challenged broilers. Histopathological examination of the small intestine and cecum of challenged treated groups with LIP + ANAE showed good mucosal integrity, few leukocytes infiltration, and low total oocyst count in broilers manure, followed by ANAE then LIP groups. In conclusion, dietary supplementation of lawsonia inermis powder and Acacia nilotica aqueous extract either alone or in combination had positive effects on broiler performance, blood metabolites, antioxidant status, cellular response, and intestinal morphology during the exposure to Eimeria spp. as a potential natural anti-coccidial."
"Lineage tracing based on modern live imaging approaches enables to visualize, reconstruct, and analyze the developmental history, fate, and dynamic behaviors of cells in vivo in a direct, comprehensive, and quantitative manner. Light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) has greatly boosted lineage tracing efforts, because fluorescently labeled specimens can be imaged in their entirety, over long periods of time, with high spatiotemporal resolution and minimal photodamage. In addition, an increasing arsenal of commercial and open-source software solutions for cell and nuclei segmentation and tracking can be employed to convert data from pixel-based to object-based representations, and to reconstruct the lineages of cells in their native context as they organize in tissues, organs, and whole organisms. This chapter describes the preparation of LSFM image datasets and the use of three freely available platforms, namely, the Fiji/ImageJ plugins Massive Multiview Tracker (MaMuT), Mastodon and TrackMate, for small-scale and large-scale lineage tracing purposes using manual, semi-automated, and fully automated pipelines for nuclei or cell tracking. Lineage tracing with these tools is described on LSFM image datasets of fluorescently labeled embryos from the crustacean model Parhyale hawaiensis that lends itself to multi-scale investigations of development and regeneration."

"Ticks are crucial vectors for various pathogens associated with human and animal diseases, including viruses. Nevertheless, significant knowledge gaps prevail in our understanding of tick-borne viruses (TBVs). We here examined existing studies on TBVs, uncovering 870 documented virus species across 28 orders, 55 families, and 66 genera. The discovery history, vector ticks, and hosts of TBVs, as well as the clinical characteristics of TBV-induced diseases, are summarized. In total, 176 tick species from nine tick genera were confirmed as vectors for TBVs. Overall, 105 TBVs were associated with infection or exposure to humans and animals. Of them, at least 40 were identified to cause human or animal diseases. This review addresses the current challenges associated with TBV research, including the lack of knowledge about the identification of novel and emerging TBVs, the spillover potentials from ticks to hosts, and the pathogenicity and infection mechanisms of TBVs. It is expected to provide crucial insights and references for future studies in this field, while specifically focusing on expanding surveys, improving TBV identification and isolation, and enhancing the understanding of TBV-vector-host interactions. All of these findings will facilitate the preparation for preventing and treating diseases caused by emerging and novel TBVs."
"Human milk, especially the mother's own milk (MOM), is highly recommended for preterm babies considering its numerous benefits. Prioritising the use of exclusive MOM in enteral feeding plans is essential for maximising the health and development of preterm babies. This study evaluated the effect of early establishment of full enteral feed (FEF) with exclusive MOM on feeding rate and neonatal nutritional outcomes at discharge among preterm babies."
Pituitary neuroendocrine tumors (pitNETs) are benign tumors that may recur after surgical resection or persist following medical management.

"Public transportation systems play a vital role in modern cities, but they face growing security challenges, particularly related to incidents of violence. Detecting and responding to violence in real time is crucial for ensuring passenger safety and the smooth operation of these transport networks. To address this issue, we propose an advanced artificial intelligence (AI) solution for identifying unsafe behaviours in public transport. The proposed approach employs deep learning action recognition models and utilises technologies like NVIDIA DeepStream SDK, Amazon Web Services (AWS) DirectConnect, local edge computing server, ONNXRuntime and MQTT to accelerate the end-to-end pipeline. The solution captures video streams from remote train stations closed circuit television (CCTV) networks, processes the data in the cloud, applies the action recognition model, and transmits the results to a live web application. A temporal pyramid network (TPN) action recognition model was trained on a newly curated video dataset mixing open-source resources and live simulated trials to identify the unsafe behaviours. The base model was able to achieve a validation accuracy of 93% when trained using open-source dataset samples and was improved to 97% when live simulated dataset was included during the training. The developed AI system was deployed at Wollongong Train Station (NSW, Australia) and showcased impressive accuracy in detecting violence incidents during an 8-week test period, achieving a reliable false-positive (FP) rate of 23%. While the AI correctly identified 30 true-positive incidents, there were 6 cases of false negatives (FNs) where violence incidents were missed during the rainy weather suggesting more data in the training dataset related to bad weather. The AI model's continuous retraining capability ensures its adaptability to various real-world scenarios, making it a valuable tool for enhancing safety and the overall passenger experience in public transport settings."
"The anterolateral thigh (ALT) flap is a reliable and versatile flap with the ideal characteristics for soft-tissue reconstruction. However, as it is known for its highly variable anatomy, it requires preoperative perforator localization to optimize flap design and dissection of the flap. Dynamic Infrared Thermography (DIRT) is a non-invasive and quick imaging method that provides real-time information. This study aimed to provide a proof-of-principle for the feasibility of projecting DIRT hotspots directly onto patient's skin before ALT flap harvest."
"Controlling organ size in plants is a complex biological process influenced by various factors, including gene expression, genome ploidy and environmental conditions. Despite its importance for plant growth and development, the mechanisms underlying organ size regulation remain unknown. Here, we investigated the role of RAN1, a member of the Ras-related nuclear GTPase family, in regulating pollen size. A RAN1 knockdown mutant (ran1-1) exhibited a significant reduction in pollen size, accompanied by impaired germination and reduced pollen tube growth. RAN1 mutation caused disruptions in actin filament organization, such as aberrant structure of actin collar due to the dysregulation of expression of actin-binding proteins. Furthermore, we identified that mutation of the transcription activator SHORT HYPOCOTYL UNDER BLUE1 (SHB1) showed similar but milder phenotypes in pollen compared to ran1-1. Genetic evidence suggested that SHB1 acts downstream of RAN1. Transient expression assays in leaves showed that SHB1 was largely retained in the cytoplasm of the ran1-1 mutant, potentially affecting the expression of actin-binding proteins. These findings highlight the pivotal role of RAN1 in modulating pollen size and development, providing valuable insights into cell size regulation."

"The different spatiotemporal distribution of progenitor and neurogenic capacities permits that brain regions engage asynchronously in neurogenesis. In the hindbrain, rhombomere progenitor cells contribute to neurons during the first neurogenic phase, whereas boundary cells participate later. To analyze what maintains boundary cells as non-neurogenic progenitors, we addressed the role of Her9, a zebrafish Hes1-related protein. her9 expression is temporarily sustained in boundary cells independently of Notch at early embryonic stages, while they are non-neurogenic progenitors. Complementary functional approaches show that Her9 inhibits the onset of Notch signaling and the neurogenic program, keeping boundary cells as progenitors. Multicolor clonal analysis combined with genetic perturbations reveal that Her9 expands boundary progenitors by promoting symmetric proliferative and preventing neurogenic cell divisions. Her9 also regulates the proliferation of boundary cells by inhibiting the cell cycle arrest gene cdkn1ca and interplaying with Cyclin D1. Moreover, her9 is enriched in hindbrain radial glial cells at late embryonic stages independently of Notch. Together these data demonstrate that Her9 maintains the stemness properties of hindbrain boundary progenitors and late radial glial cells, ensuring the different temporal distribution of neurogenic capacities within the hindbrain."

"Our study aimed to assess the impact of political affiliation, personal beliefs, and policy measures on the intention to receive routine COVID-19 and influenza vaccines in the coming year. A cross-sectional study of 1256 individuals at Minnesota State and County Fairs was conducted to assess their intention to receive COVID-19 booster and influenza vaccines in the coming year. The association between vaccine intention and political affiliation, belief in collective responsibility, and workplace/school vaccine requirements were analyzed using multinomial logistic regression. Vaccine intention in the coming year was high among our participants; 65% intended to receive both vaccines, 11% intended to receive only the influenza vaccine, 7% intended to receive only the COVID-19 vaccine, and 17% planned to receive neither. Political affiliation was strongly associated with the intention to receive both vaccines. Republicans were far more likely than Democrats to report plans to receive neither vaccine (aOR: 12.8; 95% CI: 6.2-26.6), or only the influenza vaccine in the coming year (aOR: 8.7; 95% CI: 4.2-17.9). Additionally, those who planned to receive both vaccines were significantly more likely to view vaccines as a collective responsibility. This study highlights the significant influence of political affiliation and beliefs in collective responsibility on vaccine intentions."
"Stereotactic arrhythmia radioablation (STAR) is a noninvasive treatment of refractory ventricular tachycardia (VT). In this study, we aimed to systematically review prospective trials on STAR and pool harmonized outcome measures in a meta-analysis. After registration in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO: CRD42023439666), we searched OVID Medline, OVID Embase, Web of Science Core Collection, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Google Scholar on November 9, 2023, to identify reports describing results of prospective trials evaluating STAR for VT. Risk of bias was assessed using the Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies of Interventions tool. Meta-analysis was performed using generalized linear mixed models. We identified 10 prospective trials in which 82 patients were treated with STAR between 2016 and 2022. The 90-day rate of treatment-related grade ≥3 adverse events was 0.10 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.04-0.2). The proportions of patients achieving given VT burden reductions were 0.61 (95% CI 0.45-0.74) for ≥95%, 0.80 (95% CI 0.62-0.91) for ≥75%, and 0.9 (95% CI 0.77-0.96) for ≥50% in 63 evaluable patients. The 1-year overall survival rate was 0.73 (95% CI 0.61-0.83) in 81 patients, 1-year freedom from recurrence was 0.30 (95% CI 0.16-0.49) in 61 patients, and 1-year recurrence-free survival was 0.21 in 60 patients (95% CI 0.08-0.46). Limitations include methodological heterogeneity across studies and moderate to significant risk of bias. In conclusion, STAR is a promising treatment method, characterized by moderate toxicity. We observed 1-year mortality of ≈27% in this population of critically ill patients suffering from refractory VT. Most patients experience a significant reduction in VT burden; however, 1-year recurrence rates are high. STAR should still be considered an investigational approach and recommended to patients primarily within the context of prospective trials."
"Virtual machine logs are generated in large quantities. Virtual machine logs may contain some abnormal logs that indicate security risks or system failures of the virtual machine platform. Therefore, using unsupervised anomaly detection methods to identify abnormal logs is a meaningful task. However, collecting accurate anomaly logs in the real world is often challenging, and there is inherent noise in the log information. Parsing logs and anomaly alerts can be time-consuming, making it important to improve their effectiveness and accuracy. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a method called LADSVM(Long Short-Term Memory + Autoencoder-Decoder + SVM). Firstly, the log parsing algorithm is used to parse the logs. Then, the feature extraction algorithm, which combines Long Short-Term Memory and Autoencoder-Decoder, is applied to extract features. Autoencoder-Decoder reduces the dimensionality of the data by mapping the high-dimensional input to a low-dimensional latent space. This helps eliminate redundant information and noise, extract key features, and increase robustness. Finally, the Support Vector Machine is utilized to detect different feature vector signals. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to traditional methods, this approach is capable of learning better features without any prior knowledge, while also exhibiting superior noise robustness and performance. The LADSVM approach excels at detecting anomalies in virtual machine logs characterized by strong sequential patterns and noise. However, its performance may vary when applied to disordered log data. This highlights the necessity of carefully selecting detection methods that align with the specific characteristics of different log data types."
"The COVID-19 pandemic amplified the risk environment for people who inject drugs (PWID), making continued access to harm reduction services imperative. Research has shown that some harm reduction service providers were able to continue to provide services throughout the pandemic. Most of these studies, however, focused on staff perspectives, not those of PWID. Our study examines changes in perceptions of access to harm reduction services (e.g., participant reported difficulty in accessing syringes and naloxone) among PWID participating in a longitudinal study conducted through the University of Illinois-Chicago's Community Outreach Intervention Projects field sites during the COVID-19 pandemic."
"Once thought to be in a terminally differentiated state, macrophages are now understood to be highly pliable, attuned and receptive to environmental cues that control and align responses. In development of purpose, the centrality of metabolic pathways has emerged. Thus, macrophage inflammatory or reparative phenotypes are tightly linked to catabolic and anabolic metabolism, with further fine tuning of specific gene expression patterns in specific settings. Single-cell transcriptome analyses have revealed a breadth of macrophage signatures, with some new influencers driving phenotype. CD36/Scavenger Receptor B2 has established roles in immunity and lipid metabolism. Macrophage CD36 is a key functional player in metabolic expression profiles that determine phenotype. Emerging data show that alterations in the microenvironment can recast metabolic pathways and modulate macrophage function, with the potential to be leveraged for therapeutic means. This review covers recent data on phenotypic characterization of homeostatic, atherosclerotic, lipid-, tumor- and metastatic-associated macrophages, with the integral role of CD36 highlighted."
"Individuals with intellectual disabilities (ID) often exhibit lower levels of physical fitness compared to the general population, including reduced strength, endurance, flexibility, and coordination. Dynamic neuromuscular stabilization (DNS) training can potentially improve the performance of adults with ID caused by weak motor skills due to a lack of desirable nerve growth during childhood and before puberty. Also, DNS training proposed to improve physical fitness in this population, but the effectiveness and durability of DNS training on specific fitness components have not been well-established. This study employed a randomized controlled trial design to investigate the effects of an 8-week DNS training program on the strength, endurance, and flexibility of adults with ID. A total of 31 participants were randomly assigned to either an intervention group (n = 16) or a control group (n = 15). Muscular strength, endurance, and flexibility were assessed at baseline (pre-test), immediately after the intervention (post-test), and 2 months following the intervention (follow-up) using the 30-second chair stand (30sCS) test, sit-ups test, trunk lift test, and chair sit-and-reach test. Participants in the intervention group engaged in the DNS training program for 8 weeks, with 3 sessions per week, while the control group maintained their usual activities. The analysis of the outcome measures revealed significant time, group, and time-group interaction effects. Post-hoc analyses indicated that the DNS group exhibited significantly greater improvements in 30sCS, sit-ups, trunk lift, and chair sit-and-reach compared to the control group (p < 0.01). These improvements were maintained at the 2-month follow-up assessment in the DNS group. This randomized controlled trial demonstrates that an 8-week DNS training program significantly improves muscular strength, endurance, and flexibility in adults with ID, with benefits maintained at a 2 month follow-up. Further research is needed to replicate these findings and investigate underlying mechanisms, but the study highlights the potential of DNS training to promote physical fitness and well-being in individuals with ID.Trial registration RTC, prospectively registered in the Clinical Trial Registry (UMIN000053560) on 24/03/2024."
"Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia duodenalis are zoonotic protozoan parasites that are widely seen in domestic and wild animals worldwide. While these pathogens, which affect the digestive system of the hosts, cause high economic losses in animal breeding, they are also considered an important public health problem. In recent years, molecular-based studies revealed that 120 genotypes belonging to 44 Cryptosporidium species and eight G. duodenalis assemblages (G. duodenalis A-H) circulate among hosts. The aim of the study was to determine the presence and prevalence of cryptosporidiosis and giardiosis in buffaloes, for which there was only one previous study on the subject in Türkiye."

"Coronary microvascular disease (CMVD) affects the coronary pre-arterioles, arterioles, and capillaries and can lead to blood supply-demand mismatch and cardiac ischemia. CMVD can present clinically as ischemia or myocardial infarction with no obstructive coronary arteries (INOCA or MINOCA, respectively). Currently, therapeutic options for CMVD are limited, and there are no targeted therapies. Genetic studies have emerged as an important tool to gain rapid insights into the molecular mechanisms of human diseases. For example, coronary artery disease (CAD) genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have enrolled hundreds of thousands of patients and have identified > 320 loci, elucidating CAD pathogenic pathways and helping to identify therapeutic targets. Here, we review the current landscape of genetic studies of CMVD, consisting mostly of genotype-first approaches. We then present the hypothesis that CAD GWAS have enrolled heterogenous populations and may be better characterized as ischemic heart disease (IHD) GWAS. We discuss how several of the genetic loci currently associated with CAD may be involved in the pathogenesis of CMVD. Genetic studies could help accelerate progress in understanding CMVD pathophysiology and identifying putative therapeutic targets. Larger phenotype-first genomic studies into CMVD with adequate sex and ancestry representation are needed. Given the extensive CAD genetic and functional validation data, future research should leverage these loci as springboards for CMVD genomic research."
"An ageing population and a workforce crisis have triggered an ambitious UK strategy for sustained delivery of healthcare. In perioperative care (the management of patients from contemplation of surgery until full recovery), it is recognised that interventions are needed to place the workforce on a more sustainable footing through cross-functionality and skill-shifting, namely with advanced practice roles. However, despite some reports and reviews in the literature, it is unclear how skills development efforts may potentially support workforce transformation for an effective and resilient perioperative care workforce. Thus, drawing causal inferences for policy-making that is both evidence based and rooted in theory is challenging. A scoping review, reported within this protocol, confirmed that 'poly-skilling' and 'advanced practice roles' are critical to this workforce transformation, but the mechanisms through which interventions in this area may work are not understood. A synthesis of evidence is, therefore, proposed in this protocol, to understand what works for whom and under what circumstances, in relation to poly-skilling and advanced practice roles in workforce transformation for sustained healthcare delivery."
"Persistent toe walking is associated with autism spectrum disorder. The true prevalence of persistent toe walking and odds of progression to surgery in children with and without autism remains unclear. This retrospective descriptive study identified patients ages 3 to 17 years who were enrolled in our healthcare system over a 2-year period. Using international classification of disease codes, we identified all children with autism and persistent toe walking, and excluded children with conditions that may independently cause toe walking. Data on Achilles lengthening surgeries, sex, race and body mass index was gathered. The toe walking prevalence amongst children with and without autism was calculated. Multivariable logistic regression analysis controlling for sex, race and body mass index was used to determine independent risk factors for persistent toe walking and surgery. Of the children who met inclusion criteria (N = 284,925), 4622 (1.6%) had persistent toe walking. Prevalence of persistent toe walking was higher amongst children with autism (6.3% vs 1.5%, p < .01), as were odds of persistent toe walking (OR 4.13, 95% CI 3.74 to 4.56, p < .01). Males and White patients had higher odds of persistent toe walking compared to females and patients of any other race, respectively (p < .01 for all). Although children with autism and toe walking had higher rates of surgery than their counterparts without autism (4.3% vs 2.6%, p = .04), this difference was not significant after controlling for sex, race and BMI (OR 1.59, 95% CI 0.95 to 2.69, p > .05)."
"Pragmatic trials that combine electronic health record data and patient-reported data may be subject to selection bias due to the differential post-randomization exclusion of participants who are randomized in error. Such situations are often caused by inevitable reasons, such as incomplete patient medical records at the pre-randomization stage. This can lead to participants in the intervention arm being identified as ineligible after randomization, while randomized-in-error participants in the usual care are often not discernable. The differential exclusion can present analytic challenges and threaten result validity."
"Plants defend against chewing herbivores by up-regulating jasmonic acid (JA) signaling, which activates downstream signaling cascades and produces numerous secondary metabolites that act as defense molecules against the herbivores. Although secondary metabolism always remains a focus of research, primary metabolism is also reported to be realigned upon herbivory. However, JA signaling-mediated modulation of primary metabolites and their metabolic pathways in plants are mostly unexplored. Here, we applied gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-based untargeted metabolomics aided with computational statistical frameworks on wild type Arabidopsis, mutants of active JA receptor (i.e., CORONATINE-INSENSITIVE 1, COI1-1) and downstream transcription factor (i.e., MYC2) to navigate the JA signaling-mediated primary metabolism alterations during herbivory. Pathway and metabolite's chemical class enrichment analysis revealed JA signaling is crucial for constitutive as well as herbivore-induced primary metabolism and topology of their interaction networks. JA signaling majorly modulated alterations of sugars, amino acids and related metabolites. Herbivory-mediated sugar depletion and induction of methionine for aliphatic glucosinolates are also dependent on JA signaling. Taken together, our results demonstrate trails of JA signaling-mediated primary metabolic alterations associated with herbivory."
"End-stage heart failure (ESHF) remains a significant challenge despite optimal treatment, with heart transplantation (HTx) being the gold standard of care. Mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices such as left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are increasingly used for temporary or permanent treatment. Psychiatric comorbidities are common in patients with ESHF and may affect treatment outcomes, but the relationship between sociodemographic, clinical, and psychiatric characteristics remains unclear."
"Mammographic density is a strong risk factor for breast cancer and is reported clinically as part of Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) results issued by radiologists. Automated assessment of density is needed that can be used for both full-field digital mammography (FFDM) and digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) as both types of exams are acquired in standard clinical practice. We trained a deep learning model to automate the estimation of BI-RADS density from a prospective Washington University clinic-based cohort of 9,714 women, entering into the cohort in 2013 with follow-up through October 31, 2020. The cohort included 27% non-Hispanic Black women. The trained algorithm was assessed in an external validation cohort that included 18,360 women screened at Emory from January 1, 2013, and followed up through December 31, 2020, that included 42% non-Hispanic Black women. Our model-estimated BI-RADS density demonstrated substantial agreement with the density as assessed by radiologists. In the external validation, the agreement with radiologists for category B 81% and C 77% for FFDM and B 83% and C 74% for DBT shows important distinction for separation of women with dense breast. We obtained a Cohen's κ of 0.72 (95% confidence interval, 0.71-0.73) in FFDM and 0.71 (95% confidence interval, 0.69-0.73) in DBT. We provided a consistent and fully automated BI-RADS estimation for both FFDM and DBT using a deep learning model. The software can be easily implemented anywhere for clinical use and risk prediction. Prevention Relevance: The proposed model can reduce interobserver variability in BI-RADS density assessment, thereby providing more standard and consistent density assessment for use in decisions about supplemental screening and risk assessment."
"The prevalence of obesity, along with that of its associated health conditions, including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, and liver diseases, such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), is increasing annually. Bariatric surgery is indicated for the treatment of obesity if conservative treatment fails. While various liver fibrosis scores have been proposed for assessing liver function, they are typically used prior to bariatric surgery. This study aimed to determine whether fibrosis scores calculated from non-invasive parameters are effective in monitoring liver function after bariatric surgery."
"Malaria incidence in the Greater Mekong Subregion has been on the decline, and most remaining malaria risk in the region is concentrated among hard-to-reach populations, especially those with exposure to forested areas. New vector control tools focused on outdoor protection in forest settings are needed for these populations."
"This was an original article, and the objective of this study was to investigate the effects of bipolar transurethral plasma kinetic prostatectomy (TUPKP) on urodynamics and sexual function in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) patients. One hundred and four BPH patients were divided into a control group and an intervention group. The control group received transurethral resection of prostate, while the intervention group received TUKEP. Relative to the control group, the intervention group presented less intraoperative blood loss and shorter bladder irrigation time, catheter retention time, and shorter hospital stay. Three months after surgery, the improvements of maximum urine flow rate (Qmax), pressure-flow rate (A-G) and residual urine volume (RV) in intervention group were more obvious than control group. One month after surgery, relative to control group, the intervention group had lower C-reactive protein (CRP), epinephrine (E) along with cortisol (Cor), cyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX-2) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels. On day 7 after surgery, PSA, EGF, and PGE2 levels in the intervention group were lower when compared to the control group. We conclude that TUKEP can diminish intraoperative blood loss, promote postoperative recovery, improve postoperative urodynamics and sexual function, and improve prognosis of BPH patients."
"Hip fracture prevention approaches like prophylactic augmentation devices have been proposed to strengthen the femur and prevent hip fracture in a fall scenario. The aim of this study was to validate the finite element model (FEM) of specimens augmented by prophylactic intramedullary nailing in a simulated sideways fall impact against ex vivo experimental data. A dynamic inertia-driven sideways fall simulator was used to test six cadaveric specimens (3 females, 3 males, age 63-83 years) prophylactically implanted with an intramedullary nailing system used to augment the femur. Impact force measurements, pelvic deformation, effective pelvic stiffness, and fracture outcomes were compared between the ex vivo experiments and the FEMs. The FEMs over-predicted the effective pelvic stiffness for most specimens and showed variability in terms of under- and over-predicting peak impact force and pelvis compression depending on the specimen. A significant correlation was found for time to peak impact force when comparing ex vivo and FEM data. No femoral fractures were found in the ex vivo experiments, but two specimens sustained pelvic fractures. These two pelvis fractures were correctly identified by the FEMs, but the FEMs made three additional false-positive fracture identifications. These validation results highlight current limitations of these sideways fall impact models specific to the inclusion of an orthopaedic implant. These FEMs present a conservative strategy for fracture prediction in future applications. Further evaluation of the modelling approaches used for the bone-implant interface is recommended for modelling augmented specimens, alongside the importance of maintaining well-controlled experimental conditions."
"With the rapid expansion of veterans' access to community care under the Veterans Affairs Maintaining Internal Systems and Strengthening Integrated Outside Networks (VA MISSION) Act of 2018, ensuring that veterans receive high-quality community care has become a national priority. Using Veterans Health Administration (VHA) data and Medicare performance scores, we assessed how clinicians' performance on quality measures differed between those who treated veterans within the VHA Community Care Network and those who did not. We found that in 2022, 66.0 percent of community-based clinicians treated VHA enrollees. These clinicians were more likely to be male, have less practice experience, be affiliated with group practices, and be based in rural and socially vulnerable areas compared with clinicians who did not treat VHA enrollees. Notably, clinicians in the lowest quartile of quality performance measures were 8.8 percentage points more likely to treat VHA enrollees than those in the highest quartile. This pattern was most pronounced among primary care and mental health clinicians, and it persisted across VHA Community Care Network regions. These results underscore the need for federal efforts to ensure that veterans receive care from high-performing community clinicians."
"Successful navigation relies on reciprocal transformations between spatial representations in world-centered (allocentric) and self-centered (egocentric) frames of reference. The neural basis of allocentric spatial representations has been extensively investigated with grid, border, and head-direction cells in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) forming key components of a 'cognitive map'. Recently, egocentric spatial representations have also been identified in several brain regions, but evidence for the coexistence of neurons encoding spatial variables in each reference frame within MEC is so far lacking. Here, we report that allocentric and egocentric spatial representations are both present in rodent MEC, with neurons in deeper layers representing the egocentric bearing and distance towards the geometric center and / or boundaries of an environment. These results demonstrate a unity of spatial coding that can guide efficient navigation and suggest that MEC may be one locus of interactions between egocentric and allocentric spatial representations in the mammalian brain."
"The discharge time of the postpartum woman is an issue related to emotional readiness and hospital policies and should be evaluated by the nurse. The feeling of readiness of the postpartum woman is the key in making the decision to discharge.The objective of the study is to evaluate the discharge readiness of puerperium and to determine the factors affecting.This study included 323 postpartum women who visited the obstetrics and gynecology outpatient clinic of the hospital between Semtember 10, 2021, and January 31, 2022, and met the inclusion criteria. Data were collected using the Personal and Obstetric Information form, The Readiness for Hospital Discharge Scale-Postpartum Mother Form(RHDS-PM). The chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, and the Fisher-Freeman-Halton test were used in the comparison of categorical data. Categorical data are presented as frequencies and percentages The mean age of the participants was 28.57±5.69 years. In our study, it was found that the mean RHDS-PMF score of the postpartum women was 154.29±31.08. A statistically significant difference was found in satisfaction with nursing care based on postpartum knowledge status (p< 0.001).Based on this study's results, the average discharge scale score of the postpartum women in the group was determined to be ready. The scale score of those who believe that they would be capable of self-care at home is higher than those who do not. Thus, the education and the self care power provided support postpartum women's satisfaction with nursing care and their readiness for discharge."
"Cancer metastasis is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths, making early detection and the prevention of metastatic progression critical research priorities. Recent studies have expanded our understanding of CEMIP (KIAA1199, HYBID), revealing its involvement in cancer metastasis and its potential role in slowing cancer progression. CEMIP plays critical roles in several stages of cancer metastasis: First, CEMIP promotes cancer cell proliferation to maintain cell heterogeneity before the metastasis process. Second, it facilitates cancer cell detachment by promoting the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through alterations in signaling pathways. Third, CEMIP contributes to cancer cell adherence and attachment by enabling cells to withstand cell death (anoikis and ferroptosis) and hypoxia. Fourth, during the invasion process, CEMIP induces hyaluronan depolymerization and further modulates signaling to promote EMT. Lastly, in the pre-metastatic niche, CEMIP influences the tumor microenvironment through hypoxia, angiogenesis, signaling pathway changes, and hyaluronan degradation. Recent studies have focused on leveraging CEMIP as a diagnostic tool or a predictor of metastasis and/or targeting CEMIP to overcome cancer resistance and progression. This review aims to explore the role of CEMIP at each stage of cancer metastasis and highlight recent advances in targeting CEMIP to inhibit cancer progression."
"Low temperature restricts the growth, development, and yield of peppers, significantly limiting the development of the pepper industry. NAC (NAM, ATAF1/2, and CUC2) transcription factors (TFs) are implicated in plant responses to cold stress, but their specific mechanisms in peppers are unclear. In this study, we isolated a cold-induced NAC transcription factor, CaNAC76, from pepper (Capsicum annuum L.). CaNAC76 is localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm and exhibits transcriptional activation activity. Silencing CaNAC76 expression reduced the activities of superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, and catalase enzymes, resulting in decreased cold tolerance in peppers. Conversely, overexpressing CaNAC76 increased the activities of antioxidant enzymes and the expression of cold stress-responsive genes (ICE-CBF-COR) in Arabidopsis, enhancing the plant's freezing tolerance. Transcriptional regulation analysis showed that CaNAC76 directly binds to the promoter region of CaCAD1 and induces its expression. Similarly, low temperatures induced the expression of CaCAD1. Ectopic expression of CaCAD1 improved Arabidopsis freezing tolerance, whereas silencing CaCAD1 expression increased sensitivity to low temperatures. Furthermore, we observed that CaNAC76 overexpression enhanced CAD activity and lignin content in Arabidopsis, leading to lignin deposition in the xylem and interfascicular fibers. In summary, the results demonstrate that CaNAC76 can enhance cold tolerance in peppers by affecting both CBF-dependent (ICE-CBF-COR) and CBF-independent pathways (promoting CaCAD1 expression)."
"The recent report of the first pig kidney transplant in a living human brings hope to thousands of people with end-stage kidney failure. The scientific community views this early success with caution as kidney xenotransplantation exhibits many challenges and barriers. One of these is coagulation dysregulation. This includes (i) pig von Willebrand Factor (vWF) interaction with human platelets, which can induce abnormal clotting responses, heightening the risk of graft failure, (ii) the inefficiency of pig thrombomodulin in activating human protein C, which emphasizes the species-specific variations that aggravate coagulation challenges, and (iii) the development of thrombotic microangiopathy in the pig grafts and the occurrence of systemic consumptive coagulopathy in the recipients. Indeed, coagulation dysregulation largely results from differences in endothelial cell response and incompatibilities between pig and human coagulation-anticoagulation pathways. These barriers can be resolved by modifications to pig vWF and the expression of human thrombomodulin and endothelial protein C receptors in pig cells, serving as strategic interventions to align the coagulation systems of the two species more closely. These coagulation challenges have clinical implications in how they affect graft survival and patient outcome. Genetic engineering of the organ-source pig and the administration of various drugs have assisted in correcting this coagulation dysregulation. Hence, comprehending and controlling coagulation dysregulation is crucial for progress in xenotransplantation as a viable option for treating patients with terminal kidney disease."
"Perioperative neurocognitive disorder (PND) is a prevalent form of cognitive impairment in elderly patients following anesthesia and surgery. The underlying mechanisms of PND are closely related to perineuronal nets (PNNs). PNNs, which are complexes of extracellular matrix primarily surrounding neurons in the hippocampus, play a critical role in neurocognitive function. Connexin 43 (Cx43) contributes to cognitive function by modulating the components of PNNs. This study was designed to investigate the specific regulatory mechanisms of Cx43 on PNNs and its pivotal role in the development of PND."
"Perception of emotion conveyed through language is influenced by embodied experiences obtained from social interactions, which may vary across different cultures. To explore cross-cultural differences in the perception of emotion between Chinese and English speakers, this study collected norms of valence and arousal from 322 native Mandarin speakers for 4923 Chinese words translated from Warriner et al., (Behavior Research Methods, 45, 1191-1207, 2013). Additionally, sensory experience ratings for each word were collected. Analysis demonstrated that the reliability of this dataset is satisfactory, as indicated by comparisons with previous datasets. We examined the distributions of valence and arousal for the entire dataset, as well as for positive and negative emotion categories. Further analysis suggested that valence, arousal, and sensory experience correlated with various psycholinguistic variables, including the number of syllables, number of strokes, imageability, familiarity, concreteness, frequency, and age of acquisition. Cross-language comparison indicated that native speakers of Chinese and English differ in their perception of emotional valence and arousal, largely due to cross-cultural variations associated with ecological, sociopolitical, and religious factors. This dataset will be a valuable resource for research examining the impact of emotional and sensory information on Chinese lexical processing, as well as for bilingual research investigating the interplay between language and emotion across different cultural contexts."

"Data on antifungal prescribing in neonatal patients are limited to either single-center or single-country studies or to 1-day recording. Therefore, we assessed antifungal longitudinal usage in neonatal units (NUs) within Europe."
"Gene co-expression networks typically comprise modules and their associated hub genes, which are regulating numerous downstream interactions within the network. Methods for hub screening, as well as data-driven estimation of hub co-expression networks using graphical models, can serve as useful tools for identifying these hubs. Graphical model-based penalization methods typically have one or multiple regularization terms, each of which encourages some favorable characteristics (e.g. sparsity, hubs, and power-law) to the estimated complex gene network. It is common practice to find a single optimal graphical model corresponding to a specific value of the regularization parameter(s). However, instead of doing this, one could aggregate information across several graphical models, all of which depend on the same data set, along the solution path in the hub gene detection process. We propose a novel method for detecting hub genes that utilizes the information available in the solution path. Our procedure is related to stability selection, but we replace resampling with a simple statistic. This procedure amalgamates information from each node of the data-driven graphical models into a single influence statistic, similar to Cook's distance. We call this statistic the Mean Degree Squared Distance (MDSD). Our simulation and empirical studies demonstrate that the MDSD statistic maintains a good balance between false positive and true positive hubs. An R package MDSD is publicly available on GitHub under the General Public License https://github.com/markkukuismin/MDSD."
"During the analysis of a commingled human remains assemblage, pair-matching is often conducted as part of the inventory to inform the DNA sampling strategy and to calculate the minimum or most likely number of individuals. As commingled assemblages become larger, pair-matching becomes more difficult, and it is unknown whether accuracy declines. Therefore, a study to determine the accuracy rates of visual pair-matching for multiple observers was conducted on a large, commingled human assemblage. The sample consisted of 580 left and right humeri (n = 287 and n = 293, respectively) from the commingled remains of the USS Oklahoma, which were undergoing analysis at the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency. Five anthropologists completed this study, determining humeri pairs with varying degrees of confidence and non-pairs. The overall precision was 81.0% and ranged from 74.1% to 95.9% for participants, including all confidence levels. When considering only confident matches, the overall precision for all participants increased to 91.4%."
"Homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) testing is used to determine the appropriateness of poly ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitors for patients with epithelial ovarian cancer and no germline/somatic BRCA1/2 alterations. Myriad MyChoice CDx reports a genomic instability score (GIS) to quantify the level of HRD, with a positive score defined as ≥42. The authors sought to define factors associated with obtaining an inconclusive HRD test result."
"Cheater viruses cannot replicate on their own yet replicate faster than the wild type (WT) when the 2 viruses coinfect the same cell. Cheaters must possess dual genetic features: a defect, which leads to their inability to infect cells on their own, and a selective advantage over WT during coinfection. Previously, we have discovered 2 point-mutant cheaters of the MS2 bacteriophage. Here, we set out to discover the possible repertoire of cheater MS2 viruses by performing experimental evolution at a very high multiplicity of infection. Our results revealed a third point-mutant cheater that arose in 8 biological replicas. Each of the 3 primary cheaters disrupts the fine balance necessary for phage replication, in different ways that create a defect + advantage. We found that over time, the point-mutant cheaters accumulate additional secondary mutations, which alter other stages of the viral replication cycle, complementing the disruptions created by the original cheater. Intriguingly, cheater and secondary mutations almost always reside in very close proximity on the genome. This region encodes for multiple functions: overlapping reading frames as well as overlapping RNA structures critical for transitioning from one stage to another in the viral replication cycle. This region of overlap explains the dual functions of cheaters, as one mutation can have pleiotropic effects. Overall, these findings underscore how viruses, whose dense genomes often have overlapping functions, can easily evolve point-mutant cheaters, and how cheaters can evolve to alter the intricate balance of the viral replication cycle."
"Obesity is a chronic, complex, relapsing disease requiring medical intervention that has reached epidemic proportions globally. Most patients are still experiencing bias and stigma related to their disease-even by health care providers. Our goal in this pilot study is twofold: to develop a scale to accurately measure nurse practitioner knowledge and attitude regarding the disease of obesity to determine whether bias exists and to potentially identify gaps in knowledge that can be targeted with future educational interventions."
"Proteoglycans, key components of non-collagenous proteins in the bone matrix, attract water through their negatively charged glycosaminoglycan chains. Among these proteoglycans, biglycan (Bgn) and decorin (Dcn) are major subtypes, yet their distinct roles in bone remain largely elusive. In this study, we utilized single knockout (KO) mouse models and successfully generated double KO (dKO) models despite challenges with low yield. Bgn deficiency, but not Dcn deficiency, decreased trabecular bone mass, with more pronounced bone loss in dKO mice. Low-field nuclear magnetic resonance measurements showed a marked decrease in bound water among all KO groups, especially in Bgn KO and dKO mice. Moreover, both Bgn KO and dKO mice exhibited reduced fracture toughness compared to Dcn KO mice. Dcn was significantly upregulated in Bgn KO mice, while a modest upregulation of Bgn was observed in Dcn KO mice, indicating Bgn's predominant role in bone. High resolution atomic force microscopy showed decreased in situ permanent energy dissipation and increased elastic modulus in the extrafibrillar matrix of Bgn/Dcn deficient mice, which were diminished upon dehydration. Furthermore, we found that both Bgn and Dcn are indispensable for the activation of ERK and p38 MAPK signaling pathways. Collectively, our results highlight the distinct and indispensable roles of Bgn and Dcn in maintaining bone structure, water retention, and bulk/in situ tissue properties in the bone matrix, with Bgn exerting a predominant influence."
"Development of spectral photon-counting computed tomography (SPCCT) for ultra-high-resolution coronary CT angiography (CCTA) has the potential to accurately evaluate the coronary arteries of very-high-risk patients. The aim of this study was to compare the diagnostic performances of SPCCT against conventional CT for quantifying coronary stenosis in very-high-risk patients, with invasive coronary angiography (ICA) as the reference method."
"Methamphetamine (METH) is a potent psychostimulant that interferes the functionality of various brain regions and nervous connections, leading to addiction. The nucleus accumbens core (NAcC), primarily composed of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAergic) neurons, serves as a critical nucleus intimately related to addictive behavior. Previous research has indicated the involvement of cholecystokinin (CCK) receptors in drug addiction, yet the precise function of CCK receptors within the neural circuitry mediating METH-induced addiction remains elusive."
Audits allow analysis of the delivery of care and the prevalence of diseases. This study investigated kidney diseases' impact on end-stage renal disease (ERSD) in patients younger than 30 years.
"Periosteal chondrosarcoma (PCS) is the rarest subtype of chondrosarcoma and is recognized as a low-grade malignant tumour, reported to have an 88% ten year overall survival rate. The relationship between surgical margins and clinical outcome is inconsistent; some authors claim that PCS can be successfully treated with marginal resection and others report more local recurrence and distant metastasis with marginal compared to wide resection. This study was intended to report the treatment and prognosis of localized PCS patients from the Japanese National Bone and Soft Tissue Tumor Registry database and to perform a systematic review of the literature to determine the relationship between surgical margins and rates of local recurrence, distant metastasis, and mortality."
The aim of the present study was to quantify research outputs after completing a Coursework Pathway (CP).
"Over the past few decades, there has been a sudden rise in the incidence of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) in Western countries. However, current treatments often show limited efficacy in certain patients and are associated with adverse effects, which highlights the need for safer and more effective therapeutic approaches. Environmental factors, particularly dietary habits, have been observed to play a substantial role in the development of MS. In this study, we are the first to investigate the potential protective effect of the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) in MS. ABA, which is abundant in fruits such as figs, apricots and bilberries, is known to cross the blood-brain barrier and has demonstrated neuroprotective effects in conditions like depression and Alzheimer's disease."

"The blink reflex excitability, assessed through paired electrical stimuli responses, has been modulated using traditional non-invasive neurostimulation techniques. Recently, transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation (tACS) emerged as a tool to modulate brain oscillations implicated in various motor, perceptual, and cognitive functions. This study aims to investigate the influence of 20-Hz and 10-Hz tACS sessions on the primary motor cortex and their impact on blink reflex excitability."
"The baroreflex is one of the most important control mechanisms in the human cardiovascular system. This work utilises a closed-loop in silico model of baroreflex regulation, coupled to pulsatile mechanical models with (i) one heart chamber and 36-parameters and (ii) four chambers and 51 parameters. We perform the first global sensitivity analysis of these closed-loop systems which considers both cardiovascular and baroreflex parameters, and compare the models with their respective unregulated equivalents. Results show the reduced influence of regulated parameters compared to unregulated equivalents and that, in the physiological resting state, model outputs (pressures, heart rate, cardiac output etc.) are most sensitive to parasympathetic arc parameters. This work provides insight into the effects of regulation and model input parameter influence on clinical metrics, and constitutes a first step to understanding the role of regulation in models for personalised healthcare."
"Recently, members of a unique species of non-coding RNA, known as transfer RNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs) have been reported to serve multiple molecular functions, including in cells that mediate immunity. Because of their low molecular weights, tsRNAs were previously difficult to detect and were thus overlooked, until now. In this review, we delve into the biogenesis of tsRNAs and their diverse biological functions, ranging from transcriptional regulation to modulation of mRNA translation. We highlight the current evidence demonstrating their involvement in the immune response, as well as how tsRNAs modulate immunity to influence tumor growth and spread, autoimmune disease pathology and infection by pathogens. We surmise that tsRNAs are likely informative as diagnostic markers of cellular homeostasis and disease, and that therapeutic targeting of tsRNAs could be beneficial for a range of human diseases. Improved knowledge on the functions for tsRNAs in the mammalian immune system will enable us to leverage tsRNAs for their effective clinical use as treatments for human health challenges."
"Since late 2019, humanity has faced the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The continuous evolution of SARS-CoV-2 has led to the emergence of multiple Variants of Concern (VOCs) and Variants of Interest (VOIs), posing significant risks to global health. SARS-CoV-2 infects host cells via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors, facilitated by the spike (S) protein. Icetexane diterpenes, including brussonol and komaroviquinone, exhibit notable anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antiviral, antiproliferative, and anticancer properties. Recent research has explored their potential as inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 3Clpro protease, showing promising efficacy comparable to Nirmatrelvir. This study investigates brussonol and komaroviquinone as potential inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.2 variant spike protein using molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, and quantum biochemistry approaches. The stability and interaction energies of brussonol, komaroviquinone, and mefloquine with the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.2 variant spike protein were evaluated. RMSD analysis demonstrated that komaroviquinone and mefloquine maintain more stable binding poses with the spike protein compared to various NAGs and glycans. Electrostatic potential maps revealed significant interactions with ASN603, a critical residue for ligand binding efficacy. Furthermore, this study addresses a gap in current research, as no studies were found that simulate the trimer of the SARS-CoV-2 BA.2 variant spike protein. Most existing studies focus on the monomer and often exclude the NAGs and glycans. This research underscores the importance of maintaining the NAGs and glycans in the trimer simulations, providing a more accurate representation of the protein's structure and its interactions with ligands. The findings indicate that both komaroviquinone and brussonol exhibit higher binding affinities compared to mefloquine. This study provides valuable insights into the molecular interactions of these compounds, highlighting their potential for further development as antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2."
We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of published prospective cohort studies and randomized controlled trials (RCT) assessing the association between a healthy dietary pattern and adult-onset asthma following the PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines.
"Mitochondria adapt to increased energy demands during muscle contraction by acutely altering metabolite fluxes and substrate oxidation. With age, an impaired mitochondrial metabolic response may contribute to reduced exercise tolerance and decreased skeletal muscle mass, specific force, increased overall fatty depositions in the skeletal muscle, frailty and depressed energy maintenance. We hypothesized that elevated energy stress in mitochondria with age alters the capacity of mitochondria to utilize different substrates following muscle contraction. To test this hypothesis, we used in vivo electrical stimulation to simulate high-intensity intervals (HII) or low intensity steady-state (LISS) exercise in young (5-7 months) and aged (27-29 months) male and female mice to characterize effects of age and sex on mitochondrial substrate utilization in skeletal muscle following contraction. Mitochondrial respiration using glutamate decreased in aged males following HII and glutamate oxidation was inhibited following HII in both the contracted and non-stimulated muscle of aged female muscle. Analyses of the muscle metabolome of female mice indicated that changes in metabolic pathways induced by HII and LISS contractions in young muscle are absent in aged muscle. To test improved mitochondrial function on substrate utilization following HII, we treated aged females with elamipretide (ELAM), a mitochondrially-targeted peptide shown to improve mitochondrial bioenergetics and restore redox status in aged muscle. ELAM removed inhibition of glutamate oxidation and showed increased metabolic pathway changes following HII, suggesting rescuing redox status and improving bioenergetic function in mitochondria from aged muscle increases glutamate utilization and enhances the metabolic response to muscle contraction in aged muscle. KEY POINTS: Acute local contraction of gastrocnemius can systemically alter mitochondrial respiration in non-stimulated muscle. Age-related changes in mitochondrial respiration using glutamate or palmitoyl carnitine following contraction are sex-dependent. Respiration using glutamate after high-intensity contraction is inhibited in aged female muscle. Metabolite level and pathway changes following muscle contraction decrease with age in female mice. Treatment with the mitochondrially-targeted peptide elamipretide can partially rescue metabolite response to muscle contraction."
"The immune system is of pivotal importance with regard to the development and maintenance of mental illness. Aberrant cytokine levels are significant immune markers, and research is increasingly focusing on the complement system and the gut-brain axis. The efficacy and safety of immunomodulatory interventions are currently the subject of clinical studies. Hence, this review is timeline and relevant to evaluate the latest evidence on the clinical value of immunomodulatory treatments from studies over the past 18 months in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and unipolar depression."
"Research underscores the urgent need for technological innovations to treat lung tissue damage from viral infections and the lasting impact of COVID-19. Our study demonstrates the effectiveness of recombinant human NV1 protein in promoting a pro-healing extracellular matrix that regulates homeostasis in response to excessive tissue reactions caused by infection and injury. NV1 achieves this by calibrating multiple biological mechanisms, including reducing hyperinflammatory cytokine levels (e.g., IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-10, and IP-10), enhancing the production of proteins involved in viral inactivation and clearance through endocytosis and phagocytosis (e.g., IL-9, IL-1α), regulating pro-clotting and thrombolytic pathways (e.g., downregulates SERPINE 1 and I-TAC during Th1-mediated inflammation), maintaining cell survival under hypoxic conditions via HIF-1α regulation through the M3K5-JNK-AP-1 and TSC2-mTOR pathways, and promoting blood vessel formation. Our findings reveal NV1 as a potential therapeutic candidate for treating severe lung injuries caused by inflammatory and hypoxic conditions from viral infections and related diseases."
"An increasing body of evidence indicates that dysregulation of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in cellular processes is implicated in the development of diverse tumors. Nevertheless, the association between LLPS and the prognosis, as well as the tumor immune microenvironment, in individuals with colon cancer remains poorly understood."
"G-quadruplex (G4), an important secondary structure of nucleic acids, is polymorphic in structure. G4 monomers can associate with each other to form multimers, which show better application performance than monomers in some aspects. G4 dimers, the simplest and most widespread multimeric structures, are often used as a representative for studying multimers. RHAU, a G4 ligand, has been reported to recognize G4 dimers. However, there are few reports focusing on interactions between RHAU and different G4 dimers. In this work, interactions between RHAU peptide and six G4 dimers were investigated by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). It was revealed that compared to the hybrid G4 monomer, the hybrid tandem unstacked G4 dimer could form special binding sites, leading to a weak interaction with RHAU. It was also found that the steric hindrance at terminal G-tetrads of a special Z-G4 structure greatly weakened their interactions with RHAU. Additionally, RHAU exhibited stronger interactions with intermolecular stacked/interlocked parallel dimers than with intramolecular tandem stacked parallel dimers. This work enriches the understanding of interactions between RHAU and G4 dimers, which is conducive to the elucidation of G4 polymorphism, and provides a strong reference for studying G4 multimer-peptide interactions."
"Atypical basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors, which lack the basic region for DNA binding, are important elements of brassinosteroid (BR) signaling. Recently, our systematic characterization of the rice (Oryza sativa) INCREASED LEAF INCLINATION (ILI) subfamily of atypical bHLHs revealed their indispensable roles in BR-mediated growth and development. Here, we reported the isolation of two additional rice ILI-interacting atypical bHLHs, ATBS1-INTERACTING FACTOR 1 (OsAIF1)/OsbHLH176 and OsAIF2/OsbHLH178. Genetic and cytological analyses of the OsAIFs knockout mutants and overexpression lines revealed that OsAIF1 and OsAIF2 negatively regulate rice leaf inclination and grain size in a synergistic and redundant manner. Compared to the wild-type, osaif knockout mutants exhibited hypersensitivity to BR, while OsAIF1 and OsAIF2 overexpression lines showed greatly reduced sensitivity or complete insensitivity to BR, indicating that these two OsAIFs act as major negative regulators of rice BR signaling. As ILI-interacting negative atypical HLHs, OsAIF1 and OsAIF2 genetically counteracted the positive ILI subfamily of atypical HLHs. Moreover, OsAIF1 and OsAIF2 physically interacted with and antagonized OsbHLH92, a positive regulator of BR signaling, thereby modulating rice development and gene transcription. These findings suggested that the atypical HLHs (ILIs and OsAIF1/OsAIF2) and the bHLH (OsbHLH92) transcription factors form a triantagonistic cascade in rice, counteracting each other to fine-tune leaf angle and grain size through BR signaling. Our results provide insights into the mechanisms balancing BR signaling and growth in rice."
"Pancreas divisum (PD) is a congenital malformation of the pancreas and is implicated as a cause of pancreatitis. The role of endotherapy has been variable in symptomatic PD indicated by recurrent acute pancreatitis (RAP), chronic pancreatitis (CP), or chronic pancreatic-type abdominal pain (PP). The aim of this study was to analyze the pooled data to determine the success of endoscopic intervention for pancreas divisum."
"To add to the limited evidence on forensic medical and psychological evaluations of children experiencing distress migration and seeking asylum in the United States, this paper describes the sociodemographic characteristics, nature of human rights violations, and guardianship status of the children served by the Human Rights Clinic of Miami from 2010 to 2021. Through a retrospective study of affidavits, we identified trends among sociodemographic characteristics and types of human rights violations and used bivariate analysis to determine factors associated with guardianship. Children constituted 17% of all evaluations conducted during this period. Approximately half were male, and two-thirds were aged 15-17 years. Honduras was the most common country of origin, and physical violence was the most reported human rights abuse, followed by gang violence. Most children reported being detained at the United States-Mexico border. Only a third had a guardian present during the evaluation, with guardianship significantly more likely for younger children. This study provides insight into the health needs of children affected by distress migration. It underscores how children's experiences of forced migration and the barriers they face in accessing essential safeguards illustrate critical gaps in protecting their right to health."
"Infant acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is an aggressive malignancy that has historically been associated with a very poor prognosis. Despite large cooperative international trials and incremental increases in intensity of therapy, there has been no significant improvement in outcome over the last 3 decades. Using representative cases, we highlight the key differences between KMT2A-rearranged and KMT2A-germ line infant ALL, and how advances in molecular diagnostics are unpicking KMT2A-germ line genetics and guiding treatment reduction. We focus on KM2TA-rearranged infant B-cell ALL for which the last few years have seen the emergence of novel therapies that both are more effective and less toxic than conventional chemotherapy. Of these, there is promising early data on the efficacy and tolerability of the bispecific T-cell engager monoclonal antibody, blinatumomab, as well as the use of autologous and allogeneic chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy. We discuss how we can improve risk stratification and incorporate these new agents to replace the most toxic elements of currently deployed intensive chemotherapy schedules with their associated unacceptable toxicity."
"Peritoneal adhesion (PA) refers to the abnormal adhesion of the peritoneum either with the peritoneum itself or with tissues and organs that is caused by abdominopelvic surgery, abdominal infection or peritoneal inflammation. PA is associated with various clinical complications, such as abdominal pain and distension, intestinal obstruction, gastrointestinal disorders and female infertility, and adversely affects the quality of life of patients. Macrophages are essential for PA formation and can undergo polarization into classically activated macrophages (M1) and alternatively activated macrophages (M2), which are influenced by the peritoneal microenvironment. By releasing proinflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species, M1 macrophages promote peritoneal inflammatory reactions and the resultant formation of adhesion. In contrast, M2 macrophages secrete anti-inflammatory cytokines and growth factors to inhibit PA formation and to promote repair and healing of peritoneal tissues, and thereby play a significant anti-inflammatory role. This review comprehensively explores the function and mechanism of macrophages and their subtypes in PA formation to gain insight into the prevention and treatment of PA based on the modulation of macrophages."
"Immunogenic cell death (ICD) spatiotemporally regulates damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) derived from dying cancer cells to signal the immune response. Intriguingly, these DAMPs and cytokines also induce cellular responses in non-immune cells, particularly cancer cells. Several ICD-modulating natural products and miRNAs have been reported to regulate the DAMP, cytokine, and cell death responses, but they lack systemic organization and connection. This review summarizes the impacts of natural products and miRNAs on the DAMP and cytokine responses and cancer cell death responses (apoptosis, autophagy, ferroptosis, necroptosis, and pyroptosis). We establish the rationale that ICD inducers of natural products have modulating effects on miRNAs, targeting DAMPs and cytokines for immune and cancer cell death responses. In conclusion, DAMP, cytokine, and cell death responses are intricately linked in cancer cells, and they are influenced by ICD-modulating natural products and miRNAs."
"Low- and middle-income countries experience high injury-related mortality rates, with road traffic crashes being a significant contributor in Nigeria. Data from trauma registries are crucial for designing and advocating for trauma intervention programmes. However, there is limited research to inform the development of trauma registries in a Nigerian setting. The aim of this study was to design a feasible prototype trauma registry (TR) including, scope of activities and registry components for University College Hospital (UCH), Ibadan, Nigeria."
"The emergence of drug-resistant Tuberculosis (TB) has made treatment challenging. Although fluoroquinolones (FQs) are used as key drugs in the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), the problem of FQs resistance is becoming increasingly serious. Rifampicin (RIF) resistance is considered a risk factor for FQs resistance. The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of RIF and isoniazid (INH) resistance on the FQs resistance in vitro experiment."

"Cortical morphometry is an intermediate phenotype that is closely related to the genetics and onset of major depressive disorder (MDD), and cortical morphometric networks are considered more relevant to disease mechanisms than brain regions. We sought to investigate changes in cortical morphometric networks in MDD and their relationship with genetic risk in healthy controls."
"This study aimed to describe asbestosis morbidity and mortality in two statewide samples. We considered trends, demographic disparities, and excess mortality."
"The Japanese health care system provides universal coverage with relatively low cost sharing and patients have a free choice of providers. Although Japan's government price controls have helped to restrain the growth in health care spending, the country's rapidly growing elderly population and adoption of new drugs and technologies have placed increased fiscal pressures on its health care system. Additionally, the Japanese health care system does not have the infrastructure in place to restrain utilization, which may be a key driver of increases in health care spending. Although the US health care system has many shortcomings, such as the highest health care prices among developed countries and a significant uninsured population, it has been able to manage utilization by using various tools, such as prior authorization and gatekeeping. The US health care system might be able to offer Japan some lessons on ways to reduce unnecessary utilization and supply to create greater value in its health care system."
"Most species of pheasants (Galliformes: Phasianidae) occur in Asia. In Pakistan, pheasants occur from 245-3050 m in altitude, and one of these, the Kalij pheasant (Lophura leucomelanos) is a large-bodied, brightly-colored habitat quality indicator species. The present study was designed to determine spatiotemporal variation, population size, and the relative abundance of Kalij pheasants in Haripur, Pakistan. The line transects and point count methods were used to collect direct (physical observations) and indirect signs (feathers and calls) to avoid double counting. Twenty field surveys were conducted along 16 transects with an area of 0.811 km2 in 4 study sites to quantify habitat utilization of Kalij pheasant. Kalij pheasant activities were observed at the start of dawn (0600 hours to 0730 hours) and ended by 1630 hours to 1800 hours dusk period with only a few sightings during the middle of the day. Study sites were selected based on confirmation of presence signs. Twenty-seven individuals with direct (16) and indirect (feather = 5, calls = 6) signs were encountered while walking along line transects. Twelve signs were counted (sightings = 3, Calls = 9) within the radius of 11-50 m in the point count method. Results showed that the Kalij pheasant occupied scrub forest with dense vegetation between 500-1100m away. The mean encounter rate of the Kalij pheasant was 0.82/km, which was higher from July to September. The sex ratio (1.17) is biased toward males in the overall population of Kalij pheasants. The estimated mean density of the Kalij pheasant in Haripur was 6.97 animals/km2, and the total abundance was 142 individuals. New potential sites may be identified and declared as protected areas, and awareness and support of the local community are recommended for the protection and management of the Kalij pheasant."
"Propionic and methylmalonic acidemias (PAcidemia and MMAcidemia, respectively) are genetic disorders clinically characterized by metabolic decompensation associated with life-threatening encephalopathic episodes in the neonatal period. Adequate and rapid therapeutic management is essential for patients' survival and prognosis. In this study, a restricted protein diet associated with L-carnitine (LC) supplementation was shown to decrease mortality and morbidity in patients affected by these disorders probably by decreasing the accumulation of the major metabolites and therefore their toxicity. Since oxidative stress was proposed as a contributing mechanism of tissue damage in PAcidemia and MMAcidemia and LC has potent antioxidant properties, our objective in this work was to investigate the effects of a long-term therapy consisting of reduced protein intake associated with LC supplementation on oxidative damage markers in patients affected by these diseases. We measured urinary isoprostanes, di-tyrosine, and oxidized guanine species, which reflect oxidative damage to lipids, proteins, and DNA/RNA, respectively, as well as the concentrations of NO products (nitrate plus nitrite) in patients untreated or submitted to short-term or a long-term treatment. Results revealed significant increases of isoprostanes, di-tyrosine, and oxidized guanine species, as well as a moderate nonsignificant increase of NO levels in the untreated patients, relatively to controls. Furthermore, these altered markers were attenuated after short-term treatment and normalized after prolonged treatment. In conclusion, data from this work show for the first time that long-standing treatment of patients with disorders of the propionate pathway can protect against oxidative damage. However, it remains to be elucidated whether oxidative stress identified in this study directly correlates with the clinical conditions of the affected patients."
Patients with solitary functioning kidney appear to be exposed to an increased cardiovascular risk. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of peripheral and central blood pressure on subclinical cardiovascular organ damage in a sample of children and adolescents with solitary functioning kidney.
"Puncture biopsy is a primary method for obtaining tissue or cell samples from tumors for histopathological diagnosis. However, patients often experience pain, anxiety, and discomfort during the procedure. Virtual reality is a novel technology developed through advancements in computer skill, and it is utilized in healthcare as a cognitive approach to relieve pain and relaxation. However, there is controversy in published trials regarding the efficacy of virtual reality in adults during puncture biopsy. Therefore, a synthesis of objective and accurate data is needed to support the efficacy of virtual reality for pain relief during puncture biopsy in adults."
"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a prevalent joint disorder that is characterized by the degeneration of articular cartilage in synovial joints. Most of the current treatment options for this disorder tend to focus on symptom management rather than addressing the underlying progression of the disease. Cartilage tissue engineering has emerged as a promising approach to address the limitations of current OA treatments, aiming to regenerate cartilage and restore the natural function of affected joints. Like any other tissue engineering field, cartilage tissue engineering uses different fabrication techniques and biomaterials to develop the constructs. Numerous studies over the last few years have demonstrated the preclinical efficacy of tissue-engineered constructs in promoting cartilage regeneration and highlight the potential of tissue-engineered constructs as a viable therapeutic approach for OA. This paper aims to provide a focused review of advancements in tissue-engineered constructs over the past decade. Specifically, we highlight the constructs based on natural, synthetic, and composite biomaterials and the varying conventional and advanced fabrication techniques. We also highlight the challenges in state-of-the-art cartilage tissue engineering that must be overcome in the upcoming years to fully replicate the complex anatomy of the native cartilage. We believe that continued collaborative research efforts among researchers from various facets of engineering and clinicians are required to advance the field of cartilage tissue engineering and become a viable OA therapy."
"Spinal cord injury (SCI) can lead to severe motor and sensory dysfunction, with a high rate of disability and mortality. Due to the complicated pathological process of SCI, there is no effective clinical treatment strategy at present. Although mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are effective in the treatment of SCI, their application is limited by factors such as low survival rate, cell dedifferentiation, tumorigenesis, blood-brain barrier, and immune rejection. Fortunately, there is growing evidence that most of the biological and therapeutic effects of MSCs may be mediated by the release of paracrine factors, which are extracellular vesicles called exosomes. Exosomes are small endosomal vesicles with bilaminar membranes that have recently been recognized as key mediators for communication between cells and tissues through the transfer of proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, cytokines, and growth factors. Mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes (MSC-exos) play a critical role in SCI repair by promoting angiogenesis and axonal growth, regulating inflammation and immune response, inhibiting apoptosis, and maintaining the integrity of the blood-spinal cord barrier. Furthermore, they can be used to transport genetic material or drugs to target cells, and their relatively small size allows them to permeate the blood-brain barrier. Studies have demonstrated that some exosomal miRNAs derived from MSCs play a significant role in the treatment of SCI. In this review, we summarize recent research advances in MSC-exos and exosomal miRNAs in SCI therapy to better understand this emerging cell-free therapeutic strategy and discuss the advantages and challenges of MSC-exos in future clinical applications."
"The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) provides breastfeeding support to participating women in low-income households. This study aimed to determine the relationships between prenatal maternal and household characteristics and breastfeeding duration, as well as whether these characteristics modify associations of prenatal breastfeeding intention with breastfeeding duration."
"A muscle's mechanical action is affected by its architecture. However, less is known about the architecture of muscles with broad attachments: ""end-divergent"" muscles. Potential regional variation of fascicle orientation in end-divergent muscles suggests that their mechanical action varies by region. Here, we comprehensively examined 3D architecture and potential action of the human gluteus maximus (typical end-divergent muscle) in vivo. The gluteus maximus fascicles were three-dimensionally reconstructed over the whole muscle belly using diffusion tensor imaging and tractography. We calculated the force fraction and moment-arm length about the hip joint for individual muscle fascicles, and their product (specific torque, an estimate of torque-generating capacity for a given cross-sectional area). We found that the specific torque for hip extension and external rotation tended to be greater in the distal than the other regions, whereas that for hip abduction appeared to be greater in the proximal than the other regions. Notably, the distal-lateral region exhibited a negative specific torque for hip abduction, indicating that fascicles in this region act for hip ""adduction"". These findings indicate that end-divergent architecture diversifies within-muscle mechanical action in terms of directions as well as magnitudes in vivo."
"Intravenous corticosteroid pulse therapy (IVPT) has been preferentially conducted for rapidly progressive alopecia areata (RP-AA); however, the evaluation of long-term outcomes has been insufficient. In this study, 106 IVPT-treated RP-AA patients (36 males and 70 females) who were followed up for more than 1 year and up to 6.8 years were retrospectively analyzed. The mean observation period was 1137.8 ± 587.9 days (range 380-2490). The mean severity of alopecia tool (SALT) score before IVPT was 21.3 ± 23.4 but whole-scalp hair loss was observed in all cases after the intervention, suggesting that IVPT was performed soon after the onset. With additional interventions represented by intralesional triamcinolone acetonide injection with or without topical potent corticosteroid for those who insufficiently responded at 6 months after IVPT, 64.2%, 14.2%, and 21.7% of the patients respectively achieved good response (GR; SALT score ≤25), moderate response (MR; 25 < SALT score <75), and poor response (PR; 75 ≤ SALT score) 1 year after IVPT. On the final evaluation, the proportions of patients with GR, MR, and PR were 79 (74.5%), 7 (6.6%), and 20 (18.9%). Sixteen patients achieved and maintained full hair regrowth with IVPT alone until the end of observation. A previously reported scoring system for the short-term outcome prediction was shown to be useful for distinguishing the final-point GR responders from PR responders (P = 0.003). Of note, 21 patients were found to have some symptoms suggestive of the existence of preceding infectious diseases and tended to relapse. The revised scoring system adding the absence of preceding infectious diseases as one factor successfully predicted the occurrence of the relapse in our cohort (P = 0.002). Taken together, previously unreported real-world efficacy of IVPT to RP-AA was elucidated with the invention of a tool putatively enabling optimal long-term management."
"Recently, we demonstrated that the oncolytic Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) strain PD-H can be efficiently adapted to resistant colorectal cancer cells through dose-dependent passaging in colorectal cancer cells. However, the method is time-consuming, which limits its clinical applicability. Here, we investigated whether the manufacturing time of the adapted virus can be reduced by replacing the dose-based passaging with volume-based passaging. For this purpose, the murine colorectal carcinoma cell line MC38, resistant to PD-H-induced lysis, was initially infected with PD-H at 0.1 multiplicity of infection (MOI). For subsequent passages, 15-30 µL of a 1:10 dilution of the cell culture supernatant was transferred to fresh MC38 cells early after virus-induced cell lysis became visible. By virus passage 10, complete cell lysis of MC38 cells was achieved. Sequencing of the passage 10 virus (P-10) revealed two nucleotide substitutions in the 5' UTR and six amino acid changes in the viral polyprotein compared to the PD-H founder. P-10, however, consisted of a heterogeneous virus population. Therefore, the detected mutations were introduced into the cDNA of PD-H, from which the recombinant virus PD-MC38 was generated. PD-MC38 exhibited significantly enhanced replication and lytic activity in MC38 cells compared to PD-H, whereas its oncolytic activity in other colorectal cancer cell lines was comparable to or even lower than that of PD-H. These findings demonstrate that volume-based passaging is suitable to generate tumor cell-specific adapted PD-H. Moreover, compared to the dose-dependent passaging, volume-based passaging significantly reduced the time required to generate the adapted virus."

"This study aimed to explore the synergistic effect of lipid accumulation product (LAP) and visceral adiposity index (VAI) on diabetes risk, and to evaluate the potential associations of these novel metabolic markers with diabetes. The current cross-sectional survey utilised data from the 2015-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). The relationship between LAP and VAI levels and diabetes was examined using multiple logistic regression analysis. Moreover, threshold effects analysis and smoothed curve fitting were used as analytical techniques. The diabetes group exhibited significantly higher LAP (90.1 ± 84.1) and VAI (2.8 ± 2.8) levels compared to the non-diabetes group (p < 0.0001).After adjusting for confounding factors, LAP (OR = 1.01, 95% CI: 1.00-1.01, p < 0.0001) and VAI (OR = 1.22, 95% CI: 1.16-1.28, p < 0.0001) were independently associated with diabetes risk. The interaction term (LAP x VAI) showed a significant synergistic effect (OR = 1.01, 95% CI: 1.00-1.07, p = 0.0042).Diabetes risk significantly increased when LAP was below 97.70 (OR = 1.03, 95% CI: 1.02-1.03, p < 0.0001) and when VAI was below 3.76 (OR = 1.88, 95% CI: 1.69-2.08, p < 0.0001). According to this study, LAP and VAI are independent predictors of diabetes risk and exhibit a significant synergistic effect. Combining these indices may improve the accuracy of diabetes screening."
A sensor array that can distinguish ochratoxins based on the fluorescence of the albumin-ochratoxin complex has been developed. This sensor array enabled the identification of ochratoxins and their mixtures in real food samples.
"A person's age estimation from biological evidence is a crucial aspect of forensic investigations, aiding in victim identification and criminal profiling. In this study, we present a novel approach of utilizing Attenuated Total Reflection Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR FT-IR) spectroscopy to predict the age of donors based on nail samples. A diverse dataset comprising nails from donors spanning different age groups was analyzed using ATR FT-IR, with subsequent multivariate analysis techniques used for age prediction. The developed partial least squares regression (PLS-R) model demonstrated promising accuracy in age estimation, with a root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) equal to 11.1 during external validation. Additionally, a partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) classification model achieved high accuracy of 88% in classifying donors into younger and older age groups during external validation. This proof-of-concept study highlights the potential of ATR FT-IR spectroscopy as a non-destructive and efficient tool for age estimation in forensic investigations, offering a new approach to forensic analysis with practical implications."
"In this study, the influences of various concentrations of β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) on the gelation properties of curdlan thermo-irreversible gels were evaluated. The results revealed that water-holding capacity and freeze-thaw stability of the curdlan/β-CD complex gels initially increased but then decreased with increasing β-CD concentration, with the curdlan gel containing 1 % (w/v) β-CD demonstrating the best performance. Moreover, textural characteristics including hardness, gumminess, cohesiveness, and chewiness exhibited similar trends, but springiness showed minor effect. Compared with the pure curdlan gel, the curdlan/β-CD mixed gels exhibited better elastic behavior and greater thermal stability but lower crystallinity. Additionally, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the curdlan/β-CD composite gels revealed fine network structures with relatively continuous pores. The intermolecular hydrogen bonds between curdlan and β-CD were responsible for the enhanced gel properties. Thus, these data suggest that the inclusion of β-CD ameliorates the texture and stability of the curdlan gel by forming hydrogen bonds."
"Down syndrome (DS) or trisomy 21 (T21) is present in a significant number of children and adults around the world and is associated with cognitive and medical challenges. Through research, the T21 Research Society (T21RS), established in 2014, unites a worldwide community dedicated to understanding the impact of T21 on biological systems and improving the quality of life of people with DS across the lifespan. T21RS hosts an international conference every two years to support collaboration, dissemination, and information sharing for this goal. In 2022, T21RS hosted an international conference in Long Beach, California, from June 9 to 12. The conference, attended by 483 people including scientists, families, self-advocates, and industry representatives from 17 countries, was a dynamic and interactive meeting that shared discoveries from international research teams. This summary highlights the scientific discoveries shared at the 4th T21RS meeting with the Imagine, Discover, Inspire theme."

"Apple pomace, a by-product of apple juice production, is typically discarded as waste. Recent approaches have focused on utilizing apple pomace by extracting beneficial bioactive compounds, such as antioxidant phenolic compounds (PCs). Before these PC-rich extracts can be used in food products, they must undergo food preservation and processing methods. However, the effects of these processes on the composition, stability, and properties of the PC remain insufficiently understood. The present study aimed at investigating the effects of a thermal treatment (TT), a high-pressure thermal treatment (HPTT), and a pulsed electric field treatment (PEF) on the composition and antioxidant activity of PC-rich apple pomace extracts (APEs). Major PCs, including phloridzin, chlorogenic acid, and epicatechin, as well as minor compounds, were identified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC). As a stability indicative property, the antioxidant activity was analyzed by a Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity assay (TEAC), electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, and the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent assay. The results showed that TT at 80 °C increased phloridzin content, likely due to the hydrolysis of bound forms, while higher temperatures and HPTT resulted in a substantial PC conversion. The PEF treatment also caused notable PC conversion, but generally, it had a milder effect compared to TT and HPTT. Hence, low temperatures with and without high pressure and PEF seem to be the most promising treatments for preserving the highest content of major PC in APE. Antioxidant activity varied among the analytical methods, with HPTT showing minor changes despite PC loss compared to the untreated APE. This suggests that other antioxidant compounds in the extracts may contribute to the overall antioxidant activity. This study demonstrates that apple pomace contains valuable PC, highlighting its potential as a health-promoting food additive and the impact of conventional preservation and processing methods on PC stability."
"Several cannabis plant-derived compounds, especially cannabinoids, exhibit therapeutic potential in numerous diseases and conditions. In particular, THC and CBD impart palliative, antiemetic, as well as anticancer effects. The antitumor effects include inhibition of cancerous cell growth and metastasis and induction of cell death, all mediated by cannabinoid interaction with the endocannabinoid system (ECS). However, the exact molecular mechanisms are still poorly understood. In addition, their effects on leukemia have scarcely been investigated. The current work aimed to assess the antileukemic effects of CBN and CBG on an acute monocytic leukemia cell line, the THP-1. THP-1 cell viability, morphology and cell cycle analyses were performed to determine potential cytotoxic, antiproliferative, and apoptotic effects of CBN and CBG. Western blotting was carried out to measure the expression of the proapoptotic p53. Both CBN and CBG inhibited cell growth and induced THP-1 cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in a dose- and time-dependent manner. CBN and CBG illustrated different dosage effects on THP-1 cells in the MTT assay (CBN > 40 μΜ, CBG > 1 μM) and flow cytometry (CBN > 5 μM, CBG > 40 μM), highlighting the cannabinoids' antileukemic activity. Our study hints at a direct correlation between p53 expression and CBG or CBN doses exceeding 50 μM, suggesting potential activation of p53-associated signaling pathways underlying these effects. Taken together, CBG and CBN exhibited suppressive, cell death-inducing effects on leukemia cells. However, further in-depth research will be needed to explore the molecular mechanisms driving the anticancer effects of CBN and CBG in the leukemia setting."
"Neuromorphic engineering has emerged as a promising avenue for developing brain-inspired computational systems. However, conventional electronic AI-based processors often encounter challenges related to processing speed and thermal dissipation. As an alternative, optical implementations of such processors have been proposed, capitalizing on the intrinsic information-processing capabilities of light. Among the various Optical Neural Networks (ONNs) explored within the realm of optical neuromorphic engineering, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have exhibited notable success in emulating the computational principles of the human brain. The event-based spiking nature of optical SNNs offers capabilities in low-power operation, speed, temporal processing, analog computing, and hardware efficiency that are difficult or impossible to match with other ONN types. In this work, we introduce the pioneering Free-space Optical Deep Spiking Convolutional Neural Network (OSCNN), a novel approach inspired by the computational model of the human eye. Our OSCNN leverages free-space optics to enhance power efficiency and processing speed while maintaining high accuracy in pattern detection. Specifically, our model employs Gabor filters in the initial layer for effective feature extraction, and utilizes optical components such as Intensity-to-Delay conversion and a synchronizer, designed using readily available optical components. The OSCNN was rigorously tested on benchmark datasets, including MNIST, ETH80, and Caltech, demonstrating competitive classification accuracy. Our comparative analysis reveals that the OSCNN consumes only 1.6 W of power with a processing speed of 2.44 ms, significantly outperforming conventional electronic CNNs on GPUs, which typically consume 150-300 W with processing speeds of 1-5 ms, and competing favorably with other free-space ONNs. Our contributions include addressing several key challenges in optical neural network implementation. To ensure nanometer-scale precision in component alignment, we propose advanced micro-positioning systems and active feedback control mechanisms. To enhance signal integrity, we employ high-quality optical components, error correction algorithms, adaptive optics, and noise-resistant coding schemes. The integration of optical and electronic components is optimized through the design of high-speed opto-electronic converters, custom integrated circuits, and advanced packaging techniques. Moreover, we utilize highly efficient, compact semiconductor laser diodes and develop novel cooling strategies to minimize power consumption and footprint."
"People value solitude in varying degrees. Theories and studies suggest that people's appreciation of solitude varies considerably across persons (e.g., an introverted person may value solitude more than an extraverted person), and solitude experiences (i.e., on average, people may value some functions of solitude, e.g., privacy, more than other functions, e.g., self-discovery). What are the unique contributions of these two sources?"
"Available large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary datasets predominantly stem from European populations, while sample sizes for other ethnicities, notably Central/South Asian, East Asian, African, Hispanic, etc., remain comparatively limited, resulting in low precision of causal effect estimations within these ethnicities when using Mendelian randomization (MR). In this paper, we propose a trans-ethnic MR method, TEMR, to improve the statistical power and estimation precision of MR in a target population that is underrepresented, using trans-ethnic large-scale GWAS summary datasets. TEMR incorporates trans-ethnic genetic correlation coefficients through a conditional likelihood-based inference framework, producing calibrated p values with substantially improved MR power. In the simulation study, compared with other existing MR methods, TEMR exhibited superior precision and statistical power in causal effect estimation within the target populations. Finally, we applied TEMR to infer causal relationships between concentrations of 16 blood biomarkers and the risk of developing five diseases (hypertension, ischemic stroke, type 2 diabetes, schizophrenia, and major depression disorder) in East Asian, African, and Hispanic/Latino populations, leveraging biobank-scale GWAS summary data obtained from individuals of European descent. We found that the causal biomarkers were mostly validated by previous MR methods, and we also discovered 17 causal relationships that were not identified using previously published MR methods."
"Co-formulated dolutegravir and lamivudine (DTG/3TC) is recommended as the first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART); however, the data on the viral decay in seminal plasma (SP) and blood plasma (BP), as well as changes in inflammatory biomarkers in BP, remain limited among antiretroviral-naïve people with HIV (PWH) receiving DTG/3TC. A prospective observational cohort study was conducted to compare the impact of DTG/3TC vs. bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (BIC/FTC/TAF) on viral decay kinetics and changes in inflammatory biomarkers in antiretroviral-naïve PWH."

"Autonomic regulation has been identified as a potential regulator of pain via vagal nerve mediation, assessed through heart rate variability (HRV). Non-invasive vagal nerve stimulation (nVNS) and heart rate variability biofeedback (HRVB) have been proposed to modulate pain.

This systematic review compared interventions of nVNS and HRVB in adults with long-standing pain conditions."
"Bronchopulmonary neuroendocrine neoplasms (BP-NENs) account for approximately 30% of all NENs. Although BP-NENs and NENs of the gastroenteropancreatic organs (GEP-NENs) share morphological and molecular features, they differ in terms of their terminology and classification. Bronchopulmonary neuroendocrine tumors (BP-NETs) have classically been termed as carcinoid and grouped into typical (TC) and atypical carcinoid (AC) based on the presence or absence of necrosis and mitotic count. In the most recent World Health Organization (WHO) classification for NENs of endocrine organs (WHO 2022), BP-NETs-NET G1 and G2-are introduced as synonyms of TC and AC, respectively. However, the Ki-67 index, which defines the grade of NETs in digestive organs, is only discussed in the descriptive text and not included into the criteria for classification of BP-NENs. In addition, well-differentiated NENs with high mitotic counts which correspond to NET G3 in the GEP organ system are not defined. This review discusses the role of Ki-67 for a proper classification of BP-NETs/carcinoids."
"This study aimed to evaluate the applicability of the 10-minute submaximal treadmill test (T10 test), a self-paced test, in determining critical speed (CS) and predicting running performance. Specifically, we sought to identify the percentage of T10 velocity (vT10) that runners performed in official distance races, and to compare physiological and performance indicators between sexes. 60 recreational runners (n=34 males and n=26 females) underwent a maximum incremental test, the novel T10 test, and ran 1200-m and 2400-m on the track. Runners self-reported their best performance times. Generalized Linear Model was used to compare running performances between sexes. For both males and females, the %vT10 in 5 km, 10 km, and half-marathon races occurred at 107.5% and 106.5%, 99.9% and 100.8%, and 92.6% and 97.1%, respectively. There was no interaction effect (p=0.520) and no main effect of sex (p=0.443). There was a main effect of distance (p<0.001), indicating that %vT10 in the 5km race differed from that found in the 10 km race (p=0.012), as well as in the half-marathon (p<0.001). Our findings suggest that %vT10 values can be used to determine pace in recreational endurance runners for race distances regardless of sex."
"Glycogen Storage Disease Type Ib (GSD-Ib) is a rare autosomal recessive metabolic disorder caused by mutations in SLC37A4, leading to a deficiency in glucose-6-phosphate translocase. This disorder is characterized by impaired glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, resulting in clinical and metabolic manifestations. We report a three-month-old Moroccan female patient presenting with doll-like facies, hepatomegaly, dysmorphic features, and developmental delays. Laboratory analysis revealed hypoglycemia, elevated triglyceride levels, hypercalcemia, and neutropenia. Genetic testing confirmed a homozygous pathogenic variant in SLC37A4 and a heterozygous variant of uncertain significance in TBX1. Initial management included a lactose-free and galactose-free diet, multivitamin supplementation, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) therapy to address neutropenia. A novel aspect of this case involves hypercalcemia as an unusual finding in GSD-Ib and the co-occurrence of a variant in the TBX1 gene, which is not typically associated with the disease but may contribute to the patient's clinical presentation. These findings add a new dimension to our understanding of GSD-Ib and suggest potential avenues for future research to elucidate these genetic interactions and their impact on clinical outcomes."
"Falls among older adults are considered a significant global health concern, often leading to severe injuries and increased healthcare costs. Fall-risk-increasing drugs (FRIDs), such as opioids and benzodiazepines, have been identified as contributing factors, yet the causal relationship remains unclear. This study examined the association between FRIDs, identified using the STOPP version 2 and STOPP Fall criteria, and falls among older outpatients."
"In liposomal drug delivery development, the delicate balance of membrane stability is a major challenge to prevent leakage (during shelf-life and blood circulation), and to ensure efficient payload release at the therapeutic destination. Our composite screening approach uses the processing by dual centrifugation technique to speed up the identification of de novo formulations of intermediate membrane stability. By screening binary lipid combinations at systemically varied ratios we highlight liposomal formulations of intermediate stability, what we termed ""the edge of stability"", requiring moderate stimuli for destabilization. Supplementation with a pH-sensitive cholesterol derivative (to obtain acid labile liposomes) and renewed assessment with cargo load led to the discovery of three formulations with sufficient shelf-life stability, acceptable cargo retention and efficient pH-responsive cargo release in vitro. The ""lead candidates"" exhibited promising in cellulo uptake with increased intracellular cargo release and revealed in vivo performance advantages compared to a control liposome. Our approach filters lipid compositions on ""the edge of stability"" that were introduced with a pH-sensitive cholesterol derivate leading pH-responsive liposomes, out of a multidimensional parameter space. Their discovery by rational approaches would have been highly unlikely, thus highlighting the potential of our screening approach."
"In the Drosophila brain, neuronal diversity originates from approximately 100 neural stem cells, each dividing asymmetrically. Precise mapping of cell lineages at the single-cell resolution is crucial for understanding the mechanisms that direct neuronal specification. However, existing methods for high-resolution lineage tracing are notably time-consuming and labor-intensive. Here, we outline the best practices for lineage tracing using CLADES (cell lineage access driven by an edition sequence), a revolutionary approach to neuronal lineage tracing that addresses the limitations of previous methods. CLADES effectively traces the birth order of neurons using approximately 100 samples. The technique relies on a genetic cascade of reporter activations and deactivations that delineate lineage progression through color-coded markers. This system not only facilitates the detailed mapping of neuronal lineages but also holds the potential to be applied to tracking biological events and producing cell types for therapeutic purposes."

"Immunotherapy has shown significant improvement in the survival of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) compared to TKIs as first-line treatment. Unfortunately, approximately 30% of HCC exhibits intrinsic resistance to ICIs, making new therapeutic combinations urgently needed. The dysregulation of the Notch signaling pathway observed in HCC can affect immune cell response, reducing the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. Here, we provide an overview of how Notch signaling regulates immune responses and present the therapeutic rationale for combining Notch signaling inhibition with ICIs to improve HCC treatment. Moreover, we propose using exosomes as non-invasive tools to assess Notch signaling activation in hepatic cancer cells, enabling accurate stratification of patients who can benefit from combined strategies."
"More than half of patients with cancer receive radiotherapy, which often requires daily treatments for several weeks. The impact of geographic and sociodemographic factors on the odds of patients with cancer being recommended radiotherapy, starting radiotherapy, and completing radiotherapy is not well understood."
"This study aims to formulate a consensus on primary care physicians' leadership competencies tailored to Indonesia's rural and remote health systems using the LEADS framework. Effective physician leaders are essential in these settings; however, many physicians lack the necessary leadership qualifications due to insufficient training. From a medical education perspective, this issue is further compounded by the lack of consensus on leadership course content."
"Real-time reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is a powerful tool for analysing target gene expression in biological samples. To achieve reliable results by RT-qPCR, the most stable reference genes must be selected for proper data normalisation, particularly when comparing cells of different types. We aimed to choose the least variable candidate reference genes among eight housekeeping genes tested within a set of human cancer cell lines (HeLa, MCF-7, SK-UT-1B, A549, A431, SK-BR-3), as well as four lines of normal, non-malignant mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) of different origins."
"The present study explored the determinants influencing students' intentions towards utilizing digital learning technologies (DLTs). It proposes a holistic view model for students' utilization of digital learning technologies by integrating social support theory and the ""Technology Acceptance Model"" (TAM). Data were gathered from 262 students of the University of Ha'il through utilizing a questionnaire. Two steps in SEM were applied for data analysis: CFA was employed to develop the model measurement, and SEM was conducted to analyze the relationships between constructs. The results revealed that ""Educational Support"" (EDS) significantly affected students' ""behavior intention"" (BI) to utilize digital learning technologies through perceived usefulness (PU) (EDS→PU: β = 0.338, p < 0.05). Furthermore, ""Emotional support"" (EMS) significantly affected behavioral intention through both ""perceived ease of use"" (PEU) and PU (EMS→PEU: β = 0.635, p < 0.05; EMS→PU: β = 0.310, p < 0.05). Surprisingly, students' ""perceived ease of use"" (PEU) did not affect digital learning technologies' ""perceived usefulness"" (PU) (PEU→PU: β = 0.195, p > 0.05). The present study contributes to a refined understanding of how educational and emotional support influence students' receptivity towards and engagement with learning technologies. Thus, institutions and universities should enhance their students' educational and emotional support to facilitate the successful utilization of digital learning technologies. Furthermore, the study revealed that PU and PEU affected students' intentions to utilize DLTs. Thus, PU and PEU can enhance the utilization of digital learning technologies. This study provides practical implications that educational institutions and universities could apply to achieve successful usage of these digital learning technologies."
"The growing number of athletes diagnosed with cancer requires a better understanding of their background, experiences, and specific goals to provide personalized care. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore the lived experiences of collegiate athletes in the United States diagnosed with cancer, reflecting on various barriers and challenges because of their cancer diagnosis, as they relate to their athletic participation and educational experiences."
"Metabolic exchange is one of the foundations of symbiotic associations between organisms and is a driving force in evolution. In the ocean, photosymbiosis between heterotrophic hosts and microalgae is powered by photosynthesis and relies on the transfer of organic carbon to the host (e.g. sugars). Yet, the identity of transferred carbohydrates as well as the molecular mechanisms that drive this exchange remain largely unknown, especially in unicellular photosymbioses that are widespread in the open ocean. Combining genomics, single-holobiont transcriptomics, and environmental metatranscriptomics, we revealed the transportome of the marine microalga Phaeocystis in symbiosis within acantharia, with a focus on sugar transporters. At the genomic level, the sugar transportome of Phaeocystis is comparable to non-symbiotic haptophytes. By contrast, we found significant remodeling of the expression of the transportome in symbiotic microalgae compared to the free-living stage. More particularly, 36% of sugar transporter genes were differentially expressed. Several of them, such as GLUTs, TPTs, and aquaporins, with glucose, triose-phosphate sugars, and glycerol as potential substrates, were upregulated at the holobiont and community level. We also showed that algal sugar transporter genes exhibit distinct temporal expression patterns during the day. This reprogramed transportome indicates that symbiosis has a major impact on sugar fluxes within and outside the algal cell, and highlights the complexity and the dynamics of metabolic exchanges between partners. This study improves our understanding of the molecular players of the metabolic connectivity underlying the ecological success of planktonic photosymbiosis and paves the way for more studies on transporters across photosymbiotic models."
"Human hair, particularly on the scalp, serves as a significant aspect of social identity and well-being. The exposome, encompassing both intrinsic and extrinsic factors, plays a fundamental role in hair weathering. Intrinsic factors include genetic predispositions and physiological changes within the body, while extrinsic factors comprise environmental exposures such as UV radiation, pollution, humidity, temperature variations, lifestyle choices, and chemical treatments. These elements collectively contribute to the cumulative damage experienced by hair over time. Understanding the comprehensive impact of the exposome on hair health and hair aging necessitates an exploration of various environmental conditions, lifestyle factors, and technical artifacts. Despite advancements in research, the intricate mechanisms underlying the exposome influence on hair remain incompletely understood. Through a comprehensive review of current literature and emerging research findings, this study aims to enhance the understanding of exposome impact on hair health."

"Non-IgA vasculitis is a rare disease that belongs to the group of small-vessel vasculitides. Due to nomenclature and classification changes introduced in 2018, there are few published data under this name. The aim of this study is to characterize non-IgA vasculitis as an independent vasculitis entity in terms of demographic, clinical, and treatment-related features. A retrospective data analysis of patients with biopsy-confirmed non-IgA vasculitis treated at the Department of Dermatology at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf between January 1, 2018, and December 31, 2022, was performed. A total of 28 patients with non-IgA vasculitis were included; 53.6% (15/28) were women and 42.9% (12/28) were older than 71 years. Previous infection as a possible triggering factor was found in 42.6% (12/28) of the cases. Palpable purpura was the most common skin finding (78.6%, 22/28) and 28.6% patients (8/28) had skin lesions above the waist. On direct immunofluorescence, C3 (89.3%, 25/28) was the most frequent deposition, followed by fibrinogen (71.4%, 20/28) and IgM (53.6%, 15/28). Hospitalization was required in 85.7% (24/28), with a mean hospital stay of 9.4 ± 4.1 days. No fatal courses were reported. This study is the first characterization of non-IgA vasculitis based on patient cases from Germany and contributes to a better understanding of non-IgA vasculitis as an independent entity. Non-IgA vasculitis primarily affects older patients of both sexes, with most cases having an identifiable trigger. Our results indicate that cutaneous manifestations often extend beyond the lower legs. Treatment is usually required in the inpatient setting and requires a longer stay than other dermatological conditions. With proper treatment, the disease is not expected to be fatal."
"Objective The purpose of this study was to investigate how miR-200b-3p inhibitors the proliferation and metastasis of endometrial cancer(EC) cells by inducing the expression of FOS-like antigen 2(FOSL2) of activator protein 1(AP1) transcription family. Methods Endometrial cancer cell line HEC-1-A was divided into 12 groups: NC-mimic (transfected with negative control NC mimic), miR-200b-3p mimic (transfected with miR-200b-3p mimic), NC-inhibitor (transfected with negative control NC inhibitor), miR-200b-3p inhibitor group (transfected with miR-200b-3p inhibitor), si-NC (transfected with negative control Si-NC), si-FOSL2 (transfected with si-FOSL2), oe-NC (transfected with negative control oe-NC), oe-FOSL2 group (oe-FOSL2), miR-200b-3p mimic+oe-NC group (co-transfected with miR-200b-3p mimic and oe-NC), miR-200b-3p mimic+oe-FOSL2 group (co-transfected with miR-200b-3p mimic and oe-FOSL2), miR-200b-3p inhibitor+si-NC group (co-transfected with miR-200b-3p inhibitor and si-NC), miR-200b-3p inhibitor+si-FOSL2 group (co-transfected with miR-200b-3p inhibitor and si-FOSL2). Real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR, Western blot, CCK-8 assay, scratch test and Transwell assay were used to detect the expression of miR-200b-3p mRNA, FOSL2 mRNA and protein expression level, cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Results In endometrial cancer cell lines, the expression of miR-200b-3p was significantly down-regulated, while the expression of FOSL2 was significantly up-regulated. Compared with NC-mimic group, the expression of FOSL2, N-cadherin and Vimentin in miR-200b-3p mimic group was significantly decreased, and the expression of E-cadherin was significantly increased. The cell proliferation, migration rate and the number of transmembrane cells were significantly decreased. Compared with the miR-200b-3p mimic+oe-NC group, the expression of FOSL2, N-cadherin and Vimentin in miR-200b-3p mimic+oe-FOSL2 group was significantly increased, and the expression level of E-cadherin was significantly decreased, and the cell proliferation, migration rate and the number of transmembrane cells were significantly increased. Compared with NC-inhibitor group, the expression of FOSL2, N-cadherin and Vimentin in miR-200b-3p inhibitor group was significantly increased, and the expression of E-cadherin was significantly decreased. The cell proliferation, migration rate and the number of transmembrane cells were significantly increased. Compared with the miR-200b-3p inhibitor+si-NC group, the expression of FOSL2, N-cadherin and Vimentin in miR-200b-3p inhibitor+si-FOSL2 group was significantly decreased, and the expression of E-cadherin was significantly increased; the cell proliferation, migration rate and the number of transmembrane cells were significantly decreased. Conclusion The expression of miR-200b-3p in endometrial cancer cells is down-regulated, which can inhibitor the proliferation, migration and invasion of endometrial cancer cells by regulating the EMT process, and its mechanism is related to its targeted negative regulation of FOSL2 expression."
"As the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues, a body of emerging evidence suggests that individuals who had been infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) suffered from lingering adverse health consequences. Such long-term conditions, also known as ""long COVID"" or ""post-acute COVID syndrome,"" are reported to bring both pulmonary and extrapulmonary manifestations."
"Metal implants are commonly used in clinical practice. However, little is known regarding the prevalence of metal implants. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of metal implants in the United States (US) among individuals aged ≥ 40 years. This study conducted a serial cross-sectional analysis of US adults aged ≥ 40 years who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) (2015-2016 and 2017-March 2020). Self-reported questionnaires were used to assess whether the participants had metal implants inside their bodies. The primary outcome was the prevalence of metal implants among adults aged 40 years and older. Furthermore, weighted logistic regression analysis was employed to determine the changes in the prevalence of metal implants from 2015 to March 2020. Moreover, this study investigated the variation in metal implant prevalence by demographic factors based on the pooled NHANES cycles. All analyses were conducted based on 3,736 participants from the NHANES 2015-2016 and 6,387 participants from the NHANES 2017-March 2020. This study observed a high prevalence of metal implants among adults aged 40 and older (2015-2016: 27.23%; 2017-March 2020: 31.53%). Moreover, the results of the weighted logistic regression analysis showed that the prevalence of metal implants significantly increased from 2015 to March 2020, especially among older individuals, men, and White individuals. In addition, the results of the weighted logistic regression analysis indicated that the metal implant prevalence differed by age and race/ethnicity, in which older individuals and White individuals showed a significantly higher prevalence of metal implants than younger individuals and non-White individuals, respectively. There was a high prevalence of metal implants among US adults aged 40 and older, and the prevalence of metal implants significantly increased from 2015 to March 2020. Therefore, more attention needs to be paid to this special population, and it may be necessary to ensure accessibility and affordability and assess the potential long-term health impacts of metal implants, considering the increased prevalence of metal implants."

"Global efforts to highlight cancer and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) as a growing burden were first raised in 2005 World Health Assembly Resolution 58.22 and reinforced with Resolution 70.12 and the Global NCD action plan in 2017. One common thread for addressing cancer burden was the need to articulate cancer priorities within a comprehensive national cancer control plan (NCCP). Since 2012, the International Cancer Control Partnership provided guidance on cancer policy and planning, with the goal that every country should have an implementable plan. The purpose of the global review of NCCPs was to update global knowledge of the status and content of NCCPs. The global review included 16 new questions related to cancer equity, pandemic preparedness, global WHO initiatives, evidence-based recommendations, and other emerging trends. The findings can guide country-level decision makers on improvements to deliver person-centred cancer services to reduce the cancer burden."
"Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a common treatment for severe aortic stenosis (AS), but it carries the risk of severe complications, including device embolization. We present a case of a TAVR valve embolization into the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT), diagnosed with transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) shortly after device deployment. The dislodged valve was successfully retrieved from the LVOT into the aorta, flattened, and stabilized with a thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair (TEVAR) stent, enabling the successful implantation of a new TAVR valve."

"Background Stroke now represents the condition with the highest need for physical rehabilitation worldwide, with only low or moderate-level evidence testing telerehabilitation compared to in-person care. We compared functional ambulation in subacute patients with stroke following telerehabilitation and matched in-person controls with no biopsychosocial differences at baseline. Methods We conducted a matched case-control study to compare functional ambulation between individuals with stroke following telerehabilitation and in-person rehabilitation, assessed using the Functional Ambulation Categories (FAC) and the Functional Independence Measure™ (FIM). Results The telerehabilitation group (n =38) achieved significantly higher FAC gains (1.5 (1.3) vs 1.0 (1.0)) than the in-person rehabilitation group, with no differences in ambulation efficiency, in individuals: admitted to rehabilitation within 60days after stroke onset; aged 49.8 (±11.4) years at admission; 55.3% female sex; moderate stroke severity; 42.1% with 'good' motor FIM at baseline; mostly living with sentimental partner (73.7%); with 21.1% holding an university education degree. Conclusions The groups showed no significant differences in ambulation efficiency, though the telerehabilitation group achieved higher FAC gains. Our results suggest that home telerehabilitation can be considered a good alternative to in-person rehabilitation when addressing ambulation in patients with moderate stroke severity and whose home situation mostly includes a cohabiting partner."

"The number of older adults undergoing organ transplantation, and waiting lists are increasing. The epidemiological data on infections in older transplant patients are scarce. The objective of the study was to investigate the incidence and distribution of infectious complications in older patients according to post-transplant periods. This retrospective study was conducted in a university hospital between 1 January 2018 and 31 March 2023. All infectious episodes were analyzed over three post-transplant periods. Forty-four patients were enrolled. The median age was 67 years (min: 65 and max: 87 years). Patients experienced a total of 98 infectious episodes. The median number of infectious events per patient was 1.0 (min: 0 and max: 8). The overall incidence rate of infectious events was 2.18 infectious episodes per 1000 transplant days. Of the patients at risk, 18.2% had 12 (12.4% of all infections) infections in the first month (9.09 episodes per 1000 transplant days), 56.8% had 52 (53.1%) infections between 1 and 6 months (7.88 episodes per 1000 transplant days), and 40.9% had 34 (35%) infections >6-12 months post-transplant (0.92 episodes per 1000 transplant days) The most prevalent type of infection was bacterial (79.6%, n = 78) followed by viral (18.4%, n = 18) and fungal (2.0%, n = 2) infections. The overall mortality rate of the 44 patients was 13.6%. The bacterial infections were more prevalent, and the incidence of infection was high during all post-transplant periods. These results may guide infection management in older transplant patients."
"The I38T substitution in the influenza virus polymerase-acidic (PA) subunit is a resistance marker of concern for treatment with the antiviral baloxavir marboxil (BXM). Thus, monitoring PA/I38T mutations is of clinical importance. Here, we developed three rapid and sensitive assays for the detection and monitoring of the PA/I38T mutation. In addition, we updated our previously developed methods to monitor the D197N mutation in the neuraminidase (NA) of influenza B virus, which is associated with resistance to oseltamivir. Real-time PCR high-resolution melting analysis (HRMA) was developed for the rapid detection of the PA/I38T and NA/D197N mutations using oligonucleotides with substitutions of interest and influenza viruses isolated in our laboratory. HRMA was subsequently performed on 94 clinical samples that were positive for A/H1N1pdm09, A/H3N2, and type-B influenza viruses and on viruses that were selected in vitro to grow in the presence of BXA (baloxavir acid, BXM active compound). The HRMAs were able to discriminate PA/I38 from the PA/I38T mutation and NA substitutions in synthetic oligonucleotides. However, the I38T mutation and NA mutations were not detected in any of our clinical samples, indicating the absence of these resistance markers in the circulating viruses examined. Only one out of 43 A/H3N2 clinical samples analyzed contained a virus with mutations associated with resistance to oseltamivir. All the HRMA results were confirmed by sequencing. Finally, HRMA was performed on A/H1N1pdm09 and A/H3N2 influenza viruses following BXA selection in vitro. The presence of the I38T mutation in the BXA-selected A/H3N2 variant, but not in the A/H1N1pdm09 variant, was identified by HRMA after 12 passages. Overall, these findings indicate that HRMA could be a powerful tool for rapidly monitoring BXM resistance in influenza viruses during seasonal circulation."
"Intestinal stem cells (ISCs) face the challenge of integrating metabolic demands with unique regenerative functions. Studies have shown an intricate interplay between metabolism and stem cell capacity; however, it is still not understood how this process is regulated. Combining ribosome profiling and CRISPR screening in intestinal organoids, we identify the nascent polypeptide-associated complex (NAC) as a key mediator of this process. Our findings suggest that NAC is responsible for relocalizing ribosomes to the mitochondria and regulating ISC metabolism. Upon NAC inhibition, intestinal cells show decreased import of mitochondrial proteins, which are needed for oxidative phosphorylation, and, consequently, enable the cell to maintain a stem cell identity. Furthermore, we show that overexpression of NACα is sufficient to drive mitochondrial respiration and promote ISC identity. Ultimately, our results reveal the pivotal role of NAC in regulating ribosome localization, mitochondrial metabolism, and ISC function, providing insights into the potential mechanism behind it."
"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the demyelination of nerves, axonal damage, and neuroinflammation. Cognition impairment, pain, and loss of mobility are some of the usual complications of MS. It has been postulated that the overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species (ROS) are the main factors that contribute to MS pathology. Among various animal models, the cuprizone model is the most widely used model for investigating MS-related pathology. We assessed the effects of cuprizone along with the protective effects of some black seed oil-based nanoformulations of curcumin with and without piperine, in mice hippocampus in terms of the changes in antioxidant enzymes, transcription factors, and cytokines during demyelination and remyelination processes. The results of behavioral studies point toward impairment in working memory following the feeding of cuprizone for 5 weeks. However, in treatment groups, mice seemed to prevent the toxic effects of cuprizone. Nanoformulations used in this study were found to be highly effective in lowering the amount of ROS as indicated by the levels of antioxidant enzymes like catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione, and glutathione peroxidase. Moreover, nanoformulations CCF and CCPF were observed resisting the toxic effects of cuprizone. We observed greater expression of NFκB-p65 in the CPZ group than in the control group. CCF nanoformulation had a better inhibitory effect on NFκB-p65 than other formulations. Histological examination of the hippocampus was also conducted. Nanoformulations used here were found effective in reversing MS-related pathophysiology and hence have the potential to be applied as adjuvant therapy for MS treatment."
"Children with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) are at increased risk for vaccine-preventable diseases.

"There are limited data describing the epidemiology of vertebral fractures (VF) from resource-limited settings, where the aging population is growing most rapidly. We aimed to determine the prevalence, incidence, and risk factors for VF in The Gambia, West Africa. The Gambian Bone and Muscle Ageing Study is a prospective observational study in men and women aged 40 yr and over. Rural participants had baseline measurements and plasma samples collected and were followed up 6-8 yr later; urban participants had a single measurement. DXA scans were obtained to assess areal BMD (aBMD), body composition, and VF. Prevalence and incidence were calculated. Risk factors for prevalent and incident fractures were tested using logistic regression, in men and women separately, with and without adjustment for age and BMI. At baseline, 581 individuals (298 women) had useable scans, 214 (127 women) at follow-up. Prevalence of VF was 14.8%. Those with VF were older (65.6(11.2) vs 61.7(12.3) yr, p = .01) and had lower aBMD Z-scores. For example, in women, a 1 SD increase in femoral neck Z-score resulted in a lower risk of having a prevalent VF (OR [95% CI]) 0.51 [0.38, 0.73]. In men, lumbar spine Z-scores were predictive of prevalent fracture (0.71 [0.53, 0.97]). The incidence of VF over follow-up was 12.1%. Low BMD and grip strength were associated with the odds of having an incident VF. Given the importance of prevalent VF in predicting future VF and other fragility fractures in other populations, our findings are a major cause for concern. VF prevalence in Gambian older adults is similar to elsewhere, despite fractures not being a perceived issue. Risk factors were like those identified elsewhere, including age, aBMD, and bone resorption. Understanding the impact of these fractures is important in a region where the health of the aging population needs to be prioritized."
"One of the challenges when transitioning from International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision (ICD-10) to International Classification of Diseases, 11th Revision (ICD-11) is to ensure clinical coding accuracy."
"No standardized method has yet been established for evaluating airway mucosal aberrancies associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or chronic bronchitis (CB). While goblet cell hyperplasia (GCH) is an established pathognomonic hallmark of the CB disease process, no standardized method exists for acquiring mucosal biopsies and assessing morphologic airway mucosa alterations. Additionally, the impacts from interventions targeting the airway mucosa are not well defined. In this context, a reliable and robust measure for assessing airway mucosa at baseline and subsequent to an intervention is critical for characterizing treatment-related changes."
"Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and cancer are significant global causes of mortality. However, the link between diets that promote inflammation and various subtypes of CVDs and cancers remains unclear."
"The host enzyme heparanase (HPSE) facilitates the release of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) from target cells by cleaving the viral attachment receptor heparan sulfate (HS) from infected cell surfaces. HPSE 2, an isoform of HPSE, binds to but does not possess the enzymatic activity needed to cleave cell surface HS. Our study demonstrates that HSV-2 infection significantly elevates HPSE 2 protein levels, impacting two distinct stages of viral replication. We show that higher HPSE 2 negatively affects HSV-2 replication which may be through the regulation of cell surface HS. By acting as a competitive inhibitor of HPSE, HPSE 2 may be interfering with HPSE's interactions with HS. We demonstrate that the enhanced expression of HPSE 2, either via viral infection or plasmid transfection, reduces HPSE's ability to cleave HS, thereby hindering viral egress. Conversely, low HPSE 2 levels achieved through siRNA transfection allow HPSE to cleave more HS, reducing viral entry. Altogether, we propose a hypothetical model in which the modulation of HPSE 2 impedes HSV-2 replication by regulating HS availability on the cell surface. This dual role of HPSE 2 in viral replication and potential tumor suppression underscores its significance in cellular processes and viral pathogenesis."

"The human genome is composed of distinct genomic regions that are susceptible to various types of somatic mutations. Among these, Short Tandem Repeats (STRs) stand out as the most mutable genetic elements. STRs are short repetitive polymorphic sequences, predominantly situated within noncoding sectors of the genome. The intrinsic repetition characterizing these sequences makes them highly mutable in vivo. Consequently, this characteristic provides the chance to unravel the natural developmental history of human viable cells retrospectively. However, STRs also introduce stutter noise in vitro amplification, which makes their analysis challenging. Here we describe our integrated biochemical-computational platform for single-cell lineage analysis. It consists of a pipeline whose inputs are single cells and whose output is a lineage tree of input cells."
"During heat shock (HS), cells orchestrate a gene expression program that promotes the synthesis of HS proteins (HSPs) while simultaneously repressing the synthesis of other proteins, including growth-promoting housekeeping proteins. Recent studies show that mRNAs encoding housekeeping proteins, along with associated processing factors, form macromolecular assemblies during HS. These assemblies inhibit transcription, nuclear export, and translation of housekeeping mRNAs, and coincide with structural rearrangements in proteins. These findings reveal a mechanism linking temperature sensitivity through structural rearrangements and macromolecular assembly to the 'shut down' of housekeeping protein synthesis. This review delves into recent findings in yeast, with a focus on macromolecular assembly, offering perspectives into mechanisms that regulate gene expression during HS and how these processes may be conserved."

"Ethylene is an important plant hormone whose production relies on the action of key enzymes, one of which is 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase (ACS). There are three classes of ACS, which are all partially regulated by degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), which regulates ethylene production. Arabidopsis has a single class III ACS, ACS7, but although it is known to be degraded by the 26S proteasome, the UPS proteins involved are poorly characterised. In this work, we used mass spectrometry to identify novel components of the ubiquitin system that may contribute to the regulation of ethylene biosynthesis via ACS7. We found two HECT-type ligases, UPL1 and UPL2, which regulate ACS7 stability. In vitro experiments showed that UPL1 and UPL2 E3 ligases directly control ACS7 turnover. In addition, increased ethylene levels were observed in UPL1- and UPL2-knockout plants in response to NaCl and NaCl+MG132 treatment, respectively. Under the same conditions, we observed increased ACS7 transcript levels in upl1 compared to WT plants under control and stress conditions, further confirming that UPL1 and UPL2 regulate ACS7-dependent ethylene production in response to stress. We used molecular modelling to predict ACS7 ubiquitylation sites and cell-free degradation assays to verify that lysine residues at positions 174, 238 and 384 regulate ACS7 protein stability. Overall, this study provides new insights into the regulation of ACS7 protein stability, and hence ethylene production, in plant growth and development and the response to stress."

"This article explores the historical significance and lasting impact of Vittorio Putti's ""Decalogue of Fractures"" in the field of orthopedic trauma. Putti served as director of the Rizzoli Orthopedic Institute in Bologna from 1915 until his death in 1940 and was one of the founding members of the ""Société Internationale de Chirurgie Orthopédique et de Traumatologie"" (SICOT). He also played a key role in organizing the third SICOT World Congress, held in Bologna in 1936.The ""Decalogue"" distills Putti's extensive clinical experience and remains a cornerstone of modern traumatology. He developed the *Decalogue* to enhance the principles of fracture treatment, addressing what he viewed as suboptimal outcomes. This article examines each of the tenets, emphasizing their influence on contemporary fracture management and the evolution of orthopaedic trauma care. It also reflects on Putti's forward-thinking vision for a comprehensive trauma network, underscoring his belief in the critical importance of specialization and centralization to ensure efficiency, quality, and consistency, principles that continue to shape orthopaedic practice today."
"Under the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS), participants can self-manage their funding. This management style largely deviates from previous Australian service systems. The self-management option provides NDIS participants flexibility and choice in accessing any services; however, it generates an administrative burden. In 2019, parents of children with disability had the highest percentage of using the self-management option. Parents of children commonly have high child-care responsibilities and experience health issues. Given the administrative burden associated with the self-management option, the experiences of these parents should be documented."
"Ferroptosis is a type of regulated cell death driven by iron-dependent accumulation of lipid peroxidation, exhibiting unique morphological changes. While actin microfilaments are crucial for various cellular processes, including morphogenesis, motility, endocytosis, and cell death, their role in ferroptosis remains unclear. Here, our study reveals that actin microfilaments undergo remodeling and disassembly during ferroptosis. Interestingly, inhibitors that target actin microfilament remodeling do not affect cell sensitivity to ferroptosis, with the exception of CK-666 and its structural analog CK-636. Mechanistically, CK-666 attenuates ferroptosis independently of its canonical function in inhibiting the Arp2/3 complex. Further investigation revealed that CK-666 modulates the ferroptotic transcriptome, prevents lipid degradation, and diminishes lipid peroxidation. In addition, CK-666 does not impact the labile iron pool within cells nor does the inhibition of FSP1 impacts its antiferroptosis activity. Notably, the results of DPPH assay and liposome leakage assay suggest that CK-666 mitigates ferroptosis by directly eliminating lipid peroxidation. Importantly, CK-666 significantly ameliorated renal ischemia-reperfusion injury and ferroptosis in renal tissue, underscoring its potential therapeutic impact."
"Anterior choroidal artery (AChA) aneurysms account for 2%-5% of all intracranial aneurysms. Treatment considerations include microsurgical clipping, flow diversion, or coiling with or without adjunctive devices. AChA aneurysms pose challenges in treatment due to the origination of the aneurysm from the origin or proximal segment of the AChA. The AChA is particularly susceptible to vasospasm and occlusion during treatment with devastating neurological deficits, including hemiparesis, hemianesthesia, lethargy, neglect, and hemianopia. In this study, the authors performed a meta-analysis to quantify the outcomes and complication rates across treatment modalities for AChA aneurysms and to identify risk factors reported in the literature."
"BACKGROUND Ancylostoma caninum is a soil-borne, soil-transmitted helminth with infective larvae and produces cutaneous larva migrans in humans. The objective of this study was to confirm the presence of A. caninum in domestic dogs from the urban-marginal and rural sectors of the Ecuadorian coast through morphometry, culture, and molecular techniques. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 498 domestic dogs were analyzed via 5 coproparasitic screening methods: direct, modified flotation, sedimentation with centrifugation using saline solution (identification of eggs), and modified Baermann and Harada-Mori methods (identification of larvae). For confirmation, culture (agar in plates, Müller-Hinton agar plates, MacConkey agar plates, and artisanal media with sand and/or ravine soil, both sterile, and all prepared in Petri dishes), polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and DNA sequencing analyses were subsequently conducted via morphometric methods. RESULTS A total of 250 domestic dogs were diagnosed with A. caninum (50.20%) via coproparasitic methods. The parasite was subsequently confirmed via morphometry, cultured in 5 culture media, and detected by PCR, and phylogenetic characterization was performed. CONCLUSIONS The coproparasitic methods used for screening increased the sensitivity of the results. Morphometry is an easily accessible and low-cost confirmatory method. The culture method was used to test the good adaptability of and infection by the parasite. The presence of A. caninum was detected for the first time via PCR, and its phylogenetic profile was analyzed using the molecular marker cox1."
"Bipolar disorder (BD) is a common psychiatric disorder characterized by alterations between manic/hypomanic and depressive states. Rare pathogenic copy number variations (CNVs) that overlap with exons of synaptic genes have been associated with BD. However, no study has comprehensively explored CNVs in synaptic genes associated with BD. Here, we evaluated the relationship between BD and rare CNVs that overlap with synaptic genes, not limited to exons, in the Japanese population."
"Cell identity can be reprogrammed, naturally or experimentally, albeit with low frequency. Why some cells, but not their neighbours, undergo a cell identity conversion remains unclear. We find that Notch signalling plays a key role to promote natural transdifferentiation in C. elegans hermaphrodites. Endogenous Notch signalling endows a cell with the competence to transdifferentiate by promoting plasticity factors expression (hlh-16/Olig and sem-4/Sall). Strikingly, ectopic Notch can trigger additional transdifferentiation in vivo. However, Notch signalling can both promote and block transdifferentiation depending on its activation timing. Notch only promotes transdifferentiation during an early precise window of opportunity and signal duration must be tightly controlled in time. Our findings emphasise the importance of temporality and dynamics of the underlying molecular events preceding the initiation of natural cell reprogramming. Finally, our results support a model where both an extrinsic signal and the intrinsic cellular context combine to empower a cell with the competence to transdifferentiate."
"During the COVID-19 pandemic, the role of housing in controlling the spread of the virus was limited, as policies primarily focused on short-term measures such as lockdowns and social distancing. As the pandemic recedes, a shift has occurred towards restructuring the environment to confront future health crises better. This research thoroughly evaluates existing literature and housing complexes. It recommends that future projects prioritize several key features: ample exposure to natural environments, opportunities for growing food, encouragement of casual social interactions, inclusion of communal spaces, and provision of areas for exercise to help reduce the risks of contagion and alleviate the mental health impacts on residents. Based on research conducted during and after the pandemic, current recommendations for housing often provide generalized suggestions or propose ideal layouts through diagrams. This approach can be unrealistic from both spatial and economic perspectives and fails to inspire or stimulate creativity. This paper, by contrast, reviews and analyzes historical housing projects while critically examining three case studies that have the potential to inspire future designs. The goal is to provide officials, architects, and stakeholders with a series of practical possibilities and guidelines that contribute to the post-COVID home design process by making it more health-conscious and fostering the creation of new types of neighborhoods that can significantly impact the planning of cities in California."

"This study reveals the anti-tyrosinase activity of Ganoderma formosanum extracts, pinpointing compounds including gluconic acid, mesalamine, L-pyroglutamic acid, esculetin, 5-hydroxyindole, and salicylic acid, as effective melanin production inhibitors in melanoma cells and zebrafish embryos. Furthermore, multiple molecular docking simulations provided insights into interactions between the identified compounds and tyrosinase, increasing binding affinity up to -16.36 kcal/mol. The enhanced binding of identified compounds to tyrosinase facilitated synergistic inhibitory effects on melanin production. This study highlights the potential of GFE-EA as a source of natural tyrosinase inhibitors and contributes to understanding the role of active compounds extracted from G. formosanum."

"The study of split-belt treadmill adaptation provides insight into the priorities determining how we adapt to novel conditions during walking. During split-belt adaptation, young adults reduce their metabolic cost and positive leg work in part by learning to take longer steps on the fast belt, thus adopting a positive step length asymmetry. However, aging may lead to a shift in the work performed by distal versus proximal joints, so it is unknown if older adults can similarly reduce the work performed by the legs during split-belt walking. Therefore, we quantified the relationship between joint work rate and step length asymmetry when fourteen older adults walked on a split-belt treadmill. We hypothesized that total positive joint work would decrease at more positive step length asymmetries and that more positive asymmetries would be associated with a reduction in positive ankle joint work on the fast belt. We found that step length asymmetry was negatively correlated with total positive work (p = 0.01) and that changes in positive joint work were primarily driven by positive ankle work on the fast belt (p = 0.01). Since ankle musculature is hypothesized to be a major contributor to metabolic cost during gait, reductions in ankle joint work likely contribute to the reduction in metabolic cost observed in other studies of split-belt walking. These results demonstrate that healthy aging still allows individuals to take advantage of the work performed by the treadmill to reduce the mechanical energy cost of walking."
"Forests face an escalating threat from the increasing frequency of extreme drought events driven by climate change. To address this challenge, it is crucial to understand how widely distributed species of economic or ecological importance may respond to drought stress. In this study, we examined the transcriptome of white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) to identify key genes and metabolic pathways involved in the species' response to water stress. We assembled a de novo transcriptome, performed differential gene expression analyses at four time points over 22 days during a controlled drought stress experiment involving 2-year-old plants and three genetically distinct clones, and conducted gene enrichment analyses. The transcriptome assembly and gene expression analysis identified a total of 33,287 transcripts corresponding to 18,934 annotated unique genes, including 4,425 genes that are uniquely responsive to drought. Many transcripts that had predicted functions associated with photosynthesis, cell wall organization, and water transport were down-regulated under drought conditions, while transcripts linked to abscisic acid response and defense response were up-regulated. Our study highlights a previously uncharacterized effect of drought stress on lipid metabolism genes in conifers and significant changes in the expression of several transcription factors, suggesting a regulatory response potentially linked to drought response or acclimation. Our research represents a fundamental step in unraveling the molecular mechanisms underlying short-term drought responses in white spruce seedlings. In addition, it provides a valuable source of new genetic data that could contribute to genetic selection strategies aimed at enhancing the drought resistance and resilience of white spruce to changing climates."
"Cutaneous Leishmaniases (CL), highly endemic in Africa and Mediterranean region, are caused by different Leishmania parasite species. Accurate species identification is crucial for effective diagnosis, treatment, and control of these diseases, but traditionally relies on DNA-based methods. High Resolution Melting analysis PCR (HRM PCR) provides rapid results and precise differentiation based on nucleotide variations. We hypothesized that the Strumpellin gene of Leishmania could serve as an effective target for developing a HRM PCR method for the rapid and efficient detection and identification of Leishmania species in CL diagnosis."
"In 2018, Medicare introduced new codes to the Endoscopic Sinus Surgery (FESS) and balloon sinus dilation (BSD) families of Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes. Using the Medicare Part B National Summary Data File from 2010 to 2022, an interrupted time-series analysis examined trends in volume and reimbursements before and after 2018. Prior to 2018, volume and reimbursements for FESS grew at a mean rate of 2.5% ± 2.2% per year and 6.9% ± 6.6% per year, respectively, before reimbursements decreased significantly in 2018 by -13.9% (P = .014), leading to a stabilization of volume (growth of 0.72%, P = .602). Volume and reimbursements for BSD saw rapid growth from 2011 to 2015 which plateaued prior to the introduction of bundled codes and did not appear to change significantly in 2018 (-0.6%, P = .306 and 11.9%, P = .392, respectively). In addition to concurrent devaluation of FESS and BSD codes, bundling appears to have further contributed to falling reimbursements in rhinology."

"As a result of human activities, surface waters worldwide are experiencing increasing levels of eutrophication, leading to more frequent occurrences of microalgae, including harmful algal blooms. We aimed to investigate the impact of decomposing camelina straw on mixed phytoplankton communities from eutrophic water bodies, comparing it to the effects of barley straw. The research was carried out in 15 aquaria (five of each type - containing no straw, camelina straw, and barley straw). The experiment lasted eight weeks, and the water used in the aquaria was sourced from an eutrophic reservoir. Our research revealed that the camelina straw had the most significant inhibitory effect on the growth of specific groups and species of phytoplankton (especially chrysophytes, potentially toxic cyanobacteria, and dinoflagellates). This inhibition was achieved by releasing polyphenols, primarily gallic and caffeic acids and flavonoids. Simultaneously, polyphenols promoted the growth of filamentous green algae. Our findings present novel data on the vulnerability of freshwater species and taxonomic groups of algae to the effects of camelina and barley straw exposure."
"Carcinoma of unknown primary (CUP) comprises 2-5% of cancer diagnoses worldwide, with a prevalence that has modestly declined with increased availability of advanced diagnostic tools such as next-generation sequencing (NGS). This case presentation illustrates the possibilities and gaps that remain with improving diagnostic capabilities in identifying and effectively treating CUP. This is the case of a rapidly enlarging right axillary mass without a primary tumour site and histological evaluation demonstrating a poorly differentiated neoplasm. Tumour of origin testing using a clinically validated RNA-sequencing-based machine learning classifier unexpectedly suggested greatest probability of metastatic melanoma with lesser likelihood of fibrosarcoma. Subsequent clinical behaviour and lack of response to chemoimmunotherapy conflicted with NGS results, with a multidisciplinary team ultimately agreeing on final diagnosis of aggressive soft tissue sarcoma, specifically malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour. The patient had a complete clinical response after forequarter amputation and a sarcoma-based chemotherapy regimen. This case highlights both the potential and current shortcomings of NGS and predictive tumour of origin analytic tools in helping with characterisation and categorisation of CUP. There is a need for improvement and optimisation of these diagnostic modalities, but they offer another option to improve historically poor outcomes in CUP."

"This study investigated the correlations between phenolic compounds and antioxidant capacities of Korean red pine (Pinus densiflora Sieb. et Zucc.) bark (RPB) fractions after in vitro gastrointestinal digestion. RPB extracts were prepared using 70% (v/v) aqueous ethanol and further fractionated with n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and water. Their antioxidant capacities were evaluated using three assays. Phenolic compounds were quantified using a liquid chromatography system to assess their stability. The antioxidant capacities of RPB extract and its fractions were significantly influenced by the digestive process. Gastric digestion increased the contents of procyanidin B1 and catechin, whereas intestinal digestion degraded most of the phenolic compounds except protocatechuic acid. Principal component analysis revealed that taxifolin had the greatest impact on data variability, indicating that this polyphenol plays an important role in the antioxidant capacity of RPB. This study provides insights into the stability and bioaccessibility of phenolic compounds in RPB under simulated gastrointestinal conditions, supporting its potential use as a source of natural antioxidants in dietary supplements."

"Dissecting the mechanisms underlying heat tolerance is important for understanding how plants acclimate to heat stress. Here, we identify a heat-responsive gene in Arabidopsis thaliana, RNA-DIRECTED DNA METHYLATION 16 (RDM16), which encodes a pre-mRNA splicing factor. Knockout mutants of RDM16 are hypersensitive to heat stress, which is associated with impaired splicing of the mRNAs of 18 out of 20 HEAT SHOCK TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR (HSF) genes. RDM16 forms condensates upon exposure to heat. The arginine residues in intrinsically disordered region 1 (IDR1) of RDM16 are responsible for RDM16 condensation and its function in heat stress tolerance. Notably, RDM16 produces two alternatively spliced transcripts designated RDM16-LONG (RDL) and RDM16-SHORT (RDS). RDS also forms condensates and can promote RDL condensation to improve heat tolerance. Our findings provide insight into the cooperative condensation of the two RDM16 isoforms encoded by RDM16 splice variants in enhancing heat tolerance in Arabidopsis."
"Cognition is crucial to brain function, and accurately classifying cognitive load is essential for understanding the psychological processes across tasks. This paper innovatively combines functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) with eye tracking technology to delve into the classification of cognitive load at the neurocognitive level. This integration overcomes the limitations of a single modality, addressing challenges such as feature selection, high dimensionality, and insufficient sample capacity. We employ fNIRS-eye tracking technology to collect neural activity and eye tracking data during various cognitive tasks, followed by preprocessing. Using the maximum relevance minimum redundancy algorithm, we extract the most relevant features and evaluate their impact on the classification task. We evaluate the classification performance by building models (naive Bayes, support vector machine, K-nearest neighbors, and random forest) and employing cross-validation. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of fNIRS-eye tracking, the maximum relevance minimum redundancy algorithm, and machine learning techniques in discriminating cognitive load levels. This study emphasizes the impact of the number of features on performance, highlighting the need for an optimal feature set to improve accuracy. These findings advance our understanding of neuroscientific features related to cognitive load, propelling neural psychology research to deeper levels and holding significant implications for future cognitive science."

"Background Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is seen in almost 30-40% cases of psoriasis. Psoriasis precedes the onset of PsA in 85% of cases. Delay in the diagnosis of PsA may lead to poor functional outcomes and morbidity. Screening psoriasis patients with high-frequency ultrasound helps to diagnose arthritis at an early stage leading to prompt intervention and possible reduction in the morbidity associated with the disease. Objectives To determine the role of high frequency ultrasonography (USG) in the detection of subclinical PsA. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in a dermatology and radiology department of Armed Forces Medical College, Pune between July 2021 and December 2022. Patients of chronic plaque psoriasis with no clinical evidence of arthritis were assessed using high-frequency USG. Various parameters such as bony erosions, synovial thickening, tendon thickening, tendon hypo-echogenicity, calcifications and power doppler signals were assessed. Results A total of 117 patients were included in the study. The distal interphalangeal joint (DIP) and Achilles tendon were the most commonly affected sites. Synovial thickening in DIP was observed in 67 (57%) patients and Achilles tendon thickening was observed in 39 (33%) patients. Limitations of the study The cross-sectional nature of the study is the major limitation. A longitudinal study will be required to understand the clinical relevance of ultrasonographic changes in these patients. Another limitation of the study is the lack of age and gender-matched controls. Future research should include such controls to ensure more accurate results. Conclusion Subclinical arthritis is common in patients with chronic plaque psoriasis. High-frequency ultrasound is a useful tool for detecting subclinical synovitis and enthesitis in asymptomatic patients. The DIP joint and Achilles tendon ultrasound can be used for screening for early detection of PsA."

"Patients with ovarian cancer (OC) are often diagnosed at an advanced stage and have a poor prognosis because of extensive tumour metastasis. Tumour metastasis usually occurs in stages, which means that before the invasion of tumour cells, a pre-metastatic niche (PMN) has been formed to support the subsequent colonisation and growth of tumour cells. Tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) are highly heterogeneous in terms of origin, phenotype and function. As one of the most abundant components in the tumour microenvironment (TME), TAMs can contribute to PMN formation by promoting organotropism, mediating immunosuppression, metabolic reprogramming, facilitating angiogenesis, and inducing cancer cell stemness. Therefore, TAMs play an important role in OC metastasis."
"Histology is the gold standard for analyzing tissue structure and cell morphology. Immunostaining on thin tissue sections enables precise visualization of antigens and proteins. However, for cryosectioning small tissues such as organoids, spheroids, and tumoroids there is a lack of standardized, time- and cost-effective methods, limiting the throughput of analysis. Here, we have adapted to cryosectioning our previously developed HistoBrick approach, in which small tissue arrangement is spatially controlled within arrayed mini-wells. By testing various embedding matrices, we show that an 8% PEGDA and 2.5% gelatine mixture is optimal, providing essential structural support to maintain sample integrity during cryosectioning. This embedding matrix preserves fragile substructures of human retinal organoids, which are particularly susceptible to damage during sample preparation. Using PEGDA-gelatine HistoBricks for the simultaneous embedding of 16 retinal organoids, we analyzed a time course of retinal organoid development. We observed the maintenance of photoreceptors cell bodies up to week 98 in culture, while photoreceptor outer segments were gradually lost. Further, we observed displaced photoreceptors in the region of outer segments. The PEGDA-gelatine HistoBrick is a cost-efficient tool that can be implemented for small tissue studies to increase throughput in experiments such as large-scale screenings or toxicology research."
"Hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives are a class of phenolic acid compounds, including sinapic acid, ferulic acid, and caffeic acid, which are widely found in plants. This experiment was conducted to study the effects of hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives (sinapic acid, ferulic acid, and caffeic acid) on the growth performance, muscle physical parameters, and intestinal morphology of tilapia. A total of 320 tilapia fingerlings (9.99 ± 0.12 g) were randomly divided into 4 groups with 4 replicates per group and 20 tilapia per replicate. Each group was fed a basal diet (control group), and the experimental diet supplemented with 0.52 mmol/kg sinapic acid, ferulic acid, and caffeic acid, respectively. After 8 weeks of feeding, the growth indexes and serum indexes of tilapia were measured, and the body, muscle composition, and muscle physical parameters, as well as the intestinal morphology were analyzed. The results showed that the addition of hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives to the diets significantly increased the weight gain rate (WGR) compared with the control (p < 0.05), with improvements of approximately 14.93%, 27.27%, and 28.06% for sinapic acid, ferulic acid, and caffeic acid, respectively. In the caffeic acid and ferulic acid groups, the final mean weight (FBW) was significantly increased and the feed coefficient (FCR) was significantly decreased compared with the control (p < 0.05). Compared with the control group, the hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives group had significantly lower levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), glucose (GLU), triglyceride (TG), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (p < 0.05), but had significantly higher levels of albumin (ALB), total protein (TP), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and total cholesterol (TCHO) among all groups (p > 0.05). Besides, moisture, crude protein, crude fat, and ash in whole fish and muscle among all groups showed no significant differences (p > 0.05). In addition, hardness, gumminess, adhesiveness, and resilience of muscle in tilapia fed the hydroxycinnamic acid derivative were significantly higher than that of the control group (p < 0.05). Chewiness, springiness, stringiness, and cohesiveness showed no statistically significant differences among the treatments (p > 0.05). The analysis of intestinal morphology showed that the villus height and muscle thickness of the foregut and hindgut in the fish fed hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives were significantly higher than those in the control fish (p < 0.05), but the villus width of the foregut and hindgut did not differ significantly among the treatment groups (p > 0.05). In conclusion, dietary hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives can improve the growth, muscle physical parameters, and intestinal morphology of tilapia. Ferulic acid and caffeic acid had stronger beneficial effects on tilapia than sinapic acid."

"Storage solutions have a significant impact on the physiological properties of saphenous veins (SV), yet their effects on the biomechanics remained unclear. This study investigated how different storage solutions affect the biomechanical properties of SV. The goal was to find a solution that minimally impacts SV biomechanics, providing an effective method for SV preservation. A total of 108 SV samples (54 axial, 54 circumferential) were randomly divided into four groups: Baseline (tested within 24 h after surgical removal), and three stored for 72 h-sodium lactated ringer's solution (SLR), physiological saline (PS), and Air. Uniaxial tensile experiments were performed, and differences in elastic modulus, maximum stress, and average stress-strain curves were evaluated. In the axial direction, the elastic modulus of SVs stored in SLR was significantly higher than in PS (7.21 ± 2.78 MPa vs. 3.90 ± 1.54 MPa, p = 0.009) and similar to Baseline (vs. 8.52 ± 3.43 MPa), while the PS group did not differ significantly from the Air group (3.90 ± 1.54 MPa vs. 2.50 ± 1.34 MPa, p > 0.99). The maximum stress in SLR was similar to Baseline (1.92 ± 0.82 MPa vs. 1.91 ± 0.58 MPa) and significantly higher than in PS (vs. 1.05 ± 0.56 MPa, p = 0.002). Similar trends could also be observed in the circumferential direction. PS significantly impairs the mechanical performance of SVs, while short-term storage in SLR can effectively preserve the biomechanical characteristics of SVs. SLR may be considered as an effective short-term storage solution for SV."
"Cell-based test methods with a phenotypic readout are frequently used for toxicity screening. However, guidance on how to validate the hits and how to integrate this information with other data for purposes of risk assessment is missing. We present here such a procedure and exemplify it with a case study on neural crest cell (NCC)-based developmental toxicity of picoxystrobin. A library of potential environmental toxicants was screened in the UKN2 assay, which simultaneously measures migration and cytotoxicity in NCC. Several strobilurin fungicides, known as inhibitors of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex III, emerged as specific hits. From these, picoxystrobin was chosen to exemplify a roadmap leading from cell-based testing towards toxicological predictions. Following a stringent confirmatory testing, an adverse outcome pathway was developed to provide a testable toxicity hypothesis. Mechanistic studies showed that the oxygen consumption rate was inhibited at sub-µM picoxystrobin concentrations after a 24 h pre-exposure. Migration was inhibited in the 100 nM range, under assay conditions forcing cells to rely on mitochondria. Biokinetic modeling was used to predict intracellular concentrations. Assuming an oral intake of picoxystrobin, consistent with the acceptable daily intake level, physiologically based kinetic modeling suggested that brain concentrations of 0.1-1 µM may be reached. Using this broad array of hazard and toxicokinetics data, we calculated a margin of exposure ≥ 80 between the lowest in vitro point of departure and the highest predicted tissue concentration.

"Streptococcus pneumonia is a Gram-positive and facultative anaerobic bacterium that causes a number of diseases, including otitis media, community-acquired pneumonia, sepsis, and meningitis. With the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains, there is an urgent need to develop antibiotics with a novel mechanism. The toxin-antitoxin (TA) system, which is primarily found in prokaryotes, consists of a toxin and its equivalent antitoxin genes. The YefM-YoeB module is a Type II TA system, where the YoeB toxin functions as a putative mRNA interferase upon activation, while the YefM antitoxin acts as a transcription repressor by binding to its promoter region along with YoeB. In this study, we determined the crystal structure of the YefM-YoeB complex from S. pneumoniae TIGR4 to comprehend the binding mechanism of the TA system. Furthermore, an in vitro ribonuclease activity assay was conducted to identify the ribonuclease activity of the YoeB toxin. Additionally, furthermore, the oligomeric state of the YefM-YoeB complex in solution was investigated, and a DNA-binding mode was proposed. These structural and functional insights into the YefM-YoeB complex could provide valuable information for the development of novel antibiotics targeting S. pneumonia-associated diseases."
"Pilomatrixoma is a benign cutaneous adnexal tumor that differentiates toward hair follicle cells. It infrequently occurs in the periorbital region. In the periorbital area, it is often located in the upper eyelid and eyebrow region. Periorbital pilomatrixoma is often misdiagnosed clinically and is less common than other benign skin tumors. In this retrospective review, we evaluate the demographic, clinical, and histopathological data of patients with periorbital pilomatrixoma, treated from 2010 to 2023."
"Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a type of microvascular complication that arises from diabetes mellitus and leads to further health issues. Most importantly, the prevalence of DN is steadily rising in developed countries. This research explored the therapeutic benefits of alogliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-4) inhibitor, on streptozotocin (STZ)-induced DN and its underlying mechanisms in rats."
"Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) constitutes a family of bone fragility disorders characterized by both genetic and clinical heterogeneity. Several different mouse models reproduce the classic features of OI, and the most commonly studied carry either a spontaneous or genetically induced pathogenic variant in the Col1a1 or Col1a2 gene. When OI is caused by primary alterations of type I collagen, it represents a systemic connective tissue disease that, in addition to the skeleton, also affects several extra-skeletal tissues and organs, such as skin, teeth, lung, heart, and others, where the altered type I collagen is also expressed. Currently, existing mouse models harbor a disease-causing genetic variant in all tissues and do not allow assessing the primary vs secondary consequences of the mutation on a specific organ/system. Here, we describe the generation of the first conditional knock-in allele for Col1a1 that can express a severe OI-causing glycine substitution (p.Gly1146Arg) in the triple helical region of α1(I) but only after Cre-driven recombination in the tissue of choice. We called this new dominant allele Col1a1G1146R-Floxed/+ and introduced it into the murine model. We describe its validation by crossing mice carrying this allele with EIIA-Cre expressing mice and showing that offspring with the recombined allele reproduce the classic features of a severe form of OI. The new mouse model will be useful to study the tissue-specific impact of this severe mutation on organs, such as the lung, the heart, and others."

"Antibiotic resistance is a world wide problem mainly in developing countries. In this work, coelomic fluid (PCF) and paste (PBP) of Pheretima posthuma was assessed for its potential as antibiofilm and anti-quorum sensing (QS) agent against pathogenic bacterial biofilms. PCF and PBP were extracted and biofilm formation time kinetics was examined using crystal violet staining method by utilizing four bacterial isolates in bispecies biofilm (06 combinations; MH5-MH10) and multi species biofilms (05 combinations; MH11-MH15). QS study was performed by determining pyocyanin formation time kinetics using 03 P. aeruginosa strains at various time periods (0, 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 hours). Following next, anti- QS effect was analyzed by measuring pyocyanin concentrations. Results showed that among bispecies bacterial biofilms, MH5-MH7 combinations showed significantly higher biofilm (p < 0.05) after 72 hours while other three (MH8-MH10) produced maximum biofilm after 48 to 72 hours. Likewise, for multispecies biofilms, maximum biofilm was noted after 48-72 hours. QS analysis revealed that PA1 strain synthesized highly significant (p < 0.001) pyocyanin (20 µg/mL) after 96 hours compared to PA2 and PA3 strains, which formed significant pyocyanin (18 µg/mL) after 72 hours. Also, 100-150 µg/mL of both PCF and PBP exhibited a significant (p < 0.05) reduction in biofilm while 200 µg/mL concentration showed highest QS against all selected strains. To our knowledge, this is the first assessment of its kind on the potential application of earthworm PCF and PBP for its antibiofilm and anti-QS potential. The study recommends precise chemistry of bioactive agents and their probable mechanism(s) of actions for the observed interference. Also, new pharmaceutical drugs synthesized using bioactive agents from PCF and PCB may surely have the potential to manage different infection problems caused by bacterial biofilms."
"Approximately 15-45% of female patients develop transient postoperative urinary retention (POUR) following pelvic reconstructive surgery. Catheter options for bladder drainage include transurethral indwelling catheter (TIC), intermittent self-catheterization (ISC), and suprapubic tube (SPT).

"It is a common strategy for viruses to block the host cell cycle to favour their DNA replication. Baculovirus, being a double-stranded DNA virus, can arrest the cell cycle in the G2/M phase to facilitate its replication. However, the key viral genes and mechanisms crucial for inducing cell cycle arrest remain poorly understood. Here, we initially examined the impacts of several Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) DNA replication-associated genes: ie1, lef-1, lef-2, lef-3, lef-4, odv-ec27 and dbp. We assessed their effects on both the host cells' DNA replication and cell cycle. Our findings reveal that when the lef-2 gene was overexpressed, it led to a significant increase in the number of cells in the G2/M phase and a reduction in the number of cells in the S phase. Furthermore, we discovered that the LEF-2 protein is located in the virogenic stroma and confirmed its involvement in viral DNA replication. Additionally, by employing interference and overexpression experiments, we found that LEF-2 influences host cell DNA replication and blocks the cell cycle in the G2/M phase by regulating the expression of CyclinB and CDK1. Finally, we found that BmNPV lef-2 triggered a DNA damage response in the host cell, and inhibiting this response removed the cell cycle block caused by BmNPV LEF-2. Thus, our findings indicate that the BmNPV lef-2 gene plays a crucial role in viral DNA replication and can regulate host cell cycle processes. This study furthers our understanding of baculovirus-host cell interactions and provides new insight into the molecular mechanisms of antiviral research."
"The coordination of chromatin remodeling is essential for DNA accessibility and gene expression control. The highly conserved and ubiquitously expressed SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable (SWI/SNF) chromatin remodeling complex plays a central role in cell type- and context-dependent gene expression. Despite the absence of a defined DNA recognition motif, SWI/SNF binds lineage specific enhancers genome-wide where it actively maintains open chromatin state. It does so while retaining the ability to respond dynamically to cellular signals. However, the mechanisms that guide SWI/SNF to specific genomic targets have remained elusive. Here we demonstrate that trans-acting long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) direct the SWI/SNF complex to cell type-specific enhancers. SWI/SNF preferentially binds lncRNAs and these predominantly bind DNA targets in trans. Together they localize to enhancers, many of which are cell type-specific. Knockdown of SWI/SNF- and enhancer-bound lncRNAs causes the genome-wide redistribution of SWI/SNF away from enhancers and a concomitant differential expression of spatially connected target genes. These lncRNA-SWI/SNF-enhancer networks support an enhancer hub model of SWI/SNF genomic targeting. Our findings reveal that lncRNAs competitively recruit SWI/SNF, providing a specific and dynamic layer of control over chromatin accessibility, and reinforcing their role in mediating enhancer activity and gene expression."
"Liver fibrosis is caused by chronic toxic or cholestatic liver injury. Fibrosis results from the recruitment of myeloid cells into the injured liver, the release of inflammatory and fibrogenic cytokines, and the activation of myofibroblasts, which secrete extracellular matrix, mostly collagen type I. Hepatic myofibroblasts originate from liver-resident mesenchymal cells, including HSCs and bone marrow-derived CD45+ collagen type I+ expressing fibrocytes. Recombinant human serum amyloid P (hSAP), a natural inhibitor of fibrocyte activation into myofibroblasts, was shown to ameliorate experimental renal, lung, skin, and cardiac fibrosis. We investigated if hSAP can ameliorate the development of liver fibrosis of different etiologies."
包虫病也叫棘球蚴病，是由棘球绦虫的幼虫寄生于人体组织所引起的疾病，常好发于肝脏，原发于骨的包虫病非常罕见。该病为人畜共患病，狗为终宿主，羊、牛是中间宿主。其在体内潜伏期长、初期可以没有任何临床表现，影像学检查也缺乏特异性，因此骨包虫病漏诊和误诊率极高，特别是在非牧区。骨包虫病患者血清嗜酸性粒细胞可升高，血清包虫抗体或抗原可阳性。病理活检常可以观察到棘球蚴等虫体结构。目前手术联合抗寄生虫药物治疗仍然是主要治疗手段。由于缺乏骨包虫病标准化的药物治疗方案，加之手术彻底切除较困难，因此其复发率极高。本文报道1例空军军医大学第一附属医院诊断的股骨包虫病，旨在提高病理医师对骨包虫病的认识及准确诊断，便于临床对症治疗，改善预后。.

"Barotrauma is a medical condition caused by sudden pressure changes in the body causing damage to multiple parts of the body. However, it is an infrequent occurrence when it comes to Colo-rectal perforation, wherein the trauma occurs due to the insufflation of compressed air through the anus. Several factors influence the outcome of a patient with colonic perforation due to barotrauma such as the severity of the injury, hemodynamic status of the patient, the patient's general health and well-being, the time taken for active medical/ surgical intervention since the injury, aggressive intravenous antibiotics administration to prevent sepsis, post-operative complications like surgical site infection, post-op ileus, anastomotic leak, etc. Overall, the patient's prognosis largely depends on early diagnosis, effective initial resuscitation, timely surgical intervention, and intensive post-operative care for a favorable outcome. Recently, we came across 2 cases of extensive pneumoperitoneum with Colo-rectal perforation as a result of the forceful insufflation of compressed air through the anus. Prompt medical intervention was necessary to prevent any further complications and they underwent surgical repair of the colorectal perforation."

"Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) procedure was planned for a 68-year-old female patient diagnosed with severe aortic stenosis by transthoracic echocardiography. The first valve unexpectedly dislodged during catheter tip withdrawal after full deployment. A second valve deployment became necessary, posing challenges due to the difficulty of passing the second valve delivery system through the first valve frame. The snare technique is typically used in cases where there are difficulties in delivering the transcatheter heart valve system across the native aortic valve during the TAVR procedure. We described a novel bailout technique to capture the delivery system in the main access using a snare catheter from the secondary access, while retaining the stiff wire in the left ventricle. This technique could be particularly applicable in scenarios where recrossing is challenging and risky."

"Preeclampsia is a life-threatening complication that develops in 2-8% of pregnancies. It is characterized by elevated blood pressure after 20 weeks of gestation and may progress to multiorgan dysfunction, leading to severe maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. The only definitive treatment is delivery, and efforts are focused on early risk prediction, surveillance, and severity mitigation. Anesthesiologists, as part of the interdisciplinary team, should evaluate patients early in labor in order to optimize cardiovascular, pulmonary, and coagulation status. Neuraxial techniques are safe in the absence of coagulopathy and aid avoidance of general anesthesia, which is associated with high risk in these patients. This review aims to provide anaesthesiologists with a comprehensive update on the latest strategies and evidence-based practices for managing preeclampsia, with an emphasis on perioperative care."

LLMs hold promise for transformative impacts in health care."
"Collagen, a key structural component of the extracellular matrix, undergoes significant remodeling during carcinogenesis. However, the important role of collagen levels in breast cancer diagnostics still lacks effective in vivo detection techniques to provide a deeper understanding. This study presents photoacoustic spectral analysis improved by machine learning as a promising non-invasive diagnostic method, focusing on exploring collagen as a salient biomarker. Murine model experiments revealed more profound associations of collagen with other cancer components than in normal tissues. Moreover, an optimal set of feature wavelengths was identified by a genetic algorithm for enhanced diagnostic performance, among which 75% were from collagen-dominated absorption wavebands. Using optimal spectra, the diagnostic algorithm achieved 72% accuracy, 66% sensitivity, and 78% specificity, surpassing full-range spectra by 6%, 4%, and 8%, respectively. The proposed photoacoustic methods examine the feasibility of offering valuable biochemical insights into existing techniques, showing great potential for early-stage cancer detection."
"Methanol-induced optic neuropathy (MION) represents a critical public health issue, particularly prevalent in lower socioeconomic populations and regions with restricted alcohol access. MION, characterized by irreversible visual impairment, arises from the toxic metabolization of methanol into formaldehyde and formic acid, leading to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation inhibition, oxidative stress, and subsequent neurotoxicity. The pathogenesis involves axonal and glial cell degeneration within the optic nerve and potential retinal damage. Despite advancements in therapeutic interventions, a significant proportion of affected individuals endure persistent visual sequelae. The study comprehensively investigates the pathophysiology of MION, encompassing the absorption and metabolism of methanol, subsequent systemic effects, and ocular impacts. Histopathological changes, including alterations in retinal layers and proteins, Müller cell dysfunction, and visual symptoms, are meticulously examined to provide insights into the disease mechanism. Furthermore, preventive measures and public health perspectives are discussed to highlight the importance of awareness and intervention strategies. Therapeutic approaches, such as decontamination procedures, ethanol and fomepizole administration, hemodialysis, intravenous fluids, electrolyte balance management, nutritional therapy, corticosteroid therapy, and erythropoietin (EPO) treatment, are evaluated for their efficacy in managing MION. This comprehensive review underscores the need for increased awareness, improved diagnostic strategies, and more effective treatments to mitigate the impact of MION on global health."
