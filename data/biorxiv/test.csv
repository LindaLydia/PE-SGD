"Systemic infections leading to sepsis are life-threatening conditions that remain difficult to treat, and the limitations of current experimental models hamper the development of innovative therapies. Animal models are constrained by species-specific differences, while 2D cell culture systems fail to capture the complex pathophysiology of infection. To overcome these limitations, we developed a laser photoablation-based, three-dimensional microfluidic model of meningococcal vascular colonization, a human-specific bacterium that causes sepsis and meningitis. Laser photoablation-based hydrogel engineering allows the reproduction of vascular networks that are major infection target sites, and this model provides the relevant microenvironment reproducing the physiological endothelial integrity and permeability in vitro. By comparing with a human-skin xenograft mouse model, we show that the model system not only replicates in vivo key features of the infection, but also enables quantitative assessment with a higher spatiotemporal resolution of bacterial microcolony growth, endothelial cytoskeleton rearrangement, vascular E-selectin expression, and neutrophil response upon infection. Our device thus provides a robust solution bridging the gap between animal and 2D cellular models, paving the way for a better understanding of disease progression and developing innovative therapeutics."
"Nuclear homeostasis requires a balance of forces between the cytoskeleton and nucleus. Mutations in the LMNA gene, which encodes the nuclear envelope proteins lamin A/C, disrupt this balance by weakening the nuclear lamina. This results in nuclear damage in contractile tissues and ultimately muscle disease. Intriguingly, disrupting the LINC complex that connects the cytoskeleton to the nucleus has emerged as a promising strategy to ameliorate LMNA-associated cardiomyopathy. Yet how LINC complex disruption protects the cardiomyocyte nucleus remains unclear. To address this question, we developed an assay to quantify the coupling of cardiomyocyte contraction to nuclear deformation and interrogated its dependence on the nuclear lamina and LINC complex. We found that, surprisingly, the LINC complex was mostly dispensable for transferring contractile strain to the nucleus, and that increased nuclear strain in lamin A/C-deficient cardiomyocytes was not rescued by LINC complex disruption. Instead, LINC complex disruption eliminated the cage of microtubules encircling the nucleus. Disrupting microtubules was sufficient to prevent nuclear damage and rescue cardiac function induced by lamin A/C deficiency. We computationally simulated the stress fields surrounding cardiomyocyte nuclei and show how microtubule forces generate local vulnerabilities that damage lamin A/C-deficient nuclei. Our work pinpoints localized, microtubule-dependent force transmission to the nucleus as a pathological driver and therapeutic target for LMNA- cardiomyopathy.

"Enzymes in a pathway often form metabolons through weak protein-protein interactions (PPI) that localize and protect labile metabolites. Due to their transient nature, the structural architecture of these enzyme assemblies has largely remained elusive, limiting our abilities to re-engineer novel metabolic pathways. Here we delineate a complete PPI map of 1225 interactions in the E. coli 1-carbon metabolism pathway using bimolecular fluorescence complementation that can capture transient interactions in vivo and show strong intra- and inter-pathway clusters within the folate and purine biosynthesis pathways. Scanning mutagenesis experiments along with AlphaFold predictions and meta-dynamics simulations reveal that most proteins use conserved ""dedicated"" interfaces distant from their active sites to interact with multiple partners. Diffusion-reaction simulations with shared interaction surfaces and realistic PPI networks reveal a dramatic speedup in metabolic pathway fluxes. Overall, this study sheds light on the fundamental features of metabolon biophysics and structural aspects of transient binary complexes.

Significance statementEnzymes from the same metabolic pathway often form dynamic assemblies called metabolons, which channel metabolites as well as protect labile intermediates. Yet very little is known about their structural features or what makes these interactions transient. Paucity of such information has particularly affected our ability to engineer novel metabolic pathways, construct multi-scale mathematical models of cells, etc. We address this by obtaining a comprehensive map for 1225 interaction pairs in the essential 1-carbon metabolism pathway of E. coli. Using both high-throughput experiments and computation, we uncover that metabolon proteins tend to use a conserved dedicated interface to interact with their partners. These results shed light on structural and energetic aspects of PPI in metabolons at near atomic level of resolution."
"Signaling pathways depend on negative and positive feedback loops (NFLs and PFLs) to regulate internal noise. Across diverse organisms, signaling is regulated by NFLs that function at different cellular locations. These range from NFLs functioning upstream near signal-receiving receptors to those downstream within the nucleus. While previous studies have examined the relationship between NFLs, internal noise in signaling pathways, and network topology, none have directly addressed how the cellular location of NFLs impacts noise regulation. This is significant given the almost ubiquitous presence of multi-level regulation systems within signaling pathways. Here, we use stochastic models inspired by Imd and Toll signaling to address this gap within the context of immune signaling. We use both mechanistic and evolutionary models to demonstrate how noise is regulated by NFLs and how this, in turn, affects the hosts ability to fight off infection while minimizing immunopathologic effects of excessive immune gene expression. We found that downstream NFLs reduce noise in antimicrobial peptides (AMP) expression for some parameter values. On the other hand, upstream NFLs amplify the noise, but the presence of a strong PFL can reduce this noise. Our evolutionary simulations suggest that the mechanisms through which the downstream NFL operates within the cell can affect the evolution of the upstream NFLs. The results of our study provide insight into why distinct signaling pathways are regulated by varying numbers of NFLs, which operate in different cellular locations and employ diverse mechanisms to control gene expression.

Author SummarySignaling pathways are noisy biological circuits. This noise is caused by random fluctuations in the number of proteins that function within these pathways. To properly respond to external stimuli, the ratio of noise to information needs to be minimized. To regulate noise, biological pathways produce proteins that either reduce (negative feedback) or amplify (positive feedback) signaling following stimulation. Negative feedback loops can shut down signaling by interfering with the first steps of signaling, which entail the detection of stimuli. Conversely, signaling might be left intact, and instead, negative feedback loops might interfere with the last step, which is the production of output. These regulatory differences can affect noise within signaling pathways. Here, we examined this using stochastic (inherently random) models to simulate immune signaling in response to pathogens. We found that negative feedback loops that function at later stages of signaling can decrease noise in the output, while negative feedback loops that act at earlier stages amplify the noise, but this noise can be reduced by the presence of a strong positive feedback loop."
"Cells frequently undergo spontaneous morphogenesis, yet the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. While actin filaments are central to cell morphogenesis and are typically regulated by biochemical signaling, cells can form protrusions even without clear external cues, suggesting the existence of intrinsic physical mechanisms. Here, we report that actin filaments undergo directional movement driven by treadmilling, an ATP-fueled polymerization-disassembly cycle intrinsic to actin. These Self-propelled Treadmilling Actin filaments (SpTAs), exhibit stochastic yet directional motion, in a manner similar to self-propelled ""particles"" rather than the previously reported reaction-diffusion ""waves"". SpTA arrival at the cell periphery drives membrane protrusion by orienting their polymerizing ends outwards. This SpTA accumulation, guided by nascent membrane curvature, further amplifies protrusion growth and expansion, driving cellular polarization for migration. Our findings establish actin filament as a novel class of active particle, providing a fundamental physical framework for understanding how molecular-scale motion leads to higher-order organization in living systems."
"The evolution of tube-like floral morphologies that control pollen release via small openings (functionally poricidal flowers) represents a taxonomically and geographically widespread instance of repeated and independent evolution of a functionally similar morphology. Poricidal flowers are also often closely associated with buzz pollination by bees. Yet we lack an updated angiosperm-wide survey of their phylogenetic distribution. We identify all known angiosperm genera containing poricidal flowers via a literature survey. We determined their phylogenetic distribution and minimum number of independent gains and losses via a species-level angiosperm-wide phylogeny. We estimated if evolution of poricidal flowers is associated with changes in speciation/extinction via diversification rate analyses. Poricidal flowers occur across 87 angiosperm families and 639 genera containing >28,000 species. At the species level, an average of 205 independent gains and 215 losses of poricidal flowers occurred. Angiosperm-wide analyses suggest an early burst in poricidal evolution, but no differences in net diversification (origination-extinction) between non-poricidal and poricidal taxa. Analyses for two focal families however indicate strong context-dependent effects of poricidal flowers on diversification. Poricidal evolution thus represents a large-scale example of convergent evolution in floral form, but effects on diversification appear to be strongly contingent on phylogenetic and ecological background."
"The development of therapeutics builds on testing their efficiency in vitro. To optimize gene therapies, for example, fluorescent reporters expressed by treated cells are typically utilized as readouts. Traditionally, their global fluorescence signal has been used as an estimate of transduction efficiency. However, analysis in individual cells within a living 3D tissue remains a challenge. Readout on a single-cell level can be realized via fluorescence-based flow cytometry at the cost of tissue dissociation and loss of spatial information. Complementary, spatial information is accessible via immunofluorescence of fixed samples. Both approaches impede time-dependent studies on the delivery of the vector to the cells.

Here, quantitative 3D characterization of viral transduction efficiencies in living retinal organoids is introduced. The approach combines quantified gene delivery efficiency in space and time, leveraging human retinal organoids, engineered adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors, confocal live imaging, and deep learning-based image segmentation. The integration of these tools in an organoid imaging and analysis pipeline allows quantitative testing of future treatments and other gene delivery methods. It has the potential to guide the development of therapies in biomedical applications."
"Primary cilia dysfunction underlies a group of severe disorders known as ciliopathies. These include Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), which is caused by mutations in BBS genes encoding for components of ciliary protein complexes essential for the assembly and maintenance of primary cilia. As in most ciliopathies, a hallmark feature of BBS is the development of cystic kidney disease. However, the molecular mechanisms linking ciliary dysfunction to cystogenesis remain incompletely understood. Here, we show that Bbs8-/- mice develop late-onset cystic kidney disease accompanied by increased regulated cell death and fibrosis. While the number and length of cilia are not affected, loss of BBS8 reduces K40 acetylation of -tubulin within primary cilia, compromising ciliary stability. Notably, proteomic analysis revealed a significant upregulation of histone deacetylase HDAC2 in Bbs8-/- kidneys, which we confirmed in Bbs8-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and in urine-derived renal epithelial cells (URECs) from a BBS8 patient. We further demonstrate the protein interaction between BBS8 and HDAC2, implicating a disrupted BBS8-HDAC2 regulatory axis in disease pathogenesis. Consistent with a role of excessive HDAC2 activity in the BBS8 deficient cells, pharmacological inhibition of HDAC2 restored tubulin acetylation in BBS8 urine-derived cells. Thus, modulation of HDAC2 activity may represent a strategy to alter ciliary stability in vivo which could explain positive effects of class I specific HDAC inhibitors in models of cystic kidney disease."
"The effects of environmental stress on animal life are gaining importance. Diapause is a reversible dormancy program triggered by adverse environmental conditions. To characterize the genetic basis of this complex program, we leveraged the Drosophila Genome Reference Panel (DGRP) to conduct a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS). We assessed post-diapause and non-diapause fecundity across 193 DGRP lines. GWAS revealed 546 variants, encompassing single nucleotide polymorphisms, insertions, and deletions associated with post-diapause fecundity. We identified 291 candidate diapause-associated genes, 40 of which were previously associated with diapause. Gene network analysis indicated that the diapause-associated genes were primarily linked to neuronal and reproductive system development. Similarly, comparison with other fly GWAS revealed the greatest overlap with olfactory-behavior-associated and fecundity-and-lifespan-associated genes. An RNAi screen of selected candidates identified two neuronal genes, Dip- and Scribbler, to be required during recovery for post-diapause fecundity. To complement the genetic analysis, we tested which neurons are required for successful diapause. Although amputation of the antenna had little effect on non-diapause lifespan, it reduced diapause lifespan and post-diapause fecundity. Furthermore, olfactory receptor neurons and temperature-sensing neurons were required for successful diapause recovery. Our results provide insights into the molecular, cellular, and genetic basis of Drosophila adult reproductive diapause."
"The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa serves as a model organism for studying multiple signal transduction pathways. The chemoreceptor cluster, a core component of the chemotaxis pathway, is assembled from hundreds of proteins. The unipolar distribution of receptor clusters has long been recognized, yet the precise mechanism governing their assembly remains elusive. Here, we directly observed the relative positions of the flagellar motor and chemoreceptor cluster using flagellar filament labeling and gene editing techniques. Surprisingly, we found that both are located at the same cell pole, with the distribution pattern controlled by the polar anchor protein FlhF. Additionally, the efficient assembly of the chemoreceptor cluster is partially dependent on the integrity of the motor structure. Furthermore, we discovered that overexpression of the chemotaxis regulatory protein CheY leads to high intracellular levels of the second messenger c-di-GMP, triggering cell aggregation. Therefore, the colocalization of the chemoreceptor cluster and flagellum in P. aeruginosa serves to avoid cross-pathway signaling interference, enabling cells to conduct various physiological activities in an orderly manner."
"Cancer long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been identified by experimental and in silico methods. However, current approaches for identifying cancer lncRNAs are not sufficient and effective. To uncover them, we focused on the core cancer driver lncRNAs, which directly interact with cancer driver protein-coding genes (PCGs). We investigated various aspects of cancer lncRNAs, including their expression patterns, genomic locations, and direct interactions with cancer driver PCGs, and developed a pipeline to unearth candidate cancer driver lncRNAs. Finally, we validated the reliability of potential cancer driver lncRNAs through functional analysis of bioinformatics data and CRISPR-Cas9 knockout experiments. We found that cancer lncRNAs were more concentrated in cancer driver topologically associated domains (CDTs), and CDT is an important feature in identifying cancer lncRNAs. Moreover, cancer lncRNAs showed a high tendency to co-express with and bind to cancer driver PCGs. Utilizing these distinctive characteristics, we developed a pipeline CADTAD to unearth candidate cancer driver lncRNAs in pan-cancer, including 256 oncogenic lncRNAs, 177 tumor suppressive lncRNAs, and 75 dual-function lncRNAs, as well as in three individual cancer types, and validated their cancer-related function. More importantly, the function of 10 putative cancer driver lncRNAs in prostate cancer was subsequently validated to influence cancer phenotype through cell studies. In light of these findings, our study offers a new perspective from the 3D genome to study the roles of lncRNAs in cancer. Furthermore, we provide a valuable set of potential lncRNAs that could deepen our understanding of the oncogenic mechanism of cancer driver lncRNAs."
"Intracellular pH (pHi) dynamics are linked to cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation. The adherens junction (AJ) and signaling protein {beta}-catenin has decreased abundance at high pHi due to increased proteasomal-mediated degradation. However, the effects of low pHi on {beta}-catenin abundance and function have not been characterized. Here, we use population-level and single-cell assays to show that low pHi stabilizes {beta}-catenin, increasing junctional, cytoplasmic, and nuclear abundance. We assayed single-cell protein degradation rates to show that {beta}-catenin half-life is longer at low pHi and shorter at high pHi compared to control. Importantly, a constitutively stabilized and pHi-insensitive {beta}-catenin mutant ({beta}-catenin-H36R), has a longer and pHi-independent half-life. We also determined that the pH-dependent stability of {beta}-catenin affects both its adhesion and signaling functions. We show that the composition of AJs changes with pHi; at low pHi, E-cadherin-containing AJs are enriched in {beta}-catenin while plakoglobin abundance is reduced. Conversely, when {beta}-catenin is lost from E-cadherin-containing AJs at high pHi, plakoglobin is increased. We also found that cell area was reduced at low pHi and increased at high pHi compared to control while cell volume was unaffected, suggesting pHi alters cell-cell adhesion. Finally, we show that low pHi increases {beta}-catenin transcriptional activity in single cells and is indistinguishable from a Wnt-on state, while high pHi reduces {beta}-catenin transcriptional activity compared to control cells. This work characterizes pHi as a true rheostat regulating {beta}-catenin abundance, stability, and function, solidifying {beta}-catenin as a molecular mediator of pHi-dependent cell processes via pH-dependent adhesion and signaling functions.

SummaryIntracellular pH (pHi) regulates the degradation rate of the pH sensor {beta}-catenin, altering protein abundance, subcellular localization, and function in epithelial cells. This work shows pHi acts as a rheostat to alter both adhesion and signaling functions of {beta}-catenin."
"Pairwise perturbation of gene function using the CRISPR/Cas9 system has huge potential in screening for genetic interactions and synthetic lethal gene pairs to identify novel combination therapies for cancer. However, existing dual guide expression systems are cumbersome to clone, often result in a large proportion of undesired guide pairs and have imbalance of guide expression from the two positions. Here, we demonstrate a next-generation system for dual guide delivery based around a tRNA spacer that allows a single step cloning strategy, as little as 2% of undesired guide pairs, and highly balanced expression of the two guides. This system allows efficient library-scale screening for hundreds of thousands of genetic interactions using the well understood Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) system. We use this to screen a 100,136 guide pair library in colorectal cancer cells and successfully identify synthetic lethal genetic interactions between paralogs or other known interacting genes, establishing our method for performing efficient large scale genetic interaction screens. This system is versatile and can be used with most guide RNA vector systems, and for other uses of paired guide delivery such as improving single gene knockout efficiency or improving guide detection in single cell or optical CRISPR screens."
"Over-activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a hallmark of glioblastoma. However, EGFR-targeted therapies have led to minimal clinical response. While delivery of EGFR inhibitors (EGFRis) to the brain constitutes a major challenge, how additional drug-specific features alter efficacy remains poorly understood. We apply highly multiplex single-cell chemical genomics to define the molecular response of glioblastoma to EGFRis. Using a deep generative framework, we identify shared and drug-specific transcriptional programs that group EGFRis into distinct molecular classes. We identify programs that differ by the chemical properties of EGFRis, including induction of adaptive transcription and modulation of immunogenic gene expression. Finally, we demonstrate that pro-immunogenic expression changes associated with a subset of tyrphostin family EGFRis increase the ability of cytotoxic T-cells to eradicate tumor cells. Our study provides a framework that considers each agents unique and often unknown poly-pharmacology to prioritize compounds that induce clinically favorable molecular responses."
"The melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) and a key regulator of appetite and metabolism. It can interact with the melanocortin-receptor accessory protein 2 (MRAP2), a single transmembrane helix protein known to interact with several different GPCRs. However, the consequences of this interaction are not completely understood. Here we report that co-expression of MRAP2 has multiple effects on the MC4R: it enhances G protein-mediated signaling and simultaneously impairs {beta}-arrestin2 recruitment and, consequently, internalization. In addition, co-expression of MRAP2 leads to an increased number of monomers of MC4R by disrupting receptor oligomers. A structural homology model of the active state MC4R-MRAP2-Gs complex suggests interaction sites between MRAP2 and MC4R that are relevant for receptor activation. Taken together, our data indicate that MRAP2 is an accessory protein that interacts with and influences MC4R structure, biasing its signaling towards G protein-mediated effects."
"Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infects up to 80% of the worlds population. Here, we show that HCMV infection leads to widespread changes in human chromatin accessibility and chromatin looping, with hundreds of thousands of genomic regions affected 48 hours after infection. Integrative analyses reveal HCMV-induced perturbation of Hippo signaling through drastic reduction of TEAD1 transcription factor activity. We confirm extensive concordant loss of TEAD1 binding, active H3K27ac histone marks, and chromatin looping interactions upon infection. Our data position TEAD1 at the top of a hierarchy involving multiple altered important developmental pathways. HCMV infection reduces TEAD1 activity through four distinct mechanisms: closing of TEAD1-bound chromatin, reduction of YAP1 and phosphorylated YAP1 levels, reduction of TEAD1 transcript and protein levels, and alteration of TEAD1 exon-6 usage. Altered TEAD1-based mechanisms are highly enriched at genetic risk loci associated with eye and ear development, providing mechanistic insight into HCMVs established roles in these processes."
"Root biology is pivotal in addressing global challenges including sustainable agriculture and climate change. However, roots have been relatively understudied among plant organs, partly due to the difficulties in imaging root structures in their natural environment. Here we used microfabricated ecosystems (EcoFABs) to establish growing environments with optical access and employed nonlinear multimodal microscopy of third-harmonic generation (THG) and three-photon fluorescence (3PF) to achieve label-free, in situ imaging of live roots and microbes at high spatiotemporal resolution. THG enabled us to observe key plant root structures including the vasculature, Casparian strips, dividing meristematic cells, and root cap cells, as well as subcellular features including nuclear envelopes, nucleoli, starch granules, and putative stress granules. THG from the cell walls of bacteria and fungi also provides label-free contrast for visualizing these microbes in the root rhizosphere. With simultaneously recorded 3PF fluorescence signal, we demonstrated our ability to investigate root-microbe interactions by achieving single-bacterium tracking and subcellular imaging of fungal spores and hyphae in the rhizosphere."
"The rate and chromosomal positioning of meiotic recombination significantly affects the distribution of the genetic diversity in eukaryotic genomes. Many studies have revealed sex-specific recombination patterns, with male recombination typically biased toward chromosome ends, while female recombination is more evenly distributed along chromosomes, or concentrated in pericentromeric region. It has been proposed that such patterns in females may counteract meiotic drive caused by selfish genetic elements near centromeres and should not occur in species devoid of clearly defined centromeres, but evidence for this expectation is scarce. Here, we constructed a sex-specific genetic map of a species with holocentric chromosomes, the bulb mite (Rhizoglyphus robini), a model organism for sexual selection studies with heritable alternative male reproductive phenotypes. We found a similar recombination landscape in both males and females, with a consistent pattern of increased rates towards both chromosome ends, and a higher recombination rate in females than in males. Recombination rate was positively correlated with repeat density and negatively with gene density. Our results are consistent with the meiotic drive hypothesis and suggest that the evolution of recombination patterns is closely linked to chromosome features."
"Tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) play a crucial role in intercellular communication, enabling a dynamic network for the transfer of molecular cargo over long distances between connected cells. Previous studies have demonstrated efficient, directional transfer of -Synuclein (-Syn) aggregates from neurons to microglia, with endosomal trafficking and lysosomal processing identified as the primary events following -Syn internalization. Using human neuronal and microglial cell lines, we found that microglia exhibit higher lysosomal turnover, particularly through lysophagy, whereas neuronal lysosomes display compromised degradative capacity and impaired autophagic flux. This deficiency results in less efficient degradation of aggregates in neurons. Moreover, perturbation of autophagy enhances TNT-mediated transfer of aggregate from neuronal cells to microglia. In contrast, microglia co-cultured with -Syn-containing neurons upregulate autophagy flux, enabling efficient degradation of the transferred aggregates. These findings were further validated using human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC)-derived neurons and microglia. Overall, our study highlights the distinct responses of neurons and microglia to -Syn aggregates and identifies dysfunctional autophagy in neurons as a key driver of the preferential and directional transfer of aggregates to microglia."
"Predicting the protein stability changes upon mutations is one of the effective ways to improve the efficiency of protein engineering. Here, we propose a dual-view ensemble learning-based framework, DVE-stability, for mutation-induced protein stability change prediction from single sequence. DVE-stability integrates the global and local dependencies of mutations to capture the intramolecular interactions from two views through ensemble learning, in which a structural microenvironment simulation module is designed to indirectly introduce the information of structural microenvironment at the sequence level. DVE-stability achieved state-of-the-art prediction performance on 7 single-point mutation benchmark datasets, and comprehensively surpassed other methods on 5 of them. Furthermore, DVE-stability outperformed other methods comprehensively through zero-shot inference on multiple-point mutation prediction task, demonstrating superior model generalizability to capture the epistasis of multiple-point mutations. More importantly, DVE-stability exhibited superior generalization performance in predicting rare beneficial mutations that are crucial for practical protein directed evolution scenarios. In addition, DVE-stability identified important intramolecular interactions via attention scores, demonstrating interpretable. Overall, DVE-stability provides a flexible and efficient tool for mutation-induced protein stability change prediction in an interpretable ensemble learning manner."
"A central challenge in neuroscience is decoding brain activity to uncover mental content comprising multiple components and their interactions. Despite progress in decoding language-related information from human brain activity, generating comprehensive descriptions of complex mental content associated with structured visual semantics remains challenging. We present a method that generates descriptive text mirroring brain representations via semantic features computed by a deep language model. Constructing linear decoding models to translate brain activity induced by videos into semantic features of corresponding captions, we optimized candidate descriptions by aligning their features with brain-decoded features through word replacement and interpolation. This process yielded well-structured descriptions that accurately capture viewed content, even without relying on the canonical language network. The method also generalized to verbalize recalled content, functioning as an interpretive interface between mental representations and text, and simultaneously demonstrating the potential for non-verbal thought-based brain-to-text communication, which could provide an alternative communication pathway for individuals with language expression difficulties, such as aphasia."

"To survive, animals must rapidly learn to avoid predictable threats. Such learning depends on detecting reliable cue-outcome relationships that efficiently drive behavioral adaptations. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) integrates learned information about the environment to guide adaptive behaviors1-7 and is critical for threat avoidance8-15. However, as most studies have focused on well-learned threat avoidance strategies, the specific inputs that signal avoidability and drive rapid avoidance learning remain poorly understood. Dopamine (DA) inputs from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) potently modulate prefrontal function and are preferentially engaged by aversive stimuli16-21. Previous studies implicated VTA and prefrontal DA in aversive learning22-25, but their findings have been constrained by limited spatiotemporal resolution. Here, we used high-resolution tools to dissect the role of the VTA-mPFC DA circuit in rapid avoidance learning. Optogenetic suppression of VTA DA terminals in mPFC selectively impaired learning of a cued avoidance response, without affecting cue-shock association learning, reactive escape behaviors, or expression of previously learned avoidance. Using a fluorescent DA sensor, we observe rapid, event-locked DA activity that emerged transiently during the initiation of learning. Increased DA encoded aversive outcomes and their predictive cues, while decreased DA encoded their omission and predicted how quickly mice learned to avoid. In yoked mice lacking control over shock omission, these dynamics were largely absent. Together, these findings demonstrate that the VTA-mPFC DA circuit is necessary for rapid acquisition of proactive avoidance behaviors and reveal transient event-related DA signals that underlie this form of learning."
"The advent of single-cell profiling technologies has revolutionized our understanding of the cellular and molecular states that underpin disease. However, current computational tools struggle to recover both known and novel mechanistic insights at distinct layers of biological regulation. Here, we present Decipher, a novel computational pipeline that builds integrated cell signalling networks from single-cell profiles in a context-specific, data-driven manner and identifies the key cellular and molecular events that drive disease. We benchmarked Decipher against existing tools and found it could recover known, experimentally determined cytokine signalling pathways, whilst maintaining the flexibility to detect novel pathways and context-specific effects. Notably, Decipher produces global cell-to-cell signalling maps that are interpretable. We utilised Decipher to unveil the cellular and molecular mechanisms driving a novel population of inflammatory monocytes enriched with interferon stimulated genes that is markedly increased in frequency following secondary immunization with the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine. Finally, we employed Decipher to interrogate regulon profiles from covid-19 patients with mild versus severe disease, and we found that progression to severe disease was associated with a loss of interferon signalling transcription factors (Irf7, Irf9, STAT1, STAT2) and a gain of factors that drive inflammation and cellular stress responses (NFkB, HIF-1a, ATF3, ATF4). Taken together, our findings demonstrate that Decipher can decode signalling pathways and report on ligand-receptor mediated transcription factor-target gene networks that underlie processes in homeostasis, disease, and cellular responses to therapies. We present Decipher as an invaluable new tool for the discovery of novel therapeutic targets and the development of new medicines."
"Perseveration - repeating one choice when others would generate larger rewards - is a common behavior, but neither its purpose nor neuronal mechanisms are understood. Here we demonstrate a neural correlate and causal role of dorsal prefrontal cortex, specifically anterior supplementary motor cortex (MOs) in perseveration in mice performing a dynamic reward learning task. An auditory go cue signaled mice to turn a wheel either left or right, with the reward probability of each action switching in blocks. Mice perseverated, gaining suboptimal reward, but were faster when making repeated choices. Neuropixels recordings found neurons whose activity correlated with perseveration and predicted rapid reaction times, almost exclusively in anterior MOs. Optogenetically inhibiting this region at choice time reduced perseveration and slowed reactions. In contrast, inactivating medial prefrontal cortex at choice time had no effect, but inactivating it after reward delivery impaired learning. In this task, therefore, anterior MOs reflects a perseverative decision variable, and is necessary for mediating the effect of this decision variable on choice and reaction time."
"The canonical framework for testing pain and mechanical sensitivity in rodents is manual delivery of stimuli to the paw. However, this approach is time consuming, produces variability in results, requires significant training, and is ergonomically unfavorable to the experimenter. To circumvent limitations in manual delivery of stimuli, we have created a device called the ARM (Automated Reproducible Mechano-stimulator). Built using a series of linear stages, cameras, and stimulus holders, the ARM is more accurate at hitting the desired target, delivers stimuli faster, and decreases variability in delivery of von Frey hair filaments. We demonstrate that the ARM can be combined with traditional measurements of pain behavior and automated machine-learning based pipelines. Importantly, the ARM enables remote testing of mice with experimenters outside the testing room. Using remote testing, we found that mice habituated more quickly when an experimenter was not present and experimenter presence leads to significant sex-dependent differences in paw withdrawal and pain associated behaviors. Lastly, to demonstrate the utility of the ARM for neural circuit dissection of pain mechanisms, we combined the ARM with cellular-resolved microendoscopy in the amygdala, linking stimulus, behavior, and brain activity of amygdala neurons that encode negative pain states. Taken together, the ARM improves speed, accuracy, and robustness of mechanical pain assays and can be combined with automated pain detection systems and brain recordings to map central control of pain."
"Humans have the capacity to persist in behavioural policies, even in challenging environments that lack immediate reward. Persistence is the scaffold on which many higher executive functions are built. However, it remains unclear whether humans are uniquely persistent or, instead, if this capacity is widely conserved across species. To address this question, we compared humans with mice and monkeys in harmonised versions of a dynamic decision-making task. The task encouraged all species to strike a balance between persistently exploiting one policy and exploring alternative policies that could become better at any moment. Although all three species had similar strategies, we found that both primate species--humans and monkeys--were able to persist in exploitation for longer than the mice. The similarities in persistence patterns in humans and monkeys, as opposed to mice, may be related to the various ecological, neurobiological, or cognitive factors that differ systematically between these species.

TEASERHumans, monkeys and mice use similar decision-making strategies but differ in their persistence in exploitation."
"In signaling networks, protein-protein interactions are often mediated by modular domains that bind short linear motifs. The motifs sequences affect many factors, among them affinity and specificity, or the ability to bind strongly and to the appropriate partners. Using Deep Mutational Scanning to create a mutant library, and protein complementation assays to measure protein-protein interactions, we determined the in vivo binding strength of a library of mutants of a binding motif on the MAP kinase kinase Pbs2, which binds the SH3 domain of the osmosensor protein Sho1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These measurements were made using the full-length endogenous proteins, in their native cellular environment. We find that along with residues within the canonical motif, many mutations in the residues neighboring the motif also modulate binding strength. Interestingly, all Pbs2 mutations which increase affinity are situated outside of the Pbs2 region that interacts with the canonical SH3 binding pocket, suggesting that other surfaces on Sho1 contribute to binding. We use predicted structures to hypothesize a model of binding which involves residues neighboring the canonical Pbs2 motif binding outside of the canonical SH3 binding pocket. We compared this predicted structure with known structures of SH3 domains binding peptides through residues outside of the motif, and put forth possible mechanisms through which Pbs2 can bind specifically to Sho1. We propose that for certain SH3 domain-motif pairs, affinity and specificity are determined by a broader range of sequences than what has previously been considered, potentially allowing easier differentiation between otherwise similar partners.

SummaryProtein-protein interactions are often mediated by a binding domain on one protein and a short disordered binding motif on another protein. We measured the binding strength of a mutant library of a binding motif situated in the yeast protein Pbs2 to the SH3 domain of Sho1. Many mutations in the residues neighboring the binding motif affect binding. A protein structure prediction of the interaction partners shows that residues neighboring the motif bind residues outside the known binding pocket on the SH3 domain. The Sho1-Pbs2 interaction differs enough from other known SH3-motif pairs to allow specific binding."
"Broad-scale, long-term water quality (WQ) studies are critical for understanding increasing pressures on inland waters but remain rare due to cost. The LAGOS-US LANDSAT dataset provides 37-year remote sensing-derived WQ estimates for thousands of U.S. lakes > 4 ha (1984-2020). WQ estimates use machine-learning models with Landsat imagery and ground-truthed Water Quality Portal data (LAGOS-US LIMNO). The dataset includes: (a) 45.9 million whole-lake water reflectance (six bands and 15 band ratios); (b) 740,627 matchups from 13,756 lakes with in situ data for six WQ variables: chlorophyll, Secchi depth, true color, dissolved organic carbon, total suspended solids, or turbidity; and (c) predictions for each WQ variable across lake-time combinations with quality imagery. Two random forest models were fit for each variable: Holdout-data (75/25 spatially representative train-test split) and Full-data (trained on all data). Variance explained for the Full-data predictions ranged from 20.7% for TSS to 63.7% for Secchi depth. Imagery underwent cloud and pixel quality control, and workflow components were validated guiding future research."
"Parallel processing is a fundamental organizing principle in the nervous system and understanding how parallel neural circuits generate distinct outputs from common inputs is a key goal of neuroscience. In the mammalian retina, divergence of cone signals into multiple feedforward bipolar cell pathways forms the initial basis for parallel retinal circuits dedicated to specific visual functions. Here, we used patch-clamp electrophysiology, electron microscopy and two photon imaging of a fluorescent glutamate sensor to examine how kinetically-distinct responses arise in transient versus sustained ON alpha RGCs (ON-T and ON-S RGCs) of the mouse retina. We directly compared the visual response properties of these RGCs with their presynaptic bipolar cell partners, which we identified using 3D electron microscopy reconstruction. Different ON bipolar cell subtypes (type 5i, type 6 and type 7) had indistinguishable light-driven responses whereas extracellular glutamate signals around RGC dendrites and postsynaptic excitatory currents measured in ON-T and ON-S RGCs in response to the identical stimuli used to probe bipolar cells were kinetically distinct. Anatomical examination of the bipolar cell axon terminals presynaptic to ON-T and ON-S RGCs suggests that bipolar subtype-specific differences in the size of synaptic ribbon-associated vesicle pools may contribute to transient versus sustained kinetics. Our findings indicate that feedforward bipolar cell synapses are a primary point of divergence in kinetically distinct visual pathways."
"Cancer cell lines are frequently used in biological and translational research to study cellular mechanisms and explore treatment options. However, cancer cell lines may display mutational profiles divergent from native cancers or may be misidentified or contaminated. We explored how similar cancer cell lines are to native cancers to find the most suitable representations for the corresponding diseases by utilising large collections of copy number variation (CNV) profiles and applied machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict cell line classifications.

Our results confirm that cancer cell lines indeed accumulate more mutations compared to native cancers but retain similar CNV profiles. We demonstrate that many relevant oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes are altered by CNV events in both cancers and their corresponding cell lines. Based on the similarities between the two groups and the predictions of the ML model, we provide some recommendations about cell lines with good potential to represent selected cancer types in in vitro studies."
"The rapid and sustained proliferation of cancer cells necessitates increased protein production, which, along with their disrupted metabolism, elevates the likelihood of translation errors. Ribosome-associated quality control (RQC), a recently identified mechanism, mitigates ribosome collisions resulting from frequent translation stalls. However, the precise pathophysiological role of the RQC pathway in oncogenesis remains ambiguous. Our research centered on the pathogenic implications of mitochondrial stress-induced protein carboxyl-terminal alanine and threonine tailing (msiCAT-tailing), a specific RQC response to translational arrest on the outer mitochondrial membrane, in glioblastoma (GBM). The presence of msiCAT-tailed mitochondrial proteins was observed commonly in glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs). Exogenous introduction of mitochondrial ATP synthase F1 subunit alpha (ATP5) protein with artificial CAT-tail mimicking sequences enhanced mitochondrial membrane potential ({Delta}{Psi}m) and inhibited mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) formation. These alterations in mitochondrial characteristics provided resistance to staurosporine (STS)-induced apoptosis in GBM cells. Consequently, msiCAT-tailing can foster cell survival and migration, whereas blocking msiCAT-tailing via genetic or pharmacological intervention can impede GBM cell overgrowth.

"Scalable and efficient neural models with biological plausibility are crucial for real-time applications in neuromorphic hardware and robotics. While biophysically detailed compartmental models are valuable for their accuracy, their complexity and computational cost limit real-world application on currently available hardware. In this study, we harness the signal processing potential of the Izhikevich point neuron model to decode slope and amplitude, both important dynamical features of sensory signals. Results demonstrate that our slope-detector effectively signals up-stokes of naturalistic input signals across a wide range of frequencies. It exhibits bidirectional slope detection, with burst duration encoding slope magnitude in a graded manner. We compare to a biophysically detailed two-compartment pyramidal neuron model, showing that our bursting slope-detector performs similarly. We then demonstrate that our slope-detector does not need to burst, improving efficiency and producing more precise, discrete output by signalling events with single spikes. This makes it well-suited for real-time robotics control systems or neuromorphic hardware applications, offering greater efficiency and enabling large-scale simulations using the same computational power."
"Cellular processes including lysosomal and mitochondrial dysfunction are implicated in the development of many diseases. Quantitative visualization of mitochondria and lysosomes is crucial to understand how these organelles are dysregulated during disease. To address a gap in live-imaging tools, we developed GEM-SCOPe (Genetically Encoded and Modular SubCellular Organelle Probes), a modular toolbox of fluorescent markers designed to inform on localization, distribution, turnover, and oxidative stress of specific organelles. We expressed GEM-SCOPe in differentiated astrocytes and neurons from a human pluripotent stem cell PRKN-knockout model of Parkinsons disease and identified disease-associated changes in proliferation, lysosomal distribution, mitochondrial transport and turnover, and reactive oxygen species. We demonstrate GEM-SCOPe is a powerful panel that provide critical insight into the subcellular mechanisms underlying Parkinsons disease in human cells. GEM-SCOPe can be expanded upon and applied to a diversity of cellular models to glean an understanding of the mechanisms that promote disease onset and progression."
"Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are major producers of type I/III interferons. As interferons are crucial for antiviral defense, pDCs are assumed to play an essential role in this process. However, robust evidence supporting this dogma is scarce. Genetic or pharmacological manipulations that eliminate pDC or disrupt their interferon production often affect other cells, confounding interpretation. To overcome this issue, we engineered pDC-less mice that are specifically and constitutively devoid of pDCs by expressing diphtheria toxin under coordinated control of the Siglech and Pacsin1 genes, uniquely co-expressed in pDCs. pDC-less mice mounted protective immunity against systemic infection with mouse Cytomegalovirus and showed higher survival and less lung immunopathology to intranasal infection with influenza virus and SARS-CoV2. Thus, contrary to the prevailing dogma, we revealed that pDCs and their interferons are dispensable or deleterious during several viral infections. pDC-less mice will enable rigorously reassessing the roles of pDCs in health and disease."
"The Expensive Tissue Hypothesis was proposed to account for thermal homeostasis during the evolutionary expansion of brain size in the human lineage and abandoned following publication of a study that found no significant anticorrelations among the body mass-independent residuals of metabolically expensive organs in over 100 mammals, including 23 primates. Re-examination of the same dataset reveals a consistent tradeoff between the liver and brain proportions of a four-organ thermogenic core (kidney, heart, liver and brain), an inherent mechanism of thermoregulation that predates the emergence of permanent homeothermy. The ability of current models of brain size evolution to account for thermal homeostasis is limited by two common assumptions: that organ sizes evolve independently, and that the energy cost of the brain is proportional to the log ratio of brain mass with respect to body mass. Instead, arithmetic ratios provide direct experimental evidence for thermoregulatory constraints on brain size, as do organ cellular metabolic rates (cMRs). These are inferred without log transformation from the parallel adaptive increases in MR/kg and number of microRNA families (mirFam) that have accompanied major shifts in mammalian evolution. The cMR of the liver, the primary organ of gluconeogenesis, varies inversely with that of the brain, the primary consumer of glucose, a phylogenetic plasticity that appears to recapitulate the livers unique developmental plasticity. With mirFam as a proxy for energy reliability, a positive feedback model of relative brain size detected adaptation to a low-energy regime among the smallest primates and, among the largest primates, adaptation to the physiological limit on the rate of heat dissipation."
"MotivationProtein language models are enabling advances in elucidating the sequence-to-function mapping, and have important applications in protein design. Models based on multiple sequence alignments efficiently capture the evolutionary information in homologous protein sequences, but multiple sequence alignment construction is imperfect.

ResultsWe present ProtMamba, a homology-aware but alignment-free protein language model based on the Mamba architecture. In contrast with attention-based models, ProtMamba efficiently handles very long context, comprising hundreds of protein sequences. It is also computationally efficient. We train ProtMamba on a large dataset of concatenated homologous sequences, using two GPUs. We combine autoregressive modeling and masked language modeling through a fill-in-the-middle training objective. This makes the model adapted to various protein design applications. We demonstrate ProtMambas usefulness for sequence generation, motif inpainting, fitness prediction, and modeling intrinsically disordered regions. For homolog-conditioned sequence generation, ProtMamba outperforms state-of-the-art models. ProtMambas competitive performance, despite its relatively small size, sheds light on the importance of long-context conditioning.

AvailabilityA Python implementation of ProtMamba is freely available in our GitHub repository: https://github.com/Bitbol-Lab/ProtMamba-ssm."
"Semi-supervised learning offers a cost-effective approach for neuron segmentation in electron microscopy (EM) volumes. This technique leverages extensive unlabeled data to regularize supervised training for more robust predictions of neuron boundaries. However, the distribution mismatch between labeled and unlabeled data, due to limited annotations and diverse neuronal structures, can cause unreliable predictions on unlabeled data, thus limiting the generalization of semi-supervised models. In this paper, we develop a distribution-aware pipeline to address the inherent mismatch issue and enhance semi-supervised neuron segmentation in EM volumes. At the data level, we propose an unsupervised heuristic to select valuable sub-volumes as labeled data based on distribution similarity in a pretrained feature space, ensuring a representative coverage of neuronal structures. At the model level, we introduce an axial-through mixing strategy into anisotropic neuron segmentation and integrate it into a semi-supervised framework. Building on this, we establish cross-view consistency constraints through intra- and inter-mixing of labeled and unlabeled data, which facilitates the learning of shared semantics across distributions. Extensive experiments on public EM datasets from multiple species, imaging modalities, and resolutions demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Codes and demos are available at https://github.com/yanchaoz/SL-SSNS."
"During cognitive tasks, increased frontoparietal neural activity and functional connectivity are commonly observed in older adults. Cognitive reserves accrued from positive life choices can provide additional neural resources to cope with aging. However, how cognitive reserves interact with upregulated neural activity in older adults is poorly understood. We measured brain activity with fMRI during a speech-in-noise task and assessed whether cognitive reserve accumulated from long-term musical training bolsters or holds back age-related upregulated activity. Older musicians exhibited less upregulation of task-induced functional connectivity than older non-musicians in auditory dorsal regions, which predicted better behavioral performance in older musicians. These results suggest that cognitive reserve may hold back neural recruitment. Besides functional connectivity strength, we also found that older musicians showed more youth-like fine spatial patterns of functional connectivity than older non-musicians. Our findings enlightened the intricate interplay between cognitive reserve and age-related upregulated activity during speech in noise perception.

Significance StatementUnderstanding the interplay between cognitive reserve and age-related neural changes is vital for developing strategies to mitigate cognitive decline in older adults. This study reveals that long-term musical training, which provides cognitive reserve for speech perception, helps older musicians preserve youth-like levels of functional connectivity and fine-scale activity patterns in the auditory dorsal stream during speech-in-noise perception. Unlike older non-musicians, who exhibit age-related neural upregulation, older musicians maintain youth-like connectivity patterns akin to those of younger adults, resulting in superior speech-in-noise perception. These findings support the ""Hold-back upregulation"" hypothesis and suggest that musical training counteracts age-related declines by preserving youthful brain function. The results offer valuable insights for designing interventions to enhance aging populations cognitive function and communication abilities."
"Precise regulation of protein synthesis is critical to a variety of brain functions including long-term memory. Dysregulated protein synthesis has been implicated in several disorders characterized by memory deficits. In contrast to mRNA methylation such as N6-methyladenosine (m6A) that was widely studied in memory, the regulation and function of mRNA acetylation in memory remain largely unknown. N4-acetylcytidine (ac4C), the only known form of RNA acetylation in eukaryotes, has recently been shown to regulate mRNA stability and translation efficiency. In this study, we identified the ac4C epitranscriptome through ac4C-RNA immunoprecipitation followed by next-generation sequencing (acRIP-seq) in the homogenates and synaptosomes of mouse hippocampus, a brain region critical for spatial memory. The task of Morris water maze (MWM) was employed to induce and evaluate memory acquisition and forgetting processes. Interestingly, the levels of ac4C mRNA were upregulated in the synaptosomes after memory formation but returned to normal levels after memories were naturally forgotten. The dynamic changes of ac4C-mRNAs regulated by memory were validated by ac4C dot-blot, Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and acRIP-qPCR analysis. We further demonstrate that NAT10, the ac4C writer, in mouse hippocampus is important for spatial memory via regulating memory-related mRNAs, proteins, and ultimately synaptic plasticity. Lastly, we generated a freely-accessible website (http://ac4catlas.com) that included the dataset of ac4C epitranscriptome in mouse hippocampus. Altogether these results reveal a previously unappreciated mechanism underlying memory."
"Time-series spatial transcriptome data with single-cell resolution provide an opportunity to study cell differentiation, proliferation and migration in physical space over time. Due to the destructive nature of sequencing, reconstruction of spatiotemporal dynamics from data remains challenging. Especially, the inference of migration in physical space remains a difficult task, as samples obtained at different temporal snapshots might not be in the same coordinate system due to the difference of biological replicates. Here we developed stVCR, a generative deep learning model, which integrates the dynamical optimal transport (OT) with the unbalanced setting, the density matching invariant to rigid body transformations as well as priors to model known biology and preserve spatial structure. stVCR achieves the end-to-end simultaneous reconstruction of continuous cell differentiation, proliferation, physical space migration, and spatial coordinates alignment from spatial transcriptome snapshots. In addition, stVCR allows the interpretable study of complex interactions between cell phenotype transition, spatial migration and proliferation. Through benchmarking on both simulation data and real datasets, we validated the effectiveness and robustness of stVCR and demonstrated its advantages over static OT or linear interpolation methods. We applied stVCR to dissect spatiotemporal dynamics underlying axolotl brain regeneration and 3D Drosophila embryo development."
"While the importance of spontaneous mutation and gene acquisition in the emergence and adaptive evolution of microbial pathogens is well recognized, the role of gene loss remains underexplored. Here, by large-scale phylogenomic analysis of 8,684 global isolates, we reconstructed the origin and evolutionary dynamics of the pandemic clone (PC) of Vibrio parahaemolyticus, the leading cause of seafood-associated infections worldwide. As has also been observed for the pandemic lineage of V. cholerae, the emergence of the clone involved the acquisition of multiple marker genes and genomic islands within a short timeframe ([~]60 years), followed by divergence into distinct, successive sublineages mediating independent waves of cross-country transmission. In V. parahaemolyticus, a recent wave succession event within the last two decades has been driven by gene-loss in the putrescine utilization (Puu) pathway, which confers phenotypic advantages related to environmental adaptation (enhanced biofilms) and human transmission (increased cell adhesion and intestinal colonization, reduced virulence in an animal model and milder clinical symptoms in humans), aligning with the trade-off hypothesis of pathogen virulence evolution. We identify similar lineage-specific Puu-gene-loss across multiple bacterial genera, with effects on biofilm and adhesion replicated in V. cholerae and Escherichia coli, suggesting convergent evolution and universal phenotypic effects across bacteria. Our findings highlight the indispensable role of gene loss in the adaptive evolution of bacterial pathogens."
"The Type VI Secretion System (T6SS) is a bacterial organelle that resembles a poison-tipped spear and is deployed by a wide range of Gram-negative species to intoxicate prokaryotic and eukaryotic prey. In this capacity, T6SSs are implicated in facilitating interbacterial antagonism and host-microbe interactions. Past reports have elucidated that many strains of Vibrio parahaemolyticus which cause Acute Hepatopancreatic Necrosis Disease (AHPND) in shrimp harbor two functional T6SSs (T6SS1 and T6SS2), leading to speculation about the contribution of these systems to disease progression. In the present study, we confirm the antibacterial functionality of T6SS1 and T6SS2 in the representative AHPND-causing V. parahaemolyticus (VPAHPND) strain 13-306/D4. Employing a small-scale shrimp infection model, we then demonstrate that T6SS1 enhances the lethality of this isolate against whiteleg shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) postlarvae under warm, marine-like conditions. We additionally describe a novel antibacterial toxin/immunity pair encoded on pVA-like plasmids that features a putative colicin/bacteriocin effector domain. Our findings provide empirical evidence that Type VI Secretion (T6S) contributes to AHPND pathogenesis under conditions that are relevant to commercial aquaculture, inviting further studies to clarify the role of T6S as a virulence determinant.

Author summaryType VI Secretion Systems (T6SSs) have drawn interest as versatile organelles that augment virulence and competitive fitness in myriad bacterial species. Included among these species are members of the genus Vibrio, many of which have clinical and commercial importance as pathogens or aquaculture pests. Isolates of Vibrio parahaemolyticus that harbor the pirAvp and pirBvp toxin genes encoded on pVA1-like plasmids have been identified as a causative agent of Acute Hepatopancreatic Necrosis Disease (AHPND), an illness that results in mass mortality events in shrimp aquaculture systems. It has been noted that, aside from PirA/Bvp, many VPAHPND strains harbor two T6SSs (T6SS1 and T6SS2) which may be employed to outcompete and displace the native shrimp microbiome during colonization. In this study, we have directly assessed the effects of inactivating T6SS1 and T6SS2 on the lethality of a representative VPAHPND isolate against whiteleg shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) postlarvae using an immersion challenge infection assay. Our findings indicate that T6SS1 contributes to the virulence of VPAHPND against L. vannamei under warm, marine-like conditions, although further studies are needed to determine the underlying mechanisms. The present study helps to elucidate the factors involved in AHPND pathogenesis, thereby informing future efforts to develop countermeasures against this disease."
"Cells prevent heat damage through the highly conserved canonical heat stress response (HSR), where heat shock factors (HSFs) bind heat shock elements (HSEs) to activate heat shock proteins (HSPs). Plants generate short HSFs (S-HSFs) derived from HSF splicing variants, yet their functions remain poorly understood. While an enhanced canonical HSR confers thermotolerance, its hyperactivation inhibits plant growth. How plants prevent this hyperactivation to ensure proper growth remains unknown. Here, we report that Arabidopsis S-HsfA2, S-HsfA4c, and S-HsfB1 confer sensitivity to extreme heat (45 {degrees}C) and constitute new HSF types featuring a unique truncated DNA-binding domain (tDBD). This tDBD binds a new heat-regulated element (HRE), which confers minimal promoter heat-responsiveness and exhibits heat stress sensing and transmission patterns. Using S-HsfA2, we investigated whether and how S-HSFs prevent canonical HSR hyperactivation. HSP17.6B, a common direct target of HsfA2 and S-HsfA2, confers thermotolerance; however, its overexpression partially causes HSR hyperactivation. Moreover, HRE-HRE-like and HSE elements mediate the HSP17.6B promoters heat response. We further show S-HsfA2 alleviates hyperactivation via two mechanisms: 1) S-HsfA2 negatively regulates HSP17.6B via the HRE-HRE-like element, establishing a noncanonical HSR (S-HsfA2-HRE-HSP17.6B) that antagonistically represses HsfA2-activated HSP17.6B expression. 2) S-HsfA2 binds the HsfA2 DBD, preventing HsfA2 from binding HSEs and thereby attenuating HsfA2-activated HSP17.6B promoter activity. Overall, our findings highlight the essential role of S-HsfA2 in preventing hyperactivation of plant heat tolerance to maintain proper growth."
"Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) have emerged as crucial regulators of protein function, allowing proteins to sense and respond to their environment. Creb binding protein (CBP) and EP300 (p300) are transcription coactivators that regulate gene expression in multicellular organisms, following their recruitment to cis-regulatory elements. CBP and p300 contain large IDRs, however little is known about how these different IDRs work together to regulate CBP function. Here, we show that CBP-IDRs cooperate to control different aspects of CBP behaviour in the nucleus, by regulating the properties of fluid-like condensates formed by endogenous CBP. We show how IDRs with different sequence properties make unique contributions to CBP behaviour by establishing a balance between positive and negative regulation of CBP condensates. These conflicting interactions are functionally important, shaping CBPs response to factors such as lysine acetylation, that influence condensate formation. When disrupted, regulatory CBP-IDRs change how CBP interacts with chromatin, alter patterns of CBP-dependent histone acetylation and change gene expression. Together, our work highlights how IDRs with different sequences, spatially segregated in the same protein, can cooperate to shape protein function."
"Alkaloids are nitrogen-containing natural products derived from amino acids. The basic amino acids lysine and ornithine are precursors to a wide range of alkaloids including the bioactive compounds nicotine, hyoscyamine and securinine. Feeding experiments have shown that the amino acids can be incorporated into alkaloids in a symmetric or nonsymmetric manner. The symmetric pathway is catalysed by two enzymes, a decarboxylase and oxidase, forming a cyclic iminium which acts as the electrophile in the scaffold forming step. Here, we describe the ornithine/lysine/arginine decarboxylase-oxidases (OLADOs), PLP-dependent enzymes responsible for the nonsymmetric pathway, catalysing the single step decarboxylative oxidative deamination of lysine, ornithine or arginine. These enzymes are group III ornithine/lysine/arginine decarboxylases (OLADs), an enzyme class previously exclusively associated with prokaryotes. We reveal OLADs to be widespread in plants and show that OLADOs have repeatedly emerged through parallel evolution from OLADs, via similar active site substitutions. This investigation introduces a new class of eukaryotic decarboxylases, and describes enzymes involved in multiple alkaloid biosynthesis pathways. It furthermore demonstrates how the principle of parallel evolution at a genomic and enzymatic level can be leveraged for gene discovery across multiple lineages."
"Understanding the mechanistic basis of life history divergence is fundamental for predictive ecology. Variation in resource use impacts life history divergence and provides a framework for studying life history trade-offs. Contrary to the theory, empirical evidence does not support that resource allocation alone mediates life history divergence in the wild, which subsequently suggests a pivotal role for resource acquisition, but this has not been empirically demonstrated in free-living populations. Here, we sampled wild Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) from different age groups during their marine feeding stage and hypothesized that prey taxa (crustaceans versus fish) have an age-dependent effect on the condition factor. We found that salmon in their first year at sea had a higher condition factor when foraging on larger numbers of crustaceans and a lower condition factor when foraging on larger numbers of fish, and vice versa in older sea age groups. Provided that condition factor is a predictor of age-at-maturity, our results show that resource acquisition may be an important process shaping life history variation in Atlantic salmon via modulating age-dependent performance trade-offs. Our results also emphasize the importance of bottom-up trophic cascades for maturation age and help to better predict the maturation dynamics of wild populations in the marine environment."

"While it is recognized that excess expression of non-essential proteins burdens cell growth, the physiological state of cells under such stress is largely unknown. This is because it is challenging to distinguish between adverse effects arising from the properties of the expressed excess protein (cytotoxicity) and those caused solely by protein overexpression. In this study, we attempted to identify the model protein with the lowest cytotoxicity in yeast cells by introducing a new neutrality index. We found that a non-fluorescent fluorescent protein (mox-YG) and an inactive glycolytic enzyme (Gpm1- CCmut) showed the lowest cytotoxicity. These proteins can be expressed at levels exceeding 40% of total protein while maintaining yeast growth. The transcriptome of cells expressing mox-YG to the limit indicated that the cells were in a nitrogen source requirement state. Proteome analysis revealed increased mitochondrial protein and decreased ribosome abundance, similar to the inactivated state of the TORC1 pathway. The decrease in ribosome abundance was presumably due to defective nucleolus formation, partially rescued by a mutation in the nuclear exosome. These findings suggest that massive overexpression of excess protein, termed protein burden, causes nitrogen source starvation, a metabolic shift toward more energy-efficient respiration, and a ribosomal biosynthesis defect due to an imbalance between ribosomal protein and rRNA synthesis in the nucleolus."
"Visceral rhythms orchestrate the physiological states underlying human emotion. Chronic aberrations in these brain-body interactions are implicated in a broad spectrum of mental health disorders. However, the relationship of gastric-brain coupling to affective symptoms remains poorly understood. We investigated the relationship between this novel interoceptive axis and mental health in 243 participants, using a cross validated machine learning approach. We find that increased fronto-parietal brain coupling to the gastric rhythm indexes a dimensional signature of worse mental health, spanning anxiety, depression, stress, and well-being. Control analyses confirm the specificity of these interactions to the gastric-brain axis. Our study proposes coupling between the stomach and brain as a factor in mental health and offers potential new targets for interventions remediating aberrant brain-body coupling."
"Cognitive control involves allocating cognitive effort according to internal needs and task demands. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is hypothesized to play a central role in this process. We investigated the neural basis of cognitive control in the ACC of rats performing an adjusting-amount delay discounting task, with a 4s or 8s delay between lever choice and reward. A reinforcement learning model indicated that decision making on this task can be guided by either a value tracking strategy, requiring a  resource-based form of cognitive control or a delay-lever biased strategy requiring a  resistance-based form of cognitive control. This was then tested in vivo by multiple single unit recordings and local field potentials acquired from male rats performing the task. On this task, the behavioral manifestation of resistance-based control is an excessive focus on delayed lever choices which was observed during a substantial portion of 4s but not 8s delay sessions. On a neural level, this was associated with an increase in Theta (6-12Hz) oscillations prior to delay choices which was present exclusively on 4s delay sessions. By contrast, evidence of a resource-based control signal was found in spike trains that closely tracked lever value prior to choice, and was far more prevalent on 8s delay sessions. These data provide candidate neural signatures of  resource-based versus  resistance-based forms of cognitive control. While mediated by distinct neural mechanisms, either form could be engaged by individual subjects under different task conditions."
"Parkinsons disease (PD) and other -synucleinopathies are characterized by the intracellular aggregates of -synuclein (S) believed to spread via the cell-to-cell transmission. To understand the contributions of various brain cells to the spreading of S pathology, we examined the metabolism of S aggregates in neuronal and glial cells. In neurons, while the full-length S rapidly disappeared following S PFF uptake, truncated S accumulated with a half-life of days rather than hours. Epitope mapping and fractionation studies indicate that S fibrils internalized by neurons was truncated at the C-terminal region and remained insoluble. In contrast, microglia and astrocytes rapidly metabolized S fibrils as the half-lives of S fibrils in these glial cells were <6 hours. Differential uptake and processing of S fibrils by neurons and glia was recapitulated in vivo where injection of fluorescently labeled S fibrils initially accumulated in glial cells followed by rapid clearance while neurons stably accumulated S fibrils at slower rate. Immunolocalization and subcellular fractionation studies show that internalized S PFF is initially localized to endosomes followed by lysosomes. The lysosome is largely responsible for the degradation of internalized S PFF as the inhibition of lysosomal function leads to the stabilization of S in all cell types. Significantly, S PFF causes lysosomal dysfunction in neurons. In summary, we show that neurons are inefficient in metabolizing internalized S aggregates, partially because S aggregates cause lysosomal dysfunction, potentially generating aggregation-prone truncated S. In contrast, glial cells may protect neurons from S aggregates by rapidly clearing S aggregates."
"Peripheral sensory neurons regenerate their axons after injury to regain function, but this ability declines with age. The mechanisms behind this decline are not fully understood. While excessive production of endothelin 1 (ET-1), a potent vasoconstrictor, is linked to many diseases that increase with age, the role of ET-1 and its receptors in axon regeneration is unknown. Using single cell RNA sequencing, we show that satellite glial cells (SGCs), which completely envelop the sensory neuron soma residing in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG), express the endothelin B receptor (ETBR), while ET-1 is expressed by endothelial cells. Inhibition of ETBR ex-vivo in DRG explant cultures improves axon growth in both adult and aged conditions. In vivo, treatment with the FDA-approved compound, Bosentan, improves axon regeneration and reverses the age-dependent decrease in axonal regenerative capacity. Single-nuclei RNA sequencing and electron microscopy analyses reveal a decreased abundance of SGCs in aged mice compared to adult mice. Additionally, the decreased expression of connexin 43 (Cx43) in SGCs in aged mice after nerve injury is partially rescued by Bosentan treatment. These results reveal that inhibiting ETBR function enhances axon regeneration and rescues the age-dependent decrease in axonal regenerative capacity, providing a potential avenue for future therapies.

"Parent-of-origin effect (POE) is a phenomenon whereby an alleles effect on a phenotype depends both on its allelic identity and parent from whom the allele is inherited, as exemplified by the polar overdominance in the ovine callypyge locus and the human obesity DLK1 locus. Systematic studies of POE of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) are lacking. In this study we use trios among participants in the Framingham Heart Study to examine to what extend POE exists for gene expression of whole blood using whole genome sequencing and RNA sequencing. For each gene and the SNPs in cis, we performed eQTL analysis using genotype, paternal, maternal, and joint models, where the genotype model enforces the identical effect sizes on paternal and maternal alleles, and the joint model allows them to have different effect sizes. We compared models using Bayes factors to identify paternal, maternal, and opposing eQTL, where paternal and maternal effects have opposite directions. The resultant variants are collectively called POE eQTL. The highlights of our study include: 1) There are more than 2, 000 genes harbor POE eQTL and majority POE eQTL are not in the vicinity of known imprinted genes; 2) Among 180 genes harboring opposing eQTL, 99 harbor exclusively opposing eQTL, and 58 of the 99 are phosphoprotein coding genes, reflecting significant enrichment; 3) Paternal eQTL are enriched with GWAS hits, and genes harboring paternal eQTL are enriched with drug targets. Our study demonstrates the abundance of POE in gene expression, illustrates the complexity of gene expression regulation, and provides a resource that is complementary to existing resources such as GTEx. We revisited two previous POE findings in light of our POE results. A SNP residing in KCNQ1 that is maternally associated with diabetes is a maternal eQTL of CDKN1C, not KCNQ1. A SNP residing in DLK1 that showed paternal polar overdominance for human obesity is a maternal eQTL of MEG3, offering an explanation for the baseline risk of homozygous samples through association between MEG3 expression and obesity. Finally, we advised caution on conducting Mendelian randomization using gene expression as the exposure."
"BackgroundThe solution space of an FBA-based model of cellular metabolism, can be characterised by extraction of a bounded, low dimensional kernel (the SSK) that facilitates perceiving it as a geometric object in multidimensional flux space. The aim is to produce an amenable description, intermediate between the single feasible extreme flux of FBA, and the intractable proliferation of extreme modes in conventional solution space descriptions. Fluxes that remain fixed are separated off while the focus of interest is put on the subset of variable fluxes that have a nonzero but finite range of values. For un-bounded fluxes, a finite subrange that geometrically corresponds to the variable flux range is determined and is supplemented by a limited set of rays that encapsulates their unbounded aspects. In this way the kernel emphasises the realistic range of flux variation allowed in the interconnected biochemical network by e.g. limited nutrient uptake, an optimised objective and other model constraints. This work builds on the full presentation of the SSK approach in a research monograph.

MethodsCalculations are performed with the publicly available software package SSKernel, the source code and user manual of which is included as a supplementary file.

ResultsIt is demonstrated how knowledge of the SSK and accompanying rays can be exploited to explore representative flux states of the metabolic network. Noting that bioengineering interventions such as gene knockouts modify the solution space, new tools based on the SSK analysis are presented here that predict the effects of such interventions on a target flux constructed to represent a desired metabolic output. A simple metabolic model is used first to demonstrate the special concepts and constructions needed to define and compute the SSK. The demonstration model is tweaked to produce typical behaviours of larger models, but with kernels in 1,2 or 3 dimensions that are explicitly displayed to visualise the concepts. General applicability to models where visualisation is inaccessible, is illustrated by showing evaluation of potential bioengineering strategies for a genome scale model.

ConclusionsSSKernel is a flexible interactive tool that facilitates an overview of the FBA solution space as a multidimensional geometric object, in terms of a manageable number of parameters. It allows exploration of effects on this solution space from metabolic interventions, and can be used to investigate bioengineering strategies to manipulate cellular metabolism."
"In cleavage-stage embryos, preexisting organelles partition evenly into daughter blastomeres without significant cell growth after symmetric cell division. The presence of mitochondrial DNA within mitochondria and its restricted replication during preimplantation development makes their inheritance particularly important. While chromosomes are precisely segregated by the mitotic spindle, the mechanisms controlling mitochondrial partitioning remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigate the mechanism by which Dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) controls the mitochondrial redistribution and partitioning during embryonic cleavage. Depletion of Drp1 in mouse zygotes causes marked mitochondrial aggregation, and the majority of embryos arrest at the 2-cell stage. Clumped mitochondria are located in the center of mitotic Drp1-depleted zygotes with less uniform distribution, thereby preventing their symmetric partitioning. Asymmetric mitochondrial inheritance is accompanied by functionally inequivalent blastomeres with biased ATP and endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ levels. We also find that marked mitochondrial centration in Drp1-depleted zygotes prevents the assembly of parental chromosomes, resulting in chromosome segregation defects and binucleation. Thus, mitochondrial fragmentation mediated by Drp1 ensure proper organelle positioning and partitioning into functional daughters during the first embryonic cleavage.

Impact statementDepletion of Dynamin-related protein 1, a key regulator of mitochondrial fission, in mouse zygotes impair symmetric organelle partitioning and chromosome segregation leading to early developmental arrest."
"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the most concerning modern threats as it places a greater burden on health systems than HIV and malaria combined. Current surveillance strategies for tracking antimicrobial resistance (AMR) rely on genomic comparisons and depend on sequence alignment with strict similarity cutoffs of greater than 95%. Therefore, these methods have high false-negative error rates due to a lack of reference sequences with a representative coverage of AMR protein diversity. Deep learning (DL) has been used as an alternative to sequence alignment, as artificial neural networks (ANNs) can extract abstract features from data and therefore limit the need for sequence comparisons. Here, a convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained to differentiate antimicrobial resistance proteins from nonresistance proteins and functionally annotate them in nine resistance classes. Our model demonstrated higher recall values (>0.9) than the alignment-based approach for all protein classes tested. Additionally, our CNN architecture allowed us to investigate internal states and explain the model classification regarding protein domain feature importance related to antimicrobial molecule inactivation. Finally, we built an open-source bioinformatic tool that can be used to annotate antimicrobial resistance proteins and provide information on protein domains without sequence alignment."
"Although non-invasive sampling is increasingly used in capture-recapture (CR) experiments, it carries a risk of misidentification that, if ignored, causes an overestimation of population size. Models that deal with misidentification have been proposed. However, these models assume that only one sample per individual can be collected at the same occasion. This is not true for several experiments based on DNA, for example for those that extract the DNA from faecal samples. These models do not take repeated observations into account, leading to biased estimates.

In this paper, we develop an approach that extends the latent multinomial model (LMM) of Link et al. (2010) using a Poisson distribution to model the number of simultaneous multiple samplings of the same individual. We then conduct simulations to test how our new model performs. As an illustration, we applied the new Poisson model to a collection of Eurasian otter faeces (Lampa et al., 2015).

Our findings indicate that repeated observations can be modelled without bias. The application on otters shows that our model is necessary to estimate accurately the population size in presence of misidentification and repeated observations."
"Animals commonly face combinations of thermal and nutritional stress in nature, which will intensify under climate change. While genetic adaptation is necessary to buffer long-term stress, it's unclear whether adaptation to combined stress can occur without compromising viability and thermal plasticity. We tested larval thermotolerance and thermal plasticity in Drosophila melanogaster selected under different temperatures (18{degrees}C, 25{degrees}C, and 28{degrees}C) and diets (standard, diluted, and low-protein:high-carbohydrate [P:C]). Basal larval cold tolerance was affected by both protein concentration and temperature; larvae evolved higher basal cold tolerance on the diluted and low P:C diets at 18{degrees}C and 28{degrees}C. Hardening increased cold tolerance for most lines, except those selected at 18{degrees}C and 28{degrees}C on low P:C diets and at 25{degrees}C on standard diets. Basal larval heat tolerance was affected by selection temperature; selection at 25{degrees}C increased heat tolerance. An interaction between selection temperature, selection diet, and hardening treatment affected larval heat tolerance; hardening reduced heat tolerance in most lines, except those selected at 25{degrees}C on low P:C diets and at 28{degrees}C on standard diets. Our results suggest that adaptation to combined stress allows basal cold tolerance and its plasticity to co-evolve, but not heat tolerance, highlighting ectotherm's vulnerability to long-term climate change."
"Diploid human cells contain two non-identical genomes, and differences in their regulation underlie human development and disease. We present Fiber-seq Inferred Regulatory Elements (FIRE) and show that FIRE provides a more comprehensive and quantitative snapshot of the accessible chromatin landscape across the 6 Gbp diploid human genome, overcoming previously known and unknown biases afflicting our existing regulatory element catalog. FIRE provides a comprehensive genome-wide map of haplotype-selective chromatin accessibility (HSCA), exposing novel imprinted elements that lack underlying parent-of-origin CpG methylation differences, common and rare genetic variants that disrupt gene regulatory patterns, gene regulatory modules that enable genes to escape X chromosome inactivation, and autosomal mitotically stable somatic epimutations. We find that the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) locus harbors the most HSCA in immune cells, and we resolve the specific transcription factor (TF) binding events disrupted by disease-associated variants within the HLA locus. Finally, we demonstrate that the regulatory landscape of a cell is littered with autosomal somatic epimutations that are propagated by clonal expansions to create mitotically stable and non-genetically deterministic chromatin alterations."
"The liver circadian clock and hepatic transcriptome are highly responsive to metabolic signals generated from feeding-fasting rhythm. Previous studies have identified a number of nutrient-sensitive signaling pathways that could interpret metabolic input to regulate rhythmic hepatic biology. Here, we investigated the role of O-GlcNAcylation, a nutrient-sensitive post-translational modification (PTM) in mediating metabolic regulation of rhythmic biology in the liver. We observe daily oscillation of global nuclear protein O-GlcNAcylation in the liver of mice subjected to night-restricted feeding (NRF) using label-free global O-GlcNAc proteomics. Additional site-specific O-GlcNAc analysis by tandem mass tag mass spectrometry further supports temporal differences in O-GlcNAcylation by revealing day-night differences. Proteins involved in gene expression are enriched among rhythmically O-GlcNAcylated proteins, suggesting rhythmic O-GlcNAcylation may directly regulate the daily rhythmicity of the hepatic transcriptome. We show that rhythmic O-GlcNAcylation can also indirectly modulate the hepatic transcriptome by interacting with phosphorylation. Several proteins harboring O-GlcNAcylation-phosphorylation interplay motif exhibit rhythmic O-GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation. Specifically, we show that O-GlcNAcylation occurs at a phospho-degron of a key circadian transcriptional activator, circadian locomotor output cycles kaput (CLOCK), thus regulating its stability and transcriptional output. Finally, we report that day-restricted feeding (DRF) in the nocturnal mouse significantly alters O-GlcNAcylation rhythm. Whereas global O-GlcNAcylation analysis indicates dampening of global O-GlcNAcylation rhythm in mice fed under DRF, site-specific analysis reveals differential responses of O-GlcNAc sites when timing of food intake is altered. Notably, a substantial number of O-GlcNAcylation sites exhibit inverted day-night profiles when mice are subjected to DRF. This suggests the dysregulation of daily nuclear protein O-GlcNAcylation rhythm may contribute to the disruption in liver transcriptomic rhythm previously observed in DRF condition. In summary, our results provide new mechanistic insights into metabolic regulation of daily hepatic transcriptomic rhythm via interplay between O-GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation and shed light on the deleterious effects of improper mealtimes."
"Fully capturing cellular state requires examining genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and other assays for a biological sample and comprehensive computational modeling to reason with the complex and sometimes conflicting measurements. Modeling these so-called multi-omic data is especially beneficial in disease analysis, where observations across omic data types may reveal unexpected patient groupings and inform clinical outcomes and treatments. We present Multi-omic Pathway Analysis of Cells (MPAC), a computational framework that interprets multi-omic data through prior knowledge from biological pathways. MPAC leverages network relationships encoded in pathways through a factor graph to infer consensus activity levels for proteins and associated pathway entities from multi-omic data, runs permutation testing to eliminate spurious activity predictions, and groups biological samples by pathway activities to allow identifying and prioritizing proteins with potential clinical relevance, e.g., associated with patient prognosis. Using DNA copy number alteration and RNA-seq data from head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas as an example, we demonstrate that MPAC predicts a patient subgroup related to immune responses not identified by analysis with either input omic data type alone. Key proteins identified via this subgroup have pathway activities related to clinical outcome as well as immune cell compositions. Our MPAC R package, available at https://bioconductor.org/packages/MPAC, enables similar multi-omic analyses on new datasets."
"Sensory information is represented by small varying neuronal ensembles in sensory cortices. In the auditory cortex (AC) repeated presentations of the same sound activate differing ensembles indicating high trial-by trial variability in activity even though the sounds activate the same percept. Efficient processing of complex acoustic signals requires that these sparsely distributed neuronal ensembles actively interact in order to provide a constant percept. Thus, the differing ensembles might interact to process the incoming sound inputs. Here, we probe interactions within and across ensembles by combining in vivo 2-photon Ca2+ imaging and holographic optogenetic stimulation to study how increased activity of single cells level affects the cortical network. We stimulated a small number of neurons sharing the same frequency preference alongside the presentation of a target pure tone, further increasing their tone-evoked activity. We found that other non-stimulated co-tuned neurons decreased their tone-evoked activity when the frequency of the presented pure tone matched to their tuning property, while non co-tuned neurons were unaffected. Activity decrease was greater for non-stimulated co-tuned neurons with higher frequency selectivity. Co-tuned and non co-tuned neurons were spatially intermingled. Our results shows that co-tuned ensembles communicated and balanced their total activity across the larger network. The rebalanced network activity due to external stimulation remained constant. These effects suggest that co-tuned ensembles in AC interact and rapidly rebalance their activity to maintain encoding network dynamics, and that the rebalanced network is persistent."
"Major depressive disorder (MDD) affects 3.8% of the world population, representing a significant contribution to the global burden of disease (WHO). Around a quarter of people living with MDD demonstrate low-grade inflammation and substantial evidence links peripheral inflammation to anhedonia via disrupted cortico-thalamo-striatal circuitry. We examined clinical human neuroimaging in individuals with systemic inflammation (psoriatic disease), and employed a preclinical model of neuroinflammation, to study relationships between the neuroinflammatory response, neural circuitry and depression-like behaviours. Our preclinical model used a topical treatment of Aldara(R), which contains imiquimod (a TLR7/8 agonist) that also induces a psoriasis-like phenotype. Changes in functional connectivity between thalamus and ventral striatum correlated with depression in humans with psoriatic disease, and with anhedonia-like behaviours in Aldara-treated mice. Mice treated with Aldara exhibited reduced sucrose preference and impairments in intrinsic motivational behaviours relative to untreated controls. Within 4 to 6 hours of Aldara treatment, neurons in midline thalamus were activated substantially more than in control animals. Optogenetic activation of midline thalamic projections onto ventral striatum medium spiny neurons revealed that repeated Aldara treatment substantially reduced the magnitude of the evoked thalamic AMPA receptor-mediated post-synaptic currents. In the preclinical model, contributions from both resident and infiltrating immune cells drove neuroinflammation. Further dissection of these pathways revealed that NLRP3 inflammasome activation, infiltrating monocytes and infiltrating T cells all contributed to the neuroinflammatory effects of Aldara."
"Some Bacillales and Clostridiales bacteria form spores in unfavorable environments. These spores are dormant but can rapidly resume metabolism in response to certain small molecule nutrients. This process is termed germination and can be initiated by a variety of low molecular wt nutrients termed germinants. Structural modeling and mutagenesis studies showed that GerAB, an inner membrane (IM) protein of the Bacillus subtilis spore germinant receptor (GR) GerA, is involved in L-alanine-initiated spore germination. A previous molecular simulation study also suggested there is a water channel in GerAB. In the current work, Steered Molecular Dynamics (SMD) simulations were employed to force a single water molecule through GerAB, identifying three key amino acid residues, Y97, L199 and F342, that interfere with water passage. When these residues were altered to alanine, L-alanine germination was minimal in spores with L199A, F342A and triA (Y97A, L199A and F342A triple mutant), while Y97A mutant spores germinated ~61%. And besides Y97A, all other mutants showed compromised germination triggered by AGFK mixture. Western blotting found reduced levels of the GerA GR in the Y97A mutant, and an absence of the GerA GR in all other mutants. This proved that all three identified residues are crucial to the structural integrity of the GerAB protein and therefore probably the formation of the GR complex, the germinosome."
"Sequence variation within TF binding sites can significantly affect TF-DNA interactions, influencing gene expression and contributing to disease susceptibility or phenotypic traits. Despite recent progress in deep sequence-to-function models that predict functional output from sequence data, these methods perform inadequately on some variant effect prediction tasks, especially with common genetic variants. This limitation underscores the importance of leveraging biophysical models of TF binding to enhance interpretability of variant effect scores and facilitate mechanistic insights.

We introduce motifDiff, a novel computational tool designed to quantify variant effects using mono and dinucleotide position weight matrices. motifDiff offers several key advantages, including scalability to score millions of variants within minutes, implementation of statistically rigorous normalization strategy critical for optimal performance, and support for both dinucleotide and mononucleotide models. We demonstrate motifDiff  s efficacy by evaluating it across diverse ground truth datasets that quantify the effects of common variants in vivo, thereby establishing robust benchmarks for the predictive value of variant effect calculations. Finally, we show that our tool provides unique insights when interpreting human accelerated regions. motifDiff is available as a standalone Python application at https://github.com/rezwanhosseini/MotifDiff."
"The larval zebrafish is a vertebrate model for in vivo monitoring and manipulation of whole-brain neuronal activity. Tracing its neural circuits still remains challenging. Here we report an applicable methodology tailored for larval zebrafish to achieve efficient retrograde trans-monosynaptic tracing from genetically defined neurons via EnvA-pseudotyped glycoprotein-deleted rabies viruses. By combinatorially optimizing multiple factors involved, we identified the CVS strain trans-complemented with advanced expression of N2cG at 36{degrees}C as the optimal combination. It yielded a tracing efficiency of up to 20 inputs per starter cell. Its low cytotoxicity enabled the viable labeling and calcium imaging of infected neurons 10 days post-infection, spanning larval ages commonly used for functional examination. Cre-dependent labeling was further developed to enable input cell-type-specific tracing and circuit reconstruction. We mapped cerebellar circuits and uncovered the ipsilateral preference and subtype specificity of granule cell-to-Purkinje cell connections. Our method offers an efficient way for tracing neural circuits in larval zebrafish."
"BackgroundFrontiers of health science increasingly emphasizes systems and network medicine approaches for managing complex lifestyle diseases such as diabetes. In this context, systemic targets like incretin hormones and their modulators - particularly DPP4 inhibitors - have gained prominence. Ayurveda, the Indian System of Medicine (ISM), with its clinically validated multicomponent formulations offers a valuable resource for integrative therapeutic strategies with systemic mode of action.

PurposeThe study investigates the incretin modulatory effect of Varanadi Kashayam (VA), an Ayurveda polyherbal formulation used in the clinical management of diabetes and its comorbidities.

Experimental approachA high-fat diet induced Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat model was used to study the anti-diabetic, GLP-1 secretory, and anti-obesity effects of VA. In vitro studies using GLUTag cells assessed the GLP-1 secretion and DPP4 gene expression modulation; and studies using 3T3-L1 fibroblasts examined the anti-adipogenic effects. Computational methods including molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulations were used to identify the phytochemicals responsible for DPP4 inhibition.

ResultsVA administration significantly improved fasting blood glucose and oral glucose tolerance in experimental animals, along with enhanced GLP-1 secretion. The in vitro results showed inhibition of DPP4 enzyme activity, increase in GLP-1 secretion and downregulation of DPP4 gene expression in GLUTag cells, and suppression of adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 fibroblast cells. Computational analyses ascertained Chebulinic acid, Chebulagic acid and Terchebin as top ranked phytochemicals responsible for DPP4 inhibition effect.

ConclusionCombining in vitro, in vivo and in silico findings, this study provides valuable insight into the incretin modulatory effect of VA in treating diabetes and associated metabolic diseases.

"Body energy homeostasis is tightly regulated by hypothalamic neural circuits. However, their remodeling upon metabolic challenges remains incompletely characterized, thus complicating the development of safe medications against the surge of metabolic diseases. Oxytocin (OXT) neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH) are one of the key effectors regulating energy balance. In this work, we report that high-fat diet (HFD) feeding in mice evokes spatiotemporally selective ATP release from astrocytes (Inflares) in the PVH, accompanied by the expression of hematopoietic lineage-specific ADP/ATP receptor P2Y12 on local OXT (PVHOXT) neurons. Strikingly, increased purinergic signaling leads to impaired responsiveness of PVHOXT neurons accompanied by hyperphagic obesity and insulin resistance in mice. Conversely, loss of P2Y12 in PVHOXT neurons attenuates metabolic phenotypes, illustrating that such remodeling is both necessary and sufficient to induce metabolic phenotypes. Inflares were also induced by hyperglycemia, while emergence of P2Y12 on OXT neurons of patients with diabetes mellitus suggests an evolutionary conserved purinergic response to various metabolic challenges and its potential as a drug target. Accordingly, nasal administration of clinically approved doses of P2Y12 inhibitors counteracts obesity in mice and non-human primates, paving the way for application of these compounds in patients with metabolic disorders."
"The recently launched Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC v2.0 (EPICv2), successor of MethylationEPIC v1.0 (EPICv1), retains a majority of probes in EPICv1, while expanding coverage of regulatory elements. The concordance between the two EPIC versions in DNA methylation-based tools has not yet been investigated. To address this, DNA methylation was profiled on both versions using matched blood samples across four cohorts spanning early to late adulthood. High concordance between versions at the array level but variable agreement at the individual probe level was noted. A significant contribution of EPIC version to DNA methylation variation was observed, though it was to a smaller extent compared to sample relatedness and cell type composition. Modest but significant differences in DNA methylation-based estimates between versions were observed, irrespective of the data preprocessing method used. Adjustments for EPIC version or calculation of estimates separately for each version largely mitigated these version-specific discordances. This work emphasizes the importance of accounting for EPIC version differences in research scenarios, especially in meta-analyses and longitudinal studies that require data harmonization across versions.

Summary blurbOur work illustrates the importance of accounting for EPIC version in DNA methylation-based tools, specifically in research scenarios when samples profiled across different versions are harmonized."
"Resistance to starvation is a classic complex trait where genetic and environmental variables can greatly modify an animals ability to survive without nutrients. Genetic analyses in Drosophila have shown that starvation resistance is highly polygenic with different genetic architectures in different mapping populations. In this study we sought to dissect the genetic basis of starvation resistance among a set of mitonuclear genotypes carrying different mtDNAs paired with specific nuclear genomes from the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP). We focused on differences between one of the most sensitive strains (DGRP-765) and a strain with more moderate resistance (DGRP-315) whose starvation phenotypes appeared to be modified by alternative mtDNAs. Using complementary pooled-sequencing and forward genetic mapping approaches, we identified regions of chromosomes 2L, 3L and 3R contributing to starvation sensitivity and localize a major effect locus modifying starvation resistance to the coding region of phospholipase iPLA2-VIA. These analyses further confirm that the alternative mtDNAs had little influence on variation in starvation resistance between the genotypes studied. The sensitive line shows a starvation-dependent depletion of glucose and glycogen that is modified by hemi- and heterozygosity in the iPLA2-VIA region. These findings contribute to our understanding of the complex genetic relationship between resistance to starvation stress and nutrient metabolism."
"""Einstein from noise"" (EfN) is a prominent example of the model bias phenomenon: systematic errors in the statistical model that lead to spurious but consistent estimates. In the EfN experiment, one falsely believes that a set of observations contains noisy, shifted copies of a template signal (e.g., an Einstein image), whereas in reality, it contains only pure noise observations. To estimate the signal, the observations are first aligned with the template using cross-correlation and then averaged. Although the observations contain nothing but noise, it was recognized early on that this process produces a signal that resembles the template signal! This pitfall was at the heart of a central scientific controversy about validation techniques in structural biology.

This paper provides a comprehensive statistical analysis of the EfN phenomenon above. We show that the Fourier phases of the EfN estimator (namely, the average of the aligned noise observations) converge to the Fourier phases of the template signal, thereby explaining the observed structural similarity. Additionally, we prove that the convergence rate is inversely proportional to the number of noise observations and, in the high-dimensional regime, to the Fourier magnitudes of the template signal. More-over, in the high-dimensional regime, the EfN estimator converges to a scaled version of the template signal. This work not only deepens the theoretical understanding of the EfN phenomenon but also highlights potential pitfalls in template matching techniques and emphasizes the need for careful interpretation of noisy observations across disciplines in engineering, statistics, physics, and biology."
"Different actin nucleation promoting factors (NPFs) orchestrate different patterns of cell protrusions, likely reflecting their distinct patterns of self-organization. Here we leveraged in vivo biochemical approaches to investigate how the WAVE complex instructs the formation of sheet-like lamellipodia. We show that the WAVE complex is a core constituent of a linear multilayered protein array at the plasma membrane, expected for an NPF that builds sheet-like actin-based protrusions. Negative membrane curvature is both necessary and sufficient for WAVE complex linear membrane association in the presence of upstream activators (Rac, Arf1/6, PIP3) and the PRD domains of both WAVE2 and Abi2, providing a potential mechanistic basis for templating of lamellipodia and their emergent behaviors, including barrier avoidance. Through computational modeling, we demonstrate that WAVE complexs linear organization and preference for negative curvature both play important roles in robust lamellipodia formation. Our data reveal key features of mesoscale WAVE complex patterning and highlight an integral relation between NPF self-organization and cell morphogenesis."

"Cells must adopt flexible regulatory strategies to make decisions regarding their fate, including differentiation, apoptosis, or survival in the face of various external stimuli. One key cellular strategy that enables these functions is stochastic gene expression programs. However, understanding how transcriptional bursting, and consequently, cell fate, responds to DNA damage on a genome-wide scale poses a challenge. In this study, we propose an interpretable and scalable inference framework, DeepTX, that leverages deep learning methods to connect mechanistic models and scRNA-seq data, thereby revealing genome-wide transcriptional burst kinetics. This framework enables rapid and accurate solutions to transcription models and the inference of transcriptional burst kinetics from scRNA-seq data. Applying this framework to several scRNA-seq datasets of DNA-damaging drug treatments, we observed that fluctuations in transcriptional bursting induced by different drugs could lead to distinct fate decisions: IdU treatment induces differentiation in mouse embryonic stem cells by increasing the burst size of gene expression, while 5FU treatment with low and high dose increases the burst frequency of gene expression to induce cell apoptosis and survival in human colon cancer cells. Together, these results show that DeepTX can be used to analyze single-cell transcriptomics data and can provide mechanistic insights into cell fate decisions."
"Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) have shown promise for prevention and treatment of HIV. Potency and breadth measured in vitro are often used as predictors of clinical potential; however, human studies demonstrate that clinical efficacy of bNAbs is undermined by both pre-existing and de novo resistance. Here we find that HIV-infected humanized mice receiving bNAbs delivered via AAV as Vectored ImmunoTherapy (VIT) can be used to identify antibody escape paths, which are largely conserved. Path selection, and consequent therapeutic success, is driven by the fitness cost and resistance benefit of emerging mutations. Applying this framework, we independently modulated bNAb resistance or the fitness cost of escape mutants, resulting in enhanced efficacy of VIT. This in vivo escape path analysis successfully explains the therapeutic efficacy of bNAbs, whereas potency and breadth failed to do so, illustrating a tractable means of minimizing viral escape from bNAbs.

"Cells, tissues, and organs must change shape in precise ways during embryonic development to execute their functions. Multiple mechanisms including biochemical signaling pathways and biophysical forces help drive these morphology changes, but it has been difficult to tease apart their contributions, especially from tissue-scale dynamic forces that are typically ignored. We use a combination of mathematical models and in vivo experiments to study a simple organ in the zebrafish embryo called Kupffers vesicle. Modeling indicates that dynamic forces generated by tissue movements in the embryo produce shape changes in Kupffers vesicle that are observed during development. Laser ablations in the zebrafish embryo that alter these forces result in altered organ shapes matching model predictions. These results demonstrate that dynamic forces sculpt cell and organ shape during embryo development.

Significance StatementWe aim to understand the mechanisms that control precise cell and tissue shape changes required for organ function. Many studies focused on cell shapes have ignored the role of dynamic forces self-generated by slow tissue flows, but recent work showing tissues are near a jamming transition with diverging relaxation timescales suggests slow motion could give rise to large forces. Through a combination of mathematical modeling, imaging, and mechanical perturbations to in vivo experiments, our work demonstrates that tissue-scale dynamic forces are sculpting the shape of an epithelial organ in the zebrafish embryo called Kupffers vesicle (KV). Because there are many processes during development that occur at similarly slow rates, this suggests that self-generated dynamic forces should be investigated more broadly."
"The red palm weevil (Rhynchophorus ferrugineus; RPW) is an important pest threatening date palm cultivation worldwide. Conventional insecticide-based management is limited by environmental concerns and the development of resistance in RPW populations. Entomopathogenic fungi (EPF), such as Beauveria bassiana, offer a promising biocontrol alternative. While laboratory and semifield studies have demonstrated their potential as insecticides, evidence from field-scale applications under diverse environmental conditions remains scarce. This study evaluated the seasonal efficacy and persistence of B. bassiana as a preventive treatment against RPW in male and female date palm groves subjected to different cultivation practices in Israels Arava region. Healthy palms were equipped with IoTree sensors to monitor RPW infestation dynamics. EPF treatments were applied at the start of each season, and control trees were left untreated. Soil samples were collected seasonally to quantify fungal colony-forming units (CFUs) and assess their association with treatment outcomes. Results demonstrated a significant seasonal influence on EPF efficacy, with autumn treatments yielding the highest reduction in infestation rates, and summer applications showing limited effectiveness. Efficacy also varied between grove types: spring applications were most effective in male groves, whereas autumn treatments were superior in female groves. A positive correlation was found between B. bassiana CFUs in the soil and palm health, indicating that EPF persistence enhances treatment success. These findings highlight the importance of seasonal and site-specific optimization of EPF-based biocontrol strategies. Further research is needed to refine application schedules and validate outcomes across larger-scale trials."
"Assembly of branched actin networks, driven by the Arp2/3 complex are essential for the function and integrity of the immune system. Patients with loss-of-function mutations in the ARPC5 subunit of the Arp2/3 complex develop inflammation and immunodeficiency after birth, leading to early mortality. However, the mechanistic basis for these phenotypes remains obscure. Here we demonstrate that loss of Arpc5 in the murine hematopoietic system, but not the corresponding Arpc5l isoform causes early-onset intestinal inflammation after weaning. This condition is initiated by microbiota breaching the ileal mucosa, leading to local and systemic inflammation. Macrophage and neutrophils infiltrate into the ileum, but in the absence of Arpc5 fail to restrict microbial invasion. Loss of Arpc5 compromises the ability of macrophages to phagocytose and kill intra-cellular bacteria. Our results underscore the indispensable role of Arpc5, but not Arpc5l containing Arp2/3 complexes in mononuclear phagocytes function and host-microbiota homeostasis.

One-Sentence SummaryArpc5 containing Arp2/3 complexes are essential for host-microbiota homeostasis"
"Relating dendritic spine morphology to synaptic organization in brain tissue is essential for understanding excitatory synaptic transmission and plasticity. Single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) offers the spatial precision needed to study the synaptic protein distribution at the nanoscale. However, the widefield setup required for SMLM produces diffraction-limited images with poor contrast and resolution in thick brain slices (> 30 m), making accurate segmentation of dendritic spines challenging. To overcome this challenge, we developed an automated 3D segmentation approach tailored to this condition by combining two existing machine-learning models. We integrated this strategy with SMLM-based localization of synaptic proteins to map post-synaptic protein PSD-95 within spines at nanoscale resolution. This framework, named ISEPLA (Integrated Spine Extraction and Protein Localization Analysis), revealed a hierarchical organization of synaptic proteins: spines contain multiple nanomodules, each composed of smaller nanodomains. Larger spines contain more nanomodules, and larger nanomodules comprise more nanodomains. Therefore, our method enables precise morphological and molecular analysis under physiologically relevant imaging conditions, providing new insights into the synaptic organization in spines."
"The transition from prebiotic chemistry to living systems requires the emergence of a scheme for enzyme-free genetic replication. Here, we analyze a recently proposed prebiotic replication scenario, the so-called Virtual Circular Genome (VCG) [Zhou et al., RNA 27, 1-11 (2021)]: Replication takes place in a pool of oligomers, where each oligomer contains a subsequence of a circular genome, such that the oligomers encode the full genome collectively. While the sequence of the circular genome may be reconstructed based on long oligomers, monomers and short oligomers merely act as replication feedstock. We observe a competition between the predominantly error-free ligation of a feedstock molecule to a long oligomer and the predominantly erroneous ligation of two long oligomers. Increasing the length of long oligomers and reducing their concentration decreases the fraction of erroneous ligations, enabling high-fidelity replication in the VCG. Alternatively, the formation of erroneous products can be suppressed if each ligation involves at least one monomer, while ligations between two long oligomers are effectively prevented. This kinetic discrimination (favoring monomer incorporation over oligomer-oligomer ligation) may be an intrinsic property of the activation chemistry, or can be externally imposed by selectively activating only monomers in the pool. Surprisingly, under these conditions, shorter oligomers are extended by monomers more quickly than long oligomers, a phenomenon which has already been observed experimentally [Ding et al., JACS 145, 7504-7515 (2023)]. Our work provides a theoretical explanation for this behavior, and predicts its dependence on system parameters such as the concentration of long oligomers. Taken together, the VCG constitutes a promising scenario of prebiotic information replication: It could mitigate challenges of in non-enzymatic copying via template-directed polymerization, such as short lengths of copied products and high error rates."
"The RNA genome of measles virus is encapsidated by the nucleoprotein within a helical nucleocapsid that serves as template for both transcription and replication. The intrinsically disordered domain of the nucleoprotein (NTAIL), partly protruding outward from the nucleocapsid, is essential for binding the polymerase complex responsible for viral transcription and replication. As for many IDPs, binding of NTAIL occurs through a short molecular recognition element (MoRE) that folds upon binding, with the majority of NTAIL remaining disordered. Though NTAIL regions far from the MoRE influence the binding affinity, interactions between them and the MoRE have not been investigated in depth. Using an integrated approach, relying on photo-induced electron transfer (PET) experiments between tryptophan and cysteine pairs placed at different positions in the protein under varying salt and pH conditions, combined with simulations and analytical models, we identified transient interactions between two disordered regions distant in sequence, which dominate NTAIL dynamics, and regulate the conformational preferences of both the MoRE and the entire NTAIL domain. Co-evolutionary analysis corroborates our findings and suggests an important functional role for the same intramolecular interactions. We propose mechanisms by which these non-local interactions may regulate binding to the measles phosphoprotein, polymerase recruitment, and ultimately viral transcription and replication. Our findings may be extended to other IDPs, where non-local intra-protein interactions affect the conformational preferences of intermolecular binding sites."
"Proteasome activator 28{gamma} (PA28{gamma}) plays a critical role in malignant progression of various tumors, however, its role and regulation are not well understood. Here, using oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) as main research model, we discovered that PA28{gamma} interacted with complement 1q binding protein (C1QBP), which is dependent on the N-terminus of C1QBP rather than the known functional domain (amino acids 168-213). Notably, we found that PA28{gamma} enhances C1QBP protein stability in OSCC. Functionally, PA28{gamma} contributes to the malignant progression of OSCC by affecting mitochondrial morphology and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) through C1QBP in vitro and vivo. Mechanically, PA28{gamma} upregulates the expression of optic atrophy 1 (OPA1), mitofusin 1 (MFN1), mitofusin 2 (MFN2), and the mitochondrial respiratory complex via C1QBP. Moreover, in a clinical cohort of OSCC patients, PA28{gamma} was positively correlated with C1QBP expression and negatively correlated with prognosis. Therefore, C1QBP represents a potential therapeutic target for cancer treatment and prognosis."
"Solute carriers (SLC) are membrane proteins that facilitate the transportation of ions and metabolites across either the plasma membrane or the membrane of intracellular organelles. With more than 450 human genes annotated as SLCs, many of them are still orphan transporters without known biochemical functions. We developed a metabolomic-transcriptomic association analysis, and we found that the expression of SLC45A4 has a strong positive correlation with the cellular level of {gamma}-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Using mass spectrometry and the stable isotope tracing approach, we demonstrated that SLC45A4 promotes GABA de novo synthesis through the Arginine/Ornithine/Putrescine (AOP) pathway. SLC45A4 functions as a putrescine transporter localized to the peroxisome membrane to facilitate GABA production. Taken together, our results revealed a new biochemical mechanism where SLC45A4 controls GABA production."
"Studies with low statistical power reduce the probability of detecting true effects and often lead to overestimated effect sizes, undermining the reproducibility of scientific results. While several free statistical software tools are available for calculating statistical power, they often do not account for the specialized aspects of experimental designs in behavioral studies that evaluate success rates. To address this gap, we developed ""SuccessRatePower"" a free and user-friendly power calculator based on Monte Carlo simulations that takes into account the particular parameters of these experimental designs. Using ""SuccessRatePower"", we demonstrated that statistical power can be increased by modifying the experimental protocol in three ways:

1) reducing the probability of succeeding by chance (chance level), 2) increasing the number of trials used to calculate subject success rates, and in some circumstance, 3) employing statistical analyses suited for discrete values. These adjustments enable even studies with small sample sizes to achieve high statistical power. Finally, we performed an associative behavioral task in mice, confirming the simulated statistical advantages of reducing chance levels and increasing the number of trials in such studies"
"Exponential increases in microbial and viral genomic data demand transformational advances in scalable, generalizable frameworks for their interpretation. Standard homology-based functional analyses are hindered by the rapid divergence of microbial and especially viral genomes and proteins that significantly decreases the volume of usable data. Here, we present Protein Set Transformer (PST), a protein-based genome language model that models genomes as sets of proteins without considering sparsely available functional labels. Trained on >100k viruses, PST outperformed other homology- and language model-based approaches for relating viral genomes based on shared protein content. Further, PST demonstrated protein structural and functional awareness by clustering capsid-fold-containing proteins with known capsid proteins and uniquely clustering late gene proteins within related viruses. Our data establish PST as a valuable method for diverse viral genomics, ecology, and evolutionary applications. We posit that the PST framework can be a foundation model for microbial genomics when trained on suitable data."
"Enzymes are broadly used as biocatalysts in industry and medicine due to their coverage of vast areas of chemical space, their exquisite selectivity and efficiency as well as the mild reaction conditions at which they operate. Custom designed enzymes can produce tailor-made biocatalysts with potential applications extending beyond natural reactions. However, current design methods require testing of high numbers of designs and mostly produce de novo enzymes with low catalytic activities. As a result, they require costly experimental optimization and high-throughput screening to be industrially viable. Here we present rotamer inverted fragment finder-diffusion (Riff-Diff), a hybrid machine learning and atomistic modelling strategy for scaffolding catalytic arrays in de novo proteins. We highlight the general applicability of Riff-Diff by designing enzymes for two mechanistically distinct chemical transformations, the retro-aldol reaction and the Morita-Baylis-Hillman reaction. We show that in both cases it is possible to generate catalysts exhibiting activities rivalling those optimized by in-vitro evolution, along with exquisite stereoselectivity. High resolution structures of six of the designs revealed an angstrom level of active site design precision. The design strategy can, in principle, be applied to any catalytically competent amino acid constellation. These findings enable the practical applicability of de novo protein catalysts in synthesis and shed light on fundamental principles of protein design and enzyme catalysis."
"Middle age represents a critical period of accelerated brain changes and provides a window for early detection and intervention in age-related neurological decline. Hearing loss is a key early marker of such decline and is linked to numerous comorbidities in older adults. Yet, [~]10% of middle-aged individuals who report hearing difficulties show normal audiograms. Cochlear neural degeneration (CND) could contribute to these hidden hearing deficits, though its role remains unclear due to a lack of objective diagnostics and uncertainty regarding its perceptual outcomes. Here, we employed a cross-species design to examine neural and behavioral signatures of CND. We measured envelope following responses (EFRs) - neural ensemble responses to sound originating from the peripheral auditory pathway - in young and middle-aged adults with normal audiograms and compared these responses to young and middle-aged Mongolian gerbils, where CND was histologically confirmed. We observed near identical changes in EFRs across species that were associated with CND. Behavioral assessments revealed agerelated speech-in-noise deficits under challenging conditions, while pupil-indexed listening effort increased with age even when behavioral performance was matched. Together, these results demonstrate that CND contributes to speech perception difficulties and elevated listening effort in midlife, which may ultimately lead to listening fatigue and social withdrawal."
"Modular organization, the division of the cerebral cortex into functionally distinct subregions, is well established in the primate sensorimotor cortex, but debated in the cognitive association cortex, including the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Here, we obtained microelectrode recordings with broad spatial coverage from the lateral PFC of two rhesus monkeys performing a working memory task with distractors. We found that neighboring electrodes shared task-related oscillatory neural dynamics that were stable across recording sessions and formed spatially continuous, mesoscale clusters that also segregated by local and long-range frontoparietal connectivity, spiking activity, involvement in working memory processing stages and influence on behavioral accuracy. Remarkably, the degree of parcellation reflected the animals individual mnemonic abilities and strategies. Our findings support functional organization of the PFC by cognitive control operations rather than by the type of processed information, indicating that modularity may be a fundamental architectural principle across the primate cortex."
"Sensory stimulation of the brain reverberates in its recurrent neural networks. However, current computational models of brain activity do not separate immediate sensory responses from this intrinsic dynamic. We apply a vector-autoregressive model with external input (VARX), combining the concepts of ""functional connectivity"" and ""encoding models"", to intracranial recordings in humans. This model captures the extrinsic effect of the stimulus and separates that from the intrinsic effect of the recurrent brain dynamic. We find that the intrinsic dynamic enhances and prolongs the neural responses to scene cuts, eye movements, and sounds.

Failing to account for these extrinsic inputs, leads to spurious recurrent connections that govern the intrinsic dynamic. We also find that the recurrent connectivity during rest is reduced during movie watching. The model shows that an external stimulus can reduce intrinsic noise. It also shows that sensory areas have mostly outward, whereas higher-order brain areas mostly incoming connections. We conclude that the response to an external audiovisual stimulus can largely be attributed to the intrinsic dynamic of the brain, already observed during rest."
"Two key factors have been implicated as major impediments to phylogenomic inference: incomplete lineage sorting (ILS)--especially in cases where clades are in the so-called anomaly zone--and erroneous gene tree estimation--commonly manifested by long- branch attraction in the Felsenstein zone. Rafflesiaceae (Malpighiales) is an iconic parasitic plant clade whose species occur west of Wallaces line in tropical Southeast Asia. This clade has been notoriously difficult to place phylogenetically and is nested within an explosive ancient radiation, rendering the Malpighiales one of the thorniest nodes across the angiosperm Tree of Life. The parasitic family Apodanthaceae has recently been positioned as sister to Rafflesiaceae, offering the hope to stabilize their placements. Here, using a dataset of 2,135 genes and complex species tree inference methods, the monophyletic Rafflesiaceae+Apodanthaceae clade is variously placed with Euphorbiaceae, Peraceae, Putranjivaceae, and Pandaceae. Such unstable placements appear to be the result of excessive levels of rate heterogeneity and ILS, which contribute to a phylogenetic ""danger zone"" where simulation suggests that current methods and genomic data will never provide a tidy phylogenetic resolution for species trees alike. Despite the topological uncertainty, however, our divergence time estimation identifies a mid-Cretaceous origin of stem group Rafflesiaceae and Apodanthaceae, not only making them the oldest parasitic plant lineage reported to date, but also suggests a likely Gondwana vicariance scenario to explain their disjunct distribution in South America, Africa, Australia, and Northern India."
"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) within the extracellular matrix (ECM) are often studied as passive elements whose diffusion and behaviour are subject to the composition and structure of the ECM. While EV diffusion and distribution in tissues are indeed governed by matrix interactions, accumulating evidence suggests that EVs contain much of the cellular machinery required for actively remodeling ECM. Using rheology and confocal reflectance microscopy, we investigate the gelation of collagen I hydrogels formed in the presence of EVs, and show that EVs can play an active role in ECM formation. EVs appear to nucleate new fibrils, recruiting collagen molecules from solution and accelerating their polymerization. Trypsinization of EVs shows that collagen-EV interactions are primarily mediated by surface proteins. The use of extruded plasma membrane vesicles shows that membrane composition determines final fibril length and matrix structure. EVs also become integrated into the fibril structures that they help form, reminiscent of matrix vesicles found in situ within tissues. This represents a plausible way by which EVs are deposited into the ECM, becoming signaling cues for resident cells. Our data show that EV-matrix interactions are dynamic and can contribute to the remodeling of tissue microenvironments.

SignificanceExtracellular vesicles (EVs) are nanoscale membrane structures known for their role in facilitating cellto-cell trafficking of proteins, lipids, RNA, and other signaling molecules. In this report, we show that EVs derived from breast cancer cells are not merely passive messengers, but also direct active effectors of extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling processes. Bulk rheology and confocal microscopy show that these EVs have the ability to nucleate new collagen fibrils and accelerate the formation of dense fibrillar collagenous networks. This has important implications in cancer pathology, where matrix density is often associated with worse disease outcomes, but could also potentially be exploitable in future tissue engineering applications."
"Male fertility in plants is often controlled by the interaction between mitochondrial and nuclear genes. Some mitotypes confer cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS), making the individual male-sterile, unless the nuclear background contains alleles called restorers, that suppress the effects of CMS and restore the hermaphroditic phenotype. Restorers in cultivated crops are often alleles with strong and dominant effect, but in wild plants, data often suggest more complex systems. Here, we characterized the inheritance and specificity of restoration in a new CMS model, the freshwater snail Physa acuta. We explored two different populations (i) a naive population i.e., without contact with CMS in the past 80 generations, (ii) a non-naive population, where CMS is present and largely restored. Although we found male fertility of individuals with CMS mitogenomes to be heritable in both contexts, this genetic determinism was of a different nature depending on population history. In naive populations not coevolved with CMS the background variation may include alleles that happen to act as weak quantitative modifiers of the penetrance of CMS, while in populations coevolved with CMS, selection may have favored, when such variants were available, the emergence of strong alleles with a dominant effect."
"Tomato yellow leaf curl disease (TYLCD) was reported in western Mediterranean basin since the late 1980s. Based on intensive plant samplings performed in Spain, Italy and Morocco at different periods between the 1990s and 2014, several begomoviruses (family Geminiviridae) were identified as the cause of TYLCD. They comprise the native Begomovirus solanumflavusardiniaense (Tomato yellow leaf curl Sardinia virus, TYLCSAV), two strains of Begomovirus coheni (Tomato yellow leaf curl virus, TYLCV) introduced from the Middle East, and several types of TYLCV/TYLCSaV recombinants including the invasive recombinant TYLCV-IS76 in which the genome fragment inherited from TYLCSaV was unusually short. Although parental and recombinant TYLCD-associated begomoviruses were present in each country, country specificities were detected with respect to their relative prevalence, the infection profiles of individual tomato plants, and the recombination patterns of TYLCV/TYLCSaV recombinants. Considering geographic proximities and trade activities between these countries, and the efficient transmission of begomoviruses which are persistently transmitted by the polyphagous and tiny whitefly vector Bemisia tabaci, it was not known if these specificities would be maintained over time. To address this question, 105 tomato samples collected in the three countries between 2015 and 2019 were analysed with PCR tests previously designed to distinguish species, strains and recombinants of TYLCD associated begomoviruses, and with an original PCR test distinguishing emerging resistance-breaking recombinants bearing short TYLCSaV-inherited fragments like TYLCV-IS76 (Srec) from formerly reported recombinants with longer TYLCSaV fragments (Lrec). The results show that country specificities are still present, the most striking being the contrasted geographic distribution of Srec recombinants, with TYLCV-IS76 detected in Morocco but not in Italy, and TYLCV-IS141 and a new Srec recombinant (TYLCV-IMS60-2400) both detected in Italy and not in Morocco. Nevertheless, besides country specificities, a general population shift was revealed regarding TYLCV/TYLCSaV recombinants. Indeed, all the recombinant positive samples, irrespective of their geographic origin, were Srec-positive but Lrec-negative, which suggest that the emergence of Srec recombinants occurred at the expenses of the Lrec recombinants. These results are discussed in relation to the positive selection of Srec recombinants by Ty-1 resistant tomato plants."
"Infectious diseases have affected humanity for millennia and are among the strongest selective forces. Tuberculosis (TB) is an ancient disease, caused by the human-adapted members of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC). The outcome of TB infection and disease is highly variable, and co-evolution between human populations and MTBC strains may account for some of this variability. Particular human genetic ancestries have been associated with higher susceptibility to TB, but socio-demographic aspects of the disease can confound such associations. Here, we studied 1,000 TB patients from Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, together with their respective MTBC isolates, by combining human and bacterial genomics with clinical data. We found that the genetic background of the TB patient population was strongly influenced by migrationsof Bantu-speaking populations from West Africa, which is in contrast to the corresponding MTBC genotypes that were mainly introduced from outside Africa. These findings suggest a recent evolutionary history of co-existence between the human and MTBC populations in Dar es Salaam. We detected no evidence of an effect of human genetic ancestry, or MTBC phylogenetic diversity alone, nor their interaction, on TB disease severity. There was also no evidence of an association between human variation genome-wide and TB disease severity.Treatment-seeking, social and environmental factors are likely to be the main determinants of disease severity at the point of care in this patient population.

Author SummaryTuberculosis (TB) is an ancient infectious disease that continues to challenge global health efforts. Here, we explored the interplay between human and bacterial genetics on TB in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. We found that neither the genetic ancestry of the patient, nor the bacterial genotype alone, nor their interaction, influenced the severity of TB. Our finding indicate that in this patient population, social and environmental factors may be the main determinants of TB disease severity."
"Early detection of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) is crucial for timely interventions. This study combines scalp recordings of lateralized auditory, visual, and somatosensory stimuli with a flexible and interpretable support vector machine learning pipeline to differentiate individuals diagnosed with aMCI from healthy controls. Event-related potentials (ERPs) and functional connectivity (FC) matrices from each modality successfully predicted aMCI. Reduced ERP amplitude in aMCI contributed to classification. The analysis of FC using phase-locking value revealed higher FC in aMCI than controls in frontal regions, which predicted worse cognitive performance, and lower FC in posterior regions from delta to alpha frequency. We observe optimal classification accuracy (96.1%), sensitivity (97.7%) and specificity (94.3%) when combining information from all sensory conditions than when using information from a single modality. The results highlight the clinical potential of sensory-evoked potentials in detecting aMCI, with optimal classification using both amplitude and oscillatory-based FC measures from multiple modalities."
"Expansion of a disease-specific tandem repeat is responsible for >45 Repeat Expansion Diseases (REDs). The expansion mutation in each of these diseases has different pathological consequences and most are currently incurable. If the underlying mechanism of mutation is shared, a strategy that slows repeat expansion in one RED may be applicable to multiple REDs. However, the fact that PMS2, a component of the MutL mismatch repair complex, promotes expansion in some models and protects against it in others, suggests that the expansion mechanisms may differ. We show here using mouse models of two REDs caused by different repeats that the seemingly paradoxical effects of PMS2 do not reflect different expansion mechanisms but rather cell-type and dosage effects in different tissues. This differential effect is recapitulated in mouse embryonic stem cells with inducible PMS2 expression: PMS2 promotes expansion at low concentrations, an effect that requires a functional nuclease domain; while at higher concentrations it protects against expansion. The apparent paradoxical behavior of PMS2 can be resolved in a model based on the different in vitro cleavage preferences of MutL and MutL{gamma}, another MutL complex known to be required for expansion. Our data thus resolve a longstanding puzzle and suggest a common mechanism responsible for REDs. Our data also provide proof of concept that increasing PMS2 levels suppresses repeat expansion not only in cells where its loss promotes expansion, but also in cells that require it for expansion, supporting its potential as a broadly applicable therapeutic strategy.

Significance statementCollectively the Repeat Expansion Diseases (REDs) represent a significant health burden. Since the consequences of the expansion mutation differ across diseases, therapeutic approaches that block the underlying mutation are appealing, particularly if the mechanism is shared. However, the conflicting effects of PMS2 loss in different REDs models challenges this idea. Here we show using two different REDs models that these disparate effects can be reconciled into a single model of repeat expansion, thus increasing confidence that the REDs do all share a common mutational mechanism. Importantly, we show that elevating PMS2 levels suppresses repeat expansion in multiple cellular contexts, including those in which PMS2 is normally required for expansion, demonstrating its potential as a broadly applicable therapeutic strategy for REDs."
"BackgroundThe outer mitochondrial Rho GTPase 1, MIRO1, mediates mitochondrial motility within cells, but implications for vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) physiology and its roles in vascular diseases, such as neointima formation following vascular injury are widely unknown.

MethodsCarotid ligation was performed in an in vivo model of selective Miro1 deletion in smooth muscle cells. VSMC proliferation during the cell cycle and molecular mechanisms of smooth muscle cell proliferation were explored in cultured aortic VSMCs by imaging mitochondrial positioning and cristae structure and assessing the effects on ATP production, metabolic function and interactions with components of the electron transport chain (ETC). MIRO1 expression was analyzed in human coronary arteries, and its function was assessed via knockdown in human coronary artery VSMCs.

ResultsResults revealed strong MIRO1 expression in VSMCs within human atherosclerotic plaques. MIRO1 facilitated VSMC proliferation and neointima formation by regulating mitochondrial positioning and PDGF-stimulated ATP production and respiration, critical for cell-cycle progression at G1/S. Deletion of Miro1 disrupted mitochondrial cristae structure, diminished ETC complex I activity, and impaired super complex formation. Notably, restoring MIRO1 function with a mutant lacking EF hands, which are essential for mitochondrial mobility, only partially rescued these effects. MIRO1 knockdown in human coronary artery VSMCs confirmed its pivotal role in mitochondrial function and VSMC proliferation.

ConclusionsThis study highlights two key mechanisms by which MIRO1 regulates VSMC proliferation. First, it maintains ATP synthesis by preserving mitochondrial cristae integrity. Second, its Ca2+-dependent EF hands enable ATP-dependent mitochondrial positioning. By linking mitochondrial motility and energy production to VSMC physiology, these findings position MIRO1 as a critical regulator of vascular remodeling and a potential target for therapeutic interventions."
"Mice offer a wealth of opportunities for investigating brain circuits regulating multiple behaviors, largely due to their genetic tractability. Social behaviors are translationally relevant, considering both mice and humans are highly social mammals, and human social behavior disruptions are key symptoms of myriad neuropsychiatric disorders. Stresses related to social experiences are particularly influential in the severity and maintenance of neuropsychiatric disorders like anxiety disorders, and trauma and stressor-related disorders. Yet, induction and study of social stress in mice has disproportionately focused on males, influenced heavily by their inherent territorial nature. Conspecific-instigated stress (i.e., defeat), while ethologically relevant, is quite variable and predominantly specific to males, making rigorous and sex-inclusive studies challenging. In pursuit of a controllable, consistent, high throughput, and sex-inclusive method for social stress elicitation, we modified a paradigm to train male and female F1 129S1/SvlmJ x C57BL/6J mice to associate (via classical conditioning) same or different sex C57BL/6J conspecifics with a mild, aversive stimulus. While further paradigm optimization is required, social interaction testing 24 h after conditioning indicates males socially conditioned better to male conspecifics by exhibiting reduced social interaction, whereas females socially conditioned better to male conspecifics.

Serum corticosterone levels inversely corresponded to social avoidance after different sex, but not same sex, conditioning, suggesting corticosterone-mediated arousal influences cross sex interactions. These current outcomes reveal why past pursuits to develop same sex female social stress paradigms may have met with limited success. Future research should expand investigation of utilizing male mouse conspecifics to instigate social stress across sexes.

Significance StatementValidated paradigms to study social stress in female mice, and across sexes, are needed. We modified a published male mouse protocol by using classical conditioning to pair an aversive stressor with a conspecific. Our goal was to create a uniform, cross-sex, high-throughput social stress technique to advance future research. Though our modified paradigm requires future improvements, we did acquire evidence that both males and females socially conditioned in this way exhibit stronger associations when a male conspecific is used. Future research seeking to induce social stress in female mice may meet with more success using male, rather than female, conspecifics. This work, while not achieving our goal, provides useful information to advance future sex-inclusive social stress investigations. (117 words)"
"Achieving high binding strength and efficient delivery of molecular cargo to cells expressing biomarker targets is a significant challenge in drug delivery. Here, we investigated how altering the surface immobilization residue (i.e. anchor point) within a non-antibody binding scaffold called Anticalin can enhance particle adhesion to the immune checkpoint protein CTLA-4 on mammalian cells under shear stress. By introducing bio-orthogonal clickable amino acids into Anticalin at various positions and applying tension to the protein complex using single-molecule AFM force spectroscopy and bead-based adhesion assays, we elucidate the relationship between anchor point position and mechanostability of the Anticalin:(CTLA-4) complex. Multi-regression analysis of the physicochemical properties of the anchor points revealed that the distance from the anchor point on Anticalin to CTLA-4s center of mass was a major determinant of binding strength under shear flow. These results demonstrate how anchor point engineering can enhance particle adhesion and cellular delivery to CTLA-4 targets and provides a heuristic for choosing surface immobilization points of targeting proteins such that they withstand high mechanical forces."
"Macroautophagy, a major self-degradation pathway in eukaryotic cells, utilizes autophagosomes to transport self-material to lysosomes for degradation. While microtubular transport is crucial for the proper function of autophagy, the exact roles of factors responsible for positioning autophagosomes remain incompletely understood. In this study, we performed a loss-of-function genetic screen targeting genes potentially involved in microtubular motility. A genetic background that blocks autophagosome-lysosome fusions was used to accurately analyze autophagosome positioning. We discovered that pre-fusion autophagosomes move towards the non-centrosomal microtubule organizing center (ncMTOC) in Drosophila fat cells, which requires a dynein-dynactin complex. This process is regulated by the small GTPases Rab7 and Rab39 together with their adaptors: Epg5 and ema, respectively. The dynein-dependent movement of vesicles toward the nucleus/ncMTOC is essential for efficient autophagosomal fusions with lysosomes and subsequent degradation. Remarkably, altering the balance of kinesin and dynein motors changes the direction of autophagosome movement, indicating a competitive relationship where normally dynein-mediated transport prevails. Since pre-fusion lysosomes were positioned similarly to autophagosomes, it indicates that pre-fusion autophagosomes and lysosomes converge at the ncMTOC, which increases the efficiency of vesicle fusions."
"Behavioral plasticity in animals influences direct species interactions, but its effects can also spread unpredictably through ecological networks, creating indirect interactions that are difficult to anticipate. We use coarse-grained models to investigate how changes in species behavior shape these indirect interactions and influence the broader dynamics of ecological networks. As an illustrative example, we examine predators that feed on two types of prey, each of which temporarily reduces activity after evading an attack, thereby lowering vulnerability at the expense of growth. We demonstrate that this routine behavior can shift the indirect interaction between prey species from apparent competition to mutualism or parasitism. These shifts occur when predator capture efficiency drops below a critical threshold, causing frequent hunting failures. As a result, one prey species indirectly promotes the growth of the other by relaxing its density dependence through a cascade of network effects, paradoxically increasing predator biomass despite decreased hunting success. Empirical capture probabilities often fall within the range where such dynamics are predicted. We characterize these shifts in the qualitative nature of species interactions as changes in interaction valence, highlighting how routine animal behaviors reshape community structure through cascading changes within ecological networks."
"Humans naturally seek knowledge, yet integrating vast, fragmented information remains challenging. Traditionally, knowledge acquisition has relied on random walks within network--an unguided and inefficient process. We introduce compressive learning, a framework that embeds higher-order structural features--specifically node-degree inhomogeneity--into pre-learning trajectories to scaffold more efficient learning. Across two large-scale experiments, we demonstrate that scale-free networks--due to their pronounced node-degree inhomogeneity--are more compressible and learnable than other network types, and confirm the efficacy of the compressive learning approach. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings reveal that compressive pre-learning enhances structured neural representations in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). A hypergraph-based two-stage model further reveals that compressive learning constructs a network skeleton of hyperedge-defined substructures that more effectively accommodate new inputs. Together, our results highlight the central role of higher-order network structure in human learning and offer a strategic approach to effectively ""connect the dots."""
"Humans navigate the social world by rapidly perceiving social features from other people and their interaction. Recently, large-language models (LLMs) have achieved high-level visual capabilities for detailed object and scene content recognition and description. This raises the question whether LLMs can infer complex social information from images and videos, and whether the high-dimensional structure of the feature annotations aligns with that of humans. We collected evaluations for 138 social features from GPT-4V for images (N=468) and videos (N=234) that are derived from social movie scenes. These evaluations were compared with human evaluations (N=2254). The comparisons established that GPT-4V can achieve human-like capabilities at annotating individual social features. The GPT-4V social feature annotations also express similar structural representation compared to the human social perceptual structure (i.e., similar correlation matrix over all social feature annotations). Finally, we modeled hemodynamic responses (N=97) to viewing socioemotional movie clips with feature annotations by human observers and GPT-4V. These results demonstrated that GPT-4V based stimulus models can also reveal the social perceptual network in the human brain highly similar to the stimulus models based on human annotations. These human-like annotation capabilities of LLMs could have wide range of real-life applications ranging from health care to business and would open exciting new avenues for phycological and neuroscientific research."
"Natural environments typically contain a blend of simultaneous sounds. A significant challenge in neuroscience is identifying specific neural signals corresponding to each sound and analyzing them separately. Combining frequency-tagging and machine learning, we achieved high-precision separation of neural responses to mixed melodies, classifying them by selective attention towards specific melodies. Across two magnetoencephalography datasets, individual musicality and task performance heavily influenced the attentional recruitment of cortical regions, correlating positively with top-down attention in the left parietal cortex, but negatively with bottom-up attention in the right. In prefrontal areas, neural responses indicating higher sustained selective attention reflected better performance and musicality. These results suggest musical training enhances neural mechanisms in the frontoparietal regions, boosting performance via improving top-down attention, reducing bottom-up distractions, and maintaining selective attention over time. Importantly, this work establishes the effectiveness of combining frequency-tagging with machine learning to capture cognitive and behavioral effects with stimulus precision, applicable to other studies involving simultaneous stimuli."
"An animals behaviour is the result of multiple neural pathways acting in parallel, receiving information across and within sensory modalities at the same time. How these pathways are integrated, particularly when their individual outputs are in conflict, is key to understanding complex natural behaviours. We investigated this question in the visually guided flight of the hummingbird hawkmoth Macroglossum stellatarum. These insects were recently shown to partition their visual field, using ventrolateral optic-flow cues to guide their flight like most insects, while the same stimuli in the dorsal visual field evoke a novel directional response. Using behavioural experiments which set the two pathways into conflict, we tested whether and how the ventrolateral and dorsal pathway integrate to guide hawkmoth flight. Combined with environmental imaging we demonstrate that the partitioning of the visual field followed the prevalence of visual cues in the hawkmoths natural habitats, while the integration hierarchy of the two pathways matched the relevance of these cues for the animals flight safety, rather than their magnitude in the experimental setup or in natural habitats. These results provide new mechanistic insights into the vision-based flight control of insects, and link these to their natural context. We anticipate our findings to be the starting point for comparative investigations into parallel pathways for flight guidance in insects from differently structured natural habitats."
"Phage-encoded anti-CRISPR (Acr) proteins inhibit CRISPR-Cas systems to allow phage replication and lysogeny maintenance. Most of the Acrs characterized to date are stable stoichiometric inhibitors. While enzymatic Acrs have been characterized biochemically, little is known about their potency, specificity, and reversibility. Here, we examine AcrIF11, a widespread phage and plasmid-encoded ADP-ribosyltransferase (ART) that inhibits the Type I-F CRISPR-Cas system. We present an NMR structure of an AcrIF11 homolog that reveals chemical shift perturbations consistent with NAD (cofactor) binding. In experiments that model both lytic phage replication and MGE/lysogen stability under high targeting pressure, AcrIF11 is a highly potent CRISPR-Cas inhibitor and more robust to Cas protein level fluctuations than stoichiometric inhibitors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that AcrIF11 is remarkably specific, predominantly ADP-ribosylating Csy1 when expressed in P. aeruginosa. Given the reversible nature of ADP-ribosylation, we hypothesized that ADPr eraser enzymes (macrodomains) could remove ADPr from Csy1, a potential limitation of PTM-based CRISPR inhibition. We demonstrate that diverse macrodomains can indeed remove the modification from Csy1 in P. aeruginosa lysate. Together, these experiments connect the in vitro observations of AcrIF11s enzymatic activity to its potent and specific effects in vivo, clarifying the advantages and drawbacks of enzymatic Acrs in the evolutionary arms race between phages and bacteria."
"Intravital microscopy (IVM) enables live imaging of animals at single-cell level, offering essential insights into cancer progression. This technique allows for the observation of single-cell behaviors within their natural 3D tissue environments, shedding light on how genetic and microenvironmental changes influence the complex dynamics of tumors. IVM generates highly complex datasets that often exceed the analytical capacity of traditional uni-parametric approaches, which can neglect single-cell heterogeneous in vivo behavior and limit insights into microenvironmental influences on cellular behavior. To overcome these limitations, we present BEHAV3D Tumor Profiler (BEHAV3D-TP), a computational framework that enables unbiased single-cell classification based on a range of morphological, environmental and dynamic single cell features. BEHAV3D-TP integrates with widely used 2D and 3D image processing pipelines, enabling researchers without advanced computational expertise to profile cancer and healthy cell dynamics in IVM data. Here, we apply BEHAV3D-TP to study diffuse midline glioma (DMG), a highly aggressive pediatric brain tumor characterized by invasive progression. By extending BEHAV3D-TP to incorporate tumor microenvironment (TME) data from IVM or fixed correlative imaging, we demonstrate that distinct migratory behaviors of DMG cells are associated with specific TME components, including tumor-associated macrophages and vasculature. BEHAV3D-TP enhances the accessibility of computational tools for analyzing the complex behaviors of cancer cells and their interactions with the TME in IVM data."
"Non-human primate studies traditionally use two or three animals. We previously used standard statistics to argue for using either one animal, for an inference about that sample, or five or more animals, for a useful inference about the population. A recently proposed framework argued for testing three animals and accepting the outcome found in the majority as the outcome that is most representative for the population. The proposal tests this framework under various assumptions about the true probability of the representative outcome in the population, i.e. its typicality. On this basis, it argues that the framework is valid across a wide range of typicalities. Here, we show (1) that the error rate of the framework depends strongly on the typicality of the representative outcome, (2) that an acceptable error rate requires this typicality to be very high (87% for a single type of outlier), which actually renders empirical testing beyond a single animal obsolete, (3) that moving from one to three animals decreases error rates mainly for typicality values of 70-90%, and much less for both lower and higher values. Furthermore, we use conjunction analysis to demonstrate that two out of three animals with a given outcome only allow to infer a lower bound to typicality of 9%, which is of limited value. Thus, the use of two or three animals does not allow a useful inference about the population, and if this option is nevertheless chosen, the inferred lower bound of typicality should be reported."
"Recent evidence demonstrates that eukaryotic genomes encode thousands of evolutionarily novel proteins that originate de novo from non-coding DNA and can contribute to species-specific adaptations. Yet, it remains unclear how these incipient proteins--whose sequences are entirely new to nature--navigate the cellular environment to bring about beneficial traits. Here, we conduct a systematic in vivo investigation of de novo protein cell biology in yeast, revealing the early stages of de novo protein cellular integration. We show that beneficial de novo proteins exploit conserved membrane targeting, trafficking, and degradation pathways to integrate cellular systems. We find that beneficial de novo proteins frequently localize to membrane-bound compartments, particularly the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Despite having unrelated sequences, ER-localized de novo proteins converge on a shared molecular signature: a C-terminal transmembrane domain that enables recognition by conserved post-translational ER insertion pathways. Subsequently, ER-localized de novo proteins traffic from the ER and their homeostasis is regulated by conserved proteasomal and vacuolar degradation pathways. Our findings demonstrate that ancient targeting and degradation pathways can accommodate young de novo proteins bearing a convergent molecular signature. These pathways could act as selective filters, biasing which young de novo proteins persist. The ER membrane may offer a ""safe harbor"" for certain classes of de novo proteins to acquire a selected function over time, thereby serving as a cradle for evolutionary innovation."
"We present a novel, versatile genome editing method termed ONE-STEP tagging, which combines CRISPR-Cas9-mediated targeting with Bxb1 integrase-based site-specific integration for efficient, precise, and scalable protein tagging. Applied in hiPSCs, cancer cells, and primary T cells, this system enables rapid generation of endogenously tagged cell lines. By enhancing the nuclear localization signal (NLS) of the catalytically superior eeBxb1 integrase and co-delivering a DNA-PK inhibitor (AZD-7648), we achieved up to [~]90% integration efficiency at the ACTR10 locus. ONE-STEP tagging is robust across diverse loci and cell types and supports large DNA cargo integration, with efficiencies reaching 16.6% for a 14.4 kb construct. The method also enables multiplexed tagging of multiple proteins within the same cell and allows simultaneous CRISPR-based editing at secondary loci, such as gene knockouts or homology-directed repair (HDR) insertions. Importantly, we demonstrate successful application in primary T cells by targeting the T cell receptor (TCR) locus while simultaneously knocking out B2M, a key step toward generating immune-evasive, off-the-shelf CAR-T cells. Additionally, we introduce a dual-cassette version of the method compatible with universal donor plasmids, allowing use of entirely off-the-shelf reagents. Together, these advances establish ONE-STEP tagging as a powerful tool for both basic and therapeutic genome engineering."
"DNA replication requires recruitment of Cdc45 and GINS into the MCM double hexamer by initiation factors to form an active helicase, the Cdc45-MCM-GINS (CMG) complex, at the replication origins. The initiation factor Sld3 is a central regulator of Cdc45 and GINS recruitment, working with Sld7 together. However, the mechanism through which Sld3 regulates CMG complex formation remains unclear. Here, we present the structure of the Sld3 Cdc45-binding domain in complex with Cdc45 (Sld3CBD-Cdc45), showing detailed interactions and conformational changes required for binding to each other. The mutant analysis indicated that the binding between Sld3CBD and Cdc45 could be broken easily. We also revealed that Sld3CBD, GINS, and MCM bind to different sites on Cdc45 in the Sld3CBD-CMG model, indicating that after recruitment of Cdc45, Sld7-Sld3 could remain in Cdc45-MCM until CMG formation. The consistency between the particle size of Sld7-Sld3-Cdc45 and the distance between Sld3CBDs in the Cdc45-MCM dimer indicated the binding manner of the Cdc45-Sld3-[Sld7]2-Sld3-Cdc45 off/on MCM double hexamer. A DNA-binding assay of Sld3 and its complexes with single-stranded ARS1 fragments revealed a relationship between the dissociation of Sld7-Sld3 from CMG and the unwound single-stranded DNA. These findings help to further our understanding of the molecular basis of the regulation of CMG complex formation by Sld3."
"Mammalian primordial germ cells (PGCs) migrate asynchronously through the embryonic hindgut and dorsal mesentery to reach the gonads. We previously found that interaction with different somatic niches regulates PGC proliferation along the migration route. To characterize transcriptional heterogeneity of migrating PGCs and their niches, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of 13,262 mouse PGCs and 7,868 surrounding somatic cells during migration (E9.5, E10.5, E11.5) and in anterior versus posterior locations to enrich for leading and lagging migrants. Analysis of PGCs by position revealed dynamic gene expression changes between faster or earlier migrants in the anterior and slower or later migrants in the posterior at E9.5; these differences include migration-associated actin polymerization machinery and epigenetic reprogramming-associated genes. We furthermore identified changes in signaling with various somatic niches, notably strengthened interactions with hindgut epithelium via non-canonical WNT (ncWNT) in posterior PGCs compared to anterior. Reanalysis of a previously published dataset suggests that ncWNT signaling from the hindgut epithelium to early migratory PGCs is conserved in humans. Trajectory inference methods identified putative differentiation trajectories linking cell states across timepoints and from posterior to anterior in our mouse dataset. At E9.5, we mainly observed differences in cell adhesion and actin cytoskeletal dynamics between E9.5 posterior and anterior migrants. At E10.5, we observed divergent gene expression patterns between putative differentiation trajectories from posterior to anterior including Nodal signaling response genes Lefty1, Lefty2, and Pycr2 and reprogramming factors Dnmt1, Prc1, and Tet1. At E10.5, we experimentally validated anterior migrant-specific Lefty1/2 upregulation via whole-mount immunofluorescence staining for LEFTY1/2 and phosphorylated SMAD2/3, suggesting that elevated autocrine Nodal signaling in migrating PGCs occurs as they near the gonadal ridges. Together, this positional and temporal atlas of mouse PGCs supports the idea that niche interactions along the migratory route elicit changes in proliferation, actin dynamics, pluripotency, and epigenetic reprogramming."
"Humans use multiple sensory systems to estimate body orientation in space. Sensory contributions change depending on context. A predominant concept for the underlying multisensory integration (MSI) is the linear summation of weighted inputs from individual sensory systems. Changes of sensory contributions are typically attributed to some mechanism explicitly adjusting weighting factors. We provide evidence for a conceptually different mechanism that performs a multisensory correction if the reference of a sensory input moves in space without the need to explicitly change sensory weights. The correction is based on a reconstruction of the sensory reference frame motion (RFM) and automatically corrects erroneous inputs, e.g., when looking at a moving train. The proposed RFM estimator contains a nonlinear dead-zone that blocks corrections at slow velocities. We first demonstrate that this mechanism accounts for the apparent changes in sensory contributions. Secondly, using a balance control model, we show predictions of specific distortions in body sway responses to perturbations caused by this nonlinearity. Experiments measuring sway responses of 24 subjects (13 female, 11 male) to visual scene movements confirmed these predictions. The findings indicate that the central nervous system resolves sensory conflicts by an internal reconstruction of the cause of the conflict. Thus, the mechanism links the concept of causal inference to shifts in sensory contributions, providing a cohesive picture of MSI for the estimation of body orientation in space.

Significance StatementHow the central nervous system (CNS) constructs body orientation in space from multiple sensory inputs is a fundamental question in neuroscience. It is a prerequisite to maintain balance, navigate and interact with the world. To estimate body orientation, the CNS dynamically changes the contribution of individual sensory inputs depending on context and reliability of the cues. However, it is not clear how the CNS achieves these dynamic changes. The findings in our study resolve major aspects of this question. Importantly, the proposed solution using nonlinear multisensory feedback contrasts with traditional approaches assuming context-dependent gain-scaling of individual inputs. Thus, our findings demonstrate how complex, intelligent, and unintuitive behavior can emerge from a comparably simple nonlinear feedback mechanism."
"Structured AbstractO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSUnexplained stillbirth may occur due to premature placental ageing, with unexpected deterioration of placental function for gestational age. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are enzyme-resistant RNA molecules that accumulate in ageing tissues. Furthermore, circRNAs bind gDNA directly, forming circRNA:DNA complexes which can induce DNA breaks and genomic instability.

ObjectivesThis study investigated tissue ageing and circRNA accumulation with gestational age in healthy and stillbirth placentae, and determined whether circRNAs directly interact with placental DNA causing DNA damage and cellular senescence.

Study designPlacenta samples (n=60 term uncomplicated; n=4 unexplained stillbirth, 23, 26, 31, 34 weeks gestation) were assessed. Abundance of 7 candidate circRNAs (circ_0009000, circ_0024157, circ_0061017, circ_0036877, circ_0054624, circ_0111277 and circ_0000284), and their linear transcripts, was quantified using qPCR. Total RNA, in the presence and absence of RNase R and RNase H1, was determined using the Qubit fluorimeter. Physical interaction of candidate circRNAs with DNA was confirmed by DNA:RNA ImmunoPrecipitation (DRIP)-qPCR. Telomere length was assessed using real-time PCR. Relative abundance of senescence-associated genes was quantified using qPCR. DNA damage was assessed using an alkaline Comet Assay. Patient-derived trophoblast stem cells (TSCs) differentiation into syncytiotrophoblasts or extravillous trophoblasts was confirmed using immunofluorescence microscopy. The effect of circ_0000284 knockdown was assessed following transfection with either a siRNA (designed to knockdown circ_0000284) or a scrambled siRNA control, at 5, 10 and 20 nM final concentrations using Lipofectamine RNAiMax. Abundance of circRNAs in maternal blood sampled between 15-16 weeks gestation (n=12 control, n=6 women who went on to have a stillbirth) was determined using qPCR. Appropriate statistical analyses were undertaken (SPSS).

ResultsPlacental DNA damage, senescence and expression of 7 candidate circRNAs, but not their linear transcripts, were increased in 40 and 41+ weeks gestation samples, and in stillbirth, compared with earlier gestations (37-39 weeks). DRIP-qPCR signal size was significantly larger in term placentae than in enzyme-treated controls, confirming that all candidate circRNA loci bind to placental DNA. Abundance of circRNA was significantly decreased with the addition of RNase H1, compared with all healthy gestation samples, indicating that stillbirth placentae may lack RNase H1. Telomere length is shorter in placentae from stillbirths compared with healthy 37 weeks placentae. Depletion of circ_0000284 by specific siRNA in primary cells significantly reduced DNA damage and increased expression of senescence-associated genes compared to control. Abundance of candidate circRNAs are increased in maternal blood at 16 weeks gestation for women who went on to have a stillbirth compared with women who had live births.

ConclusionsStillbirth placentae show accelerated ageing with shortened telomeres, premature DNA breaks, increased cellular senescence and accumulation of candidate circRNAs, at levels consistent with older gestation tissue. These circRNAs bind to DNA in the placenta, and circ_0000284 knockdown reduces DNA breaks and senescence in primary placental cells. Therefore, circRNAs play a role in placental ageing and associate with stillbirth, likely via decreased RNase H1 abundance, preventing circRNA degradation and facilitating circRNA accumulation, and subsequent circR-loop formation. circRNAs present a viable method of stillbirth risk screening.

C_LIO_LICircular RNAs accumulate in ageing healthy placenta and accumulate prematurely in stillbirth placentae. Circular RNAs bind directly to placental DNA, inducing DNA breaks and cellular senescence, thereby contributing to overall functional decline of the placenta, reducing its ability to support the fetus. Circular RNAs in maternal blood represents a novel screening tool for detection of stillbirth risk.
C_LIO_LIPremature placental ageing has previously been associated with stillbirth, however circular RNAs have never before been implicated in this process. Circular RNA accumulation in ageing tissues has been shown in model species (i.e. C. elegans, Drosophila Melanogaster, mice) but this is the first evidence in human tissues and in the placenta.

"From overt emotional displays to a subtle eyebrow raise during speech, facial expressions are key cues for social interaction. How these inherently dynamic signals encode emotion remains only partially understood. Moreover, despite the ubiquity of speech in face-to-face interactions, the dynamics of facial emotion signals during speech have been overlooked. In Study 1 we recorded participants facial movements signalling happy, sad and angry emotions in Expression-only and Emotive-speech conditions. We then employed a data-driven pipeline integrating facial motion quantification, spatiotemporal classification and clustering to investigate the structure and function of facial dynamics in signalling emotion. Results reveal that a few fundamental spatiotemporal patterns reliably differentiated emotion in non-verbal expressions and emotive speech facial signals. Furthermore, we identified transient substates - or dynamic phases-that are diagnostic of emotion and conditions. A perceptual validation with naive observers (Study 2) showed that the low-dimensional spatiotemporal structure captures meaningful cues that closely predicts human emotion categorisations. We argue that this low-dimensional spatiotemporal structure optimises both the transmission and perception of dynamic facial emotion signals. This work contributes insights into face-to-face emotion signalling and provide a versatile framework for modelling dynamic social cues and can inform the design of expressive emotive capabilities in social agents."

"Similar to motor skill learning in mammals, vocal learning in songbirds requires a set of interconnected brain areas that make up an analogous basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuit known as the anterior forebrain pathway (AFP). Although neural activity in the AFP has been extensively investigated during awake singing, very little is known about its neural activity patterns during other behavioral states. Here, we used chronically implanted Neuropixels probes to investigate spontaneous neural activity in the AFP during natural sleep and awake periods in male zebra finches. We found that during sleep, neuron populations in the pallial region LMAN (lateral magnocellular nucleus of the nidopallium) spontaneously exhibited synchronized bursts that were characterized by a negative sharp deflection in the local field potential (LFP) and a transient increase in gamma power. LMAN population bursts occurred primarily during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and were highly reminiscent of sharp-wave ripple (SWR) activity observed in rodent hippocampus. We also examined the functional connectivity within the AFP by calculating the pairwise LFP coherence. As expected, delta and theta band coherence within LMAN and Area X was higher during sleep compared to awake periods. Contrary to our expectations, we did not observe strong coherence between LMAN and Area X during sleep, suggesting that the input from LMAN into Area X is spatially restricted. Overall, these results provide the first description of spontaneous neural dynamics within the AFP across behavioral states.

Significance statementAlthough cortical and basal ganglia circuits are known to be required for learning in both mammals and birds, little is known about the ongoing spontaneous activity patterns within these circuits, or how they are modulated by behavioral state. Here we prove the first description of cortical-basal ganglia network activity during sleep and awake periods in birds. Within the pallial area LMAN, we observed population-wide bursting events that were highly reminiscent of hippocampal sharp-wave ripple (SWR) activity, suggesting that large-scale population events have diverse functions across vertebrates."
"The study of disorders of consciousness (DoC) is very complex because patients suffer from a wide variety of lesions, affected brain mechanisms, different severity of symptoms, and are unable to communicate. Combining neuroimaging data and mathematical modeling can help us quantify and better describe some of these alterations. The goal of this study is to provide a new analysis and modeling pipeline for fMRI data leading to new diagnosis and prognosis biomarkers at the individual patient level. To do so, we project patients fMRI data into a low-dimension latent-space. We define the latent spaces dimension as the smallest dimension able to maintain the complexity, non-linearities, and information carried by the data, according to different criteria that we detail in the first part. This dimensionality reduction procedure then allows us to build biologically inspired latent whole-brain models that can be calibrated at the single-patient level. In particular, we propose a new model inspired by the regulation of neuronal activity by astrocytes in the brain. This modeling procedure leads to two types of model-based biomarkers (MBBs) that provide novel insight at different levels: (1) the connectivity matrices bring us information about the severity of the patients diagnosis, and, (2) the local node parameters correlate to the patients etiology, age and prognosis. Altogether, this study offers a new data processing framework for resting-state fMRI which provides crucial information regarding DoC patients diagnosis and prognosis. Finally, this analysis pipeline could be applied to other neurological conditions."
"The microglial surface protein Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid Cells 2 (TREM2) plays a critical role in mediating brain homeostasis and inflammatory responses in Alzheimers disease (AD). The soluble form of TREM2 (sTREM2) exhibits neuroprotective effects in AD, though the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Moreover, differences in ligand binding between TREM2 and sTREM2, which have major implications for their roles in AD pathology, remain unexplained. To address these knowledge gaps, we conducted the most computationally intensive molecular dynamics simulations to date of (s)TREM2, exploring their interactions with key damage- and lipoprotein-associated phospholipids and the impact of the AD-risk mutation R47H. Our results demonstrate that the flexible stalk domain of sTREM2 serves as the molecular basis for differential ligand binding between sTREM2 and TREM2, facilitated by its role in modulating the dynamics of the Ig-like domain and altering the accessibility of canonical ligand binding sites. We identified a novel ligand binding site on sTREM2, termed the  Expanded Surface 2, which emerges due to competitive binding of the stalk with the Ig-like domain. Additionally, we observed that the stalk domain itself functions as a site for ligand binding, with increased binding frequency in the presence of R47H. This suggests that sTREM2s neuroprotective role in AD may, at least in part, arise from the stalk domains ability to rescue dysfunctional ligand binding caused by AD-risk mutations. Lastly, our findings indicate that R47H-induced dysfunction in TREM2 may result from both diminished ligand binding due to restricted complementarity-determining region 2 loop motions and an impaired ability to differentiate between ligands, proposing a novel mechanism for loss-of-function. In summary, these results provide valuable insights into the role of sTREM2 in AD pathology, laying the groundwork for the design of new therapeutic approaches targeting (s)TREM2 in AD."
"The immune system is one of the first lines of defence against cancer. When effector cells attempt to suppress tumour, cancer cells can evolve methods of escape or inhibition. Knowledge of this coevolutionary system can help to understand tumour-immune dynamics both during tumorigenesis and during immunotherapy treatments. Here, we present an individual-based model of mutation accumulation, where random mutations in cancer cells trigger specialised immune responses. Unlike previous research, we explicitly model interactions between cancer and effector cells and incorporate stochastic effects, which are important for the expansion and extinction of small populations. We find that the parameters governing interactions between the cancer and effector cells induce different outcomes of tumour progress, such as suppression and evasion. While it is hard to measure the cancer-immune dynamics directly, genetic information of the cancer may indicate the presence of such interactions. Our model demonstrates signatures of selection in sequencing-derived summary statistics, such as the single-cell mutational burden distribution. Thus, bulk and single-cell sequencing may provide information about the coevolutionary dynamics."
"Many CBASS systems defend against viral infections by depleting cellular NAD+ levels, eventually leading to dormancy or death. This abortive infection strategy is beneficial in stopping fast lytic infections, as cells die before spreading the virus to neighboring cells. However, in co-chronic viral infections, which often occur in archaea, abortive infection could be detrimental, as the cost of immunity may outweigh that of infection. Here we study an archaeal CBASS system that was expressed in the model organism Haloferax volcanii DS2. We demonstrate that this system protects against a chronically infecting virus, HFPV-1, and eliminates the virus after several passages without killing the host. Moreover, cells that cleared the virus became substantially more resistant to subsequent HFPV-1 infections. Cell death only occurred after extensive incubation with HFPV-1. These findings suggest that CBASS can be beneficial during non-lytic infection, potentially explaining why such systems are common in archaea."
"We tested the hypothesis that both density- and frequency-dependent interactions play important roles in determining plant growth in a dune heath ecosystem at several levels of available nitrogen. Plant growth was measured using the pin-point method in a five-block experiment with four nitrogen levels. To maximize statistical power, we used only three taxonomic groups: Calluna vulgaris, Avenella flexuosa (the two most dominant species), and all other vascular plant species together. The results show that both Lotka-Volterra type interspecific competition and frequency-dependency play significant roles in determining the growth of the species in the community. Significant interspecific density-dependent competition was observed in 4 out of the 6 possible cases. Nitrogen addition increased the competitive effect of C. vulgaris on the growth of the other species. Both C. vulgaris and A. flexuosa showed frequency-dependent positive feedback dynamics on growth when they were relatively dominant at the plot scale, and this effect increased with added nitrogen. In plots with added nitrogen, there was a beneficial effect of being relatively rare on the growth of the group of other species. The study highlights the importance of the combined effects of density and frequency dependency in determining plant growth."
"DNA methylation at the 5 position of cytosine (5mC) is an ancient epigenetic mark in eukaryotes. The levels of total 5mC vary enormously between different species, and the DNA methyltransferases that introduce 5mC have been repeatedly lost in several independent lineages. DNA methyltransferases are a threat to genomic stability due to the increased mutagenicity of 5mC bases and the propensity of DNA methyltransferases themselves to introduce DNA alkylation damage as an off-target effect. However, whether alkylation damage explains why 5mC is frequently lost in evolution is unclear. Here we tested the fitness consequences of DNA methyltransferase-induced alkylation damage by introducing a eukaryotic-like 5mC system into E. coli. We showed that introducing 5mC genome-wide leads to increased sensitivity to alkylating agents, which is strongly enhanced by removal of the 3mC repair enzyme AlkB. Unexpectedly, we discovered that 5mC introduction led to increased sensitivity to oxidative stress. We showed that this is due to increased formation of reactive oxygen in the presence of 5mC. We determined that reactive oxygen species led to non-enzymatic oxidation of 5mC, producing modified cytosines such as 5fC that are recognised as DNA base damage in E. coli. Overall, our work identifies increased sensitivity to oxidative stress, as well as alkylating agents, as a negative consequence of genome-wide 5mC. Oxidative stress is frequently encountered by organisms in their environment, thus offering a plausible reason for total loss of 5mC in some species."
"The neural activity of the brain is intimately coupled to the dynamics of the body. In order to predict and adapt to the sensorimotor consequences of our actions, compelling behavioral studies in humans, non-human primates, and in rodents have shown the existence of internal models - predictive models of our body in the environment. These internal models are theoretically used to compute an updated state estimate with prediction errors. Here, we directly test whether such errors are encoded in primary somatosensory (S1) or motor (M1) cortex during a motor adaptation task in mice. Using control theory-derived features that include prediction errors, we find that functionally distinct neurons are mapped onto specific computational motifs. We find that layer 2/3 population dynamics encode command-like signals and sensorimotor prediction errors (SPEs). S1 neurons encode SPEs more prominently than M1, and the neural latent dynamics change in S1 more than in M1 during this within-session learning. Then we asked, in which coordinate frameworks are such errors computed? To do this, we developed a novel 50-muscle model of the adult mouse forelimb that is capable of studying motor control and learning in a physics simulator. We identify both high-level 3D position and muscle spaces as coordinate frameworks for SPEs. Together, our results provide a new model of how neural dynamics in S1 enables adaptive learning."
"The bone marrow microenvironment plays a critical role in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) progression, yet its cellular heterogeneity remains poorly understood. Using single-cell RNA sequencing on patient-derived of bone marrow aspirates from pediatric B-ALL patients, we identified two distinct mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) populations: early mesenchymal progenitors and adipogenic progenitors. Spatial transcriptomic analysis further revealed the localization of these cell types and identified a third stromal population, osteogenic-lineage cells, exclusively present in the bone biopsy. Functional ex vivo assays using sorted stromal populations derived from B-ALL patient bone marrow aspirates demonstrated that both early mesenchymal and adipogenic progenitors secrete key niche-supportive factors, including CXCL12 and Osteopontin, and support leukemic cell survival and chemoresistance. Transcriptomic profiling revealed that B-ALL cells interact differently with stromal subtypes. Notably, adipogenic progenitors, but not early mesenchymal progenitors, provide support to leukemic cells through interleukin-7 and VCAM1 signaling. Stromal cells from B-ALL patients exhibited an enhanced adipogenic differentiation capacity compared to healthy controls. Moreover, co-culture experiments showed that B-ALL cells induce adipogenic differentiation in healthy MSCs through a cell contact-dependent mechanism. Adipogenic progenitors were also enriched in relapse samples, implicating them in disease progression. These findings highlight the complexity of the B-ALL microenvironment and identify different specialized stromal niches with which the leukemic cells can engage."
"Fragile X syndrome (FXS), a leading inherited cause of intellectual disability and autism, is frequently accompanied by sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances. In this study, we comprehensively characterized these disruptions and evaluated the therapeutic potential of a circadian-based intervention in the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) knockout (KO) mouse. The Fmr1 KO mice exhibited fragmented sleep, impaired locomotor rhythmicity, and attenuated behavioral responses to light, linked to an abnormal retinal innervation and reduction of light-evoked neuronal activation in the suprachiasmatic nucleus. Behavioral testing revealed significant deficits in social memory and increased repetitive behaviors in the mutants, which correlated with sleep fragmentation. Remarkably, a scheduled feeding paradigm (6-hour feeding/18-hour fasting) significantly enhanced circadian rhythmicity, consolidated sleep, and improved social deficits and repetitive behaviors in the Fmr1 KO mice. This intervention also normalized the elevated levels of some pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-12 and IFN-{gamma}, in the mutants blood, suggesting that its benefits extend to inflammatory pathways. These findings highlight the interplay between circadian disruption, behavior, and an inflammatory response in FXS, and provide compelling evidence that time-restricted feeding may serve as a promising non- pharmacological approach for improving core symptoms in neurodevelopmental disorders."
"Decision-making is a ubiquitous component of animal behavior that is often studied in the context of foraging. Foragers make a series of decisions while locating food (food search), choosing between food types (diet or patch choice), and allocating time spent within patches of food (patch-leaving). Here, we introduce a framework for investigating foraging decisions using detailed analysis of individual behavior and quantitative modeling in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We demonstrate that C. elegans make accept-reject patch choice decisions upon encounter with food. Specifically, we show that when foraging amongst small, dispersed, and dilute patches of bacteria, C. elegans initially reject several bacterial patches, opting to prioritize exploration of the environment, before switching to a more exploitatory foraging strategy during subsequent encounters. Observed across a range of bacterial patch densities, sizes, and distributions, we use a quantitative model to show that this decision to explore or exploit is guided by available sensory information, internal satiety signals, and learned environmental statistics related to the bacterial density of recently encountered and exploited patches. We behaviorally validated model predictions on animals that had been food-deprived, animals foraging in environments with multiple patch densities, and null mutants with defective sensory modalities. Broadly, we present a framework to study ecologically relevant foraging decisions that could guide future investigations into the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying decision-making."
"With the remarkable stride in computing power and advances in Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation programs, the crucial challenge of storing and sharing large biomolecular simulation datasets has emerged. By leveraging AutoEncoders, a type of artificial neural network, we developed a method to compress MD trajectories into significantly smaller latent spaces. Our method can save up to 98% in disk space compared to xtc, a highly compressed trajectory format from the widely used MD program package GROMACS, thus facilitating storage and sharing of simulation trajectories. Atom coordinates are very accurately reconstructed from compressed data. The method was tested across a diverse sets of biomolecular systems, including folded proteins, intrinsically disordered proteins, phospholipid bilayers, proteinligand complexes, large protein complexes and membrane-bound protein systems. The reconstructed trajectories demonstrated consistent accuracy in recovering key biophysically relevant properties for proteins, lipids and composite systems. The compression efficiency was particularly beneficial for larger systems. This approach enables the scientific community to efficiently store and share large-scale biomolecular simulation data, potentially enhancing collaborative research efforts. The workflow, termed ""compresstraj"", is implemented in PyTorch and is publicly available at https://github.com/SerpentByte/compresstraj, offering a practical solution for handling the increasing volumes of data generated in biomolecular simulation studies."
"Phages with contractile tails employ elaborate mechanisms to penetrate bacterial cell walls and deliver their genomes into the host cytoplasm. Most tailed phages that have been structurally characterized to date infect Gram-negative bacteria, but those targeting Gram-positive bacteria, many of which are important human pathogens, are less well understood. Here, we show that the baseplate of phage phi812, which infects Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus, is formed of a core, wedge modules, and baseplate arms carrying receptor-binding proteins type 1 and 2 and tripod complexes. The baseplate of phi812 with extended tail has threefold symmetry but after tail contraction it transforms to sixfold symmetry. In this process, the receptor-binding proteins re-orient to bind to the host cell. The conformational changes to the tripod complexes trigger the release of the central spike and weld proteins from the baseplate, which exposes peptidoglycan-degrading domains of the hub proteins. Changes in the positions of baseplate arms are transmitted through wedge modules to tail sheath initiator proteins. The ring formed by the tail sheath initiator proteins expands in diameter and triggers the contraction of the tail sheath. The tail sheath of phi812, shortens from 200 to 96 nm, which pushes the tail tube 10-30 nm into the cytoplasm, depending on the local thickness of the S. aureus cell wall. Our results demonstrate how tail and baseplate enable phi812 genome delivery into Gram-positive S. aureus."
"Single-cell multimodal omics technologies have empowered the profiling of complex biological systems at a resolution and scale that were previously unattainable. These biotechnologies have propelled the fast-paced innovation and development of data integration methods, leading to a critical need for their systematic categorisation, evaluation, and benchmark. Navigating and selecting the most pertinent integration approach poses a significant challenge, contingent upon the tasks relevant to the study goals and the combination of modalities and batches present in the data at hand. Understanding how well each method performs multiple tasks, including dimension reduction, batch correction, cell type classification and clustering, imputation, feature selection, and spatial registration, and at which combinations will help guide this decision. This study develops a much-needed guideline on choosing the most appropriate method for single-cell multimodal omics data analysis through a systematic categorisation and comprehensive benchmarking of current methods.

"Leveraging single cell reference atlases to analyse new data has brought about a paradigm shift in single cell data science akin to the first reference genome in genomics. However methods to perform this mapping require computational expertise as well as sometimes considerable compute power, and thus may exclude the researchers from this innovation who may benefit the most from it. ArchMap, a no-code query-to-reference mapping tool, removes this barrier by providing all-in-one automated mapping, cell type annotation, and collaborative features to analyse single-cell datasets from a wide range of integrated, often published, reference atlases and allows extension of atlases with the growing Human Cell Atlas and related efforts. This paves the way for a democratisation of reference mapping capabilities."
"The dorsal vagal complex (DVC) is a region in the brainstem comprised of an intricate network of specialized cells responsible for sensing and propagating many appetite-related cues. Understanding the dynamics controlling appetite requires deeply exploring the cell types and transitory states harbored in this brain site. We generated a multi-species DVC cell atlas using single nuclei RNAseq (sn-RNAseq), by curating and harmonizing mouse and rat data, which includes >180,000 cells and 123 cell identities at 5 granularities of cellular resolution. We report unique DVC features such as Kcnj3 expression in Ca+ permeable astrocytes as well as new cell populations like neurons co-expressing Th and Cck, and a leptin receptor-expressing neuron population in the rat area postrema which is marked by expression of the progenitor marker, Pdgfra. In summary, our findings demonstrate a high degree of complexity within the DVC and provide a valuable tool for the study of this metabolic center."
"The evolution of separate sexes is hypothesized to occur through distinct pathways involving few large-effect or many small-effect alleles. However, we lack empirical evidence for how these different genetic architectures shape the transition from quantitative variation in sex expression to distinct male and female phenotypes. To explore these processes, we leveraged the recent transition of Amaranthus tuberculatus to dioecy within a predominantly monoecious genus, along with a sex-phenotyped population genomic dataset, and six newly generated chromosome-level haplotype phased assemblies. We identify a [~]3 Mb region strongly associated with sex through complementary SNP genotype and sequence-depth based analyses. Comparative genomics of these proto-sex chromosomes within the species and across the Amaranthus genus demonstrates remarkable variability in their structure and genic content, including numerous polymorphic inversions. No such inversion underlies the extended linkage we observe associated with sex determination. Instead, we identify a complex presence/absence polymorphism reflecting substantial Y-haplotype variation--structured by ancestry, geography, and habitat-- but only partially explaining phenotyped sex. Just over 10% of sexed individuals show phenotype-genotype mismatch in the sex-linked region, and along with observation of leakiness in the phenotypic expression of sex, suggest additional modifiers of sex and dynamic gene content within and between the proto-X and Y. Together, this work reveals a complex genetic architecture of sex determination in A. tuberculatus characterized by the maintenance of substantial haplotype diversity, and variation in the expression of sex."
"Life-history traits such as body size, reproduction, survival, and stress resistance are fundamental to an organisms fitness and are highly influenced by nutritional environments across life stages. In this study, we employed a full factorial experimental design to investigate the effects of isocaloric diets (diets with equal caloric content but differing macronutrient composition) on key life-history traits in an outbred Drosophila melanogaster population. Our results demonstrated significant diet-induced plasticity, with male wing length (a proxy for body size) being influenced by the developmental diet; males reared on carbohydrate-rich developmental diets had larger wings as adults. Fertility increased with protein-rich diets at both developmental and adult stages, reaffirming the critical role of dietary protein in enhancing reproductive success. Lifespan exhibited sexually dimorphic responses to diet: carbohydrate-rich developmental diets extended male lifespan, while carbohydrate-rich adult diets reduced lifespan in both sexes. Stress resistance traits, including starvation and desiccation resistance, were unaffected by developmental diets but were influenced by adult diets, with carbohydrate-rich adult diets enhancing survival under both stress conditions in males and females. Importantly, while most traits exhibited additive effects of nutrition across life stages, a marginal interaction for male starvation resistance suggests that developmental and adult diets can interact in a trait- and sex-specific manner. Moreover, associations between dietary effects on life-history traits were context-dependent, driven primarily by adult diets and varying by sex. These findings emphasize the profound role of stage-specific nutritional environments in modulating life-history traits and their correlations, offering valuable insights into how organisms may adapt to changing ecological conditions and highlighting the importance of considering both developmental and adult dietary contexts in evolutionary studies."
"The Genome in a Bottle Consortium (GIAB), hosted by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), is developing new matched tumor-normal samples, the first to be explicitly consented for public dissemination of genomic data and cell lines. Here, we describe a comprehensive genomic dataset from the first individual, HG008, including DNA from an adherent, epithelial-like pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumor cell line and matched normal cells from duodenal and pancreatic tissues. Data for the tumor-normal matched samples comes from seventeen distinct state-of-the-art whole genome measurement technologies, including high depth short and long-read bulk whole genome sequencing (WGS), single cell WGS, and Hi-C, and karyotyping. In future publications, these data will be used by the GIAB Consortium to develop matched tumor-normal benchmarks for somatic variant detection. We expect these data to facilitate innovation for whole genome measurement technologies, de novo assembly of tumor and normal genomes, and bioinformatic tools to identify small and structural somatic mutations. This first-of-its-kind broadly consented open-access resource will facilitate further understanding of sequencing methods used for cancer biology."
"Single-neuron axonal projections reveal the route map of neuron output and provide a key cue for understanding how information flows across the brain. Reconstruction of single-neuron axonal projections requires intensive manual operations in tens of terabytes of brain imaging data, and is highly time-consuming and labor-intensive. The main issue lies in the need for precise reconstruction algorithms to avoid reconstruction errors, yet current methods struggle with densely distributed axons, focusing mainly on skeleton extraction. To overcome this, we introduce a point assignment-based method that uses cylindrical point sets to accurately represent axons and a minimal information flow tree model to suppress the snowball effect of reconstruction errors. Our method successfully reconstructs single-neuron axonal projections across hundreds of GBs (Gigabytes) images with an average of 80% F1-score, while current methods only provide less than 40% F1-score reconstructions from a few hundred MBs (Megabytes) images. This huge improvement is helpful for high-throughput mapping of neuron projections."
"Proteins that transmit molecules and signals across the plasma membrane are crucial in cell biology because they enable cells to sense and respond to their surroundings. A major challenge for studying cell-surface proteins is that often they do not fold or traffic properly to the plasma membrane when produced in heterologous cells. We developed a strategy for quantifying surface localization from fluorescence microscopy images of surface-stained cells. Using clustered protocadherins, a protein family important for cell-cell recognition during neuronal development, we found that surface delivery levels vary among clustered protocadherin isoforms and between wildtype and engineered variants. Quantifying these differences provides evidence that cis dimerization is not tightly coupled to surface delivery for clustered protocadherins. This work establishes a generalizable framework for screening proteins and variants of interest for proper cell surface localization.

SignificanceSurface proteins allow cells to interact with their environments, and their activities are often regulated by their delivery to and removal from the plasma membrane. We developed a strategy to quantitatively compare the surface delivery of proteins based on established epitope tag-based surface staining methods. Using natural and engineered variants of clustered protocadherins, cell-surface proteins essential for neuron development, we show that quantitative comparisons of surface trafficking levels facilitate the interpretation of mutational effects and can shed light on key regulatory mechanisms. We find that surface trafficking levels differ between variants and that, contrary to what was previously thought, a domain that inhibits surface delivery in some clustered protocadherins does so without directly relying on its protein-protein interface."
"Invasive species have devastating consequences for human health, food security, and the environment. Many invasive species adapt to new ecological niches following invasion, but little is known about the early steps of adaptation. Here we examine population genomics of a recently introduced drosophilid in North America, the African Fig Fly, Zaprionus indianus. This species is likely intolerant of subfreezing temperatures and recolonizes temperate environments yearly. We generated a new chromosome-level genome assembly for Z. indianus. Using resequencing of over 200 North American individuals collected over four years in temperate Virginia, plus a single collection from subtropical Florida, we tested for signatures of population structure and adaptation within invasive populations. We show founding populations are sometimes small and contain close genetic relatives, yet temporal population structure and differentiation of populations is mostly absent across North America. However, we identify two haplotypes that are differentiated between African and invasive populations and show signatures of selective sweeps. Both haplotypes contain genes in the cytochrome P450 pathway, indicating these sweeps may be related to pesticide resistance. X chromosome evolution in invasive populations is strikingly different from the autosomes, and a haplotype on the X chromosome that is highly differentiated between Virginia and Florida populations is a candidate for temperate adaptation. These results show that despite limited population structure, populations may rapidly evolve genetic differences early in an invasion. Further uncovering how these genomic regions influence invasive potential and success in new environments will advance our understanding of how organisms evolve in changing environments.

Article SummaryInvasive species (organisms that have been moved outside their natural range by human activities) can cause problems for both humans and the environment. We studied the genomes of over 200 individuals of a newly invasive fruit fly in North America, the African Fig Fly. We found genetic evidence that these recently introduced flies may be evolving in their new environments, which could make them stronger competitors and more likely to become pests."
"Protein sequence-function relationships are inherently complex, as amino acids at different positions can interact in highly unpredictable ways. A key question for protein evolution and engineering is how often epistasis extends beyond pairwise interactions to involve three or more positions. Although experimental data has accumulated rapidly in recent years, addressing this question remains challenging, as the number of possible interactions is typically enormous even for proteins of moderate size. Here, we introduce an interpretable machine learning framework for studying higher-order epistasis scalable to full-length proteins. Our model builds on the transformer architecture, with key modifications allowing us to assess the importance of higher-order interactions by fitting a series of models with increasing complexity. Applying our method to 10 large protein sequence-function datasets, we found that while additive effects explain the majority of the variance, within the epistatic component, the contribution of higher-order epistasis ranges from negligible to up to 60%. We also found higher-order epistasis is particularly important for generalizing locally sampled fitness data to distant regions of sequence space and for modeling an additional multi-peak fitness landscape. Our findings suggest that higher-order epistasis can play important roles in protein sequence-function relationships, and thus should be properly considered in protein engineering and evolutionary data analysis."
"How protein move and deform determines their interactions with the environment and is thus of utmost importance for cellular functioning. Following the revolution in single protein 3D structure prediction, researchers have focused on repurposing or developing deep learning models for sampling alternative protein conformations. In this work, we explored whether continuous compact representations of protein motions could be predicted directly from sequences, without exploiting 3D structures. SeaMoon leverages protein Language Model (pLM) embeddings as input to a lightweight convolutional neural network. We assessed SeaMoon against [~] 1 000 collections of experimental conformations exhibiting diverse motions. It predicts at least one ground-truth motion with reasonable accuracy for 40% of the test proteins. SeaMoon captures motions inaccessible to normal mode analysis, an unsupervised physics-based method relying solely on 3D geometry, and generalises to proteins without detectable sequence similarity to the training set. SeaMoon is easily retrainable with novel or updated pLMs."
"Despite its abundance in the fossil record, grass pollen is largely overlooked as a source of ecological and evolutionary data because most Poaceae species cannot be differentiated using traditional optical microscopy. However, deep learning techniques can quantify the small variations in grass pollen morphology visible under superresolution microscopy. We use the abstracted morphological features output by deep learning to estimate the taxonomic diversity and physiology of fossil grass pollen assemblages. Using a semi-supervised learning strategy, we trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on pollen images of 60 widely distributed grass species and unlabeled fossil Poaceae. Semi-supervised learning improved the CNN models capability to generalize feature recognition in fossil pollen specimens. Our models successfully captured both the taxonomic diversity of an assemblage and morphological differences between C3 and C4 species. We applied our trained models to fossil grass pollen assemblages from a 25,000-year lake-sediment record from eastern equatorial Africa and correlated past shifts in grass diversity with atmospheric CO2 concentration and proxy records of local temperature, precipitation, and fire occurrence. We quantified grass diversity for each time window using morphological variability, calculating both Shannon entropy and morphotype counts from the specimens CNN features.

Reconstructed C3:C4 ratios suggest a gradual increase in C4 grasses with rising temperature and fire activity across the late-glacial to Holocene transition. Our results demonstrate that quantitative machine-learned features of pollen morphology can significantly advance palynological analysis, enabling robust estimation of grass diversity and C3:C4 ratio in ancient grassland ecosystems.

SignificanceThe pollen of most grass species are morphologically indistinguishable using traditional optical microscopy, but we show that they can be differentiated through deep learning analyses of superresolution images. Abstracted morphological features derived from convolutional neural networks can be used to quantify the biological and physiological diversity of grass pollen assemblages, without a priori knowledge of the species present, and used to reconstruct past changes in the taxonomic diversity and relative abundance of C4 grasses in ancient grasslands. This approach unlocks ecological information that had been previously unattainable from the fossil pollen record and demonstrates that deep learning can solve some of the most intractable identification problems in the reconstruction of past vegetation dynamics."
"Self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) has the potential to provide durable, non-integrating transgene expression for transient gene therapy. However, its auto-replicative nature mimics viral infection, triggering innate immune responses that shut down cap-dependent translation, degrade cellular mRNA, induce cell death, and release cytokines. In non-immunotherapy applications, this immune activation is undesirable as it limits transgene expression, induces unintended changes in host gene expression, depletes transfected cells, and promotes inflammation--ultimately undermining therapeutic outcomes. Moreover, the use of exogenous immune suppressants to mitigate these effects often increases treatment complexity and the risk of unintended systemic side effects. To address these challenges, we developed a strategy to encode broad-spectrum innate immune suppression directly within saRNA. This approach leverages cap-independent translation to bypass saRNA-triggered translation shutdown, enabling the expression of multiple inhibitors targeting diverse double-stranded RNA-sensing and inflammatory signalling pathways. In mouse primary fibroblast-like synoviocytes--key cells in joint pathologies--this strategy eliminates the need for external immune inhibitors, reduces cytotoxicity and antiviral cytokine secretion, and enables sustained transgene expression that can be controlled with a small-molecule antiviral. Together, these findings support the development of reversible  immune-evasive saRNA constructs for transient gene therapy applications that avoid persistent immune activation and eliminate the need for external immune suppressants.

"O_LIEstablishing the timing of past evolutionary events is a fundamental task in the reconstruction of the history of life. State-of-the-art molecular dating methods generally involve the reconstruction of a species tree from conserved, vertically evolving genes, and the assumption of a molecular clock calibrated with the fossil record. Although this approach is extremely useful, its use is limited to speciation events and does not account for genes following different evolutionary paths. Recently, an alternative methodology for the relative dating of evolutionary events has been proposed that considers the distribution of branch lengths across sets of gene trees.
C_LIO_LIHere, we validate this methodology by comparing the relative age estimates with a fossil-calibrated phylogeny and propose a model-based formalisation using a Bayesian framework.
C_LIO_LIOur analyses revealed that the normalisation of the distances of interest with the branch lengths of a reference clade present across the set of gene trees results in narrower distributions, allowing the correct inference of the relative ordering of evolutionary events.
C_LIO_LIWe show that distributions of normalised lengths can be modelled using gamma or lognormal distributions and demonstrate that inference of the posterior distribution of the mode allows accurate relative age estimation, as assessed by a strong correlation with the molecular clock-dated tree.

"Skeletal muscle regeneration is a multistep process involving the activation, proliferation, differentiation, and fusion of muscle stem cells, known as satellite cells. The fusion of satellite cell-derived mononucleated muscle cells (SCMs) is indispensable for the generation of multinucleated, contractile myofibers during muscle repair. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying SCM fusion during muscle regeneration remain poorly understood. In this study, we uncovered an essential role for branched actin polymerization in SCM fusion. Using conditional knockouts of the Arp2/3 complex and its actin nucleation-promoting factors, N-WASP and WAVE, we demonstrated that branched actin polymerization is required for the SCM fusion, but not for satellite cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. We showed that the N-WASP and WAVE complexes have partially redundant functions in regulating SCM fusion. Furthermore, we revealed that branched actin polymerization is essential for generating invasive protrusions at the fusogenic synapses in SCMs. Taken together, our study has identified new components of the myoblast fusion machinery in skeletal muscle regeneration and demonstrated a critical role for branched actin-propelled invasive protrusions in this process."
"There is increasing demand for standardised, easy-to-use metrics to assess progress towards achieving biodiversity targets and the effectiveness of ecological compensation schemes. Biodiversity metrics based on combining habitat area and habitat condition scores are proliferating rapidly, but there is limited evidence on how they relate to ecological outcomes. Here, we test the relationship between the statutory biodiversity metric used for Biodiversity Net Gain (BNG) in England -- and as the basis for new biodiversity credit systems around the world -- and invertebrate richness, abundance, and community composition. We find that the combined area-condition BNG metric does not capture the value of arable farmland and grassland sites for invertebrate biodiversity: invertebrate communities were highly variable across sites that had the same type and condition under the BNG metric. We found no reliable relationship between scores under the metric and either invertebrate abundance or species richness, with the risk of the metric undervaluing sites of high invertebrate value. Our results highlight the need to incorporate factors beyond habitat type and condition into site evaluations, and to complement metric use with species-based surveys."
"During oogenesis, self-renewal and differentiation of germline stem cells (GSCs) must be tightly regulated. The Drosophila female germline serves as an excellent model for studying these regulatory mechanisms. Here, we report that a previously uncharacterized gene CG14545, which we named sakura, is essential for oogenesis and female fertility in Drosophila. Sakura is predominantly expressed in the ovaries, particularly in the germline cells, including GSCs. sakura null mutant female flies display rudimentary ovaries with germline-less and tumorous phenotypes, fail to produce eggs, and are completely sterile. The germline-specific depletion of sakura impairs Dpp/BMP signaling, leading to aberrant bag-of-marbles (bam) expression, resulting in faulty differentiation and loss of GSCs. sakura is also necessary for normal levels of piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) levels and for female-specific splicing of sex-lethal (sxl), a master regulator of sex identity determination. We identified Ovarian Tumor (Otu) as a protein binding partner of Sakura and found that loss of otu phenocopies loss of sakura in ovaries. Thus, we identify Sakura as a crucial factor for GSC renewal and differentiation and oogenesis, and propose that Sakura and Otu function together in these processes."
"Data integration is a powerful tool for facilitating a comprehensive and generalizable understanding of microbial communities and their association with outcomes of interest. However, integrating data sets from different studies remains a challenging problem because of severe batch effects, unobserved confounding variables, and high heterogeneity across data sets. We propose a new data integration method called MetaDICT, which initially estimates the batch effects by weighting methods in causal inference literature and then refines the estimation via novel shared dictionary learning. Compared with existing methods, MetaDICT can better avoid the overcorrection of batch effects and preserve biological variation when there exist unobserved confounding variables, data sets are highly heterogeneous across studies, or the batch is completely confounded with some covariates. Furthermore, MetaDICT can generate comparable embedding at both taxa and sample levels that can be used to unravel the hidden structure of the integrated data and improve the integrative analysis. Applications to synthetic and real microbiome data sets demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of MetaDICT in integrative analysis. Using MetaDICT, we characterize microbial interaction, identify generalizable microbial signatures, and enhance the accuracy of outcome prediction in two real integrative studies, including an integrative analysis of colorectal cancer metagenomics studies and a meta-analysis of immunotherapy microbiome studies."
"Observing different body stimuli can influence the speed and accuracy of our responses. Prior work indicates this effect is influenced by factors such as spatial congruence and perspective. We hypothesized that the influence of these factors would vary depending on the amount of time that participants had to process visual stimuli. Experiment 1 was a reaction time task (n=29) with stimuli varying in spatial congruence (congruent, incongruent, neutral), perspective (first- or third-person) and stimulus type (body or control). Experiment 2 (n=50) used the same stimuli in a ""Forced Response"" paradigm, which controlled the time participants had to prepare a response. This allowed us to assess responses as a function of preparation time. Experiment 1 showed effects of spatial congruence, with longer reaction times and more errors for spatially incongruent stimuli. This effect was greater for body stimuli. Experiment 2 showed that spatial information was processed faster than anatomical information, inducing incorrect responses at short preparation times for spatially incongruent body stimuli. There was little-to-no corresponding effect for control stimuli. Both experiments also showed weak-to-no effects of perspective, which appear to have been driven by spatial congruence. Our results indicate that spatial information is processed faster than anatomical information during observation of body stimuli. These data are consistent with the dual visual streams hypothesis, whereby spatial information would be processed rapidly via the dorsal stream, while anatomical processing would occur later via the ventral stream. These data also indicate differences in processing between body and control stimuli.

Public significance statementsThis study provides novel insight into the time-course of information processing, showing that spatial information is processed faster than anatomical information for body stimuli. The results also challenge the established view that visual perspective is critical to process body stimuli, demonstrating that this may instead result from lower-level effects of spatial congruence."
"Transgenerational effects, where parental environments influence offspring phenotype, facilitate acclimation over ecological timescales. Transgenerational effects may also influence evolution by altering the fitness costs of offspring traits and the expression of genetic variation. We tested the evolutionary role of transgenerational effects in the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, whose populations are exposed to coastal upwelling (periods of low temperature and pH) and exhibit local adaptation, parental effects, and phenotypic plasticity in response to upwelling. Using a quantitative genetic breeding design, we conditioned parents and larvae to upwelling or control conditions and combined RNA-seq with larval phenotyping (body size, biomineralization, survival). Larval upwelling exposure caused widespread differential expression (DE), reduced biomineralization, and reduced size. Survival was linked to biomineralization, body size, and their plasticity under upwelling, but only in offspring of upwelling-conditioned parents - evidence that parental environment affected selection on offspring traits. DE under upwelling was associated with adaptive plasticity in biomineralization and size, but adaptive gene expression changes shared negative genetic correlations. However, genetic correlations in gene expression associated with body size plasticity were significantly more positive in larvae from upwelling parents. Parental conditioning strengthened selection on offspring performance and reduced genetic tradeoffs between performance-associated expression pathways, potentially accelerating adaptation."
"Parkinsons Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterised by the deposition of protein-lipid inclusions, containing alpha-synuclein, neuronal cell loss and disruptions in lipid metabolism such as those associated with GBA mutations. GBA mutations are together an important genetic risk factor for PD and are associated with a decrease in glucocerebrosidase, a lysosomal glycoprotein encoded by GBA, increase in alpha-synuclein and changes in sphingolipids levels and composition. However, the extent of lipid metabolism disruptions associated to PD and their contributions to disease progression remain unclear.

In this study, we used a combination of biochemical and lipidomic analyses of amygdala from healthy controls (HC) and people with sporadic (sPD) or GBA-associated PD (PD-GBA) to investigate the correlation between alpha-synuclein, glucocerebrosidase and lipids.

We found extensive metabolic remodelling of brain lipids, including increased free cholesterol, diacylglycerides, sphingolipids and specific glycerophospholipids in amygdala from people with sPD and disease duration above 30 years (sPD>30y) and from people with PD carriers of a GBA risk mutation (PD-GBArisk) relative to HC. The levels of free cholesterol, diacylglycerides, sphingolipids and specific glycerophospholipids all correlated positively with pathological S and negatively with GCase activity. In contrast, the levels of phosphatidylethanolamine and cardiolipin only correlated positively with GCase activity. Moreover, we observed changes in the distribution of species for sphingolipids and glycerophospholipids in opposite directions for two categories of PD cases. We found a shift from short to long sphingomyelin and ceramide and from long to short phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine in sPD>30y and PD-GBArisk cases and the opposite in sPD<10y and PD-GBAsevere cases. The relative proportion of lipid species affected in these samples all correlated with glucocerebrosidase activity and pathological alpha-synuclein levels.

Together, these findings highlight the correlation between glucocerebrosidase, pathological alpha-synuclein and lipid levels in PD. Moreover, the identified opposite changes in lipid distribution for two categories of people with sPD and PD-GBA underscore the importance of patient stratification in clinical trials aiming at reverting PD-related lipid changes."
"The transition from opening your hand to grasping a coffee cup happens smoothly, yet the neural systems supporting this behavior go through a significant state shift at the onset of grasp. At this moment, the motor system begins to control contact forces and the somatosensory system receives a barrage of cutaneous signals that convey information about contact forces and the objects local features (e.g., edges, texture, and curvature). These cutaneous signals supplement the ongoing flow of proprioceptive input that encodes hand posture. It is unclear whether the neural signals representing object identity persist unchanged through this transition. In the present study, we sought to quantify the object-specific neural signals in the activity of individual neurons of the primary motor cortex (M1) and Brodmann areas 3a, 3b/1, and 2 of the somatosensory cortex in macaque monkeys. We found that, although the firing rates of individual neurons in each area declined rapidly after the object was grasped, this did not reduce the information they carried about the grasped object. On the contrary, it reflected a consolidation of object-specific information within sensorimotor cortex. The exception was proprioceptive area 3a, whose neurons were most informative right before contact and slightly less so after the object was securely held. In contrast, both individual neurons and population activity in cutaneous areas 3b and 1 carried little object-specific information before contact but became highly informative afterward. Population-level analyses further revealed that multimodal area 2, which receives both cutaneous and musculotendinous inputs, does not represent object identity stronger than areas 3b and 1. Although area 2 showed higher activity before contact, this activity lacked task-relevant information, suggesting that uninformative cutaneous inputs may have interfered with informative proprioceptive signals. Following object contact, however, area 2 became highly informative, consistent with its proposed role in haptic object perception. In contrast, only M1 and area 3a carried object-specific information before contact. However, neither region appeared to encode a generalizable object representation, indicating a likely integration of force-related signals with postural information. Together, these findings underscore the profound effects of object contact on the neural representation of object identity in sensorimotor cortex."
"Astrocytes are an abundant class of glial cells with critical roles in neural circuit assembly and function. Though many studies have uncovered significant molecular distinctions between astrocytes from different brain regions, how this regionalization unfolds over development is not fully understood. We used single-nucleus RNA sequencing to characterize the molecular diversity of brain cells across six developmental stages and four brain regions in the mouse and marmoset brain. Our analysis of over 170,000 single astrocyte nuclei revealed striking regional heterogeneity among astrocytes, particularly between telencephalic and diencephalic regions, at all developmental time points surveyed in both species. At the stages sampled, most of the region patterning was private to astrocytes and not shared with neurons or other glial types. Though astrocytes were already regionally patterned in late embryonic stages, this region-specific astrocyte gene expression signature changed dramatically over postnatal development, and its composition suggests that regional astrocytes further specialize postnatally to support their local neuronal circuits. Across mouse and marmoset, we found hundreds of species differentially expressed genes, as well as divergence in the expression of astrocytic region- and age-differentially expressed genes and the timing of astrocyte maturation relative to birth between the species. Finally, we used expansion microscopy to show that astrocyte morphology is also regionally specialized across cortex, striatum, and thalamus in the mouse."
"It is commonly thought that drug addiction involves a transition to habitual control of action, where the choice to consume drugs becomes automatized and reflects a failure to deliberate over possible negative outcomes. Determining whether the pursuit of addictive drugs is habitual is hampered by a lack of behavior assessments suitable for use during a bout of actual drug seeking. Therefore, to understand how variable histories of drug reinforcement might affect goal-directed and habitual pursuit of drug, we trained rats to perform a multi-step decision-making task to earn oral fentanyl and sucrose rewards following extensive pretraining with either fentanyl or sucrose. Importantly, this task allowed for independent measurements of goal-directed and habitual choice characteristics during online pursuit of rewards, and habitual choice could be further categorized into perseverative and reward-guided components. Chronic fentanyl led to a bias for reward-guided habitual choice specifically in females, and a high degree of perseveration in both sexes. These behavioral changes after chronic fentanyl pretraining generalized across fentanyl and sucrose seeking. In contrast, acute fentanyl selectively increased perseveration in females, and blunted the gradual within-session improvement in goal-directed choice in both sexes. These results show that chronic fentanyl reinforcement promotes habits that generalize across drug and non-drug reward seeking, and that female rats are especially susceptible to habitual control induced by both chronic and acute fentanyl reinforcement."
"In developing epithelia, cells become planar polarised through asymmetric localisation of the core planar polarity proteins to opposite cell membranes, where they form stable intercellular complexes. Current models differ regarding the signalling mechanisms required for core protein polarisation. Here, we investigate the existence of cell-intrinsic cell-scale signalling in vivo in the Drosophila pupal wing. We use conditional and restrictive expression tools to spatiotemporally manipulate core protein activity, combined with quantitative measurement of core protein distribution, polarity and stability. Our results provide evidence for a robust cell-scale signal, while arguing against mechanisms that depend on depletion of a limited pool of a core protein or polarised transport of core proteins on microtubules. Furthermore, we show that polarity propagation across a tissue is hard, highlighting the strong intrinsic capacity of individual cells to establish and maintain planar polarity."
"Cerebral malaria is a severe neurovascular complication of Plasmodium falciparum infection, with high mortality rates even after treatment with effective antimalarials. Limitations in current experimental models have hindered our knowledge of the disease. We developed a 3D blood-brain barrier (BBB) model with enhanced barrier properties using primary brain endothelial cells, astrocytes and pericytes. Exposure to parasite egress products increased microvascular permeability, likely due to transcriptional downregulation of junctional and vascular development genes in endothelial cells. In addition, it increased the expression of ferroptosis markers, antigen presentation and type I interferon genes and upregulated the JAK-STAT pathway across all BBB cell types. Incubation with cytoadherent schizont-stage P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes induced a similar, but highly localized transcriptional shift, along with inter-endothelial gaps at sites of parasite egress, significantly increasing permeability. The co-administration of egress products with the JAK-STAT inhibitor Ruxolitinib prevented junctional disruption and BBB breakdown. These findings provide key insights into the parasite-mediated mechanisms driving brain microvascular pathogenesis in cerebral malaria and suggest potential avenues for adjunctive therapies."
"We assessed the reproducibility of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in previously published Alzheimers (AD), Parkinsons (PD), Huntingtons (HD), Schizophrenia (SCZ), and COVID-19 scRNA-seq studies. While transcriptional scores from DEGs of individual PD, HD, and COVID-19 datasets had moderate predictive power for case-control status of other datasets, genes from individual AD and SCZ datasets had poor predictive power. We developed a non-parametric meta-analysis method, SumRank, based on reproducibility of relative differential expression ranks across datasets, and found DEGs with improved predictive power. By multiple metrics, specificity and sensitivity of these genes were substantially higher than those discovered by dataset merging and inverse variance weighted p-value aggregation methods and had significant enrichment in snATAC-seq peaks and human disease gene associations. The DEGs revealed known and novel biological pathways, such as up-regulation of chaperone-mediated protein processing in PD glia and lipid transport in AD and PD microglia, and down-regulation of glutamatergic processes in AD astrocytes and glutamatergic neurons and synaptic processing and neuron projection genes in HD FOXP2 neurons. We find 56 DEGs shared amongst AD, PD, and HD, and validate BCAT1 as down-regulated in AD mouse oligodendrocytes. Lastly, we evaluate factors influencing reproducibility of individual studies as a prospective guide for experimental design."
"Gene perturbation screens (e.g. CRISPR-Cas9) assess the impact of gene disruption on in-vitro cellular phenotypes (e.g., proliferation, anti-viral response, transcriptomics). In-vitro experiments can be useful models for understanding the aetiology of in-vivo (organismal) phenotypes. For example, anti-viral response in immune cells and infectious disease outcomes. However, assessing whether an in-vitro cellular model is effectively capturing in-vivo biology is challenging.

An in-vitro model is  transportable to an in-vivo phenotype of interest if perturbations impacting the in-vitro phenotype also impact the in-vivo phenotype with mechanism-consistent directionality and effect sizes. We propose a framework; Gene Perturbation Analysis for Transportability (GPAT), to assess model transportability using gene perturbation effect estimates from perturbation screens (in-vitro cellular phenotypes) and loss-of-function burden tests (in-vivo phenotypes).

Using UK Biobank whole-genome sequence data and data from published genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screens, we evaluated transportability of in-vitro cellular models to in-vivo human phenotypes. In hypothesis-driven analyses, we found evidence that higher lysosomal cholesterol accumulation in-vitro is a transportable model for lower LDL-cholesterol measured in human blood plasma (P = 0.0006), consistent with the known role of lysosomes in lipid biosynthesis. In contrast, we found limited evidence for other putative in-vitro models. In hypothesis-free analyses, we found strong evidence for transportability of proliferation in cancer cell lines for in-vivo human plasma cellular phenotypes. For example, higher proliferation in an erythroleukemia cell line and lower plasma lymphocyte percentage. GPAT enables systematic evaluation of the transportability of in-vitro cellular models to in-vivo phenotypes, informing assay prioritization and supporting novel hypothesis generation."
"Although gut microbiota and lipid metabolites have been suggested to be closely associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), the interactions between gut microbiota, lipid metabolites and the host in T2DM development remains unclear. Rhesus macaques may be the best animal model to investigate these relationships given their spontaneous development of T2DM. We identified eight spontaneous T2DM macaques and conducted a comprehensive study investigating the relationships using multi-omics sequencing technology. Our results from 16S rRNA, metagenome, metabolome and transcriptome analyses identified that gut microbiota imbalance, tryptophan metabolism and fatty acid {beta} oxidation disorders, long-chain fatty acid (LCFA) accumulation, and inflammation occurred in T2DM macaques. We verified the accumulation of palmitic acid (PA) and activation of inflammation in T2DM macaques. Importantly, mice transplanted with spontaneous T2DM macaque fecal microbiota and fed a high PA diet developed prediabetes within 120 days. We determined that gut microbiota mediated the absorption of excess PA in the ileum, resulting in the accumulation of PA in the serum consequently leading to T2DM in mice. In particular, we demonstrated that the specific microbiota composition was probably involved in the process. This study provides new insight into interactions between microbiota and metabolites and confirms causative effect of gut microbiota on T2DM development."
"An outstanding question in the evolution of gene expression is the composition of the underlying regulatory architecture and the processes that shape it. Mutations affecting a genes expression may reside locally in cis or distally in trans; the accumulation of these changes, their interactions, and their modes of inheritance influence how traits are expressed and how they evolve. Here, we interrogated gene expression variation in C. elegans, including the first allele-specific expression analysis in this system, capturing effects in cis and in trans that govern gene expression differences between the reference strain N2 and seven wild strains. We observed extensive compensatory regulation, in which opposite effects in cis and trans at individual genes mitigate expression differences among strains, and that genes with expression differences exhibit strain specificity. As the genomic distance increased between N2 and each wild strain, the number of genes with expression differences also increased. We also report for the first time that expression-variable genes are lower expressed on average than genes without expression differences, a trend that may extend to humans and Drosophila melanogaster and may reflect the selection constraints that govern the universal anticorrelation between gene expression and rate of protein evolution. Together, these and other observed trends support the conclusion that many C. elegans genes are under stabilizing selection for expression level, but we also highlight outliers that may be biologically significant. To provide community access to our data, we introduce an easily accessible, interactive web application for gene-based queries: https://wildworm.biosci.gatech.edu/ase/.

Author SummaryGenes are first expressed as RNAs, which act as templates in the synthesis of proteins, the workhorse molecules of the cell. Naturally-occurring mutations can influence how RNA expression occurs; to evaluate how RNA expression varies among individuals and how such patterns evolve, the authors measured expression in wild strains of the nematode C. elegans and in offspring derived from crosses between them. This study describes the architecture of RNA expression variation in this essential model organism and reports novel patterns that may extend to insects and humans."
"A major challenge in neuroscience is to elucidate how the brain processes sensory input to generate behavior, especially given the difficulty to measure neural activity across the whole brain. To address this limitation, previous studies have used artificial neural networks (ANNs) and modeled decision-making circuits in the brain. Here, we developed a real-cyber hybrid neural network (HNN) that directly input the activity of real neurons to an ANN, imposing biological constraints on the model. Using spike inputs from cortical or subcortical regions, the HNN predicted body movements of head-fixed mice during a task better than the ANN did. This improvement arose not only from the added mouse neuronal activity, but from the activity generated within the HNN. The generated activity potentially included unrecorded neuronal activity from mice, which was difficult for the ANN. We propose that HNNs develop brain-like activity to predict animal movements and compensate for unrecorded neural activity."
"The Nucleocapsid protein (N) of SARS-CoV-2 plays a critical role in the viral lifecycle by regulating RNA replication and packaging the viral genome. N and RNA phase separate to form condensates that may be important for these functions. Both functions occur at membrane surfaces, but how N toggles between these two membrane-associated functional states is unclear. Here, we reveal that phosphorylation switches how N condensates interact with membranes, partly by modulating condensate material properties. Phosphorylated N forms liquid condensates that wet membranes, reminiscent of Ns role in RNA replication. In contrast, unmodified N forms viscoelastic condensates that can be engulfed by membranes, evoking viral genome packaging. These results suggest that phosphorylation serves as a regulatory switch within the viral replication cycle by modulating Ns association with membranes. We gained mechanistic insight through structural analysis and molecular simulations, which suggest phosphorylation induces a conformational change that softens condensate material properties. Our studies also show that phosphorylation alters Ns interaction with viral membrane proteins. Together, our findings uncover a novel aspect of SARS-CoV-2 biology by identifying membrane association as a key feature of N condensates and providing mechanistic insights into the regulatory role of phosphorylation. Understanding this mechanism suggests potential therapeutic targets for COVID infection."
"Frizzled (FZD) proteins are the principal receptors of the Wnt signaling pathway. However, whether Wnt ligands induce FZD endocytosis and degradation remains elusive. The transmembrane E3 ubiquitin ligases ZNRF3 and RNF43 were reported to promote the endocytosis and degradation of FZD receptors to inhibit Wnt signaling, and their function is antagonized by R-spondin (RSPO) proteins. However, the dependency of RSPO-ZNRF3/RNF43-mediated FZD endocytosis and degradation on Wnt stimulation, as well as the specificity of this degradation for different FZD, remains unclear. Here, we demonstrated that Wnt induces FZD5/8 endocytosis and degradation in a ZNRF3/RNF43-dependent manner. ZNRF3/RNF43 selectively targets FZD5/8 for degradation upon Wnt stimulation. RSPO1 enhances Wnt signaling by specifically stabilizing FZD5/8. Wnt promotes the interaction between FZD5 and RNF43. We further demonstrated that DVL proteins promote ligand-independent endocytosis of FZD but are dispensable for Wnt-induced FZD5/8 endocytosis and degradation. Our results reveal a novel negative regulatory mechanism of Wnt signaling at the receptor level and illuminate the mechanism by which RSPO-ZNRF3/RNF43 regulates Wnt signaling, which may provide new insights into regenerative medicine and cancer therapy."
"Cellular membranes differ across the tree of life. In most bacteria and eukaryotes, single-headed lipids self-assemble into flexible bilayer membranes. By contrast, thermophilic archaea tend to possess bilayer lipids together with double-headed, monolayer spanning bolalipids, which are thought to enable cells to survive in harsh environments. Here, using a minimal computational model for bolalipid membranes, we explore the trade-offs at play when forming membranes. We find that flexible bolalipids form membranes that resemble bilayer membranes because they are able to assume a U-shaped conformation. Conversely, rigid bolalipids, which resemble the bolalipids with cyclic groups found in thermophilic archaea, take on a straight conformation and form membranes that are stiff and prone to pore formation when they undergo changes in shape. Strikingly, however, the inclusion of small amounts of bilayer lipids in a bolalipid membrane is enough to achieve fluid bolalipid membranes that are both stable and flexible - resolving this trade-off. Our study suggests a mechanism by which archaea can tune the material properties of their membranes as and when required to enable them to survive in harsh environments and to undergo essential membrane remodelling events like cell division."
"The central nervous system (CNS) can effectively control body movements despite environmental changes. While much is known about adaptation to external environmental changes, less is known about responses to internal bodily changes. This study investigates how the CNS adapts to long-term alterations in the musculoskeletal system using a tendon transfer model in non-human primates. We surgically relocated finger flexor and extensor muscles to examine how the CNS adapts its strategy for finger movement control by measuring muscle activities during grasping tasks. Two months post-surgery, the monkeys demonstrated significant recovery of grasping function despite the initial disruption. Our findings suggest a two-phase CNS adaptation process: an initial phase enabling function with the transferred muscles, followed by a later phase abolishing this enabled function and restoring a control strategy that, while potentially less conflicted than the maladaptive state, resembled the original pattern, possibly representing a  good enough solution. These results highlight a multi-phase CNS adaptation process with distinct time constants in response to sudden bodily changes, offering potential insights into understanding and treating movement disorders.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTAfter major changes to the bodys mechanics, the nervous system adapts motor control using strategies operating on multiple timescales. Our primate tendon transfer study shows that core muscle synergy groupings remain stable, reflecting modular control principles. However, the activation of these synergies changes substantially, with rapid initial shifts followed by slower adjustments over weeks. This process highlights the fundamental tension the CNS faces in balancing reliance on stable muscle synergies with the need for flexible control to manage new mechanics. Understanding this adaptive process offers insights into neural plasticity and informs potential rehabilitation strategies."
"PurposeReducing strains within the tibia and fibula during running may reduce the risk of stress fractures. We examined the effect of reduced flight time during running (i.e., grounded running) on finite-element predicted bone strains within the tibia-fibula complex.

MethodsNine physically active males ran on an instrumented treadmill at 2.2 m/s using a preferred and reduced flight time technique in a randomized order. Three-dimensional force and motion capture data were recorded during running and a computed tomography image was subsequently acquired for the participants left leg. An inverse-dynamics-based musculoskeletal modeling workflow was used to calculate bone-on-bone contact and muscle forces during the stance phase of running. These forces served as inputs to a participant-specific finite-element model to estimate peak bone strains and strained volume (i.e., the volume of bone experiencing strains above a specific threshold) within the tibia-fibula complex.

ResultsGuided attempts to reduce flight time was successful with an 18 ms (95% CI: 12 ms, 25 ms; p<0.001) reduction in flight time. Reducing flight time was associated with significant reductions in peak tibial/fibular strains (17% lower; 95% CI: -7.1%, -25.0%; p=0.002) and strained volume (35% lower; 95% CI: -13.57%, -50.87%; p=0.007).

ConclusionWe conclude that guided attempts to reduce flight time significantly reduces strains in the tibia and fibula during treadmill running at a fixed speed. These results suggest that grounded running may be a viable technique to reduce musculoskeletal loading and stress fracture risk, particularly in slow runners and those runners coming back from injury."
"Unilateral spatial neglect (USN) is a common consequence of right-hemisphere stroke, traditionally attributed to structural lesions and dysfunctional attention networks. However, the brain is fundamentally a rhythmic and dynamical system, and how disrupted neural synchronization underlies USN remains unknown. We recorded steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs; 3 - 30 Hz flicker) in stroke patients with USN, without USN, and healthy controls. Only the USN group exhibited significant hemispheric asymmetry at 9 Hz, driven by exaggerated responses in the intact hemisphere rather than suppression in the lesioned hemisphere. This effect appeared only during stimulation, not at rest, indicating its specificity to sensory processing. The enhanced 9 Hz entrainment in the intact hemisphere was accompanied by increased phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) between alpha phase and gamma amplitude, reflecting systematic coordination of high-frequency activity. Transfer entropy analysis further revealed increased feedforward information flow from the right visual to the left frontal cortex, highlighting large-scale asymmetry. To explore the mechanism underlying this frequency-specific bias, we implemented a coupled-oscillator model. The model showed that the hemispheric asymmetry arises from resonance between intrinsic alpha rhythms and external input, amplified by asymmetric right-to-left interhemispheric coupling. These findings suggest that USN arises from a selective impairment of alpha-band synchrony capacity. This study offers a novel framework conceptualizing USN as a disorder of disrupted oscillatory dynamics underlying spatial attention, and points toward frequency-specific neuromodulatory intervention as a potential therapeutic approach.

Significant statementThe brain behaves as a metronome-like oscillator ensemble. When a rhythmic flicker--a cortical ""tuning fork"" matching the visual systems intrinsic alpha frequency--is applied, it serves as a probe that visualizes the brains internal state. Under normal conditions, neuronal oscillations in both hemispheres are moderately entrained at this frequency. In unilateral spatial neglect (USN), this resonance displays a distinctive asymmetry: the intact hemisphere becomes over-amplified, whereas the lesioned hemisphere shows no enhancement. A coupled-oscillator model shows that asymmetric interhemispheric coupling selectively boosts this intrinsic alpha resonance unilaterally. This biased resonance reflects a destabilization of dynamic coordination of attention networks, offering a novel mechanistic view of spatial neglect in USN and pointing toward frequency-specific neuromodulation as a promising therapeutic strategy."
"Genetic interactions are fundamental to the architecture of complex traits, yet the molecular mechanisms by which variant combinations influence cellular pathways remain poorly understood. Here, we answer the question of whether interactions between genetic variants can activate unique pathways and if such pathways can be targeted to modulate phenotypic outcomes. The model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae was used to dissect how two causal single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), MKT189G and TAO34477C, interact to modulate metabolic and phenotypic outcomes during sporulation. By integrating time-resolved transcriptomics, absolute proteomics, and targeted metabolomics in isogenic allele replacement yeast strains, we show that the combined presence of these SNPs uniquely activates the arginine biosynthesis pathway and suppresses ribosome biogenesis, reflecting a metabolic trade-off that enhances sporulation efficiency. Functional validation demonstrates that the arginine pathway is essential for mitochondrial activity and efficient sporulation only in the double-SNP background. Our findings reveal how genetic variant interactions can rewire core metabolic networks, providing a mechanistic framework for understanding polygenic trait regulation and the emergence of additive effects in complex traits."
"Disordered proteins and domains often assemble into condensates with polyanionic nucleic acids, primarily via charge complementarity, regulating numerous cellular functions. However, the assembly mechanisms associated with the other abundant and ubiquitous, anionic, stress-response regulating polymer, polyphosphate (polyP), is less understood. Here, we employ the intrinsically disordered DNA binding domain (DBD) of cytidine repressor (CytR) from E.coli to study the nature of assembly processes with polyP and DNA. CytR forms metastable liquid-like condensates with polyP and DNA, while undergoing liquid-to-solid transition in the former and dissolving in the latter. On mutationally engineering the ensemble to exhibit more or less structure and dimensions than the WT, the assembly process with polyP is directed to either condensates with partial time-dependent dissolution or spontaneous aggregation, respectively. On the other hand, the CytR variants form only liquid-like but metastable droplets with DNA which dissolve within a few hours. Polyphosphate induces large secondary-structure changes, with two of the mutants adopting polyproline II-like structures within droplets, while DNA has only minimal structural effects. Our findings reveal how polyphosphate can more efficiently discern conformational heterogeneity in the starting protein ensemble, its structure, and compactness, with broad implications in assembly mechanisms involving polyP and stress response in bacterial systems."
"How learning generalizes across contexts is a fundamental question in neuroscience, with broad implications for adaptive behavior and cognition. The hippocampus (HPC) plays a key role in contextual learning, but HPC cells exhibit place-specific activity that reorganizes, or  remaps across environments, raising the question of how stable, task-relevant representations can be preserved. Here, we used calcium imaging to monitor hippocampal neuron activity as rats performed a conditioning task across multiple spatial contexts. We asked whether hippocampal neurons, which encode both spatial locations and task-relevant features, could maintain stable representations of the task despite remapping of spatial codes. To assess representational consistency, we applied dimensionality reduction and machine learning to construct manifold embeddings of population-level HPC activity. We found that task-related neural representations remained stable across different environments, even as spatial representations shifted. Moreover, these representations exhibited similar geometric structure not only across contexts within individual animals, but also across different animals, suggesting the presence of a shared neural syntax for associative learning in the hippocampus. These findings bridge a critical gap between memory and navigation research, revealing how stable cognitive representations emerge from dynamic spatial codes. They provide new insight into conserved hippocampal encoding strategies, with potential relevance for understanding flexible memory, learning, and their disruption in neuropsychiatric disorders."
"Aging is a pan-metazoan process with significant consequences for human health and society--discovery of new compounds that ameliorate the negative health impacts of aging promise to be of tremendous benefit across a number of age-based comorbidities. One method to prioritize a testable subset of the nearly infinite universe of potential compounds is to use computational prediction of their likely anti-aging capacity. Here we present a survey of longevity effects for 16 compounds suggested by a previously published computational prediction set, capitalizing upon the comprehensive, multi-species approach utilized by the Caenorhabditis Intervention Testing Program (CITP). While eleven compounds (aldosterone, arecoline, bortezomib, dasatinib, decitabine, dexamethasone, erlotinib, everolimus, gefitinib, temsirolimus, and thalidomide) either had no effect on median lifespan or were toxic, five compounds (all-trans retinoic acid, berberine, fisetin, propranolol, and ritonavir) extended lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans. These computer predictions yield a remarkable positive hit rate of 30%. Deeper genetic characterization of the longevity effects of one of the most efficacious compounds, the endogenous signaling ligand all-trans retinoic acid (atRA, designated tretinoin in medical products), which is widely prescribed for treatment of acne, skin photoaging and acute promyelocytic leukemia, demonstrated a requirement for the regulatory kinases AKT-1 and AKT-2. While the canonical Akt-target FOXO/DAF-16 was largely dispensable, other conserved Akt-targets (Nrf2/SKN-1 and HSF1/HSF-1), as well as the conserved catalytic subunit of AMPK AAK-2, were all necessary for longevity extension by atRA. Evolutionary conservation of retinoic acid as a signaling ligand and the structure of the downstream effector network of retinoic acid combine to suggest that the all-trans retinoic acid pathway is an ancient metabolic regulatory system that can modulate lifespan. Our results highlight the potential of combining computational prediction of longevity interventions with the power of nematode functional genetics and underscore that the manipulation of a conserved metabolic regulatory circuit by co-opting endogenous signaling molecules is a powerful approach for discovering aging interventions."
"Theoretical accounts postulate that the catecholaminergic neuromodulator noradrenaline shapes cognition and behavior by reducing the impact of prior expectations on learning, inference, and decision-making. A ubiquitous effect of dynamic priors on perceptual decisions under uncertainty is choice history bias: the tendency to systematically repeat, or alternate, previous choices, even when stimulus categories are presented in a random sequence. Here, we directly test for a causal impact of catecholamines on these priors. We pharmacologically elevated catecholamine levels through the application of the noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor atomoxetine. We quantified the resulting changes in observers history biases in a visual perceptual decision task. Choice history biases in this task were highly idiosyncratic, tending toward choice repetition or alternation in different individuals. Atomoxetine decreased these biases (toward either repetition or alternation) compared to placebo. Behavioral modeling indicates that this bias reduction was due to a reduced bias in the accumulation of sensory evidence, rather than of the starting point of the accumulation process. Atomoxetine had no significant effect on other behavioral measures tested, including response time and choice accuracy. Atomoxetine and variations of pupil-linked arousal at slower and faster timescales had analogous effects on choice history bias. We conclude that catecholamines reduce the impact of a specific form of prior on perceptual decisions."
"Proteins are the principal architects of life, fueling advances in bioengineering, drug discovery, and synthetic biology. The integration of generative AI with computational protein science has revolutionized protein design while also posing dual-use risks, such as enabling the creation of pandemic-capable proteins that require strong biosecurity safeguards. Here, we introduce FoldMark, a first-of-its-kind watermarking strategy leveraging distributional and evolutionary principles tailored for protein generative models, balancing watermark capacity and structural quality. FoldMark achieves over 95% watermark bit accuracy at 32 bits with minimal impact on structural quality (>0.9 scTM scores) for leading models including AlphaFold3, ESMFold, RFDiffusion, and RFDiffusionAA. For user tracing, FoldMark can successfully trace up to 1 million users. To validate FoldMark in wet lab, we applied it to structure-based design of EGFP and CRISPR-Cas13, showing wildtype-level function (98% fluorescence, 95% editing efficiency) and >90% watermark detection, demonstrating its practical utility for safeguarding AI-driven protein research."

"ContextThe Southwest Australia Floristic Region (SWAFR) is a global hotspot for plant taxonomic and functional diversity with 450 highly specialised orchids facing threats from habitat loss, grazing, weeds, fire and climate change.

AimsTo develop fire history maps and effective monitoring tools to compare fire ecology of orchids with diverse ecological traits from an isolated urban banksia and eucalypt woodland.

MethodsA 72-year fire history map was intersected with >1000 orchid locations and 4.5 km of transects to measure effects on abundance and diversity. Orchid survival, size, flowering, pollination and germination were measured post-fire relative to areas unburnt for >22 years.

Key resultsThere were 58 overlapping major fires (1972-2024), averaging 8.7% of the 63-ha area annually. Correlating locations of 17 orchids with fire history revealed 5 fire-intolerant and 6 less productive species, while 6 benefited from fire-promoted flowering. Even the latter could be killed by unseasonal autumn fire. Fire decreased or increased pollination, with three orchids dependant on fire. Overall, fire impacts greatly out way benefits, as most orchids preferred long-unburnt areas, with maximum diversity and abundance three decades or more post-fire. Paradoxically, Pyrorchis nigricans required fire to flower, but only thrived in long-unburnt areas.

ConclusionsOrchids had diverse fire outcomes from catastrophic to beneficial summarised by fire response indexes (FRI) and fire age safe thresholds (FAST). This continuum was correlated with tuber depth, clonality, dispersion and lifespans of orchids, so is deeply integrated with their biology and ecology.

ImplicationsResearch in an urban nature reserve provided essential tools for sustainable management of orchids relevant to rare species, such as fire history maps, FRI and FAST. Many SWAFR orchids prefer long unburnt areas, are intolerant to fire, or can be harmed by aseasonal fires. Thus, fire must be carefully managed in their habitats.

"Sleep is an evolutionarily ancient and nearly universal behavior throughout the animal kingdom. Multiple cave-dwelling populations of the Mexican tetra, Astyanax mexicanus, have converged on sleep loss compared to river-dwelling surface fish. However, sleep has not been assessed in the vast majority of the 34 known A. mexicanus cave populations. Moreover, whether cavefish sleep less than surface individuals in their natural habitats is currently unknown. Analyzing the distribution of sleep loss and its relationship with other regressive traits in a phylogenetic framework is critical to inform the selective pressures across the different lineages. We measured sleep and locomotor activity in 15 distinct populations of A. mexicanus, including lineages that are broadly representative of the 34 cavefish populations identified to date. Sleep was drastically reduced in all cave and hybrid populations that were tested. A subset of caves contain hybrid populations of A. mexicanus, which show a broad range of eye and pigmentation phenotypes, yet have evolved near-complete loss of sleep. Mapping behavioral changes onto the phylogeny of A. mexicanus populations revealed that loss of sleep and elevated locomotor activity have evolved at least three times. Analysis of sleep in the wild confirms that the sleep loss phenotype observed in lab-reared fish is also present in the natural environment. Together, these findings reveal deep evolutionary convergence on sleep loss in cavefish and provide evidence for sleep loss as a primary trait contributing to cave adaptation."
"From atomic spins in magnets to galaxies, and from embryonic development to patchy vegetation in arid environments, the physical world is filled with complex systems that spontaneously form spatial patterns. While simple mathematical models, such as reaction-diffusion systems, can explain the formation of such patterns, the complexity of the physical systems these models aim to describe necessitates the analysis of model robustness. Our work utilizes random matrix theory to provide arguably the first definition of robustness that is analytically tractable, providing an easy guide for identifying spatial interactions that robustly generate spatial patterns. We illustrate our theory on examples from mathematical biology, showing that diffusion alone cannot robustly generate spatial Turing patterns in large and unstructured systems, while advection, chemotaxis and non-local interactions can robustly promote pattern formation. Furthermore, we use our theory to prove that the spinodal decompositon of soft condensed matter is dynamically robust and predict the dynamics beyond regimes permitted by the standard Landau-Ginzburg theory. By classifying different spatial interactions based on the robustness of pattern formation, this work provides insights into which mechanisms are fundamental for pattern formation in large and unstructured physical systems."
"The Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) is a foundational resource for allele frequency data, widely used in genomic research and clinical interpretation. However, traditional estimates rely on individual-level genetic ancestry groupings that may obscure variation in recently admixed populations. To improve resolution, we applied local ancestry inference (LAI) to over 27 million variants in two admixed groups: Admixed American (n = 7,612) and African/African American (n = 20,250), deriving ancestry-specific allele frequencies. We show that 78.5% and 85.1% of variants in these groups, respectively, exhibit at least a twofold difference in ancestry-specific frequencies. Moreover, 81.49% of variants with LAI information would be assigned a higher gnomAD-wide maximum frequency after incorporating LAI, potentially altering clinical interpretations. This LAI-informed release reveals clinically relevant frequency differences that are masked in aggregate estimates and may support reclassifying some variants from Uncertain Significance to Benign or Likely Benign."
"The inferior colliculus (IC) is a central hub in the ascending auditory brainstem. It hosts many neurons tuned to interaural time differences (ITDs). ITD tuning, however, is already observed and generated one synapse upstream in the superior olivary complex and the physiological mechanisms as well as the functional purpose of the IC projection remain partially unresolved. Here, we argue that combining ITD sensitive inputs from medial superior olive (MSO) and lateral superior olive (LSO) requires a temporally well adjusted delay of cross-hemispheric fibers from LSO to IC, given the fast synaptic kinetics of IC neurons. We present a normative model of the midbrain auditory circuitry that finds an optimal cross-hemispheric delay of 0.3 cycles and optimal synaptic strengths by maximizing the firing rate of IC neurons for a stimulus at a given ITD. The model suggests that, by varying the relative synaptic weight of MSO and LSO input, individual neurons are optimized to transmit information of all sound sources in a complex auditory scene. ITD tuning of IC neurons would then results as a side effect. The model focuses on the low-frequency range, is consistent with the distribution of best ITDs observed in experimental recordings and performs close to optimal in sound source reconstruction.

Author SummaryNatural acoustic scenes consist of many spatially distributed and concurrently active sound sources. We show how such concurrent sounds can be optimally reconstructed solely using information about interaural arrival time differences. We argue that this optimal solution is almost matched by a neural circuit model inspired by the ascending auditory pathway. The model is computationally very efficient because changing only one synaptic weight moves the azimuthal focus of a midbrain neuron. The model predicts a universal phase delay of cross-hemispheric delay lines in the ascending auditory brainstem."
"The decimation of reefs caused by stony coral tissue loss disease prompted the use of a topical amoxicillin treatment to prevent coral mortality. Application of this treatment led to concerns about unintentional impacts such as potential alteration of the coral microbiome and possible spread of antibiotic resistance. We used two different methodologies - microbial RNA sequencing and microbial qPCR array - to assess these concerns and to establish a baseline of antimicrobial resistance genes in coral microbes. RNA sequencing was conducted on coral mucus samples collected before and 24 hours after amoxicillin application on wild Montastraea cavernosa. While diverse antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) were expressed, no differences were detected in ARG expression after amoxicillin treatment. Additionally, there were no notable changes in the microbial communities between the before and after samples. Microbial qPCR array was used to assess differences in ARGs over longer timescales in wild Colpophyllia natans, comparing never-treated corals with ones treated a single time seven months prior and with those treated multiple times seven months and more prior. No clinically relevant ARGs represented in the arrays were detected across any samples. A small number of above-detection reads (4 in the never-treated corals, 2 in the once-treated corals, and 0 in the multi-treated corals) may indicate weak amplification of similar environmental (non-anthropogenic) ARGs in the corals. Results indicate that the localized topical application of amoxicillin to prevent mortality of SCTLD-affected corals is neither immediately disrupting the microbiome of treated corals at the colony level nor driving the development of ARGs over immediate or longer-term time scales."
"The cerebellum plays important roles in motor, cognitive, and emotional behaviors. Previous cerebellar coordinate-based meta-analyses (CBMAs) have complemented precision-mapping and parcellation approaches by finding generalizable cerebellar activations across the largest possible set of behaviors. However, cerebellar CBMAs face challenges due to inherent methodological limitations exacerbated by historical cerebellar neglect in neuroimaging. Here, we show overrepresentation of superior activations, rendering the null hypothesis of standard activation likelihood estimation (ALE) unsuitable. Our new method, cerebellum-specific ALE (C-SALE), finds behavioral convergence beyond baseline activation rates. It does this by testing experimental activations versus null models sampled from a data-driven probability distribution of finding activations at any cerebellar location. Task-specific mappings in the BrainMap meta-analytic database illustrated improved specificity of the new method. Multiple (sub)domains reached convergence in specific cerebellar subregions, supporting dual motor representations and placing cognition in posterior-lateral regions. We show our method and findings were replicable within NeuroSynth. Across both databases, 54/138 task domains or behavioral terms, including sustained attention, somesthesis, inference, anticipation and rhythm, reached convergence in specific cerebellar subgregions. Maps largely corresponded with cerebellar atlases but also showed many complementary mappings. Repeated subsampling showed that motor behaviors, and to a lesser extent language and working memory, mapped to especially consistent cerebellar subregions. Lastly, we found that cerebellar clusters were parts of brain-wide coactivation networks with cortical and subcortical regions implied in these behaviors. Together, our method further complements and expands understanding of cerebellar involvement in human behavior, highlighting regions for future investigation in both basic and clinical applications.

"Evolution is a highly intricate process marked by the generation of novelty, which requires the historical and collective organization of individuals. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between biological organization and Open-Ended Evolution (OEE), with a particular focus on the causal connection between the two. To quantitatively investigate the causal relation within a chemical system, we utilize assembly theory to assess the influence of auto-catalytic sets on the complexity dynamics of Kauffman model. In the second part of the paper, we strengthen this conjecture by analyzing the effects of the simplest auto-catalytic set on the complexity dynamics in Kauffman model, specifically in the absence of parametric correlation. By interpreting auto-catalytic sets as organizational structures in chemical systems, our findings provide the first numerical support for investigating the causal relationship between biological organization and OEE. This work represents a promising area for the initial study of the dynamical relationship between OEE and biological organization, and may advance the understanding of their connection in theoretical biology."
"Several reports have indicated that impaired mitochondrial function contributes to the development and progression of Huntingtons disease (HD). Mitochondrial genome damage, particularly DNA strand breaks (SBs), is a potential cause for its compromised functionality. We have recently demonstrated that the activity of polynucleotide kinase 3-phosphatase (PNKP), a critical DNA end-processing enzyme, is significantly decreased in the nuclear extract of HD patients brain due to lower level of a metabolite, fructose-2,6 bisphosphate (F2,6BP), a biosynthetic product of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3), leading to persistent DNA SBs with 3-phosphate termini, refractory to subsequent steps for repair completion. PNKP also plays a pivotal role in maintaining mitochondrial genome integrity. In this report, we provide evidence that both PFKFB3 and F2,6BP, an allosteric modulator of glycolysis, are also present in the mitochondria and PFKFB3 is part of a mitochondrial DNA repair complex containing HTT, PNKP, DNA polymerase Gamma and Lig 3. PNKP binds F2,6BP (Kd= 525 nM) and utilizes it as a cofactor. Notably, the levels of both F2,6BP and PFKFB3 are significantly decreased in the mitochondrial extract of HD patients brain. PNKP activity is thus severely decreased in the mitochondrial extract; however, addition of F2,6BP restored PNKP activity. Moreover, supplementation of F2,6BP in HD mouse striatal neuronal cells restored PFKFB3 level, mitochondrial genome integrity and partially restored mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial respiration and prevented pathogenic aggregate formation. We also observed that supplementation with F2,6BP restored mitochondrial genome integrity in HD drosophila model. Our findings, therefore, suggest that F2,6BP-mediated restoration of PNKP activity will have a profound impact in ameliorating neurodegenerative symptoms in HD."
"Trimethylation of histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3) is mark of active transcription and its regulatory role in RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription has been well-studied. However, if and how this mark regulates RNA polymerase I (RNA Pol I) is not known. Here we used customized genome assemblies for rDNA to demonstrate that KMT2A and KMT2F bind to entire rDNA loci. The binding of these enzymes were mirrored by the binding of H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 marks. Using biochemical assays, we demonstrate the interaction of KMT2- specific subunits with RNA Pol I transcriptional machinery. Our findings reveal KMT2F as the primary KMT depositing the H3K4me3 on rDNA. Loss of H3K4me3 adversely affects the epigenetic landscape and promotes heterochromatization of rDNA locus. Mechanistically, we show that KMT2F promotes pre-initiation complex formation of RNA Pol I. Our findings highlights the thus far undiscovered role of H3K4me3 in the transcriptional initiation of rDNA genes."
"Advancements in imaging and molecular techniques enable the collection of subcellular-scale data. Diversity in measured features, resolution, and physical scope of capture across technologies and experimental protocols pose numerous challenges to integrating data with reference coordinate systems and across scales. This paper describes a collection of technologies that we have developed for mapping data across scales and modalities, such as genes to tissues, specifically in a 3D setting. Our collection of technologies include (i) an explicit censored data representation for the partial matching problem mapping whole brains to subsampled subvolumes, (ii) a multi, scale-space optimization technology for generating resampling grids optimized to represent spatial geometry at fixed complexities, and (iii) mutual-information based functional feature selection. We integrate these technologies with our cross-modality mapping algorithm through the use of image-varifold measure norms to represent universally data across scales and imaging modalities. Collectively, these methods afford efficient representations of peta-scale imagery providing the algorithms for mapping from the nano to millimeter scales, which we term cross-modality image-varifold LDDMM (xIV-LDDMM)."
"The ability to sense and adapt to adverse food conditions is essential for survival across species, but the detailed mechanisms of neuron-digestive crosstalk in food sensing and adaptation remain poorly understood. This study identifies a novel mechanism by which animals detect unfavorable food sources through neurons and initiate a systemic response to shut down digestion, thus safeguarding against potential harm. Specifically, we demonstrate that NSY-1, expressed in AWC neurons, detects Staphylococcus saprophyticus (SS) as an unfavorable food source, prompting the animal to avoid and halt digestion of SS. Upon detection, the animals activate the AWCOFF neural circuit, leading to a systemic digestive shutdown, which is mediated by NSY-1-dependent STR-130. Additionally, NSY-1 mutation triggers the production of insulin peptides, including INS-23, which interact with the DAF-2 receptor to modulate SS digestion and affects the expression of intestinal BCF-1. These findings uncover a crucial survival strategy through neuron-digestive crosstalk, where the NSY-1 pathway in AWC neurons orchestrates food evaluation and initiates digestive shutdown to adapt effectively to harmful food sources."
"Insects rely on plants visual, chemical, tactile, and electrical cues when making various decisions. A recent study demonstrated that dehydrated plants emit ultrasonic sounds within the auditory sensitivity range of many moth species. In this study, we sought to determine whether insects also rely on plant acoustic signals when making decisions. We investigated whether female moths rely on ultrasonic clicks which are typically produced by dehydrated plants when deciding where to oviposit. In the absence of an actual plant, the moths indeed preferred to lay their eggs in proximity to acoustic signals which represent dehydrating plants. Tracking the moths behavior prior to the decision showed that they examined both sides of the arena and gradually spent more time on the acoustic-playback side. Interestingly, when actual plants were added to the arena, the oviposition preference was reversed and the moths preferred silent plants, which is in accordance with their a-priori preference for hydrated plants. Deafening the moths eliminated their preference, confirming that the choice was based on hearing. Moreover, the presence of male moths including their auditory signals did not affect their oviposition decision, suggesting that the response was specific to plant sound emissions. We reveal evidence for a first acoustic interaction between moths and plants, but as plants emit various sounds, our findings hint to the existence of more currently unknown insect-plant acoustic interactions."
"Genome analyses reveal that gene duplication in eukaryotes is pervasive, providing a primary source for the emergence of new genes. However, the mechanisms dictating early duplicate retention and the emergence of functional biases--such as the enrichment of tandem duplicates in environmental responses--remain unclear. Here, to better understand the mechanisms and factors determining gene retention, we study a frequently overlooked molecular feature--expression variability--as measured by within-line expression variation, termed variability. We demonstrate that, on average, genes with duplicates exhibit higher expression variability than singletons. Furthermore, small-scale duplications (SSDs) and whole-genome duplications (WGDs) display contrasting functional outcomes and time-dependent profiles in expression variability. These findings suggest a potential overarching mechanism that facilitates gene expression divergence, functional gains of environmental responses, and duplicate retention following SSDs."
"Decisions in humans and other organisms depend, in part, on learning and using models that capture the statistical structure of the world, including the long-run expected outcomes of our actions. One prominent approach to forecasting such long-run outcomes is the successor representation (SR), which predicts future states aggregated over multiple timesteps. Although much behavioral and neural evidence suggests that people and animals use such a representation, it remains unknown how they acquire it. It has frequently been assumed to be learned by temporal difference bootstrapping (SR-TD(0)), but this assumption has largely not been empirically tested or compared to alternatives including eligibility traces (SR-TD({lambda} > 0)). Here we address this gap by leveraging trial-by-trial reaction times in graph sequence learning tasks, which are favorable for studying learning dynamics because the long horizons in these studies differentiate the transient update dynamics of different learning rules. We examined the behavior of SR-TD({lambda}) on a probabilistic graph learning task alongside a number of alternatives, and found that behavior was best explained by a hybrid model which learned via SR-TD({lambda}) alongside an additional predictive model of recency. The relatively large{lambda} we estimate indicates a predominant role of eligibility trace mechanisms over the bootstrap-based chaining typically assumed. Our results provide insight into how humans learn predictive representations, and demonstrate that people simultaneously learn the SR alongside lower-order predictions."
"The rise of anthelmintic-resistant strains in livestock threatens both animal and human health. Understanding the factors influencing anthelmintic resistance is crucial to mitigate the threat posed by these parasites. Due to difficulties in studying parasitic worms in the laboratory, the non-parasitic nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is used as a model organism to investigate anthelmintic resistance evolution. However, the suitability of this free-living nematode as a model for parasitic worms is debatable due to its rare androdioecious reproductive system, raising questions about the generalizability of findings from evolutionary experiments in C. elegans to other species. In this study, we developed a polygenic, population genetic model combined with pharmacodynamic approaches to investigate the effects of reproductive strategy and other aspects, such as dominance, mutational effects, the number of loci, and population size, on determining the dynamics and outcome of evolutionary processes. We found that androdioecious populations showed both rapid initial adaptation typical for hermaphrodites and tolerance to high drug concentrations observed in dioecious populations. They also exhibited the highest diversity and shortest time for the fixation of the beneficial allele. These results suggest that androdioecious populations can harness the advantages of both selfing and outcrossing, optimizing their reproductive strategy in response to drug selection."
"Mutations in the COL2A1 gene, encoding procollagen-II, cause various chondrodysplasias, including precocious osteoarthritis with mild spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia engendered by the p.Arg719Cys substitution. The molecular mechanisms underlying these disorders remain incompletely understood, largely owing to the absence of models faithfully recapitulating the human disease. Here, we developed an in vitro human cartilage model using isogenic induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines carrying either wild-type or Arg719Cys COL2A1. Directed differentiation into chondrocytes yielded cartilage tissues that were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, SDS-PAGE, and RNA-sequencing. Tissues derived from Arg719Cys heterozygotes displayed a deficient matrix, closely reflecting the human disease phenotype. Arg719Cys procollagen-II was excessively post-translationally modified and partially retained within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), leading to ER distention. Notably, despite introduction of an aberrant cysteine residue--expected to engage redox-sensitive folding and quality control pathways--Arg719Cys procollagen-II was not detectably recognized by the ER proteostasis network. The resulting inability to mount a quality control response, including activation of the unfolded protein response, indicates a failure in cellular surveillance. As a result, malformed procollagen-II both accumulates intracellularly and is secreted, contributing to the deposition of a structurally compromised extracellular matrix that drives disease pathology. The iPSC-derived cartilage model presented here provides a genetically defined and expandable, human-based system for dissecting the mechanisms of failed proteostasis in collagenopathies. These findings shed light on the types of substitutions in procollagen that cells can or cannot recognize, and underscore the therapeutic potential of targeting cellular surveillance and collagen quality control pathways in COL2A1-related disorders and beyond.

SIGNIFICANCEThe p.Arg719Cys substitution in COL2A1 is known to cause dominantly inherited precocious osteoarthritis with mild spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, but its molecular pathogenesis remains poorly understood. Prior work suggests disrupted fibrillogenesis as the molecular etiology, yet phenotypically relevant human models are lacking. Here, we use human iPSC-derived cartilage to uncover how the Arg719Cys substitution alters procollagen-II folding, modification, trafficking, and matrix deposition. We observe hallmark disease phenotypes, including a sparse collagen-II matrix and distended endoplasmic reticulum (ER), consistent with intracellular accumulation of procollagen-II. Surprisingly, the mutant procollagen-II does not appear to be differentially engaged by the ER proteostasis network, despite the incorporation of an aberrant and apparently non-disulfide bond-forming Cys residue, suggesting a fundamental failure of cellular surveillance. This unrecognized misfolding leads to secretion of defective collagen culminating in matrix dysfunction. These findings establish a mechanistic basis for disease etiology and highlight collagen quality control as a potentially tractable therapeutic target. The iPSC-based model provides a scalable, human-relevant platform for dissecting disease mechanisms and developing therapies for COL2A1-related disorders and other collagenopathies."
"Genetic diversity is central to the process of evolution. Both natural selection and random genetic drift are influenced by the level of genetic diversity of a population, since selection acts on diversity while drift samples from it. At a given locus in a diploid population, each individual carries only two alleles, but the population as a whole can possess a much larger number of alleles, with the upper limit constrained by twice the population size. This allows for many possible types of homozygotes and heterozygotes. Moreover, there are clinically significant loci, such as those related to the MHC complex, the ABO blood types, and cystic fibrosis, that exhibit a large number of alleles. Despite this, much of population genetic theory, and data analysis, are limited to biallelic loci, and up to now there is no flexible expression for the force of selection which applies for arbitrary numbers of alleles (and thus any number of heterozygotes), and which accommodates diverse fitness regimes. Here, we derive an expression, for the force of selection, which explicitly separates the effects of genetic diversity from the effects of fitness of different genotypes. The result presented facilitates our understanding and analysis of selection, and applies in a variety of different situations involving multiple alleles. This includes situations where fitnesses are additive, multiplicative, randomly fluctuating, frequency-dependent, and can involve explicit gene interactions, such as heterozygote advantage. We show how our results can be used to estimate fitness effects from allele frequency trajectories and employ such an approach on existing data in the literature on experimental yeast evolution. We uncover evidence of wide-spread heterozygote advantage across the yeast genome.

Article SummaryGenetic diversity is a cornerstone of evolutionary processes, influencing both natural selection and genetic drift. While many biologically significant loci, like those associated with the MHC complex, ABO blood types, and cystic fibrosis, contain a large number of alleles, population genetics often simplifies analyses to biallelic loci. This study provides a new, flexible framework that quantifies the force of selection in populations with an arbitrary number of alleles. This approach broadens our understanding of complex genetic scenarios, including those involving additive, multiplicative, and frequency-dependent fitnesses, as well as heterozygote advantage. This advance enables more nuanced modeling of real-world evolutionary dynamics across diverse biological contexts, and is the basis for estimating fitness effects from empirical allele frequency trajectories."
"Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are essential for mammalian health and function as membrane fluidizers and precursors for signaling lipids though the primary essential function of PUFAs within organisms has not been established. Unlike mammals who cannot endogenously synthesize PUFAs, C. elegans can de novo synthesize PUFAs starting with the {Delta}12 desaturase FAT-2 which introduces a second double bond to monounsaturated fatty acids to generate the PUFA linoleic acid. FAT-2 desaturation is essential for C. elegans survival since fat-2 null mutants are non-viable; the near-null fat-2(wa17) allele synthesizes only small amounts of PUFAs and produces extremely sick worms. Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), we found that the fat-2(wa17) mutant has rigid membranes and can be efficiently rescued by dietarily providing various PUFAs, but not by fluidizing treatments or mutations. With the aim of identifying mechanisms that compensate for PUFA-deficiency, we performed a forward genetics screen to isolate novel fat-2(wa17) suppressors and identified four internal mutations within fat-2, and six mutations within the HIF-1 pathway. The suppressors increase PUFA levels in fat-2(wa17) mutant worms and additionally suppress the activation of the daf-16, UPRer and UPRmt stress response pathways that are active in fat-2(wa17) worms. We hypothesize that the six HIF-1 pathway mutations, found in egl-9, ftn-2, and hif-1 all converge on raising Fe2+ levels and in this way boost desaturase activity, including that of the fat-2(wa17) allele. We conclude that PUFAs cannot be genetically replaced and that the only genetic mechanism that can alleviate PUFA-deficiency do so by increasing PUFA levels."
"In a multicellular organism, cell lineages share a common evolutionary history. Knowing this history can facilitate the study of development, aging, and cancer. Cell lineage trees represent the evolutionary history of cells sampled from an organism. Recent developments in single-cell sequencing have greatly facilitated the inference of cell lineage trees. However, single-cell data are sparse and noisy, and the size of single-cell data is increasing rapidly. Accurate inference of cell lineage tree from large single-cell data is computationally challenging. In this paper, we present ScisTree2, a fast and accurate cell lineage tree inference and genotype calling approach based on the infinite-sites model. ScisTree2 relies on an efficient local search approach to find optimal trees. ScisTree2 also calls single-cell genotypes based on the inferred cell lineage tree. Experiments on simulated and real biological data show that ScisTree2 achieves better overall accuracy while being significantly more efficient than existing methods. To the best of our knowledge, ScisTree2 is the first model-based cell lineage tree inference and genotype calling approach that is capable of handling datasets from tens of thousands of cells or more."
"Flowering synchrony within a community may be facilitated by climatic factors and by ecological interactions that promote shared pollination services. In contrast, flowering asynchrony is promoted when there is inter-species competition for pollinators. In this multiyear study, we analyse the flowering phenology of a seasonal, herbaceous community (Kaas plateau) in Western Ghats, India to identify environmental constraints that may influence flowering synchrony. We addressed the questions: (a) Is flowering seasonality correlated with climatic factors? (b) Is there evidence for flowering synchrony within the community? (c) Do plant-pollinator interactions shift with flowering phenology?

In Kaas, we recorded flowering phenology of 76 herbaceous species and found that climatic factors influenced their flowering phenology. We also identified the community to be composed of a few mass flowering (MF) species ([~]30%) and several non-mass flowering (nMF) species ([~]70%). Using two novel synchrony indices, temporal overlap (SItemp) and synchrony in abundance (SIabd), we also identified higher asynchronous flowering within the community than expected. Notably, species sharing the same floral colour, showed marked absence of synchrony, thus suggesting that competition and not pollinator-mediated facilitation drives flowering asynchrony within Kaas. Finally, pollination networks were observed to shift with flowering abundances within the community.

Our findings reveal that even seasonal landscapes like the laterite plateaus, despite their short flowering season that last only 4-5 months, exhibit an overall asynchronous flowering phenology. And, the synchronous flowering for which the Kaas plateau is famous, was noted to be mostly due to a few mass flowering species that alter across years."
"The mechanosensitive ion channels Piezo 1 and 2 induce a curved protein-membrane nanodome that flattens with increasing membrane tension gamma. The tension-induced flattening of the nanodome is associated with Piezo activation and driven by the energy gammaDeltaA where DeltaA is the excess area of the curved nanodome relative to its planar projected area. Based on extensive coarse-grained and atomistic simulations of membrane-embedded Piezo 1 and 2 proteins, we report here an an excess area DeltaA for the Piezo protein-membrane nanodome of about 40 nm2 in tensionless membranes, and a half-maximal reduction of DeltaA at tension values of about 3 to 4 mN/m, which is within the range of experimentally determined values for the half-maximal activation of Piezo 1. In line with recent experimental investigations of Piezo proteins in cell membranes and membrane vesicles, the membrane-embedded Piezo proteins adopt conformations in our simulations that are significantly less curved than the protein conformation in the detergent micelles of cryo-EM structures. An elasticity analysis of the nanodome shapes and protein conformations obtained from our simulations leads to an elastic model for Piezo activation that distinguishes the different energy components of the protein and the membrane in the tension-induced flattening of the nanodome."
"Ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation, intensified by ozone depletion, induces DNA damage and promotes mutagenesis, shaping evolution. While UV-induced SOS responses are well characterized in bacteria, the cellular consequences of prolonged UV-B exposure remain less clear. Prolonged UV-B exposure disrupts translation and RecA-mediated SOS induction without major changes in membrane permeability or reactive oxygen species. This impairs mutagenesis and induces a reversible loss of culturability. Genetic analysis reveals both redundant and differential roles for DNA repair pathways: homologous recombination (RecA, RecB), nucleotide excision repair (UvrA), and translesion synthesis (UmuC/D) are essential for maintaining mutagenesis and culturability, while others (RecN, RmuC) have limited impact. Notably, deletion of UvrD (a repair-associated helicase) intensifies transient non-culturability without affecting mutagenesis, underscoring complexity in repair networks. Overall, our findings reveal a dose-dependent trade-off: moderate UV-B promotes mutagenesis with minimal viability loss, whereas prolonged exposure suppresses mutagenesis via transient dormancy, reflecting an adaptive strategy with significant evolutionary implications."
"In many species, FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT)-like genes promote the floral transition by integrating environmental signals, in particular photoperiod, and internal cues. Here we show that Brassica napus contains 6 FT-like genes and 2 pseudogenes belonging to 3 orthogroups. All B. napus FT-like genes induce early flowering when expressed at the shoot apical meristems of Arabidopsis thaliana ft mutants, but BnaFT.C6 and non-orthologous FT-like genes do not encode fully functional mobile florigens. In the case of BnFT.C6, the functional change is associated with a T to C amino acid change that is restricted to semi-winter accessions. Expression of orthologs of FT is photoperiod-dependent and two distal enhancers are conserved; however, the homeologs BnaFT.A7 and BnaFT.C6 show rearrangements of DNA motifs binding NF-Y/CO and NF-Y transcriptional activator complexes between the promoter and downstream enhancers. Motif rearrangements correlate with differences in tissue-specific expression. Furthermore, homeologs with rearranged motifs could not be trans-activated by B. napus CO in transient assays although they genes show LD photoperiod-dependent expression. We propose that differential diurnal expression of NF-Y genes contributes to the photoperiod-dependent regulation of B. napus FT genes.

Significance statementB. napus FT-like genes are a case study for gene retention and retraction after multiple rounds of polyploidisation. Retained B. napus FT-like genes show preferred expression in different developmental stages and amino-acid changes that affect florigen function."

"Telomeric repeat-containing RNA (TERRA), transcribed from subtelomeric regions towards telomeric ends, poses challenges in deciphering its complete sequences. Utilizing TERRA-capture RNA-seq and Oxford Nanopore direct RNA sequencing to acquire full-length TERRA, we annotate TERRA transcription regions in the human T2T-CHM13 reference genome. TERRA transcripts encompass hundreds to over a thousand nucleotides of telomeric repeats, predominantly originating from 61-29-37 bp repeat promoters enriched with H3K4me3, RNA pol II, CTCF, and R-loops. We develop a bioinformatics tool, TERRA-QUANT, for quantifying TERRA using RNA-seq datasets and find that TERRA increases with age in blood, brain, and fibroblasts. TERRA upregulation in aged leukocytes is confirmed by RT-qPCR. Single-cell RNA-seq analysis demonstrates TERRA expression across various cell types, with upregulation observed in neurons during human embryonic stem cell differentiation. Additionally, TERRA levels are elevated in brain cells in the early stage of Alzheimers disease. Our study provides evidence linking TERRA to human aging and diseases."
"Transcription of interferons upon viral infection is critical for cell-intrinsic innate immunity. This process is influenced by many host and viral factors. To identify host factors that modulate interferon induction within cells infected by influenza A virus, we developed CRISPR with Transcriptional Readout (CRITR-seq). CRITR-seq is a method linking CRISPR guide sequence to activity at a promoter of interest. Employing this method, we find that depletion of the Negative Elongation Factor (NELF) complex increases both flu transcription and interferon expression. We find that the process of flu transcription, both in the presence and absence of viral replication, is a key contributor to interferon induction. Taken together, our findings highlight innate immune ligand concentration as a limiting factor in triggering an interferon response, identify NELF as an important interface with the flu life cycle, and validate CRITR-seq as a tool for genome-wide screens for phenotypes of gene expression.

Significance StatementNearly every cell in the human body has the ability to detect and respond to viral infection by producing interferons. The timing and magnitude of the interferon response impacts the course of disease, and both hosts and viruses have evolved mechanisms to regulate interferon induction within infected cells. It has previously been challenging to comprehensively search for regulators of interferon expression using selection-based screens. Here we developed a CRISPR screening strategy to measure the effects of gene edits on transcription at a promoter of interest. Applying this method to study interferon transcription during influenza infection, we identified an interface between human and influenza transcription machinery that modulates the viral life cycle and influences the interferon response."
"Embryogenesis is commonly viewed through a tree model of cell differentiation, which fails to capture the spatiotemporal modulation of cell multipotency underlying morphogenesis. In this study we profile the multipotency landscape of the embryo, using in vivo single-cell clonal lineage tracing of mouse embryos traced from neurulation until mid-gestation, combined with a machine learning tool that categorizes individual clones into lineages based on shared transcriptional context. This revealed a previously unrecognized continuous, embryo-wide gradient of clonal fate biases, in which anatomical position and clonal composition are mutually predictive. Comparing clonal lineages revealed gene regulatory networks underlying the dynamic biasing of cells towards specific fates by spatial transcription factor programs. However, mosaic combinatorial perturbations targeting the Hedgehog pathway generated clones in which positional identity was mismatched with clonal composition, demonstrating that extrinsic signals can override the axial patterning system underlying clonal fate biases. Altogether, our work demonstrates an effective practical approach for dissecting mechanisms of lineage specification and has implications for stem cell engineering."
"Brain age is widely regarded as a powerful marker of general brain health. Brain age models are typically trained on large datasets to predict chronological age, which may offer advantages in predicting specific health outcomes, much like the success of finetuning large language models for specific applications. However, it is also well-accepted that machine learning models trained to directly predict specific outcomes (i.e., direct models) often outperform those trained on surrogate objectives. Therefore, despite their much larger training data, it is unclear whether brain age models outperform direct models in predicting specific brain health outcomes. Here, we compare large-scale brain age models (pretrained on 53,542 participants) and direct models for predicting specific health outcomes related to Alzheimers Disease (AD) dementia. Using anatomical T1 scans from three continents (N = 1,848), we find that summarizing brain age with a single scalar (i.e., brain age gap) led to poor prediction performance. Using higher-dimensional intermediate representations of brain age models led to better prediction, but was still worse than direct models without finetuning. Using intermediate representations of finetuned brain age models was necessary to achieve similar performance as direct models. Overall, our results do not discount brain age as a useful marker of general brain health, but suggest that using chronological age as a pretraining target might be suboptimal for predicting specific health outcomes."
"Functionally specific long-range lateral connectivity in layer 2/3 of the adult primary visual cortex (V1) supports the integration of visual information across visual space and shapes spontaneous, visual and optogenetically driven V1 activity. However, a comprehensive understanding of how these diverse cortical regimes emerge from this underlying cortical circuitry remains elusive. Here we address this gap by showing how the same model assuming moderately iso-orientation biassed long-range cortical connectivity architecture explains diverse phenomena, including (i) range of visually driven phenomena, (ii) modular spontaneous activity, (iii) the propagation of spontaneous cortical waves, and (iv) neural responses to patterned optogenetic stimulation. The model offers testable predictions, including presence of slower and iso-tropic spontaneous wave propagation in layer 4 and non-monotonicity of optogenetically driven cortical response to increasingly larger disk of illumination. We thus offer a holistic framework for studying how cortical circuitry governs information integration across multiple operating regimes."
"The Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is a type I membrane protein that mediates target cell recognition and membrane fusion. Its transmembrane domain (TMD) is usually considered to be a passive physical anchor that attaches the protein to the viral envelope. However, current knowledge of the dynamics and biogenesis of integral membrane proteins indicates that TMDs generally play key functions beyond membrane anchoring. Here, we explored the role of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein TMD during viral entry. To do so, we generated a series of amino acid substitutions and insertions within the hydrophobic core of the TMD and analyzed their impact on protein function. Our results indicate that the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein is highly susceptible to changes in its TMD. Furthermore, the TMD sequence and structural parameters relevant for viral entry are distributed across the entire segment, albeit with a stronger implication of the N-terminal portion. The relative orientation of the regions before and after the TMD was also found to be relevant for particle entry. Finally, our results suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein TMD can form homo-oligomers through a motif in which small residues are necessary."
"Poultry farming is threatened by regular outbreaks of Escherichia coli (E. coli) that lead to significant economic losses and public health risks. However, traditional surveillance methods often lack sensitivity and scalability. Early detection of infected poultry using minimally invasive procedures is thus essential for preventing epidemics. To that end, we leverage recent advancements in computer vision, employing deep learning-based tracking to detect behavioural changes associated with E. coli infection in a case-control trial comprising two groups of 20 broiler chickens: (1) a healthy control group and (2) a group infected with a pathogenic E. coli field strain from the poultry industry. More specifically, kinematic features derived from deep learning-based tracking data revealed markedly reduced activity in the challenged group compared to the negative control. These findings were validated by lower mean optical flow in the infected flock, suggesting reduced movement and activity, and post-mortem physiological markers of inflammation which confirmed the severity of infection in the challenged group. Overall, this study demonstrates that deep learning-based tracking offers a promising solution for real-time monitoring and early infection detection in poultry farming, with the potential to help reduce economic losses and mitigate public health risks associated with infectious disease outbreaks in poultry."
"Spacing of Ranvier nodes along myelinated axons is a critical determinant of conduction velocity, influencing spike arrival timing and hence neural circuit function. In the chick brainstem auditory circuit, the pattern of nodal spacing varies regionally along single axons, enabling precise binaural integration for sound localization. Using this model, we investigated the potential factors underlying the biased nodal spacing pattern. 3D morphometry revealed that these axons were almost fully myelinated by oligodendrocytes exhibiting distinct morphologies and cell densities across regions after hearing onset. The structure of axons did not affect internodal length. Inhibiting vesicular release from the axons did not affect internodal length or oligodendrocyte morphology, but caused unmyelinated segments on the axons by suppressing oligodendrogenesis near the presynaptic terminals. These results suggest that the regional heterogeneity in the intrinsic properties of oligodendrocytes is a prominent determinant of the biased nodal spacing pattern in the sound localization circuit, while activity-dependent signaling supports the pattern by ensuring adequate oligodendrocyte density. Our findings highlight the importance of oligodendrocyte heterogeneity in fine-tuning neural circuit function."
"Liver regeneration is impaired in patients suffering from alcohol-associated liver (ALD) diseases. Wnt ligands and their FZD receptors are dysregulated in diseased livers. R-spondin and their receptors are known to regulate Wnt activity via the stabilization of FZD receptors. Here, we investigated the components of the Wnt and R-Spondin-signaling pathways and their activity in patients with ALD. We found that while hepatocytes retained high levels of differentiation markers such as ASGR1 and ASGR2, the expression of two R-spondin co-receptors, LGR4 and LGR5, and of Wnt target genes, CYP1A2 and others, were strongly reduced.

SZN-043, a hepatocyte-targeted R-Spondin mimetic, is a new investigational drug that stimulates the physiological Wnt repair pathway and proliferation of hepatocytes. Here, we show that SZN-043 induced hepatocyte proliferation in all models tested, including humanized mouse livers, a chronic-binge alcohol-induced liver injury, and a CCl4-induced fibrosis mouse model. Altogether, SZN-043 could be beneficial for the treatment of ALD."
"One of the most common objectives in the analysis of flow cytometry data is the identification and delineation of phenotypes, distinct populations of cells with shared characteristics in the measurement dimensions. We have developed an automated tool to comprehensively identify these cell populations by Exhaustive Projection Pursuit (EPP). The method evaluates all two-dimensional projections among the suitable data dimensions and creates an optimized sequence of statistically significant gating regions that identify all phenotypes supported by the data. We evaluate the results of EPP on four well characterized data sets from the literature. The C++ code for EPP can be called from any computing environment. We illustrate this with a MATLAB utility that integrates EPP with FlowJo. All source code is freely available."
"Characterizing the processes that drive microbial community assembly remains a key challenge in ecology. Several recent studies have argued that pairwise interactions may be insufficient to explain co-occurrence patterns in complex microbial communities, but most such studies have focused on synthetic communities not found in nature or microbes grown in contexts that differ widely from their natural environment. Moreover, most models of pairwise interactions rely on equilibrium assumptions that are not relevant to all natural communities, such as gut microbiomes or species in fluctuating environments. Inclusion of appropriate demographic factors into models of pairwise interactions could be a potential approach to better capture patterns of community assembly. In this study, we investigated whether multi-species co-occurrence patterns can be predicted from pairwise interactions for microbes isolated from sourdough starters. Interaction parameters inferred from pairwise growth trajectories were suggestive of widespread coexistence between pairs of microbes in our species pool. In communities of up to nine species, most species presence and relative abundance could be reliably predicted based on a model of pairwise interactions. The inclusion of nonequilibrium demography in our model further improved the accuracy of our pairwise model. Our work contributes to the broader debate on the processes underlying community assembly by showing that pairwise interactions are predictive of community structure in a system of moderate species complexity."
"The translation machinery is required to process all codon triplets without exception while maintaining high speed and accuracy, despite orders-of-magnitude differences in cognate pairing stability. For stability-based selection to be efficient, the range of pairing stabilities must be narrowed by raising the lower bound and lowering the upper bound. The constrained structure and intramolecular cooperativity of tRNA complicate understanding of how it modulates codon-anticodon stability and whether it affects selection kinetics beyond codon recognition. To address these questions, we engineered functional split-tRNAs bearing a dangling anticodon in place of the anticodon loop. Our results demonstrate that split-tRNA supports in vitro translation nearly as efficiently as intact synthetic tRNA, challenging the notion that tRNA strain is essential for triggering GTP hydrolysis in response to codon recognition. Using split-tRNA architecture, we found that codon- anticodon stability is likely modulated by the dipole moments of adjacent nucleobases. Our kinetic modeling aligns with a conformational selection mechanism, where the decoding site fluctuates between open and closed states, and the correct codon-anticodon minihelix acts as an allosteric effector that permits its spontaneous closure and stabilizes the closed state. Overall, our data challenge the notion that tRNA is an active player in the selection process."
"Large-scale neural coherence and distributed plasticity are fundamental to brain function, yet traditional circuit- and connectome-based models fail to capture stable phase gradients, harmonic resonances, and non-local reorganization observed across spatially disconnected regions. We introduce the Syncytial Mesh Model: a unified, three-layered framework in which a mesh-like substrate--grounded in astrocytic syncytia physiology--operates alongside local circuit and structural connectivity layers. The Syncytial Mesh layer, implemented via a damped wave equation on a small-world astrocytic network, generates traveling waves, interference-driven resonance, and distributed co-activation signals that underpin rare, scale-dependent phase coherence (delta/theta, 1 Hz to 8 Hz) and diffuse plasticity. Numerical simulations--using a 9-point isotropic Laplacian, perfectly matched layer (PML) boundaries, and unified RK4 integration--produce artifact-free amplitude snapshots, radial phase gradients, and precise spectral peaks matching human MEG and LFP data. An analytic two-mode model, fitted to empirical phase-gradient coherence across N = 43 subjects, yields a decoherence rate{lambda} 0 {approx} 1.5903/s, explaining why coherence is negligible at micrometer scales yet plateaus at [~] 4.65 % for millimeter-scale patches. Quantitative comparison with individual spectra shows median Pearson correlation r = 0.917 and median MSE = 26.6 dB2. By embedding the mesh in astrocytic physiology, the Syncytial Mesh Model provides a falsifiable, mechanistically grounded alternative to connectome-centric theories, unifying neural synchrony, resonance, and distributed plasticity across scales."
"Smoothened (SMO), a member of the G Protein-Coupled Receptor superfamily, mediates Hedgehog signaling and is linked to cancer and birth defects. SMO responds to accessible cholesterol in the ciliary membrane, translocating it via a longitudinal tunnel to its extracellular domain. Reaching a complete mechanistic understanding of the cholesterol translocation process would help in the development of cancer therapies. Experimental data suggests two modes of translocation to support entry of cholesterol from outer and inner membrane leaflets, but the exact mechanism of translocation remains unclear. Using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations ([~]2 millisecond simulations) and biochemical assays of SMO mutants, we assess the energetic feasibilities of the two modes. We show that the highest energetic barrier for cholesterol translocation from the outer leaflet is lower than that from the inner leaflet. Mutagenesis experiments and complementary simulations of SMO mutants validate the role of critical amino acid residues along the translocation pathways. Our data suggests that cholesterol can take either pathway to enter SMO, thus explaining experimental observations in literature. Thus, our results illuminate the energetics and provide a first molecular description of cholesterol translocation in SMO."
"The metabolic health of the kidney is a primary determinant of the risk of progressive kidney disease. Our understanding of the metabolic processes that fuel kidney functions is limited by the kidneys structural and functional heterogeneity. As the kidney contains many different cell types, we sought to determine the intra-renal mitochondrial heterogeneity that contributes to cell-specific metabolism. To interrogate this, we utilized a recently developed mitochondrial tagging technique to isolate kidney cell-type specific mitochondria. Here, we investigate mitochondrial functional capacities and the metabolomes of the early and late proximal tubule (PT) and the distal convoluted tubule (DCT). The conditional MITO-Tag transgene was combined with Slc34a1-CreERT2, Ggt1-Cre, or Pvalb-Cre transgenes to generate mouse models capable of cell-specific isolation of hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged mitochondria from the early PT, late PT, or the DCT, respectively. Functional assays measuring mitochondrial respiratory and fatty acid oxidation (FAO) capacities and metabolomics were performed on anti-HA immunoprecipitated mitochondria from kidneys of ad libitum fed and 24-hour fasted male mice. The renal MITO-Tag models targeting the early PT, late PT, and DCT revealed differential mitochondrial respiratory and FAO capacities which dynamically changed during fasting conditions. The renal MITO-Tag model captured differential mitochondrial metabolism and functional capacities across the early PT, late PT, and DCT at baseline and in response to fasting.

New & NoteworthyThis study described the generation and utilization of mouse models capable of interrogating kidney tubular epithelial cell-specific mitochondrial metabolism. Applying the MITO-Tag system in the kidney, we have for the first time defined the mitochondrial metabolic heterogeneity of renal cortical tubular epithelium and discovered differential mitochondrial functional capacities in response to an acute metabolic stress such as fasting."
"BackgroundProtein-based stable isotope probing (Protein-SIP) is a powerful approach that can directly link individual taxa to activity and substrate assimilation, elucidating metabolic pathways and trophic relationships within microbial communities. In Protein-SIP, peptides and corresponding taxa are identified by database matching, making database quality crucial for accurate analyses. For samples with unknown community composition, Protein-SIP typically employs either unrestricted reference databases or metagenome-derived databases. While (meta)genome-derived databases represent the gold standard, they may be incomplete and are typically resource-intensive to generate. In contrast, unrestricted reference databases can inflate the search space and require complex post-processing.

ResultsHere, we explore the feasibility of using de novo peptide sequencing to construct peptide databases directly from mass spectrometry raw data. We then use the mass spectrometric data from labeled cultures to quantify isotope incorporation into specific peptides. We benchmark our approach against the canonical approach in which a sample-matching (meta)genome-derived protein sequence database is used on three different datasets: 1) a proteome analysis from a defined microbial community containing 13C-labeled E. coli cells, 2) time-course data of an anammox-dominated continuous reactor after feeding with 13C-labeled bicarbonate, and 3) a model of the human distal gut simulating a high-protein and high-fiber diet cultivated in either 2H2O or H218O. Our results show that de novo peptide databases are applicable to different isotopes, detecting similar amounts of labeled peptides compared to sample-matching (meta)genome-derived databases, and also identify labeled peptides missed by this canonical approach. Furthermore, we show that peptide-centric Protein-SIP allows up to species-specific resolution and enables the assessment of activity related to individual biological processes. Finally, we provide access to our modular Python pipeline to assist the construction of de novo peptide databases and subsequent peptide-centric Protein-SIP data analysis (https://git.ufz.de/meb/denovo-sip).

ConclusionsDe novo peptide databases enable Protein-SIP of microbial communities without prior knowledge of the composition and can be used complementarily to (meta)genome-derived databases or as a standalone alternative in exploratory or resource-limited settings."
"SummaryDuring infection, the fusion peptide (FP) of HIV envelope glycoprotein (Env) serves a central role in viral fusion with the host cell. As such, the FP is highly conserved and therefore an attractive epitope for vaccine design. Here, we describe a vaccination study in non-human primates (NHPs) where glycan deletions were made on soluble HIV Env to increase FP epitope exposure. When delivered via implantable osmotic pumps, this immunogen primed immune responses against the FP, which were then boosted with heterologous trimers resulting in a focused immune response targeting the conserved FP epitope. Although autologous immunizations did not elicit high affinity FP-targeting antibodies, the conserved FP epitope on a heterologous trimer further matured the lower affinity, FP-targeting B cells. This study suggests using epitope conservation strategies on distinct Env trimer immunogens can focus humoral responses on desired neutralizing epitopes and suppress immune-distracting antibody responses against non-neutralizing epitopes."
"Understanding the relationship between bacteriophage (phage) classification and target receptors is crucial for phage ecology and applied research. In this study, we compared 13 previously isolated Escherichia coli phages based on physiological characteristics, whole-genome sequences, and tail fiber protein phylogenetics. We improved our previously proposed physiological clustering method by optimizing the bacterial panel for host range assessment, implementing appropriate distance metrics for mixed data types, and applying silhouette coefficient analysis for objective determination of optimal cluster numbers. We combined genomic analysis and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) structural analysis of phage-resistant E. coli strains to identify target receptors of the phages. Complementation experiments further confirmed the direct involvement of identified genes in phage reception. The results revealed that phylogenetically distinct E. coli phages target different sites in the LPS R-core region (modified by WaaV, WaaW, WaaT, and WaaY), membrane proteins (NfrB, TolA, YhaH), or flagella. Our analysis revealed that, subtle chemical modifications of LPS (such as Heptose phosphorylation) were shown to be important for E. coli phage recognition. Furthermore, physiological characteristics, tail fiber phylogenetics, and whole genome analysis independently classified the phages with high correlation to target receptor specificity. The addition of three phages with known receptors further validated our approach. Our results suggest that phage phenotypes and genotypes are closely related to target receptor specificity. Here, we elucidated the diversity and specificity of E. coli phage target receptors, providing new insights into the classification of E. coli phages and phage-host interactions.

ImportancePhage therapy is gaining attention as an alternative treatment for antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Developing effective phage cocktails requires combining phages with different target receptors, but traditional methods for identifying target receptors are labor- intensive. This study demonstrates that E. coli phages with different target receptors can be grouped based on their physiological characteristics, tail fiber sequences, or whole genomes. This insight can be used to more efficiently create diverse phage cocktails. Additionally, we identified phages targeting diverse sites, including different regions of LPS, membrane proteins, and flagella. These findings deepen our understanding of phage host recognition mechanisms, enabling the rapid preparation of effective phage cocktails and contributing to new advancements in bacterial infection treatment."
"Drosophila melanogaster serves as a powerful model for studying neurodegenerative diseases, often employing the GAL4-UAS system for targeted gene expression. Electroretinograms (ERGs) provide a robust in vivo functional readout of neuronal integrity and are increasingly used to assess disease progression and therapeutic interventions in these models. However, the genetic background upon which these models are built, particularly the widely used w1118 white-eyed mutant, can significantly influence baseline ERG characteristics. This study systematically characterizes ERG responses in wild-type Canton S (CS), w1118, and a w1118line carrying a UAS-hPLD1 construct (which includes a mini-white gene). We demonstrate profound differences in ERG amplitudes, waveforms, and responses to varying light stimuli (intensity and duration) between these genotypes, as well as significant sex-specific variations. Notably, w1118 flies exhibit markedly larger ERG amplitudes compared to CS, while the hPLD1 line shows partial compensation. We also introduce a novel quadrant-based analysis of the receptor potential, revealing distinct ""fingerprints"" for each genotype. These findings underscore that the w1118 background is not electrophysiologically neutral and can intrinsically alter neuronal responses. This has critical implications for interpreting ERG data from neurodegeneration models, as these background effects could mask or mimic disease-related changes. Researchers must consider these baseline differences and potential sex-specific effects to accurately attribute observed ERG phenotypes to the gene or condition under investigation.

"Predicting the mutation prevalence trends of emerging viruses in the real world is an efficient means to update vaccines or drugs in advance. It is crucial to develop a computational method for the prediction of real-world prevalent SARS-CoV-2 mutations considering the impact of multiple selective pressures within and between hosts. Here, a deep-learning generative framework for real-world prevalent SARS-CoV-2 mutation prediction, named ViralForesight, is developed on top of protein language models and in silico virus evolution. Through the paradigm of host-to-herd in silico virus evolution, ViralForesight reproduced previous real-world prevalent SARS-CoV-2 mutations for multiple lineages with superior performance. More importantly, ViralForesight correctly predicted the future prevalent mutations that dominate the COVID-19 pandemic in the real world more than half a year in advance with in vitro experimental validation. Overall, ViralForesight demonstrates a proactive approach to the prevention of emerging viral infections, accelerating the process of discovering future prevalent mutations with the power of generative deep learning."
"Gut nematode worms are important parasites of people and other animals. The parasitic nematode Strongyloides stercoralis infects an estimated 600 million people worldwide, and is one of the soil-transmitted helminthiases, a WHO-defined neglected tropical disease. It has long been suggested that human S. stercoralis infection may be a zoonosis from dogs. We investigated this by whole genome sequence analysis of S. stercoralis from sympatric human and dog populations in Asia. We find that human- and dog-derived S. stercoralis have genetically distinct nuclear genomes, but we also find evidence of rare cross infection. Analysis of the S. stercoralis mitochondrial genome reveals evidence of historical introgression between human- and dog-derived parasites. Based on these data we suggest that S. stercoralis was originally a parasite of canids, that began to infect humans when people domesticated dogs, since when human- and dog-derived parasites have differentiated, but have not become separate species.

Significance StatementNematode worms infect approximately a quarter of the worlds human population; Strongyloides stercoralis infects some 600 million people. It has been suggested that S. stercoralis in people and dogs is the same parasite, such that some human infection is acquired zoonotically from dogs. It is important to understand the source of human Strongyloides infection to be able to control it and the harm that it causes. Our population genomic analyses of human- and dog-derived S. stercoralis in Asia show that these parasites are distinct, but also reveal rare cross infection events. Our results are consistent with S. stercoralis ancestrally being a parasite of dogs that began infecting people when dogs became domesticated."
"Sequence design is the critical first step in developing a new mRNA medicine. The mRNA primary sequence is assembled from multiple elements, including the coding sequence of the target protein or gene, flanking untranslated regions that impact expression, and the poly(A) tail, which improves stability. The mRNA primary sequence can be optimized to improve the performance of an mRNA medicine, including increasing translation and stability, and reducing reactogenicity. Here, we introduce mRNArchitect, a software toolkit to assist in the design of mRNA sequences. mRNArchitect can rapidly assemble and optimize mRNA sequences based on user requirements, including GC content, secondary structure, codon optimization, and uridine depletion. The sequences generated by mRNArchitect can also be readily synthesized, and have been experimentally validated across a variety of applications. We present mRNArchitect as a software toolkit to help scientists design new mRNA medicines.

Availability and implementationmRNArchitect is available via a web portal at www.basefacility.org.au/software/ and Github at https://github.com/BaseUQ/mRNArchitect. mRNArchitect is open-source and freely available under MIT License."
"Monitoring of salmon in Pacific Canada has been declining for decades. Counts of spawning salmon are critically important, enabling researchers to quantify impacts of stressors, identify when and where management interventions are required to avoid extirpations, and evaluate the efficacy of recovery efforts. These data are more important now than ever, as uniquely adapted spawning populations underlie salmon resilience and their ability to adapt to climate change, and fine-scale data can inform sustainable fishing opportunities including the revitalization of terminal fisheries. We revisit the state of Pacific salmon spawner data from the Yukon to southern British Columbia. Almost two-thirds of salmon populations that were historically monitored have no reported estimates in 2014-2023 - the worst decade for data since broadscale spawner surveys began in the 1950s. We found a positive association between the number of populations monitored and landed value for three of the five Pacific salmon species, suggesting that monitoring is, to some extent, motivated by the information needs of commercial fisheries management. We recommend aligning monitoring objectives and strategic investments to improve monitoring outcomes for salmon, ecosystems, and the communities that depend on them. We emphasize data stewardship, as ensuring access to these baseline data is a cornerstone for rebuilding wild Pacific salmon."
"Bacterial growth characteristics intrinsic to each strain can impact and influence gene expression, antibiotic susceptibility, and disease pathogenesis. However, little is known about specific genomic variations that influence these bacterial growth features. Here, we investigate the impact of Streptococcus pneumoniae genetics on its in vitro growth features to shed light on genes that may be important targets in the development of vaccines and therapeutics. We use statistical models to estimate growth features and demonstrate that they varied significantly across capsular serotypes and lineages, were strongly correlated with phylogeny, and showed high heritability, highlighting a strong genetic basis. Despite this, genome-wide association studies revealed no specific genomic loci statistically associated with the growth features independently of the genetic background, including those in the locus responsible for capsular polysaccharide synthesis. Our findings suggest that the serotype and lineage, as well as a combination of genomic loci, influence intrinsic pneumococcal growth kinetics, which may have implications for pneumococcal disease pathogenesis."
"High-dose vitamin C therapy for cancer, originally advocated by Linus Pauling (Proc Natl Acad Sci, 1976, 73, 3685-3689), remains a subject of ongoing debate. In this study, we investigate why only pharmacological doses are effective and explore the reasons behind inconsistent therapeutic outcomes. Our data suggest that the bona fide cause of toxicity was oxidized vitamin C rather than hydrogen peroxide. We found that vitamin C at millimolar concentrations, directly inhibits hypochlorous acid generation by myeloperoxidase, through competition with chloride rather than by scavenging the hypochlorous acid that is formed. Products of vitamin C oxidation reacted with the thiols of peroxiredoxin 2 and GAPDH, but failed to react with the cysteine of p16INK4a. The growth and viability of Jurkat cells were affected by oxidized vitamin C. These experiments were conducted in the presence of catalase, demonstrating that the biological effects were due to the products of vitamin C oxidation and not hydrogen peroxide. These findings may have practical implications for the treatment of cancer and diseases in which the deleterious effects of neutrophil activation are observed. For intravenous administration of pharmacological vitamin C to have a beneficial effect, its concentration in the blood must be maintained at millimolar levels and this can only be achieved via maintenance infusion. As a proof-of-concept, our data suggest that to enhance anticancer therapy interventions, it is crucial to implement treatments that facilitate the oxidation of vitamin C in the bloodstream.O_QDProgress in the art of healing has always been induced by progress in basic knowledge.

"Gene drives are engineered alleles that bias their own inheritance in offspring, enabling the spread of specific traits throughout a population. Targeting female fertility genes in a gene drive can be an efficient strategy for population suppression. In this study, we investigated nine female fertility genes in Drosophila melanogaster using CRISPR-based homing gene drives. Employing a multiplexed gRNA approach to prevent the formation of functional resistance alleles, we aimed to maintain high drive conversion efficiency with low fitness costs in female drive carriers. Drive efficiency was assessed in individual crosses and had varied performance across different target genes. Notably, drives targeting the octopamine {beta}2 receptor (oct) and stall (stl) genes exhibited the highest drive conversion rates and were further tested in cages. A drive targeting stl successfully suppressed a cage population with a high release frequency, though suppression failed in another replicate cage with a lower initial release frequency. Fitness costs in female drive carriers were observed in test cages, impacting the overall efficiency of population suppression. Further tests on the fertility of these lines using individual crosses indicated that some fitness costs were due to maternal deposition of Cas9 combined with new gRNA expression, which would only occur in progeny of drive males when testing split drives with separate Cas9 (when mimicking cages with complete drives) but not for complete drive systems. This could enable success in complete drives with higher maternal Cas9 deposition, even if cage experiments in split drives fail. Our findings underscore the potential and challenges of assessing gene drives for population control, providing valuable insights for optimizing and testing suppression gene drive designs."
"BackgroundCentella asiatica has long been used as a medicinal herb in traditional Asian medicine. Its wound healing, skin improvement, and neuroprotective properties have been widely studied. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are secreted by cells and contain bioactive components with therapeutic properties.

ObjectivesThis study aims to characterize EVs isolated from C. asiatica tissue culture and investigate their therapeutic properties using in vitro assays and a UVB-induced damage mouse model.

MethodsEVs were isolated from C. asiatica tissue culture and characterized by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Cytotoxicity, anti-oxidation, anti-melanin, and anti-inflammation of the EVs were evaluated by MTT assay, tyrosinase assay and RT-qPCR in chemical or in vitro assays. A UVB-induced photodamage mouse model was established to assess the anti-inflammation effect of EVs in vivo. Gels with or without EVs were applied to the damaged site and skin appearance was observed daily and skin histopathology was analyzed on day 7 by H&E and immunohistochemical staining.

ResultsC. asiatica EVs were found to contain high levels of polyphenols and mitigate hydrogen peroxide-induced intracellular ROS. The EVs were further able to reduce intracellular melanin content and tyrosinase activity, and exhibited anti-inflammatory effects by downregulating the expression of pro-inflammatory genes COX2 as well as nitric oxide production. In mice with UVB-induced skin damage, daily application of C. asiatica EV gel reduced skin epidermis thickness and inflammation compared to UVB-only or blank gel at seven days after UV irradiation.

ConclusionsThe beneficial effects of C. asiatica EVs on skin quality warrant further studies as promising agents in skin care applications."
"RNA velocities and generalizations emerge as powerful approaches for extracting time-resolved information from high-throughput snapshot single-cell data. Yet, several inherent limitations restrict applying the approaches to genes not suitable for RNA velocity inference due to complex transcriptional dynamics, low expression, or lacking splicing dynamics, or data of non-transcriptomic modality. Here, we present GraphVelo, a graph-based machine learning procedure that uses as input the RNA velocities inferred from existing methods and infers velocity vectors lying in the tangent space of the low-dimensional manifold formed by the single cell data. GraphVelo preserves vector magnitude and direction information during transformations across different data representations. Tests on synthetic and experimental single-cell data including viral-host interactome, multi-omics, and spatial genomics datasets demonstrate that GraphVelo, together with downstream generalized dynamo analyses, extends RNA velocities to multi-modal data and reveals quantitative nonlinear regulation relations between genes, virus and host cells, and different layers of gene regulation."
"Determining the neuromodulators driving brain activity is critical for understanding cognition and neuropathology. Neuromodulators act through neuroreceptors in a coordinated manner, yet their interconnected dynamics are often overlooked. We show that a neuroreceptor-based modeling framework using cortical density maps of 19 neuroreceptors and transporters from Positron Emission Tomography (PET) can model BOLD-derived brain activity. This framework reconstructs activity across four datasets (N = 314) identifying two neuroreceptor modules linked to higher-order associative or somatomotor and visual networks. Applying the framework to independent datasets, we recover the binding profiles of LSD and Modafinil, demonstrating consistency with known pharmacological and neurobiological associations. Additionally, it uncovered associations between neuroreceptors, transporters, and altered brain activity in neuropsychiatric disorders. These findings demonstrate the potential to elucidate neuromodulatory mechanisms and advance our understanding of brain function across diverse states and conditions."
"Intratumor heterogeneity in glioblastoma (GBM) impedes successful treatment as it is not obvious which tumor cells should be targeted. Here, we posit that single-cell-resolution transcriptomic data can be integrated with loss-of-function screens to identify the most critical cells to target within a tumor. We parsed CRISPR screen data from the Dependency Map (DepMap) Consortium and identified a GBM Dependency Signature (GDS) - 168 genes that are essential for GBM cell viability in vitro. Through similarity scoring of GDS transcriptomic profiles in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data and iterative hierarchical clustering, we identify and report 3 single-cell vulnerability states (VS) characterized in 49 GBM tumors using both scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomic data. These VS reflect single-cell gene dependencies and differ significantly in enrichment profiles and spatial distributions. Additionally, each VS is differently sensitive to cancer drugs, with VS2 solely responsive to temozolomide treatment. Importantly, the proportion of VS in each GBM tumor is variable, suggesting a means of stratifying patients in clinical trials. Collectively, we have developed a novel computational pipeline to identify unique vulnerability states in GBM and other cancers, which can be used to identify existing or novel drugs for incurable diseases."
"The field of computational drug design requires accurate scoring functions to predict binding affinities for protein-ligand interactions. However, train-test data leakage between the PDBbind database and the CASF benchmark datasets has significantly inflated the performance metrics of currently available deep-learning-based binding affinity prediction models, leading to overestimation of their generalization capabilities. We address this issue by proposing PDBbind CleanSplit, a training dataset curated by a novel structure-based filtering algorithm that eliminates train-test data leakage as well as redundancies within the training set. Retraining current top-performing models on CleanSplit caused their benchmark performance to drop significantly, indicating that the performance of existing models is largely driven by data leakage. In contrast, our graph neural network model for efficient molecular scoring (GEMS) maintains high benchmark performance when trained on CleanSplit. Leveraging a sparse graph modeling of protein-ligand interactions and transfer learning from language models, GEMS is able to generalize to strictly independent test datasets."
"Gonadal sex determination relies on tipping a delicate balance involving the activation and repression of several transcription factors and signalling pathways. This is likely mediated by numerous non-coding regulatory elements that shape sex-specific transcriptomic programs. To explore the dynamics of these in detail, we performed paired time-series of transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility assays on pre-granulosa and Sertoli cells throughout their development in the embryo, making use of new and existing mouse reporter lines. Regulatory elements were associated with their putative target genes by linkage analysis, and this was complemented and verified experimentally using promoter capture Hi-C. We identified the transcription factor motifs enriched in these regulatory elements along with their occupancy, pinpointing LHX9/EMX2 as potentially critical regulators of ovarian development. Variations in the DNA sequence of these regulatory elements are likely to be responsible for many of the unexplained cases of individuals with Differences of Sex Development.

TeaserMultiomics analysis revealed the regulatory elements and transcription factors responsible for gonadal sex determination."
"Aging is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death worldwide, and numerous other diseases, but the mechanisms of these aging-related effects remain elusive. Recent evidence suggests that chronic changes in the microenvironment and local paracrine signaling are major drivers of these effects, but the precise effect of aging on these factors remains understudied. Here, for the first time, we directly compare extracellular vesicles obtained from young and aged patients to identify therapeutic or disease-associated agents, and directly compare vesicles isolated from heart tissue matrix (TEVs) or plasma (PEVs). While young TEVs and PEVs showed notable overlap of miRNA cargo, aged EVs differed substantially, indicating differential aging-related changes between TEVs and PEVs. TEVs overall were uniquely enriched in miRNAs which directly or indirectly demonstrate cardioprotective effects, with 45 potential therapeutic agents identified in our analysis. Both populations also showed increased predisposition to disease with aging, though through different mechanisms. Changes in PEV cargo were largely correlated with chronic systemic inflammation, while those in TEVs were more related to cardiac homeostasis and local inflammation. From this, 17 protein targets were identified which were unique to TEVs and highly correlated with aging and the onset of cardiovascular disease. Further analysis via machine learning techniques implicated several new miRNA and protein targets, independently suggesting several of the targets identified by non-machine learning analysis, which correlated with aging-related changes in TEVs. With further study, this biomarker set may serve as a powerful, potential indicator of cardiac health and age which can be measured from PEVs. Additionally, several proposed ""young-enriched"" therapeutic agents were validated and, when tested, could successfully prevent cell death and cardiac fibrosis in disease-like conditions."
"Epigenetic clocks have achieved significant success in aging research, but they often assume linear methylation changes with age and lack biological interpretability. Using data from 4,641 samples across 23 GEO datasets, we analyzed 1,557 CpGs from nine widely used clocks with minimal overlap, and identified consistent age-associated methylation patterns. We then identified 19,432 age-associated CpGs (aaCpGs) that were strongly correlated with age and showed high consistency between sexes, with faster methylation changes observed in males. Most aaCpGs were identified during early and late life stages, indicating accelerated epigenetic changes during development and aging. No specific genomic enrichment was observed. Clustering analysis revealed four distinct, non-linear age-related methylation trajectories. These findings underscore the complexity of epigenetic aging and suggest that current clocks may overlook important dynamic patterns, particularly after age 65. Incorporating these insights could improve the accuracy and biological relevance of future epigenetic clocks, especially for use across diverse age ranges and populations."
"During plant infection, complex metabolic interactions take place between the plant and the pathogen, among which occurs a true battle for resources. On one side, the pathogen harvests nutrients at the expense of the plant to sustain its growth and virulence. On the other side, the plant tries to prevent pathogen multiplication by competing for nutrients or using anti-microbial compounds. Plants and pathogens have thus contrary objectives in an intertwined system that is particularly difficult to untangle experimentally. To help decipher this interaction, we used genome-scale metabolic modeling by combining a multi-organ model of a plant, a model of a pathogen, quantitative data and a mathematical approach using sequential flux balance analyses (FBAs). We applied this modeling strategy to the interaction between the pathogenic bacterium Ralstonia pseudosolanacearum and its natural host, the tomato plant. This allowed, for the first time, quantitative modeling of the fluxes of matter occurring during plant infection. The model showed that, for the pathosystem studied, i) the plants photosynthetic capacity is a more stringent environmental condition than minerals for bacterial proliferation ii) reduction of the plant transpiration is what limits and then stops plant growth and later pathogen growth, iii) hijacking stem resources can boost bacterial growth but is accessory, and iv) pathogen-excreted putrescine is predicted to be directly reused for plant biomass. This study provides the first holistic and quantitative view of a plant-pathogen interaction, and highlights the criticality of water flow when the bacteria responsible of the infection is a fast-growing, xylem-colonizing one."
"During split-belt treadmill walking, neurotypical humans exhibit adaptations characterized by a gradual decrease in step length asymmetry toward or beyond symmetry, whereas individuals with cerebellar damage do not show these motor adaptations. Neuromusculoskeletal simulations can help to better understand individual aspects of the underlying neural control, but are currently not capable of predicting adaptations to continuous perturbations like split-belt walking. Here, we extend a spinal reflex model with a biologically inspired model of the cerebellum, which enables error-based motor adaptation by modulating spinal control parameters in response to mismatches between internal predictions and actual motor outcomes. In this work, the cerebellum modulates only a single spinal control parameter, the timing of swing initiation in each leg, which allows examining the specific contribution of cerebellar timing control to gait adaptation without confounding effects from changes in other reflex pathways. We created 80 s predictive simulations of the model walking on a split-belt treadmill with a 2:1 belt-speed ratio, and evaluated the results by comparing spatiotemporal parameters and kinematics with literature. The extended model adapted step length asymmetry from an initial asymmetric value toward symmetry or beyond, following an exponential time course similar to that observed in human experiments. The model was capable of adapting at varying rates and converging to different SLA levels, reflecting the inter-individual variability. The modulation of timing alone could drive SLA adaptation, but the modulation of reflex gains may likely be necessary to generate the experimentally observed exponential changes in the spatial domain of human split-belt adaptation. The modular framework can be extended or adapted to test different hypotheses about motor control and adaptations during continuous perturbation tasks.

Author summaryWhen persons walk on a treadmill with the belts running at two different speeds, they initially exhibit a high step length asymmetry, which is reduced within the course of minutes, often approaching zero or even reversing into the opposite direction with prolonged exposure to the perturbation. It is known that the cerebellum is involved in this process, but the exact neural mechanisms and interdependencies of the numerous interlimb and intralimb adaptation processes remain an ongoing research topic. Predictive neuromusculoskeletal simulations can advance our understanding of the adaptation process and interaction between different mechanisms. However, no current neuromusculoskeletal model includes a representation of cerebellar control capable of generating gradual step length adaptations in response to split-belt walking. In this work, we propose a biologically inspired model of the cerebellum integrated with a commonly used reflex model. The model exhibited step length adaptations similar to human split-belt walking behavior, including convergence to different levels of step length asymmetry. In addition, we found that while step length asymmetry can be adapted when the cerebellum only modulates the timing of swing initiation, changes in reflex gains may be necessary to reproduce the exponential changes observed in the spatial domain of human split-belt adaptation."
"Bats face a complex navigation challenge when emerging from densely populated roosts, where vast numbers take off at once in dark, confined spaces. Each bat must avoid collisions with walls and conspecifics while locating the exit, all amidst overlapping acoustic signals. This crowded environment creates the risk of acoustic jamming, in which the calls of neighboring bats interfere with echo detection, potentially obscuring vital information. Despite these challenges, bats navigate these conditions with remarkable success. Although bats have access to multiple sensory cues, here we focused on whether echolocation alone could provide sufficient information for orientation under such high-interference conditions. To explore whether and how they manage this challenge, we developed a sensorimotor model that mimics the bats echolocation behavior under high-density conditions. Our model suggests that the problem of acoustic jamming may be less severe than previously assumed. Frequent calls with short inter-pulse intervals (IPI) increase the sensory input flow, allowing integration of echoic information across multiple calls. When combined with simple movement-guidance strategies--such as following walls and avoiding nearby obstacles--this accumulated information enables effective navigation in dense acoustic environments. Together, these findings demonstrate a plausible mechanism by which bats may overcome acoustic interference and underscore the role of signal redundancy in supporting robust echolocation-based navigation. Beyond advancing our understanding of bat behavior, they also offer valuable insights for swarm robotics and collective movement in complex environments."
"Neurons in the primate ventral premotor cortex (VPC) respond to both tactile and acoustic stimuli, yet how they integrate and process information from these sensory modalities remains unclear. To investigate this, we recorded VPC neuronal activity in two trained monkeys performing a bimodal detection task (BDT), in which they reported the presence or absence of either a tactile or an acoustic stimulus. Single-cell analyses revealed diverse response types, including purely tactile, purely acoustic, bimodal, and neurons with sustained activity during the decision maintenance delay--the period between stimulus offset and motor response. To further examine VPCs role in the BDT, we applied dimensionality reduction techniques to uncover low-dimensional latent dynamics in the neuronal population and conducted parallel analyses using a recurrent neural network (RNN) model trained on the same task. Neural trajectories for tactile and acoustic responses diverged sharply, whereas in stimulus-absent trials, the dynamics remained at rest. During the delay period, the trajectories exhibited a pronounced rotational dynamic, shifting toward a subspace orthogonal to the sensory response space, suggesting memory maintenance through stable equilibria. This indicates that network dynamics can sustain distinct stable states corresponding to the three potential task outcomes. Using low-dimensional modeling, we propose a universal dynamical mechanism that underlies the transition from sensory processing to memory retention, aligning with both experimental and computational findings. These results demonstrate that VPC neurons encode bimodal information, integrate competing sensory inputs, and maintain decisions across the delay period, regardless of sensory modality."
"3Social behaviour is a key part of life for many species. In monogamously breeding species, social associations between breeding partners are particularly important. Selection of a breeding partner often begins well before reproduction, and this process can affect subsequent reproductive success. Thus, the non-breeding season can shape behaviour during the breeding season. However, it is currently unknown how breeding season outcomes can impact associate choice during the non-breeding season, as studying this requires high volumes of cross-context individual social data. This study used three years of wild great tit social data from Wytham Woods, Oxford, UK, to examine social associations between pairs classified with respect to prior and future breeding status (divorcing, faithful, new and juvenile). We found distinct patterns of social association in  divorcing pairs from early winter, suggesting that divorce is an ongoing behavioural process. Newly forming pairs initially associated similarly to divorcing pairs, but became similar to faithful pairs over time. On a finer spatiotemporal scale, the behaviour of faithful and divorcing birds diverged over the winter. These results provide the first evidence of a behavioural signature of divorce during the non-breeding season in great tits, while suggesting that different behaviours may drive behavioural divorce at different times."
"Numerous studies advocate for a rhythmic mode of perception. However, the evidence in the context of auditory perception remains inconsistent. We propose that the divergent conclusions drawn from previous work stem from conceptual and methodological issues. These include ambiguous assumptions regarding the origin of perceptual rhythmicity, variations in listening tasks and attentional demands, differing analytical approaches, and the reliance on fixed participant samples for statistical testing. To systematically address these points, we conducted a series of experiments in which human participants performed auditory tasks involving monaural target sounds presented against binaural white noise backgrounds, while also recording eye movements. These experiments varied in whether stimuli were presented randomly or required motor initialization by the participants, the necessity of memory across trials and the manipulation of attentional demands across modalities. Our findings challenge the notion of universal rhythmicity in hearing, but support the existence of paradigm- and ear-specific fluctuations in perceptual sensitivity and response bias that emerge at multiple frequencies. Notably, the rhythmicity for sounds in the left and right ears appears to be largely independent among participants, and the strength of rhythmicity in behavioural data is possibly linked to oculomotor activity and attentional requirements of the task. Overall, these results may help to resolve conflicting conclusions drawn in previous work and provide specific avenues for further studies into the rhythmicity of auditory perception."
"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)-associated high-grade gliomas (HGGs) harboring ATRX mutations exhibit an aggressive clinical phenotype, driven by heightened genomic instability and metabolic reprogramming. Existing therapies, including chemotherapy and radiotherapy, are limited by resistance mechanisms and formation of secondary malignancy, underscoring the need for novel therapeutic strategies. Here, we report the results of a high-throughput screening of 10,000 small molecules aimed at identifying compounds selectively targeting vulnerabilities associated with concurrent ATRX and NF1 loss. Among the screened compounds, K784-6195 (ChemDiv ID) emerged as a promising candidate, exhibiting marked selective cytotoxicity in NF1-associated glioma cell lines with ATRX deficiency (IC50 = 4.84 {micro}M). In comparison, wild-type ATRX sporadic glioma cell lines (U251) exhibited significantly reduced sensitivity to K784-6195 (IC50 = 37.03 {micro}M). However, ATRX knockout U251 glioma cells recapitulating concurrent ATRX and NF1 loss exhibited heightened susceptibility to K784-6195 (IC50 = 20-23 {micro}M) compared to their wild-type counterpart. Metabolomic analysis revealed that K784-6195 treatment impairs metabolic pathways, including the pentose phosphate pathway, glutamine metabolism, and redox homeostasis, leading to oxidative stress and impaired cell survival. These findings highlight K784-6195 as a promising candidate for therapeutic development, offering a targeted approach for the treatment of NF-1 associated HGGs with ATRX deficiency."
"The use of kinetic models of metabolism in design-build-learn-test cycles is limited despite their potential to guide and accelerate the optimization of cell factories. This is primarily due to difficulties in constructing kinetic models capable of capturing the complexities of the fermentation conditions. Building on recent advances in kinetic-model-based strain design, we present the rational metabolic engineering of an S. cerevisiae strain designed to overproduce p-coumaric acid (p-CA), an aromatic amino acid with valuable nutritional and therapeutic applications. To this end, we built nine kinetic models of an already engineered p-CA-producing strain by integrating different types of omics data and imposing physiological constraints pertinent to the strain. These nine models contained 268 mass balances involved in 303 reactions across four compartments and could reproduce the dynamic characteristics of the strain in batch fermentation simulations. We used constraint-based metabolic control analysis to generate combinatorial designs of 3 enzyme manipulations that could increase p-CA yield on glucose while ensuring that the resulting engineering strains did not deviate far from the reference phenotype. Among 39 unique designs, 10 proved robust across the phenotypic uncertainty of the models and could reliably increase p-CA yield in nonlinear simulations. We implemented these top 10 designs in a batch fermentation setting using a promoter-swapping strategy for down-regulations and plasmids for up-regulations. Eight out of the ten designs produced higher p-CA titers than the reference strain, with 19 - 32% increases at the end of fermentation. All eight designs also maintained at least 90% of the reference strains growth rate, indicating the critical role of the phenotypic constraint. The high experimental success of our in-silico predictions lays the foundation for accelerated design-build-test-learn cycles enabled by large-scale kinetic modeling."
"Biomolecular condensates, formed through liquid-liquid phase separation, play wide-ranging roles in cellular compartmentalization and biological processes. However, their transition from a functional liquid-like phase into a solid-like state - usually termed as condensate ageing - represents a hallmark associated with the onset of multiple neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we design a computational pipeline to explore potential candidates, in the form of small peptides, to regulate ageing kinetics in biomolecular condensates. By combining equilibrium and non-equilibrium simulations of a sequence-dependent residue-resolution force field, we investigate the impact of peptide insertion - with different composition, patterning, and net charge - in the condensate phase diagram and ageing kinetics of archetypal proteins driving condensate ageing: TDP-43 and FUS. We reveal that small peptides composed of a specific balance of aromatic and charged residues can substantially decelerate ageing over an order of magnitude. The mechanism is controlled through condensate density reduction induced by peptide self-repulsive electrostatic interactions that specifically target protein regions prone to form cross-{beta}-sheet fibrils. Our work proposes an efficient computational framework to rapidly scan the impact of small molecule insertion in condensate ageing and develop novel pathways for controlling phase transitions relevant to disease prevention."
"Social interaction perception and theory of mind (ToM) frequently co-occur, but their commonalities and distinctions at behavioral and neural levels remain unclear. Participants (N = 231) provided moment-by-moment ratings of four text and four audio narratives on social interactions and ToM engagement, which were reliable (split-half r = .98 and .92, respectively) but only modestly correlated (r = .32). In a second sample (N = 90), we analyzed the co-variation between social interaction and ToM ratings and fMRI activity during text and audio narratives. Social interaction and ToM activity maps generalized across modalities (spatial r = .83 and .57, respectively), both with significant, overlapping clusters in canonical mentalizing regions (FDR q < .01). ToM uniquely engaged the lateral occipitotemporal cortex, left anterior intraparietal sulcus, and right premotor cortex. These results suggest that perceiving social interactions automatically involves mentalizing, and ToM additionally engages brain regions for action understanding and executive functions."
"Pollinators navigate complex and heterogeneous ""flower markets"", where floral resources vary in quality, availability, and spatial distribution. Bumblebees, as generalist foragers, visit numerous flowers during their foraging bouts, yet the factors influencing their flower choices and the individual differences in foraging behaviour remain poorly understood. Here, we tested how bees adjust their foraging in response to different reward structures. Bombus terrestris workers completed three foraging bouts in two artificial flower environments: one simulating a favourable environment with patches alternating high- and low-quality flowers (40% vs. 20% w/w sucrose solution), and the other a challenging environment with high-quality flowers alongside unrewarded ones (40% w/w sucrose solution vs. plain water). We hypothesised that bees would improve their foraging efficiency in both environments, but more rapidly in the more extreme one, where the greater reward difference creates stronger pressure to learn quickly. In both conditions, bees increased their sucrose intake per unit time over bouts. We also observed consistent differences in flower selectivity among individuals: in the favourable environment, bees that first visited high-quality flowers focused on them and avoided low-quality ones (became ""picky""), while bees that first visited low-quality flowers kept visiting both types. Despite these differences, bees across environments and pickiness levels all reached similar sucrose intake rates by the third foraging bout, either by becoming more selective, collecting more sucrose solution, or reducing time spent foraging. These findings highlight the adaptability of bee foraging and suggest that early flower experiences contribute to lasting individual differences in foraging behaviour.

Significance statementBumblebees are highly efficient pollinators of wild plants and commercial crops, yet their foraging behaviour varies notably among individuals. Understanding why bees differ in their foraging decisions is crucial, as it affects how they collect resources. We show that individual Bombus terrestris workers rapidly adapt to flower patches with different reward qualities. Remarkably, a bees first flower visits have lasting effects: individuals that started with high-quality flowers consistently favoured them and avoided low-quality ones, while those that started with low-quality flowers continued to visit both types over time. Despite these differences, bees reached similar nectar intake rates after just three foraging trips, regardless of how selective they were. Our findings show that bees can quickly adjust their foraging behaviour, and that early experiences play a key role in how they exploit resources across different environments."
"Among species reproducing sexually, mating strategies represent a major component of individual fitness. The Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) is an extremely diverse set of genes responsible for immunological recognition and defence against pathogens. Although MHC dissimilarity between mates has been proposed to drive mate choice through increased offspring pathogen resistance, evidence is mixed. In addition, exploration of the role of MHC in other mating strategies, such as divorce, is rare. We investigated whether MHC-IIB dissimilarity is associated with mate choice and divorce probability in the genetically monogamous black-legged kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla). We found that first-time male breeders, as well as divorced males, were paired with more MHC-IIB dissimilar females than expected under random mating. We did not find evidence for mate choice based on MHC-IIB dissimilarity when considering females. In addition, in the studied population, divorce probability was very low compared to other populations and did not significantly vary with the MHC-IIB dissimilarity of the pair. Our results pave the way to a better understanding of the complex role of MHC dissimilarity in mating decisions of species displaying mutual choice and biparental care."
"The Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a mosquito-borne, enveloped flavivirus that causes acute encephalitis. Although JEV is increasingly recognized as a global threat, there is currently no FDA-approved treatment available for JEV. 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC) is an oxysterol produced through the oxidation of cholesterol, a process catalyzed by cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H), which is an interferon-stimulated gene that is upregulated during viral infections. In this study, we report for the first time that 25HC effectively prevents JEV infection in cells. Our results show that 25HC inhibits JEV infection in Vero cells with an IC50 of ~ 3.7 micro molar, while displaying no cell toxicity (CC50 > 50 micro molar). Given the antiviral effects of 25HC against Zika and Dengue viruses, our findings suggest that 25 HC could be a promising candidate for the development of broad-spectrum anti-flaviviral therapeutics."
"Avian Pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) are a genetically diverse pathotype primarily associated with extra-intestinal infections in birds. APEC lineages are predicted to have unique metabolic capabilities contributing to virulence and survival in the host environment. Here we present a genome-scale metabolic model for the APEC pathotype based on 114 APEC genome sequences, and lineage-specific models for the phylogroups B2, C and G based on a representative isolate for each phylogroup. A total of 1,848 metabolic reactions were predicted in the 114 APEC isolates before gap filling and manual correction. Of these, 89% represented core reactions, whilst the 11% accessory reactions were mostly associated with carbon and nitrogen metabolism. Predictions of auxotrophy were confirmed by inactivation of the conditionally essential lysA and the non-essential potE genes. The APEC metabolic model outperformed the E. coli K-12 iJO1366 model in the Biolog Phenotypic Array platform. Sub-models specific for phylogroups B2, C and G predicted differences in the metabolism of 3-hydroxyphenylacetate (3-HPAA), a phenolic acid derived from the flavonoid quercetin, which is commonly added to poultry feed. Two 3-HPAA associated reactions/genes distinguished APEC phylogroup C from APEC phylogroups B2 and G, and 3-HPAA supported the growth of APEC phylogroup C in minimal media, but not phylogroups B2 and G. In conclusion, we have constructed genome-scale metabolic models for the three major APEC phylogroups B2, C and G, and have identified a metabolic pathway distinguishing phylogroup C APEC. This demonstrates the importance of lineage- and pathotype-specific metabolic models when investigating genetically diverse microbial pathogens."
"Hydrothermal vents can serve as natural laboratories to study speciation processes due to their fragmented distribution often with geographic barriers between habitats. Two sympatric species of Rimicaris shrimps occur at vents on the Izu-Bonin-Mariana volcanic arc: Rimicaris loihi also occurs near Hawaii and R. cambonae is present on the Tonga Arc. These two species biogeographically co-occur and are genetically similar, raising questions about their speciation mechanism, how they maintain distinct species, and whether interbreeding occurs. Here, we use barcoding and shotgun sequencing to test their genetic isolation and investigate their speciation process. We also evaluate population demography over 10 years to assess population densities and sex ratios at vents. Our results support R. cambonae and R. loihi as two distinct species despite sympatry throughout part of their range. We also observed regional-scale genetic structure among R. loihi populations from the Izu-Bonin-Mariana volcanic arc despite their broad geographic distribution. Finally, we found concomitant variations of shrimp densities and genetic diversity following fluctuations in geological and venting activities over a decade. A combination of geological instability, ocean currents dynamics and sea-level changes might drive temporary isolation among these local populations. We suggest similar factors, with longer isolation periods, may also have promoted speciation between the two Rimicaris species whereas distinct life-history traits could strengthen and maintain reproductive barriers. Overall, our results indicate different connectivity patterns on a volcanic arc that contrast with those observed previously at vents from mid-ocean ridges or back-arc basins systems."
"A/B toxins are a diverse family of protein toxins that enter host cells via endocytosis and induce cell death. In yeast, the A/B toxin K28 is internalised to endosomes of susceptible yeast, before following the retrograde trafficking pathway and ultimately triggering cell cycle arrest. The endolysosomal defence factor Ktd1 protects against K28, but its regulation remains unclear. Cog7, a subunit of the conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) tethering complex, has been implicated in K28 defence, though the mechanism is unknown. We developed a high throughput K28 sensitivity assay and bespoke analysis package to show that all lobe B COG subunits (Cog5 - 8) are required for K28 resistance. Although the COG complex modulates glycosylation of the surface molecules required to bind extracellular K28, our experiments reveal that the hypersensitivity of cog mutants is primarily explained by defects in Ktd1 trafficking. Ktd1 mis-localisation in cog mutants is reminiscent to disruptions in Snc1, a surface cargo that recycles multiple times via the Golgi. This work suggests not only that the COG complex is responsible for the precise trafficking Ktd1 required to mediate toxin defence, but that Ktd1 may survey endolysosomal compartments for internalised K28. This work underpins the importance of Ktd1 in defence against the A/B toxin K28, and implies various membrane trafficking regulators might influence toxin effects in other eukaryotic systems."
"Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) is widely used for quantitative analysis of metabolic systems. Accurate extraction of NMR signal parameters such as chemical shift, intensity, coupling constants, and linewidth is essential for obtaining information on the structure, concentration, and isotopic composition of metabolites. We present MultiNMRFit, an open-source software designed for high throughput analysis of one-dimensional NMR spectra, whether acquired individually or as pseudo 2D experiments. MultiNMRFit extracts signal parameters (e.g. intensity, area, chemical shift, and coupling constants) by fitting the experimental spectra using built in or user-defined signal models that account for multiplicity, providing high flexibility along with robust and reproducible results. The software is accessible both as a Python library and via a graphical user interface, enabling intuitive use by end users with or without computational expertise. We demonstrate the robustness and flexibility of MultiNMRFit on 1H, 13C, and 31P NMR datasets collected in metabolomics and isotope labeling studies."
"1O_LIPredator-prey interactions in natural communities are complex, with predators often exploiting multiple prey types and generating indirect interactions among them. Ecological theory has traditionally modeled these interactions using functional responses models which are based on foraging rates, not energy transfers. This approach overlooks how the energy acquisition rate of a predator can alter its behavior and, in turn, the strength of species interactions.
C_LIO_LIHere, we integrate predator energetics into a functional response model to represent trade-offs predators face when foraging on prey that vary in risk and abundance across heterogeneous landscapes. We compared model predictions to 20 years of prey species density and reproductive success data. The mechanistic model was parameterized for an Arctic tundra vertebrate community, where the Arctic fox feeds on cyclic lemmings and eggs of sandpipers (non-risky prey) and gulls (risky prey that often nest in partial refuge like islands). In this system, predator-mediated interactions generate apparent mutualism between lemmings and birds, but its strength varies between species, and the mechanisms underlying this interaction remain unclear.
C_LIO_LIWe found that fox energetic balance was highly related to lemming density, with a threshold of 89 lemmings per km2 required for a positive energetic balance. Model-predicted gull nest acquisition rates were lowest on islands when the energetic balance of foxes was positive, and highest for nests on the shore when foxes were in deficit. The model that incorporated predator risk-taking behavior and energetic balance produced variation in gull hatching success that most closely matched empirical observations.
C_LIO_LIWe documented for the first time that a shift in predator energetic balance, triggering changes in attack and capture probabilities on a risky prey, can be a key mechanism underlying the apparent mutualism between lemmings and gulls. In contrast, for non-risky prey, the indirect effect can be essentially driven by changes in predator movement. These findings highlight how prey characteristics can lead to different mechanisms behind similar indirect interactions.
C_LIO_LITaken together, our results indicate that mechanistic models integrating species traits, landscape features, and energy-dependent behavioral adjustments can improve our ability to quantify interaction strengths in natural communities.

"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) begins with simple steatosis, which can progress to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The pathogenesis of MASLD alters the secretion of hepatokines such as fibrinogen-like 1 (FGL1), a candidate mediator of liver steatosis and hyperglycemia. To investigate the contribution of FGL1 to liver diseases, we compared wild-type mice to mice with hepatocyte-specific deletion of Fgl1 subjected to a steatosis or HCC experimental protocol. We found that mice deficient for Fgl1 in hepatocytes showed higher levels of plasma glucose, pronounced metabolic alterations and liver injury when fed a western diet compared to their wild-type counterparts. However, both genotypes exhibited a similar lipid deposition in the liver. Similarly, wild type and Fgl1-deficient mice displayed comparable liver alterations during HCC progression. We observed that FGL1 expression was repressed during MASLD progression in mice and human concomitantly with the severity of liver injury. Altogether, these findings suggest that FGL1 is not a major contributor to the pathogenesis of MASLD and HCC."
"The actin cytoskeleton forms a mesh-like network that drives cellular deformations. The network property is defined by the network density and the species of actin-binding proteins. However, the relationship between the network density, the penetration ability of actin-binding proteins into the network, and resulting network dynamics remains elusive. Here, we report an in vitro optogenetic system, named OptoVCA, which induces Arp2/3 complex-mediated actin network assembly on a lipid membrane. By changing the illumination power, duration, and pattern, the OptoVCA flexibly manipulates the density, thickness, and shape of the actin network. Taking these advantages, we examine the effects of the network density on two representative actin-binding proteins, myosin and ADF/cofilin. We find that the penetration of myosin filaments into the network is strictly inhibited by only a several-fold increase in network density due to the steric hindrance. Furthermore, penetrated myosin filaments induce directional actin flow when the network has a density gradient. On the other hand, ADF/cofilin penetrates into the network regardless of network density. However, network disassembly is dramatically inhibited by only a several-fold increase in network density. Thus, the OptoVCA contributes to understanding cell mechanics by examining the network density-dependent effects on actin-binding proteins."
"The degeneration of midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons disrupts the neural control of natural behavior, such as walking, posture, and gait in Parkinsons disease. While some aspects of motor symptoms can be managed by dopamine replacement therapies, others respond poorly. Recent advancements in machine learning-based technologies offer opportunities to better understand the organizing principles of behavior modules at fine time scales and its dependence on dopaminergic modulation. In the present study, we applied the motion sequencing (MoSeq) platform to study the spontaneous locomotor activities of neurotoxin and genetic mouse models of Parkinsonism as the midbrain DA neurons progressively degenerate. We also evaluated the treatment efficacy of levodopa (L-DOPA) on behavioral modules at fine time scales. We revealed robust changes in the kinematics and usage of the behavioral modules that encode spontaneous locomotor activity. Further analysis demonstrates that fast behavioral modules with higher velocities were more vulnerable to loss of DA and preferentially affected at early stages of Parkinsonism. Last, L-DOPA effectively improved the velocity, but not the usage and transition probability, of behavioral modules in Parkinsonian animals. In conclusion, the hypokinetic phenotypes in Parkinsonism involve the decreased velocities of behavioral modules and their disrupted temporal organization during movement. Moreover, we showed that the therapeutic effect of L-DOPA is mainly mediated by its effect on the velocities of behavior modules at fine time scales. This work documents robust changes in the velocity, usage, and temporal organization of behavioral modules and their responsiveness to dopaminergic treatment under the Parkinsonian state.

Significance StatementParkinsons disease is the second largest neurodegenerative disease without a cure. Detection of subtle Parkinsonian signs is critical for disease-modification by applying early interventions. The present work explores the possibility of using machine learning-based approaches for early detection of subtle behavioral changes in Parkinsonian animals and evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of dopaminergic medications."
"Glutamate dehydrogenases (GDHs) catalyze the oxidative deamination of L-glutamate to 2-oxoglutarate using NAD(P)+ as a cofactor. The large type of GDHs (L-GDHs) displays a dynamic homotetrameric architecture that alternates between open and closed states. However, the catalytic mechanism and the functional relevance of the large conformational changes in L-GDHs remain poorly understood. Here, we use cryoEM to investigate the structure and the conformational landscape of the mycobacterial L-GDH composed of 180 kDa subunits (mL-GDH180) when incubated with L-glutamate and NAD+. Classification of the heterogeneous population of tetramers reveals opening-closing motions and sorting of individual subunits resolves the occupancy of the cofactor and substrate binding pockets. CryoEM maps show that ligand binding to the glutamate binding pocket is accompanied by structural changes in a region approximately two nanometers away from the active site, leading to the formation of a previously undetected interaction between the catalytic domains of neighboring subunits in mL-GDH180 closed tetrameric states. Our findings indicate that the occupancy of the substrate binding site of mL-GDH180 is linked to a remodeling of both the tertiary and quaternary structure of the enzyme."
"What are the principles that govern the responses of cortical networks to their inputs and the emergence of these responses from recurrent connectivity? Recent experiments have probed these questions by measuring cortical responses to two-photon optogenetic perturbations of single cells in the mouse primary visual cortex. A robust theoretical framework is needed to determine the implications of these responses for cortical recurrence. Here we propose a novel analytical approach: a formulation of the dependence of cell-type-specific connectivity on spatial distance that yields an exact solution for the linear perturbation response of a model with multiple cell types and space-and feature-dependent connectivity. Importantly and unlike previous approaches, the solution is valid in regimes of strong as well as weak intra-cortical coupling. Analysis reveals the structure of connectivity implied by various features of single-cell perturbation responses, such as the surprisingly narrow spatial radius of nearby excitation beyond which inhibition dominates, the number of transitions between mean excitation and inhibition thereafter, and the dependence of these responses on feature preferences. Comparison of these results to existing optogenetic perturbation data yields constraints on cell-type-specific connection strengths and their tuning dependence. Finally, we provide experimental predictions regarding the response of inhibitory neurons to single-cell perturbations and the modulation of perturbation response by neuronal gain.

Significance StatementThe cerebral cortex is strongly re-currently connected with complex wiring rules. This circuitry can now be probed by studying responses to optogenetic perturbations of one or small numbers of cells. How-ever, we currently lack a general theory connecting these responses to underlying circuitry. Here we develop a novel, exactly solvable theory to determine responses to small perturbations from the underlying connectivity. Analysis of these equations reveals simple rules that govern perturbation response patterns. Comparison with experimental data yields new constraints on the connectivity parameters. The theory yields predictions for the responses of unmeasured cell types and in new experimental conditions."
"We employ a computational framework that integrates mathematical programming and graph neural networks to elucidate functional phenotypic heterogeneity in disease by classifying entire pathways under various conditions of interest. Our approach combines two distinct, yet seamlessly integrated, modeling schemes. First, we leverage Prior Knowledge Networks (PKNs) to reconstruct gene networks from genomic and transcriptomic data. We demonstrate how this can be achieved through mathematical programming optimization and provide examples using comprehensive established databases. We then tailor Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to classify each network as a single data point at graph-level, using various node embeddings and edge attributes. These networks may vary in their biological or molecular annotations, which serves as a labeling scheme for their supervised classification. We apply the framework to the human DNA damage and repair pathway using the TP53 regulon in a pancancer study across cell-lines and tumor samples to classify Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) across different TP53 mutation types. This approach allows us to identify mutations with distinguishable functional profiles which can be related to specific phenotypes, thus providing a data-driven pipeline for genotype-to-phenotype translation. This scalable approach enables the classification of diverse conditions within the multi-factorial nature of diseases and disentangles their polygenic complexity by revealing new functional patterns through a causal representation."
"Sorting spikes from noisy single-channel in-vivo extracellular recordings is challenging, particularly due to the lack of ground truth data. Microneurography, an electrophysiological technique for studying peripheral sensory systems, employs experimental protocols that time-lock a subset of spikes. Stable propagation speed of nerve signals enables reliable sorting of these spikes. Leveraging this property, we established ground truth labels for data collected in two European laboratories and designed a proof-of-concept open-source pipeline to process data across diverse hardware and software systems. Using the labels derived from the time-locked spikes, we employed a supervised approach instead of the unsupervised methods typically used in spike sorting.

We evaluated multiple low-dimensional representations of spikes and found that raw signal features outperformed more complex approaches, which are effective in brain recordings. However, the choice of the optimal features remained dataset-specific, influenced by the similarity of average spike shapes and the number of fibers contributing to the signal.

Based on our findings, we recommend tailoring lightweight algorithms to individual recordings and assessing the ""sortability feasibility"" based on achieved accuracy and the research question before proceeding with sorting of non-time-locked spikes in future projects."
"HTT1a was identified in human and mouse Huntingtons disease brain as the pathogenic exon 1 mRNA generated from aberrant splicing between exon 1 and 2 of HTT that contributes to aggregate formation and neuronal dysfunction.1 Detection of the huntingtin exon 1 protein (HTT1a) has been accomplished with fluorescence-based reporter assays (Meso Scale Discovery, Homogeneous Time Resolved Fluorescence) and immunoprecipitation assays in Huntingtons disease knock-in mice but direct detection in homogenates by gel electrophoresis and western blot assay has been lacking. Subcellular fractions prepared from mouse and human Huntingtons disease brain were separated by gel electrophoresis and probed by western blot with neo-epitope monoclonal antibodies 1B12 and 11G2 directed to the C-terminal eight residues of HTT1a. In caudate putamen of an allelic series of 6 month old Huntingtons disease knock-in mice (Q50, Q80, Q111, Q140 and Q175) HTT1a migration was inversely correlated with CAG repeat length and appeared as a SDS soluble high molecular mass smear in Q111, Q140 and Q175 mice but weakly in Q80 and not in WT mice or Q50 indicating a CAG repeat size threshold for detecting HTT1a. HTT1a immunoreactivity diminished if 1B12 and 11G2 antibodies were preincubated with an eight amino acid peptide containing the C-terminus of HTT1a but not with unrelated peptide sequence. Migration of HTT1a and its high molecular mass smear changed with age in caudate putamen of Q111, Q175 and YAC128 mice. Treating Q111 mice with siRNA to MSH3, a modifier of CAG repeat expansion, significantly reduced levels of the high molecular mass smear indicating that the effects of curbing CAG repeat expansion were quantifiable. A prominent 56-60 kDa doublet detected by 1B12 and 11G2 antibodies in lysates from human Huntingtons disease brain was not blocked by preincubation with C-terminal HTT1a blocking peptide and also appeared in brains of Parkinsons disease patients. 1B12 and 11G2 antibodies did not immunoprecipitate HTT proteins from either Huntingtons disease mouse or human brain lysates using conditions that pulled down full length HTT with anti-HTT antibody 2B7. Altogether these data show that 11G2 and 1B12 antibodies can be used in western blot assays to track and quantify immunoreactive HTT1a levels, solubility, and subcellular localization in Huntingtons disease mouse brain.

Abbreviated SummarySapp et al., report that pathogenic exon 1 protein HTT1a is detected in brain of mouse models of Huntingtons disease by direct western blot assay using monoclonal antibodies 11G2 and 1B12. Lowering MSH3 mRNA in the caudate putamen to prevent CAG repeat expansion reduced levels of HTT1a."
"Crosslinked cytoskeletal filament networks provide cells with a mechanism to regulate cellular mechanics and force transmission. An example in the microtubule cytoskeleton is mitotic spindle elongation. The three-dimensional geometry of these networks, including the overlap length and lateral microtubule spacing, likely controls how forces can be regulated, but how these parameters evolve during filament sliding is unknown. Recent evidence suggests that the crosslinker PRC1 can resist microtubule sliding by two distinct modes: a braking mode and a less resistive coasting mode. To explore how molecular-scale mechanisms influence network geometry in this system, we developed a computational model of sliding microtubule pairs crosslinked by PRC1 that reproduces the experimentally observed braking and coasting modes. Surprisingly, we found that the braking mode was associated with a substantially smaller lateral separation between the crosslinked microtubules than the coasting mode. This closer separation aligns the PRC1-mediated forces against sliding, increasing the resistive PRC1 force and dramatically reducing sliding speed. The model also finds an emergent similar average sliding speed due to PRC1 resistance, because higher initial sliding speed favors the transition to braking. Together, our results highlight the importance of the three-dimensional geometric relationships between crosslinkers and microtubules."
"Iron (Fe) and water availability are closely interlinked, with deficiencies in both adversely affecting soybean growth. However, the strategies employed by soybean to tolerate such conditions remain poorly understood. This study elucidates the interactions of host factors, and microbial associations using multi-omics approaches in Clark (tolerant) and Arisoy (sensitive) genotypes exposed to Fe deficiency and drought. Clark exhibited resilience to stress through sustained osmotic regulation, nutrient uptake, and photosynthetic activity, in contrast to Arisoy. Particularly, Fe retention in Clark, accompanied by the upregulation of ferritin-like proteins, may mitigate oxidative stress by reducing Fenton reactions. Furthermore, higher jasmonic and salicylic acid levels in Clark may contribute to its enhanced stress adaptation compared to Arisoy. RNA-seq analysis revealed 818 and 500 upregulated, along with 931 and 361 downregulated genes, in the roots of Clark and Arisoy, respectively, under stress. We observed the upregulation of symbiotic genes, such as Chalcone-flavonone isomerase 1 and SWEET10, accompanied by increased rhizosphere siderophore and root flavonoid in Clark. This indicates a significant role of microbes in mediating differential stress tolerance in soybean. Particularly, the combined stress led to distinct root and nodule microbiome dynamics, with Clark recruiting beneficial microbes such as Variovorax and Paecilomyces, whereas Arisoy exhibited the opposite pattern. In addition, Clark maintained nodule Bradyrhizobium and tissue nitrogen status, supported by ammonium retention and induction of Ammonium transporter 1 in the roots. Furthermore, in vitro compatibility between V. paradoxus and P. lilacinus suggests a synergistic interaction, with their localized signals benefiting Clark. Remarkably, enriched microbiomes significantly improved growth parameters, accompanied by elevated rhizosphere siderophore in sensitive genotypes under stress. This study is the first to uncover mechanisms of dual stress tolerance in soybean that may offer promising targets for breeding programs and microbiome-based biofertilizer strategies to improve combined stress tolerance in soybean and other legumes.

HighlightIron retention coupled with symbiotic associations driven by the enrichment of Variovorax and Paecilomyces in the roots confers tolerance to combined iron deficiency and drought in soybean."
"While the embodiment of non-human body parts is well-established, the precise conditions that facilitate this remain incompletely understood. One critical yet underexplored factor is whether the non-human body part affords greater or lesser functionality than its biological counterpart. This study investigated how the sensorimotor capabilities of a dynamic virtual arm modulate the experience of embodiment. Given that childrens body representations are widely considered to be more flexible than those of adults, they may be especially suited to embodying functionally altered virtual bodies. To test this, both child and adult participants engaged in goal-directed forward reaching movements with a virtual arm to feed animals within an immersive virtual environment. Reaching functionality was systematically manipulated via changes in visual gain, adjusting the arms length and functionality from a normal (100%) condition, to be slightly reduced (80%); slightly increased (120%); or markedly increased (400%). Our findings reveal that extreme alterations in reaching functionality (400% visual gain) significantly reduced subjective ratings of limb ownership, an effect most evident in adult participants. Despite these perceptual disruptions, participants across all ages adjusted their reach kinematics in ways that reflected an integration of the virtual arms perceived capabilities with the physical limitations of their own bodies. Interestingly, children responded to the altered embodiment with more cautious and less refined movement strategies than adults, suggesting developmental differences in adaptive motor control over non-human bodies. Moreover, across both age groups, exposure to functionally enhanced virtual arms led to increased subjective estimates of reaching affordances, highlighting the influence of altered sensorimotor feedback on perceived action capabilities. Collectively, these results demonstrate that the sense of body ownership, the accuracy of body representations, and the properties of sensorimotor control are closely associated with bodily function. Moreover, while children may exhibit greater tolerance to functional alterations in terms of perceived ownership, they do not show superior motor control. These findings reveal that sensorimotor function and developmental factors interact to shape the boundaries of embodiment in virtual contexts."
"Sensory rhythmic stimulation enhances executive functions by entraining oscillations in higher- order cortical networks, but its effects on subcortical structures remain unclear. We propose that stimulus valence is a key feature to enable subcortical entrainment. Using intracranial EEG in epileptic patients, we first show that visual search is supported by cortico-subcortical theta (5Hz) activity. We then show that 5 Hz negative-valence visual stimulation entrains theta oscillations in a task-related network, including the ventral visual stream, hippocampus, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Finally, in a behavioral experiment in healthy individuals, we show that both neutral and negative valence 5 Hz stimulation improved visual search speed, but only negative valence stimulation enhanced target image recognition as assessed through an additional memory task. These findings highlight the role of stimulus valence in modulating subcortical brain activity and behaviors through rhythmic sensory stimulation and pave the way for further applications in clinical intervention."
"The Chiari II brain malformation affects 90% of children with open spina bifida. The hindbrain herniates through the foramen magnum into the vertebral canal leading to frequent hydrocephalus and occasional respiratory emergency. Chiari II is not confined to the back of the brain, but is a global brain syndrome with cerebral cortical and other defects implicated in learning disability, which affects 20-25% of children with open spina bifida. The reason for the association between Chiari II and spina bifida has long been debated. Separate effects on the brain and spinal cord of causative genetic or non-genetic factor(s) are possible. Conversely, Chiari II may be secondary to open spina bifida, and a prominent hypothesis cites chronic leakage of cerebrospinal fluid through the open spinal lesion as causative. To resolve the issue of causation, we bred mice in which Pax3 gene function is conditionally deleted by Cdx2cre, specifically in the lower body, leaving the head genetically intact. Open spina bifida is seen in all Cdx2cre/+; Pax3fl/fl fetuses, together with many of the features of Chiari II in the wild-type brain of the mice. These include: hindbrain and cerebellar herniation, cortical thinning, callosal and hippocampal hypogenesis, heterotopic neurons in the cerebral cortex and habenula, and thickening of the ventricular zone. We conclude that the brain defects of Chiari II arise secondary to open spina bifida, with the implication that these may occur early in human gestation through disturbed neurogenesis. The Cdx2cre/+; Pax3fl/fl mouse provides a model for improved understanding of Chiari II pathogenesis."

"New reference genomes and transcriptomes are increasingly available across the tree of life, opening new avenues to tackle exciting questions. However, there are still challenges associated with annotating genomes and inferring evolutionary processes and with a lack of methodological standardisation. Here, we propose a new workflow designed for evolutionary analyses to overcome these challenges, facilitating the detection of recombination suppression and its consequences in terms of rearrangements and transposable element accumulation. To do so, we assemble multiple bioinformatic steps in a single easy-to-use workflow. We combine state-of-the-art tools to detect transposable elements, annotate genomes, infer gene orthology relationships, compute divergence between sequences, infer evolutionary strata (i.e., footprints of stepwise extension of recombination suppression) and their structural rearrangements, and visualise the results. This workflow, called EASYstrata, was applied to reannotate 42 published genomes from Microbotryum fungi. We show in further case examples from a plant and an animal that we recover the same strata as previously described. While this tool was developed with the goal to infer divergence between sex or mating-type chromosomes, it can be applied to any pair of haplotypes whose patteern of divergence is of interest. This workflow will facilitate the study of non-model species for which newly sequenced phased diploid genomes are becoming available.

"During embryonic development, cells undergo differentiation into highly specialized cell types. Capitalizing on single-cell RNA sequencing, many initiatives and substantial resources have been established for cataloguing these differentiated cell types by their transcriptomic profiles. Despite the extensive efforts to profile various organs and their cellular compositions, we lack metrics to assess the completeness of the sequencing projects. In this cellular biodiversity analysis, we leveraged the increasingly available single-cell data together with statistical methods, originally developed for assessing the species richness of ecological communities, to estimate the cellular diversity of any organ based on current data from single-cell profiling technologies. Deriving from such cellular richness estimates, we established a practical statistical framework that enables reliable assessment of the completeness of any large-scale single-cell profiling projects, after which additional sequencing efforts do not anymore reveal new insights into an organs cellular composition. Such estimates can serve as stoppage-points for the ongoing sequencing projects, hence guiding a more cost-efficient completion of the profiling of various human tissues."
"Hypoxia is both a physiological and pathological signal in cells. Changes in gene expression play a critical role in the cellular response to hypoxia, enabling cells to adapt to reduced oxygen availability by regulating metabolism, survival and angiogenesis. These changes are primarily mediated by the HIF family of transcription factors, however other transcription factors such as NF-{kappa}B, are also activated by hypoxia. Although NF-{kappa}B is known to be activated under hypoxic conditions the extent to which NF-{kappa}B contributes to the hypoxic response remains poorly understood. In this study we analysed hypoxia-induced, NF-{kappa}B-dependent gene expression, to define the NF-{kappa}B-dependent hypoxic signature. Our analysis reveals that a significant proportion of hypoxia-induced gene expression changes are NF-{kappa}B dependent, with the majority of genes downregulated by hypoxia requiring NF-{kappa}B for their repression. We show that, while the NF-{kappa}B-mediated hypoxic response may vary between cell types, there are a core subset of hypoxia-inducible genes that require NF-{kappa}B across multiple cell backgrounds. We demonstrate that NF-{kappa}B is critical for reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and regulation of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation under hypoxic conditions. This work highlights that NF-{kappa}B has a central role in the hypoxia response, regulating a broader set of genes than previously thought, providing new understanding of the regulation of gene expression by hypoxia and NF-{kappa}B."
"Retroviruses cause significant diseases in humans and animals, including the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and a wide range of malignancies. A crucial yet poorly understood step in the replication cycle is the recognition and selection of unspliced viral RNA (USvRNA) by the retroviral Gag protein, which binds to the psi ({Psi}) packaging sequence in the 5 leader, to package it as genomic RNA (gRNA) into nascent virions. It was previously thought that Gag initially bound gRNA in the cytoplasm. However, previous studies demonstrated that the Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) Gag protein traffics transiently through the nucleus, which is necessary for efficient gRNA packaging. These data formed a strong premise for the hypothesis that Gag selects nascent gRNA at transcription sites in the nucleus, the highest concentration of USvRNA molecules in the cell. To test this hypothesis, we used single molecule labeling and imaging techniques to visualize fluorescently-tagged, actively transcribing viral genomes, and Gag proteins in living cells. Gag foci were observed in the nucleus, transiently co-localizing with USvRNA at transcriptional burst sites, and forming viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (vRNPs). Furthermore, we found that RSV Gag interacts with Med26 and CTCF in the nucleus, suggesting a possible role for these factors in trafficking Gag to transcription sites. These results support a novel paradigm for retroviral assembly in which Gag traffics to transcriptional burst sites and interacts with nascent USvRNA through a dynamic kissing interaction to capture gRNA for incorporation into virions.

ImportanceRetroviruses depend upon host cell transcription machinery to synthesize USvRNA, which serves as the genome selected by Gag for packaging. We previously reported that RSV Gag undergoes transient nucleocytoplasmic trafficking, which is needed for optimal genome packaging and co-localizes with USvRNA in the nucleus. Here, using live cell imaging, we found that the association of Gag with USvRNA at the transcriptional burst site is transient and dynamic. Both Gag and the RSV transcriptional burst are located near the periphery of the nucleus, which may facilitate viral RNA export. Our data also suggest that host transcription-associated factors may play a role in trafficking Gag to transcription sites."
"Voltage-dependence gating of ion channels underlies numerous physiological and pathophysiological processes, and disruption of normal voltage gating is the cause of many channelopathies. Here, long timescale atomistic simulations were performed to directly probe voltage-induced gating transitions of the big potassium (BK) channels, where the voltage sensor domain (VSD) movement has been suggested to be distinct from that of canonical Kv channels but remains poorly understood. Using a Core-MT construct without the gating ring, multiple voltage activation transitions were observed at 750 mV, allowing detailed analysis of the activated state of BK VSD and key mechanistic features. Even though the S4 helix remains the principal voltage sensor in BK, its vertical displacement is only [~]3 [A] and accompanied by significant lateral movements. The nature of the predicted VSD movement is in strong agreement with recent Cryo-EM structural studies of mutant BK channels with constitutively activated VSD. Free energy analysis based on the predicted activation transition yielded a total gating charge of 0.44 e per VSD, consistent with the experimental range of 0.48 - 0.65 e. We further show that the ability of modest physical movements with a small total gating charge to drive effective voltage gating of BK can be attributed to large gradients in the local electric field as reshaped by the protein. Furthermore, the S4 movement is coupled to the pore opening through a non-canonical pathway that involves the tightly packed S4-S5-S6 interface. These distinct mechanistic features may be relevant to voltage gating of other ion channels where VSDs are not domain-swapped with respect to the pore-gate domain.

Significance StatementThe big potassium (BK) channel is the only potassium channel that integrates intracellular calcium signaling with membrane depolarization. It is considered one of the most important channels in cardiovascular and neurological disorders. It has been known that voltage gating of BK channels has distinct features compared to the canonical voltage gating mechanism established through studies of voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels. Yet, little is known about the molecular nature of voltage sensing and pore activation of BK channels at present. Our work reports the first successful direct simulation of voltage-dependent activation of the big potassium (BK) channel, revealing novel voltage sensing and sensor-pore coupling mechanisms that have largely eluded the community until now."
"Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) is a major global cause of mortality worldwide, responsible for over a million deaths annually. Despite this burden, natural immunity prevents disease in more than 90% of exposed individuals. Previous studies have identified interferon-gamma (IFN-{gamma}) as a key regulator of innate immune defense against MTB. Here, we investigate the impact of IFN-{gamma} timing on macrophage-mediated control of MTB infection. We demonstrate that IFN-{gamma} exposure before infection enhances macrophage antibacterial activity, whereas post-infection exposure does not. Further investigation into this phenotype revealed a strong association between c-Myc signaling and macrophage function in MTB control, as identified using unbiased in vitro systems approaches. Given the challenge of perturbing c-Myc in primary cells, we developed a lentiviral system for c-Myc inhibition and overexpression. Using a tetracycline-inducible Omomyc system - a small peptide inhibitor of c-Myc - we show that c-Myc inhibition promotes a pro-inflammatory macrophage phenotype with enhanced antimycobacterial activity. Mechanistically, c-Myc inhibition induces metabolic reprogramming via increased mTORC1 activity, leading to upregulated inducible nitric oxide synthase and improved bacterial control. In vivo analyses, including murine models and human clinical histopathology, reveal a strong correlation between c-Myc expression and MTB persistence, as well as active tuberculosis (TB), suggesting a role for c-Myc in immune evasion. These findings reveal c-Myc as a potential mediator of immune privilege in MTB infection and highlight its role as a promising target for novel TB therapies aimed at enhancing macrophage function."
"Angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE) regulates the levels of disparate bioactive peptides, notably converting angiotensin-I to angiotensin-II and degrading amyloid beta. ACE is a heavily glycosylated dimer, containing 4 analogous catalytic sites, and exists in membrane bound and soluble (sACE) forms. ACE inhibition is a frontline, FDA-approved, therapy for cardiovascular diseases yet is associated with significant side effects, including higher rates of lung cancer. To date, structural studies have been confined to individual domains or partially denatured cryo-EM structures. Here we report the cryo-EM structure of the glycosylated full sACE dimer. We resolved four structural states at 2.99 to 3.65 [A] resolution which are primarily differentiated by varying degrees of solvent accessibility to the active sites and reveal the full dimerization interface. We also employed all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and heterogeneity analysis in cryoSPARC, cryoDRGN, and RECOVAR to elucidate the conformational dynamics of sACE and identify key regions mediating conformational change. We identify differences in the mechanisms governing the conformational dynamics of individual domains that have implications for the design of domain-specific sACE modulators."

"Effective mucosal immunity in the intestine involves a fine balance between tolerance of the microbiome, recognition and elimination of pathogens, and inflammatory tissue injury. The anti-inflammatory cytokine IL10 regulates these processes in the intestines of mice and humans; the anti-inflammatory activity of IL10 is also conserved in birds. To determine the function of IL10 in avian mucosal immunity, we generated germ line modifications of the chicken IL10 locus to abolish or reduce IL10 expression. In vitro analysis of macrophage response to lipopolysaccharide confirmed the loss of IL10 protein expression, the lack of dosage compensation in heterozygotes, and prevention of autocrine inhibition of nitric oxide production in homozygous IL10 knockout macrophages. IL10-deficiency significantly altered the composition of the caecal microbiome, but unlike IL10-deficient mice and humans, IL10-deficient chickens did not exhibit spontaneous colitis. Following experimental challenge with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium or Campylobacter jejuni in IL10-deficient chickens, enhanced clearance of the pathogens was associated with elevated transcription of pro-inflammatory genes and increased infiltration of inflammatory cells into gut mucosa. In IL10-deficient chickens challenged with the parasite Eimeria tenella, pathogen clearance was accelerated but caecal lesions were more severe and weight gain was compromised. Neither the heterozygous IL10 knockout nor a homozygous IL10 enhancer mutation had a major effect on pathogen clearance or inflammation in any of the challenge models. Our findings highlight the intrinsic compromise in mucosal immune response and have important implications for the development of strategies to combat avian and zoonotic pathogens in poultry."
"Invasive sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) in the Laurentian Great Lakes have negatively impacted ecological and economically important fishes for nearly a century. To mitigate these effects, the lampricide 3-trifluoromethyl-4-nitrophenol (TFM) is applied annually on a rotating basis to selected Great Lakes tributaries to kill larval lamprey before they become juveniles, out-migrate to the lakes, and parasitize other fishes. It has been hypothesized that larval size (e.g., mass, length) may affect survival time in response to TFM. To test this hypothesis, we conducted an experiment with 8,611 larvae across four temporal replicates, in which TFM concentrations equivalent to those used in present-day stream treatments were applied for up to 18 hours. When examining the survival times of larval lamprey exposed to TFM, we found a significant, positive relationship between length, mass, toxicity, and their interactions. For every one mm increase in total length, a corresponding increase by one gram of mass reduced survival time by 0.4315 minutes [95% CI: 0.5283 - 0.2992] and vice versa (i.e., the significant interaction between length and mass revealed that as larvae increase in mass, the survival benefit to being longer decreases, and vice versa). The changes in total length and mass of larval sea lamprey stored in ethanol for four months was also quantified. The observation that five larvae survived well past the 12-hour time window of a typical TFM field treatment highlights the need for continuous monitoring and the development of new control strategies to ensure the continued effective management of this invasive species."
"Information transmission is intrinsic to life, and noise is intrinsic to information transmission. Biological noise underlies some human diseases, but is also essential for the flexibility and plasticity of individual organisms and for their evolution. Recent technological advances in our ability to characterize many sources of biological noise have demonstrated that its amount is often heritable. Here, we treat the population genetics of all loci that influence the amount of biological noise. While analogous theory for heritable changes in mean trait values has been established for nearly a century, to our knowledge this is the first general treatment of the evolution of heritable changes in their statistical distributions. This represents a critical theoretical contribution to this important and rapidly growing domain of inquiry. It also sheds light on the hypothesis that natural selection can increase evolvability, and generalizes modifier theory used in the tradition of Feldman and colleagues."
"Theory predicts that indirect interactions in ecological networks sustain species diversity through oscillatory dynamics. However, a framework linking interaction structure to these cycles is lacking. We develop an analytical toolbox combining assembly graphs with a mathematical decomposition of interaction matrices into symmetric and anti-symmetric components. We find that assembly cycles--closed loops of species invasions--are suppressed when symmetric interactions dominate, reflecting strong intraspecific competition. Conversely, anti-symmetric dominance, indicating competitive asymmetries, leads to cycles like rock-paper-scissors and novel multispecies invasion patterns. As asymmetries increase, new cycles emerge involving both sequential and simultaneous invasions. Applying this approach to 21 plant community interaction matrices, we find few cycles due to prevalent self-limiting effects. Our work clarifies when indirect interactions drive cycles and introduces a simple ratio assessing symmetric versus anti-symmetric contributions, constraining cycle emergence, and species coexistence in nature.

Significant statementUncertainties of the fundamental blocks that maintain biodiversity hinder our understanding of the dynamics we can observe in ecological communities. By applying a well-known mathematical approach to decomposing interactions among species within ecological communities, we discover great potential for observing rock-paper-scissors and more complex cyclic dynamics in nature. However, we predict and confirm analyzing multiple datasets that cyclic dynamics are rare because of two phenomena that pervade ecological communities. These are differences in species performance and the dominance of self-limiting effects. Our framework underscores the importance of studying simple properties of biotic interactions to predict complex ecological dynamics."
"Increasing variability down serially segmented structures, such as mammalian molar teeth and vertebrate limb segments, is a much-replicated pattern. The same phenotypic pattern has conflicting interpretations at different evolutionary scales. Macroevolutionary patterns are thought to reflect greater evolutionary potential in later-forming segments, but microevolutionary patterns are thought to reflect less evolutionary potential and greater phenotypic plasticity. We address this conflict by recalculating evolutionary potential (evolvability) from a systematic review of published mammalian molar sizes, then directly measure phenotypic plasticity from a controlled feeding experiment. Effects on lengths and widths are discordant in a way that suggests general growth pathways have a role in phenotypically plastic dental responses to nutrition. Effects on successive trait means do not necessarily increase downstream, contrary to long-standing hypotheses. We confirm prior findings of increasing non-inherited variance downstream, showing decoupling between effects on trait mean and variance. These patterns can be explained by a cascading model of tooth development compounding the effect of developmental instability as an influence separate from general environmental effects on the developing embryo. When evaluated in terms of evolvability, later-developing molars are equally or more evolvable than earlier-developing molars, aligning their microevolutionary potential with macroevolutionary patterns in other serially segmented structures."
"In task functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), collinearity between task regressors in time series models may impact power. When collinearity is identified after data collection, researchers often modify the model in an effort to reduce collinearity. However, some model adjustments are suboptimal and may introduce bias into parameter estimates. Although relevant to many task-fMRI studies, we highlight these issues using the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD(R)) study. We introduce a procedure to more directly quantify the impact of collinearity on task-relevant measures: a contrast-based variance inflation factor (cVIF). We also show that collinearity reduction strategies-such as omitting regressors for specific task components, using impulse regressors for extended activations, and ignoring response time variability-can bias contrast estimates. Finally, we present a ""Saturated'"" model that includes all task components, including response times, aiming to reduce these biases while maintaining comparable levels of collinearity, as assessed by cVIF."
"Modern fungicides have made significant contributions to crop disease management, but the development of resistant fungal strains has caused their failure in disease control. Therefore, developing fungicides with novel action mechanisms is the most effective measure to manage resistance. Quinofumelin, a novel quinoline fungicide, exhibits exceptional antifungal activity against phytopathogens. However, there is currently no available information on its mechanism of action. Here, we used transcriptome and metabolome analysis to observe a co-enrichment pattern of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs) within pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway (PBP), identifying down-regulation of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH). Exogenous uridine monophosphate (UMP), uridine or uracil (metabolites in PBP) successfully restored quinofumelin-induced inhibition of mycelial growth in Fusarium graminearum and Fusarium asiaticum. Additionally, the deletion of FgDHODHII was determined to be lethal; however, mycelial growth of {Delta}FgDHODHII mutants could be restored by adding UMP, uridine or uracil. These findings indicate that the deficiencies in FgDHODHII are functionally equivalent to complete inhibition of its activity by quinofumelin. Finally, molecular docking, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and microscale thermophoresis (MST) results strongly support the precise interaction between quinofumelin and FgDHODHII. Collectively, these findings provide compelling evidence for the involvement of de novo uracil biosynthesis as mechanism of action for quinofumelin while identifying FgDHODHII as its specific target."
"Analysis at the single-cell level is a powerful approach to study biological processes and responses to perturbations. However, its application in morphological profiling with phenomics remains underexplored. Here, we use the Cell Painting assay to investigate morphological effects of 53 small molecule compounds, associated with six distinct programmed cell death mechanisms, across six concentrations in MCF7 cells. To compare single-cell and aggregated analysis strategies, we conduct both supervised and unsupervised evaluations aimed at identifying features linked to programmed cell death. We apply an energy distance as a metric to quantify morphological perturbation strength, enabling efficient filtering. Among three tested feature extraction methods, self-supervised DINO embeddings applied to single-cell data captured high-resolution morphological patterns. Focused analyses of apoptosis-inducing compounds revealed biological heterogeneity attributable to specific molecular targets and concentration-dependent effects, which were not apparent in aggregated profiles. In contrast, multi-class classification models for the six programmed cell death mechanisms trained on single-cell features achieved F1 scores of 79.86%, while models trained on aggregated features reached F1 scores of up to 89.97%. Our results highlight the advantages of single-cell data for unsupervised exploration and show that aggregated representations yield more robust and accurate performance in supervised models."
"The inner nuclear membrane (INM), a subdomain of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), sequesters hundreds of transmembrane proteins within the nucleus. We previously found that one INM protein, emerin, can evade the INM by secretory transport to the lysosome, where it is degraded. In this work, we used targeted mutagenesis to identify intrinsic sequences that promote or inhibit emerins secretory trafficking. By manipulating these sequences across several tag and expression level combinations, we now find that emerins localization is sensitive to C-terminal GFP tagging. While emerins long, hydrophobic C-terminal transmembrane domain facilitates trafficking to the lysosome, extending its lumenal terminus with a GFP tag biases the protein toward this pathway. In contrast, we identify a conserved ER retention sequence that stabilizes N- and C-terminally tagged emerin by limiting its lysosomal flux. These findings underscore long- standing concerns about tagging artifacts and reveal novel determinants of tail-anchored INM protein targeting."
"The BioModels Repository contains over 1000 manually curated mechanistic models from published literature, most often encoded in the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML). This community-based standard formally specifies each model, but does not describe the computational experimental conditions to run a simulation. Therefore, it can be challenging to reproduce any figure or result from a publication with an SBML model alone. The Simulation Experiment Description Markup Language (SED-ML) provides a solution: a standard way to specify exactly how to run an experiment corresponding to a specific figure or result. BioModels was established years before SED-ML, and both systems evolved over time, both in content and acceptance. Hence, only about half of the entries in BioModels contained SED-ML files, and these files reflected the version of SED-ML that was available at the time. Additionally, almost all of these SED-ML files had at least one minor mistake that made them invalid. To make these models and their results more reproducible, we report here on our work updating, correcting and generating new SED-ML files for 1055 curated mechanistic models in BioModels. In addition, because SED-ML is implementation-independent, it can be used for verification, demonstrating that results hold across multiple simulation engines. We tested, corrected, and improved over 450 existing SED-ML files in the BioModels database, and created basic files for the rest of the entries. Then, we used a wrapper architecture for interpreting SED-ML, and report verification results across five different ODE-based biosimulation engines, after further improving the models, the wrappers, and the engines themselves. Our work with SED-ML and the BioModels collection aims to improve the utility of these models by making them more reproducible and credible. Improved reproducibility means these models are now even more fit for re-use, such as in new investigations and as components of multiscale models.

Author summaryReproducing computationally-derived scientific results seems like it should be straightforward, but is often elusive. Code is lost, file formats change, and knowledge of what was done is only partially recorded and/or forgotten. Model repositories such as BioModels address this failing in the Systems Biology domain by encoding models in a standard format that can reproduce a figure from the paper from which it was drawn. Here, we delved into the BioModels repository to create and correct the instructions on what to do with every curated model, and then tested those instructions on a variety of simulation platforms, allowing us to find and correct issues with the platforms and the simulators themselves. Not only did this improve the BioModels repository, but also improved the infrastructure necessary to run these verification comparisons in the future, and improved the fitness of the models for re-use by other researchers."
"Microsporidia are a model clade for studying intracellular parasitism, being well-known for their streamlined genomes and their extreme life history. Although microsporidia are highly diverse and ecologically important to a broad range of hosts, previous research on genome architecture has focused primarily on the mammal-infecting genus Encephalitozoon. Here, we expand that work, testing the universality of the patterns observed in Encephalitozoon by investigating and comparing variation in genetic and epigenetic architectures in the high-quality genome assemblies of several major microsporidia clades. Our comparison of nine genomes, including the first genome assemblies of Binucleata daphniae, Gurleya vavrai, and Conglomerata obtusa, and revised, improved assemblies of Glugoides intestinalis and Ordospora colligata, found limited conservation of genetic and epigenetic architecture across all microsporidia, although many genomic characteristics, such as nucleotide composition and repeat content, were shared between genomes of the same or related clades. For example, rRNA genes were hypermethylated in all species, but their position close to chromosome ends was only found in the Encephalitozoon and its sister clade. GC-content varied widely, linked to genome size, phylogenetic position and activity of repeat elements. These findings enhance our insight into genome evolution and, consistent with findings from other systems, suggest epigenetic modification as a regulatory mechanism of gene expression and repeat element activity in microsporidia. Our comparative genome analysis reveals higher variation among microsporidia than previously supposed."
"BackgroundReference genomes have a wide range of applications. Yet, we are from a complete genomic picture for the tree of life. We here contribute another piece to the puzzle by providing a high-quality reference genome for the Ural Owl (Strix uralensis), a species of conservation concern and efforts affected by habitat destruction and climate change.

ResultsWe generated a reference genome assembly for the Ural Owl based on high-fidelity (HiFi) long reads and chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) data. It figures amongst the best avian genome assemblies currently available (BUSCO completeness of 99.94 %). The primary assembly had a size of 1.38 Gb with a scaffold N50 of 90.1 Mb, while the alternative assembly had a size of 1.3 Gb and a scaffold N50 of 17.0 Mb. We show an exceptionally high repeat content (21.07 %) that is different from those of other bird taxa with repeat extensions. We confirm a Strix characteristic chromosomal fusion and support the observation that bird microchromosomes have a higher density of genes, associated with a reduction in gene length due to shorter introns. An analysis of gene content provides evidence of changes in the keratin gene repertoire as well as modifications of metabolism genes of owls. This opens an avenue of research if this is related to flight adaptations. The population size history of the Ural Owl decreased over long periods of time with increases during the Eemian interglacial and stable size during the last glacial period. Ever since it is declining to its currently lowest effective population size. We also investigated cell culture of progressive passages as a tool for genetic resources. Karyotyping of passages confirmed no large variants, while a SNP analysis revealed a low presence of short variants across cell passages.

ConclusionsThe established reference genome is a valuable resource for ongoing conservation efforts, but also for (avian) comparative genomics research. Further research is needed to determine whether cell culture passages can be safely used in genomic research."
"Cells accumulate mutations throughout development, contributing to cancer, aging, and evolution. Quantitative data on the abundance of de novo mutations within plants or animals are limited, as new mutations are often rare within a tissue and fall below the limits of current sequencing depths and error rates. Here, we show that mutations induced by the maize Mutator (Mu) transposon can be reliably quantified down to a detection limit of 1 part in 16,000. We measured the abundance of millions of de novo Mu insertions across four tissue types. Within a tissue, the distribution of de novo Mu allele frequencies was highly reproducible between plants, showing that, despite the stochastic nature of mutation, repeated statistical patterns of mutation abundance emerge. In contrast, there were significant differences in the allele frequency distribution between tissues. At the extremes, root was dominated by a small number of highly abundant de novo insertions, while endosperm was characterized by thousands of insertions at low allele frequencies. Finally, we used the measured pollen allele frequencies to reinterpret a classic genetic experiment, showing that evidence for late Mu activity in pollen are better explained by cell division statistics. These results provide insight into the complexity of mutation accumulation in multicellular organisms and a system to interrogate the factors that shape mutation abundance.

SignificanceNew mutations provide the raw material for evolution and contribute to cancer, aging, and genetic diseases. It has been challenging to follow the origin and spread of new mutations because they can be exceptionally rare and difficult to detect. By focusing on a class of mutation that can be detected more readily - Mu transposon insertions - we followed the abundance of new mutations in multiple maize tissues. We find that the Mu has broad activity across tissues, but with significant tissue-specific differences in how abundant individual new mutations become. Most mutations were below the detection limit available for other classes of mutation. These results provide a glimpse into the complexity of mutation within multicellular organisms."
"Insects are associated with a wide variety of diverse RNA viruses, including iflaviruses, a group of positive stranded RNA viruses that mainly infect arthropods. Whereas some iflaviruses cause severe diseases in insects, numerous iflaviruses that were detected in healthy populations of butterflies and moths (order: Lepidoptera) do not show apparent symptoms. Compared to other hosts, only few iflavirus genomes for lepidopteran hosts could be found in publicly available databases and we know little about the occurrence of iflaviruses in natural and laboratory lepidopteran populations. To expand the known diversity of iflaviruses in Lepidoptera, we developed a pipeline to automatically reconstruct virus genomes from public transcriptome data. We reconstructed 1,548 virus genomes from 55 different lepidopteran species that we were identified as coding-complete based on their length. To include incompletely assembled genomes, we developed a reference-based patching approach, resulting in 240 patched genomes. By including publicly available genomes, we inferred a phylogeny consisting of 139 non-redundant iflavirus genomes. Of these, 65 represent novel complete genomes, of which 39 might even belong to novel virus species. Our analysis expanded virus host range, where highly similar viruses were found in the transcriptomes of different lepidopteran species, genera or even families. Additionally, we find two groups of lepidopteran species depending on the diversity of viruses that infect them: some species were only infected by closely related viruses, whereas other species are infected by highly diverse viruses from different regions of the phylogeny. Finally, we show that the evolution of one virus species, Iflavirus betaspexiguae, is impacted by recombination within the species, which is also supported by the co-occurrence of multiple strains within data sets. Our analysis demonstrates how data mining of publicly available sequencing data can be used at a large scale to reconstruct intra-family viral diversity which serves as a basis to study virus host range and evolution. Our results contain numerous novel viruses and novel virus-host associations, including viruses for relevant insect pests, highlighting the impact of iflaviruses in insect ecology and as potential biological control agents in the future."
"Understanding the temporal dynamics of mosquito behavior is essential for developing effective interventions against pathogen transmission. However, limited knowledge exists about the environmental, physiological, and genetic factors influencing mosquito activity patterns. This knowledge gap is partly due to a lack of tools to accurately quantify the behavior of free-flying mosquitoes over extended periods. Here, we introduce BuzzWatch, an open-source, low-cost platform designed to continuously monitor mosquito flight behavior over several weeks with high temporal resolution. BuzzWatch records videos of mosquitoes freely flying in a transparent cage and automates the extraction, analysis, and visualization of behavioral data, including flight trajectories and population-level flight and sugar-feeding statistics. Using BuzzWatch, we quantified the daily rhythms of 10 Aedes aegypti populations from various geographic origins. Globally invasive Ae. aegypti showed increased sugar feeding and flight activity during midday compared to native African populations. Our platform further revealed subtle, long-lasting effects of blood feeding on activity patterns and a complex response to extended daylight periods. By integrating a host-seeking module in BuzzWatch to deliver CO2 and heat pulses, we observed a twofold increase in Ae. aegyptis response to host-associated cues during the daytime compared to nighttime. Combined, these results demonstrate BuzzWatchs potential to investigate responses to host cues over seconds, natural variability in daily rhythms over hours, and phenotypic plasticity over days. BuzzWatch offers a novel perspective on mosquito behavior over multiple timescales, paving the way for advanced ecological and epidemiological studies that can inform targeted and effective vector control strategies.

"The problem of polypharmacy arises when two or more drugs taken in combination cause adverse side effects, even when the use of the drugs individually causes no harm. Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are a major cause of these reactions, contributing to increased morbidity and mortality. As the potential for harmful DDI grows combinatorially, the prediction of drug-drug interactions is increasingly critical for patient safety and effective healthcare management. In this paper, we present the ChemBERTaDDI frame-work a robust approach that uses transformer self-attention to extract latent molecular representations. By employing ChemBERTa-77M-MLM--a transformer-based language model pretrained on SMILES sequences--our approach generates enriched chemical embeddings that capture detailed molecular structural information. These embeddings are integrated with clinical mono side effect data and processed through a DNN predictor, enabling the learning of complex pairwise interaction patterns with minimal architectural overhead. Experiments performed using this combined data on a benchmark data set show superior performance compared with five state-of-the-art methods: Decagon, DeepDDI, MDF-SA-DDI, DPSP and NNPS. ChemBER-TaDDI outperforms the baseline architectures, as measured by F1 and AUROC, and generalizes to new introduced drug compounds."
"Cortical dysfunction is increasingly recognized as a major contributor to the non-motor symptoms associated with Parkinsons disease (PD) and other synucleinopathies. Although functional alterations in cortical circuits have been observed in preclinical PD models, the underlying molecular mechanisms are unclear. To bridge this knowledge gap, we investigated tissue-level changes in the cortices of rats and mice treated with alpha-synuclein (aSyn) seeds using a multi-omics approach. Our study revealed significant phosphoproteomic changes, but not global proteomic or lipid profiling changes, in the rat sensorimotor cortex 3 months after intra-striatal injection with aSyn preformed fibrils (PFFs). Gene ontology analysis of the phosphoproteomic data revealed that PFF administration impacted pathways related to synaptic transmission and cytoskeletal organization. Similar phosphoproteomic perturbations were observed in the sensorimotor cortex of mice injected intrastriatally or intracortically with aSyn PFFs. Functional analyses demonstrated increased neuronal firing rates and enhanced spike-spike coherence in the sensorimotor cortices of PFF-treated mice, suggesting that aSyn seeds induced cortical circuit dysfunction. Bioinformatics analysis of the altered phosphosites indicated the involvement of several kinases, including casein kinase-2 (CK2) and MAPK (ERK), both of which have been previously implicated in PD pathology. Collectively, these findings highlight the importance of phosphorylation-mediated signaling pathways in the cortical response to aSyn pathology spread in PD and related synucleinopathies, setting the stage for developing new therapeutic strategies."
"IntroductionPeripheral nerve reinnervation following nerve injury is often a slow and incomplete process, resulting in significant morbidity and permanent loss of function of the injured extremity in many patients. Prior studies have shown the efficacy of electrical stimulation to synchronize the axonal regeneration of both motor and sensory neurons in peripheral nerve injury models. Moreover, separate investigations have also shown the use of cranial nerve stimulation, principally the vagus nerve, to improve functional outcomes. However, no study has investigated the synergistic effects of both intraoperative electrical stimulation and cranial nerve stimulation for functional improvement within a peripheral nerve injury model. This investigation quantifies the efficacy of combined intraoperative electrical stimulation and trigeminal nerve stimulation on motor and sensory functional recovery in a rat peripheral nerve injury model.

MethodsTwelve adult male Lewis rats were trained in a reach and pull task for a food reward using their right forelimb with baseline force thresholds and percent success of the pull task recorded. Baseline sensory data was retrieved using an automated von Frey monofilament test. All rats underwent surgical transection and 2mm gap repair of their median and ulnar nerve of their right forelimb followed by 1 hour of intraoperative electrical stimulation. Trigeminal nerve stimulation throughout the rehabilitation period was completed via supraorbital nerve headcap electrodes. Motor and sensory data were compared to historic cohorts comprised of sham surgery (no nerve injury), brief intraoperative electrical stimulation, trigeminal nerve stimulation, and a sham peripheral and trigeminal nerve stimulation group. Polarization sensitive optical computed tomography (PS-OCT) was used to assess nerve regeneration in fixed tissue samples.

ResultsThe combined cohort of rodents were able to recover to their pre-injury motor function by the third week of rehabilitation, faster than either of the singular electrical stimulation cohorts assessed previously. Moreover, functional sensory data of the combined stim cohort demonstrated no change when compared to their pre-injury baseline.

ConclusionsPeripheral nerve electrical stimulation and trigeminal nerve stimulation are two separately acting mechanisms of therapy that employ electric waveforms to improve the functional recovery of injured peripheral nerves. The former acts within the periphery to synchronize axonal growth and regeneration of the injured neurons, while the latter acts centrally to augment neuroplasticity. When used simultaneously in a rodent peripheral nerve injury model, these modalities have shown to build upon each other to deliver a faster functional motor recovery, while sensory recovery outcomes remain to be demonstrated."
"Objective.Epilepsy affects around 50 million people worldwide, and reliable pre-seizure biomarkers could significantly improve neuromodulation therapies for drug-resistant patients. Recent research using stereo-electroencephalography (sEEG) has revealed transient changes in network dynamics preceding seizures. In particular, our previous work showed that these alterations are driven by recurrent, short-lasting (0.6 s) high-connectivity network configurations--termed High-Connectivity States (HCS). Here, we aim to replicate and further characterize HCS as a biomarker in a multicentric patient cohort, assess its robustness across recording modalities and montages, explore its relationship with interpretable physiological variables, and examine its network-level association with seizure-onset zone (SOZ) dynamics.

Approach.We analyzed long-term intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings from 12 patients with sEEG and electrocorticography (ECoG). In two patients with extensive clinical information, we examined the interplay between HCS and SOZ dynamics. We also developed a low-dimensional stochastic network model to investigate mechanistic rationales of HCS emergence. Additionally, we compared HCS dynamics with gamma-band activity and heart rate, and tested robustness across different montage configurations.

Main Results.In most patients, HCS probability reliably increased hours before seizure onset. In the two deeply characterized patients, this increase was specifically linked to an increased network centrality within the SOZ. The network model revealed that changes in HCS probability stem primarily from topological reconfigurations rather than changes in mean connectivity, underscoring the importance of dynamic interactions between epileptogenic and non-epileptogenic regions.

Significance.These results support HCS probability as a promising biomarker for early seizure prediction and offer mechanistic insights into pre-seizure brain network dynamics."
"Visual resolution, contrast sensitivity and form perception improve gradually with age. In nonhuman primates, the sensitivity and resolution of cells in the retina, lateral geniculate nucleus and primary visual cortex (V1) also improve, but not enough to account for the perceptual changes. So, what aspects of visual system development limit visual sensitivity in infants? Improvements in behavioral sensitivity might arise from maturation of regions downstream of V1 such as V2, V4 and pIT, which are thought to support increasingly complex perceptual abilities. We recorded the responses of populations of neurons in areas V1, V2, V4, and pIT to radial frequency patterns - a type of global form stimulus. Subjects were three young monkeys between the ages of 19 and 54 weeks, and a single adult animal. We found that neurons and neural populations in V4 reliably encoded global form in radial frequency stimuli at the earliest ages we studied, while V1 neurons do not. V2 and pIT populations also showed some degree of selectivity for these patterns at early ages, especially at higher radial frequency values. We did not find significant, systematic changes in neural decoding performance that could account for the improvement in behavioral performance over the same age range in an overlapping group of animals (Rodriguez Deliz et al., 2024). Finally, consistent with our prior behavioral results, neural populations in V4 show highest sensitivity for the higher radial frequency values which contain the highest concentration of curvature and orientation cues.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTInfants have remarkably limited ability to discriminate shapes. These limitations cannot be fully explained by postnatal changes in their eyes, visual thalamus, or primary visual cortex. The perception of shape requires integration of local cues across space to create global form information. We therefore examined populations of neurons in extrastriate visual cortex to learn whether information represented in these regions might limit infants abilities to process global forms. We found instead that extrastriate areas involved in global form processing function maturely early in life, by the age of 4-6 months, suggesting that infants perceptual limits are set by other aspects of brain development."
"AimGenetic diversity contains valuable information about ecological and evolutionary aspects of species, such as historical demography. Intraspecific genetic variation is shaped by species natural history traits and by characteristics of geography and climate within their ranges. Salamanders (Order Caudata) are amphibians of ecological and conservation interest because of their global distribution, trait diversity, and roles within ecological communities. Here, we studied genetic variation within salamanders to investigate predictors of nucleotide diversity and spatial patterns of genetic differentiation.

LocationGlobal.

Time PeriodPresent.

Major Taxa StudiedSalamanders.

MethodsWe repurposed mitochondrial DNA sequences, natural history traits, and geographic and environmental data from open-access databases for 214 salamander species. We calculated nucleotide diversity ({pi}) and tested for isolation by distance (IBD) and isolation by environment (IBE) within each species. We analyzed these three response variables with random forest analyses and phylogenetic comparative methods using 27 predictors expected to be associated with genetic variation (e.g., number of offspring, total range size).

ResultsWe recovered 8,175 Cytb sequences with their associated geographic coordinates, of which 7,007 sequences were manually curated by us. Species range size and sample size (the number of sequences) were important predictors of genetic variation. We found higher diversity in regions including the Neotropics and central-eastern Europe. The absence of strong phylogenetic signal in {pi}, IBD, and IBE suggests that genetic variation is shaped by local ecological and geographical factors rather than by shared ancestry.

Main ConclusionsOur finding that range size was an important predictor of genetic variation aligns with theoretical expectations that species with larger ranges tend to harbor more genetic diversity. Our results underscore the importance of integrating spatial data (i.e., DNA sequences and their associated coordinates) into macrogenetic studies, providing valuable information for future studies and conservation strategies targeting regions with high or low genetic diversity."
"Sex determination is a developmental switch that triggers sex-specific developmental programs. This switch is ""flipped"" by the expression of genes that promote male- or female-specific development. Many lineages have evolved sex chromosomes that act as primary signals for sex determination. However, haplodiploidy (males are haploid and females are diploid), which occurs in ca. 12% of animal species, is incompatible with sex chromosomes. Haplodiploid taxa must, therefore, rely on other strategies for sex determination. One mechanism, ""complementary sex determination"" (CSD), uses heterozygosity as a proxy for diploidy. In CSD, heterozygosity at a sex determination locus triggers female development, while hemizygosity or homozygosity permits male development. CSD loci have been mapped in honeybees and two ant species, but we know little about their evolutionary history. Here, we investigate sex determination in the clonal raider ant, Ooceraea biroi. We identified a 46kb candidate CSD locus at which all females are heterozygous, but most diploid males are homozygous for either allele. As expected for CSD loci, the candidate locus has more alleles than most other loci, resulting in a peak of nucleotide diversity. This peak negligibly affects the amino acid sequences of protein-coding genes, suggesting that heterozygosity of a non-coding genomic sequence triggers female development. This locus is distinct from the CSD locus in honeybees but homologous to a CSD locus mapped in two distantly related ant species, implying that this molecular mechanism has been conserved since a common ancestor that lived approximately 112 million years ago."
"Mechanisms underlying heterotypic subunit assembly of ion channels and other oligomeric complexes are poorly understood. In the human heart, heteromeric assembly of two isoforms encoded by the human ether-a-go-go related gene (hERG) is essential for the normal function of cardiac IKr in ventricular repolarization, with loss of hERG1b contributing to arrhythmias associated with long QT-syndrome (LQTS). While hERG1a homomers traffic efficiently to the plasma membrane, hERG1b homomers are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). When expressed together, the two subunits avidly associate during biogenesis. Seeking rules specifying heteromeric association, we characterized the fate of hERG1b proteins using confocal and superresolution imaging in fixed and live HeLa cells. We found hERG1b sequestered in punctate intracellular structures when expressed alone in HeLa cells. These puncta, which depend on the presence of an N-terminal ""RXR"" ER retention signal, represent a privileged ER sub-compartment distinct from that containing ER-retained, type 2 (hERG-based) LQTS mutant proteins, which were rapidly degraded by the proteasome. Introducing hERG1a to cells with preformed hERG1b puncta dissolved these puncta by rescuing extant hERG1b. Rescue occurred by association of fully translated hERG1b with 1a, a surprising finding given previous studies demonstrating cotranslational heteromeric association. We propose that sequestration limits potentially deleterious surface expression of hERG1b homomeric channels while preserving hERG1b for an alternative mode of heteromeric hERG1a/1b channel assembly post-translationally. These findings reveal a surprising versatility of biosynthetic pathways promoting heteromeric assembly.

Significance StatementhERG potassium channels are essential for repolarizing the ventricular action potential. Heteromeric hERG channels, which conduct cardiac IKr, are formed by association of hERG1a and 1b subunits. However, mechanisms governing the assembly of hERG and other heteromeric protein complexes are poorly understood. We identify a noncanonical ER compartment that sequesters hERG1b, distinct from previously described ER quality control pathways that degrade misfolded proteins, including LQTS-associated hERG variants. Instead, this compartment preserves hERG1b and facilitates its post-translational assembly with hERG1a, challenging the current view of simultaneous, cotranslational heteromeric assembly. Our findings redefine ER retention as an active regulatory step in protein complex formation that may broadly govern hetero-oligomeric assembly in many systems and facilitate therapeutic approaches to arrhythmia and other diseases."
"Acute injuries can progress into painful states that endure long after healing. The mechanisms underlying this transition remain unclear, but metabolic adaptations to the bioenergy demands imposed by injury are plausible contributors. Here we show that peripheral injury activates AKT/mTORC1 in afferent segments of the mouse spinal cord, redirecting local core metabolism toward biomass production while simultaneously suppressing autophagy-mediated biomass reclamation. This metabolic shift supports neuroplasticity, but creates a resource bottleneck that depletes critical spinal cord nutrients. Preventing this depletion with a modified diet normalizes biomass generation and autophagy and halts the transition to chronic pain. This effect, observed across multiple pain models, requires activation of the nutrient sensors, sirtuin-1 and AMPK, as well as restoration of autophagy. The findings identify metabolic reprogramming and consequent autophagy suppression as key drivers of the progression to pain chronicity and highlight nutritional and pharmacological interventions that could prevent this progression after surgery or other physical traumas."
"IMPACT STATEMENTMembrane fluidity plays a crucial role in bacterial fitness and adaptation to cope rapid environmental changes. While high membrane fluidity promotes robust biofilm formation in Klebsiella pneumoniae, studies in several other species, including Salmonella enterica, suggest that biofilm formation is associated with reduced fluidity. This paradox may reflect the complex relationship between lipid composition and biofilm formation. Our findings demonstrated that both low and high extremes of lipid fluidity restrict biofilm formation. We propose that the required fluidity for biofilm growth, relative to that required for planktonic growth, may differ between species and are readily adjusted during lifestyle transitions."
"Competition among plants can lead to allocation strategies that favor individual competitiveness at the expense of group-level productivity. However, the role of root and shoot responses in driving these outcomes is intensely debated. Experimental approaches often have difficulty disentangling above- and belowground interactions due to the confounding effects of pot size and nutrient distribution. Here, we used physical dividers and varied inter-plant distances (3-24 cm) in soybean to isolate competitive interactions while controlling for these confounding effects. Simultaneous above- and belowground competition increased relative root allocation, but reduced total biomass. Aboveground competition alone had stronger effects, triggering shade avoidance and reducing both shoot and root biomass. This likely overrode belowground cues. These results underscore the significance of neighbor-induced responses, particularly under full competition, as pivotal drivers of allocation patterns and promising targets for breeding strategies that enhance collective crop performance."
"Tools like Snipper or the Admixture Model count as state-of-the-art methods in forensic science for biogeographical ancestry. However, they have not been systematically compared to classifiers widely used in other disciplines. Noting that genetic data have a tabular form, this study addresses this gap by benchmarking forensic classifiers against TabPFN, a cutting-edge, general-purpose machine learning classifier for tabular data. The comparison evaluates performance using metrics such as accuracy--the proportion of correct classifications--and ROC AUC. We examine classification tasks for individuals at both the intracontinental and continental levels, based on a published dataset for training and testing. Our results reveal significant performance differences between methods, with TabPFN consistently achieving the best results for accuracy, ROC AUC and log loss. E.g., for accuracy, TabPFN improves SNIPPER from 84% to 93% on a continental scale using eight populations, and from 43% to 48% for inter-European classification with ten populations."
"Seeing is believing. Visualizing Ribo-seq and other sequencing data within genes of interest is a powerful approach to studying gene expression, but its application is limited by a lack of robust tools. Here, we introduce ggRibo, a user-friendly R package for visualizing individual gene expression, integrating Ribo-seq, RNA-seq, and other genome-wide datasets with flexible scaling options. ggRibo visualizes 3-nucleotide periodicity, a hallmark of translating ribosomes, within a gene-structure context, including introns and untranslated regions, enabling the study of novel ORFs, translation of different isoforms, and mechanisms of translational regulation. ggRibo can plot multiple Ribo-seq/RNA-seq datasets from different conditions for comparison. It also contains functions for plotting single-transcript view, reading-frame decomposition, and RNA-seq coverage alone. Importantly, ggRibo supports the visualization of other omics datasets that could also be presented with single-nucleotide resolution, such as RNA degradome, transcription start sites, translation initiation sites, and epitranscriptomic modifications. We demonstrate its utility with examples of upstream ORFs, downstream ORFs, nested ORFs, and differential isoform translation in humans, Arabidopsis, tomato, and rice. We also provide examples of multi-omic comparisons that reveal insights that connect the transcriptome, translatome, and degradome. In summary, ggRibo is an advanced single-gene viewer that offers a valuable resource for studying gene expression regulation through its intuitive and flexible platform."
"Heatwaves are now pervasive stressors to marine ecosystems, and it is urgent to consider mitigation tools that support ecosystem resilience and persistence in the immediate future. We modeled a system of kelp, herbivorous urchin, and predatory fish to compare how potential management actions (kelp seeding, urchin removal, and fishery closures) could reduce the likelihood of a heatwave shifting a kelp forest into a degraded urchin barren state. We found that those interventions were most effective when begun alongside or before the start of a heatwave. Closing the predatory fish fishery was more effective when done earlier and for longer, while urchin removal and kelp seeding were more effective when begun alongside and continued throughout the heatwave. Kelp seeding was notably less effective than other interventions. Our results suggest the need for improved heatwave forecasting and nimble management protocols to enact mitigation actions quickly if a heatwave is forecasted or occurs."
"Structured abstractO_ST_ABSMotivationC_ST_ABSDetection of gene regulatory aberrations enhances our ability to interpret the impact of inherited and acquired genetic variation for rare disease diagnostics and tumor characterization. While numerous methods for calling RNA expression outliers from RNA-sequencing data have been proposed, the establishment of protein expression outliers from mass spectrometry data is lacking.

ResultsHere, we propose and assess various modeling approaches to call protein expression outliers across three datasets from rare disease diagnostics and oncology. We use as independent evidence the enrichment for outlier calls in matched RNA-seq samples and the enrichment for rare variants likely disrupting protein expression. We show that controlling for hidden confounders and technical covariates, while simultaneously modeling the occurrence of missing values, is largely beneficial and can be achieved using conditional autoencoders. Moreover, we find that the differences between experimental and fitted log-transformed intensities by such models exhibit heavy tails that are poorly captured with the Gaussian distribution and report stronger statistical calibration when instead using the Students t-distribution. Our resulting method, PROTRIDER, outperformed baseline approaches based on raw log-intensities Z-scores or on differential expression analysis with limma. The application of PROTRIDER reveals significant enrichments of AlphaMissense pathogenic variants in protein expression outliers. Overall, PROTRIDER provides a method to confidently identify aberrantly expressed proteins applicable to rare disease diagnostics and cancer proteomics.

"Species from the genera Bellator and Prionotus, commonly known as  searobins, are marine ray-finned fish that belong to the subfamily Prionotinae. These fish have evolved distinctive morphological features and specialized behaviors that enable them to walk along the seafloor while detecting buried prey. This unique adaptation makes them ideal candidates for studies in evolutionary genetics. However, their phylogenetic relationships remain poorly understood. In this study, we utilized publicly available genomic reads from the GenBank database to assemble the first complete mitochondrial genomes of three searobin species: Bellator militaris, Prionotus alatus, and P. stephanophrys. We conducted a comparative analysis of these mitochondrial genomes, including the first phylogenetic analysis of the Prionotinae based on complete mitogenomic data. The resulting circular contigs measured 16,765 base pairs for B. militaris, 16,602 base pairs for P. alatus, and 16,896 base pairs for P. stephanophrys. The three mitogenomes exhibited a typical vertebrate organization, which includes 13 protein-coding genes, 2 ribosomal RNAs, 22 transfer RNAs, and a putative control region. Notably, P. stephanophrys contained an additional tRNA-Leu and an extra non-coding region. A Bayesian phylogenetic analysis grouped all Bellator species into a monophyletic clade within Prionotinae, while the sister taxon Prionotus formed a separate monophyletic subclade. The findings of this research provide valuable insights into the phylogenetic relationships and evolutionary history of the genera Bellator and Prionotus. Clarifying the taxonomy of these species may also support future management and conservation efforts for these economically valuable species."
"Adolescence is a developmental period characterized by heightened plasticity, yet how ongoing development affects sensory processing and cognitive function is unclear. We investigated how adolescent (postnatal day 20-40) and adult (postnatal day 60-80) mice differ in performance on a pure tone Go/No-Go auditory discrimination task of varying difficulty. Using dense electrophysiological recordings, we measured spiking activity at single neuron resolution in the auditory cortex while mice were engaged in the task. As compared to adults, adolescent mice showed lower auditory discrimination performance in the harder task. This performance difference was due to higher response variability and weaker cognitive control expressed as lower response bias. Adolescent and adult neuronal responses differed only slightly in representations of pure tones when measured outside the context of learning and the task. However, cortical representations after learning within the context of the task were markedly different. We found differences in stimulus- and choice-related activity at the single neuron level representations, as well as lower population-level decoding in adolescents. Overall, cortical decoding in adolescents was lower and slower, especially for difficult sound discrimination, reflecting immature cortical representations of sounds and choices. Notably, we found age-related differences, which were higher after learning, reflecting the combined impact of age and learning. Our findings highlight distinct neurophysiological and behavioral profiles in adolescence, underscoring the ongoing development of cognitive control mechanisms and cortical plasticity during this sensitive developmental period."
"INTRODUCTIONBasal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs) are integral to learning, attention, and memory, and are prone to degeneration in Down syndrome (DS), Alzheimers disease, and other neurodegenerative diseases. However, the mechanisms that lead to the degeneration of these neurons are not known.

METHODSSingle-nucleus gene expression and ATAC sequencing were performed on postmortem human basal forebrain from unaffected control and DS tissue samples at 0-2 years of age (n=4 each).

RESULTSSequencing analysis of postmortem human basal forebrain identifies gene expression differences in DS early in life. Genes encoding proteins associated with energy metabolism pathways, specifically oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis, and genes encoding antioxidant enzymes are upregulated in DS BFCNs.

DISCUSSIONMultiomic analyses reveal that energy metabolism may be disrupted in DS BFCNs by birth. Increased oxidative phosphorylation and the accumulation of reactive oxygen species byproducts may be early contributors to DS BFCN neurodegeneration."
"Recent studies have revealed bacterial genome-wide evolution to be complex and dynamic even in a constant environment. The evolution is characterized by the emergence of new clades competing or temporarily coexisting as each clade undergoes evolutionary change. Previous studies on predator-prey dynamics tracking simple ecological and phenotypic metrics have shown predation to fundamentally alter prey evolution, facilitating defense evolution followed by coevolution and frequency dependent selection between defended and undefended prey genotypes. Moreover, these dynamics can differ between prey species depending, for example, on mutation rate and the physiological and fitness effects of the mutations available. Here we sought to consolidate these fields by examining genome-wide evolution in five bacterial prey species separately subjected to long-term evolution under ciliate predation. For all species, we found mutational signals of prey adaptation, with genomic and phenotypic data demonstrating changes in composition between the experimental treatments. Mutational targets and dynamics also differed between prey species. Intriguingly, however, overall temporal molecular dynamics across the prey species were strikingly similar to those of bacteria evolving alone, with constant emergence, competition and quasi-stable coexistence of clades. This makes molecular evolution more interesting and less predictable than we might expect based on existing coevolutionary theories."
"Epistasis, where a mutations effect depends on genetic background, is central to evolution. A striking pattern, global epistasis, results in fitness effects varying systematically with background fitness--often making beneficial mutations less effective in fitter genotypes. Despite its ubiquity and importance in predicting evolution, the cellular origin of this pattern is unclear. We present a microbial cell growth model and show that global epistasis arises naturally from the underlying metabolic structure, and is modulated by reaction speeds and flux redistribution in the cell. Mutations in standalone rate-limiting modules yield predictable fitness effects, while those in interconnected modules behave idiosyncratically. As genetic divergence increases, background fitness becomes a poorer predictor of fitness effects. Our framework links cellular metabolism to adaptation, offering mechanistic insights into evolutionary predictability."
"Machine learning for protein modeling faces significant challenges due to proteins inherently dynamic nature, yet most graph-based machine learning methods rely solely on static structural information. Recently, the growing availability of molecular dynamics trajectories provides new opportunities for understanding the dynamic behavior of proteins; however, computational methods for utilizing this dynamic information remain limited. We propose a novel graph representation that integrates both static structural information and dynamic correlations from molecular dynamics trajectories, enabling more comprehensive modeling of proteins. By applying relational graph neural networks (RGNNs) to process this heterogeneous representation, we demonstrate significant improvements over structure-based approaches across three distinct tasks: atomic adaptability prediction, binding site detection, and binding affinity prediction. Our results validate that combining static and dynamic information provides complementary signals for understanding proteinligand interactions, offering new possibilities for drug design and structural biology applications."
"The rapid advancement of single-cell omics technologies such as scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq has transformed our understanding of cellular heterogeneity and regulatory mechanisms. However, integrating these data types remains challenging due to distributional discrepancies and distinct feature spaces. To address this, we present a novel single-cell Contrastive INtegration framework (sCIN), that integrates different omics modalities into a shared low-dimensional latent space. sCIN uses modality-specific encoders and contrastive learning to generate latent representations for each modality, aligning cells across modalities and removing technology-specific biases. The framework was designed to rigorously prevent data leakage between training and testing, and was extensively evaluated on three real-world paired and unpaired datasets including SHARE-seq, 10X PBMC (10k version), and CITE-seq. Paired datasets refer to multi-omics data generated using technologies capable of capturing different omics features from the same individual cells whereas unpaired datasets are collected from different but similar cell populations within the same tissue, with each modality measured separately. Results on paired and unpaired datasets show that sCIN outperforms state-of-the-art models, including scGLUE, scBridge, sciCAN, Con-AAE, Harmony, and MOFA+, across multiple metrics: Average Silhouette Width (ASW) for clustering quality, Recall@k, Cell type@k, Cell type accuracy, and Median Rank for integration quality. Moreover, sCIN was evaluated on simulated unpaired datasets derived from paired data, demonstrating its ability to leverage available biological information for effective multimodal integration. In summary, sCIN reliably integrates omics modalities while preserving biological meaning in both paired and unpaired settings."
"With the availability of reliably predicted 3D-structures for essentially all known proteins, characterizing the entirety of compound-binding sites (binding pockets on proteins) has become a possibility. The aim of this study was to identify and analyze all compound-binding sites, i.e. the pocketomes, of eleven different species from different kingdoms of life to discern evolutionary trends as well as to arrive at a global cross-species view of the pocketome universe. Computational binding site prediction was performed on all protein structures in each species as available from the AlphaFold database. The resulting set of potential binding sites was inspected for overlaps with known pockets and annotated with regard to the protein domains in which they are located. 2D-projection plots of all pockets embedded in a 128-dimensional feature space, and characterizing them with regard to selected physicochemical properties, provide informative, global pocketome maps that unveil differentiating features between pockets. Our study revealed a sub-linear scaling law of the number of unique binding sites relative to the number of unique protein structures per species. Thus, as proteome size increased during evolution and therefore potentially diversified, the number of distinct binding sites, reflecting potentially diversifying functions, grew less than proportionally. We discuss the biological significance of this finding as well as identify critical and unmet algorithmic challenges.

Authors summaryThe function of proteins is governed by specific interactions with other molecules, notably small molecules (compounds, such as metabolites). The precise nature of the protein-compound interaction, and thus, the associated function, is determined by the stereochemical and physicochemical properties of the sites at which the interaction occurs (binding pockets). Thus, novel functions (binding of novel compounds) generally require the emergence of new binding sites. With the recent breakthroughs in protein structure prediction, the complete set of protein structures has become available. This allowed us to apply computational binding site predictions and to investigate the entirety of all pockets (the ""pocketome"") across eleven different species from all kingdoms of life, and to study the relationship between emergence of novel bindings sites with increasing sizes of proteomes, the set of all protein structures in a species. We found that there is a sub-linear relationship between unique pockets and unique protein structures, suggesting that during evolution, functional diversity shows evidence of saturation, which is in line with other reports to that effect, but is approached here from the perspective of compound-binding specificities. Our study constitutes the first large-scale investigation of the pocketomes based on the now available high-confidence protein structures."
"Protein language models (pLMs) are powerful predictors of protein structure and function, learning through unsupervised training on millions of protein sequences. pLMs are thought to capture common motifs in protein sequences, but the specifics of pLM features are not well understood. Identifying these features would not only shed light on how pLMs work, but potentially uncover novel protein biology--studying the model to study the biology. Motivated by this, we train sparse autoencoders (SAEs) on the residual stream of a pLM, ESM-2. By characterizing SAE features, we determine that pLMs use a combination of generic features and family-specific features to represent a protein. In addition, we demonstrate how known sequence determinants of properties such as thermostability and subcellular localization can be identified by linear probing of SAE features. For predictive features without known functional associations, we hypothesize their role in unknown mechanisms and provide visualization tools to aid their interpretation. Our study gives a better understanding of the limitations of pLMs, and demonstrates how SAE features can be used to help generate hypotheses for biological mechanisms. We release our code (github.com/etowahadams/interprot), model weights (huggingface.co/liambai/InterProt-ESM2-SAEs), and visualizer (interprot.com)."
"Biodiversity monitoring primarily focuses on particular taxonomic groups for which identification expertise is widely available, such as vascular plants or birds. As a result, the response of many taxonomic groups to forest management is much less documented. With the advent of low-cost next generation barcoding approaches, it is now possible to envisage monitoring strategies based on molecular approaches, beyond metabarcoding/eDNA strategies that do not give access to species abundances and integrate species presence over largely unknown spatio-temporal scales. In this contribution, we demonstrate the use of massive DNA barcoding - also referred as megabarcoding - as a promising solution to overcome identification difficulties in demanding taxonomic groups. We performed a proof of concept study in a mountainous beech forest in the Massif Central, France. We sampled soil macrofauna at 25 sampling sites and managed to visually identify at the species level 130 out of the 1413 sampled individuals. Using megabarcoding on the 1283 remaining non-identified individuals, we managed to assign 1124 additional individuals to an operational taxonomic species at a competitive cost. We present the summary statistics of barcoding success in the different taxonomic groups encountered and in larvae versus adult individuals. We demonstrate that larvae individuals, which can hardly be visually identified at the species level, make a substantial contribution to overall macrofauna diversity. We finally showcase how this megabarcoding approach provides a concrete avenue for forest biodiversity monitoring, by assessing the cost and labour intensity of this approach."
"Neurons can maintain stable activity profiles over their lifetimes despite ion channel turnover over minutes to weeks. Neuronal activity is also influenced by regulating the voltage-dependence of ion channels. How do these two forms of plasticity work together to maintain a stable activity profile? We augment a classical model of activity-dependent ion channel density regulation with a mechanism that adjusts channel voltage-dependence based on activity. These findings reveal that the timescale of these mechanisms shape the specific electrical activity patterns that achieve a target activity profile. Moreover, alterations in channel voltage-dependence can impact a neurons ability to recover from perturbations. These results highlight a potentially distinct role for activity-dependent regulation of channel voltage-dependence in maintaining stable neuronal activity profiles."
"The rapid emergence of mineralized structures in diverse animal groups during the late Ediacaran and early Cambrian periods likely resulted from modifications of pre-adapted biomineralization genes inherited from a common ancestor. As the oldest extant phylum with mineralized structures, sponges are key to understanding animal biomineralization. Yet, the biomineralization process in sponges, particularly in forming spicules, is not well-understood. To address this, we conducted transcriptomic, genomic, and proteomic analyses on the calcareous sponge Sycon ciliatum, supplemented by in situ hybridization. We identified 829 genes overexpressed in regions of increased calcite spicule formation, including 17 calcarins--proteins analogous to corals galaxins localized in the spicule matrix and expressed in sclerocytes. Their expression varied temporally and spatially, specific to certain spicule types, indicating that fine-tuned gene regulation is crucial for biomineralization control. Similar subtle expression changes are also relevant in stony coral biomineralization. Tandem gene arrangements and expression changes suggest that gene duplication and neofunctionalization have significantly shaped Sycon ciliatums biomineralization, similar to that in corals. These findings suggest a parallel evolution of carbonate biomineralization in the calcitic Sycon ciliatum and aragonitic corals, exemplifying the evolution of mechanisms crucial for animals to act as ecosystem engineers and form reef structures."
"It is assumed Non-volatile tastes like sucrose do not activate retro nasal pathways. Recent studies find that sucrose when aerosolized, can reach the retro nasal olfactory region and be perceived. The neural mechanisms by which the human brain interprets sucrose via retro nasal pathways is unknown. We examined neural activity to sucrose with a nose clip on (blocking retro nasal) and nose clip off, in healthy adults (N=34, mean 25 yrs.). We examined the whole brain and ROIs involved in taste, smell, attention, reward and multi-modal integration; insula, postcentral gyrus, amygdala, olfactory cortex, subgenual and pregenual anterior cingulate, nucleus accumbens and OFC. We also examined correlations with subjective ratings of pleasantness and mouth fullness. We also examined the effect of the nose clip on the time to peak activity for sucrose using the bold signal time course. The nose clip on vs off reduced the subjective experience of mouth fullness. Neural activity to sucrose was reduced with the nose clip on in the primary taste, olfactory, attention and reward ROIs and in the rolandic operculum, lingual gyrus and precuneus in the whole brain analyses. The olfactory and prefrontal cortex ROIs tracked subjective mouth fullness, but this was not apparent with the nose clip on. Blocking retro nasal sensation reduces subjective and neural responses to sucrose taste. Retro nasal sensations could play a role in pure taste perception. Developing more satisfying low-sugar foods could be achieved by enhancing the perception of sweetness through aroma modulation."
"Animal group foraging produces inequality of food gain among individuals due to their differences, particularly dominance rank. External environmental factors, such as the spatial distribution of food, may mitigate the influence of social features on individual food acquisition. However, the role of environmental fluctuation in social foraging inequality remains largely unexplored Here, we investigated how repeated environmental changes affect inequality in food acquisition among captive large-billed crows (Corvus macrorhynchos). By repeatedly altering the relationship between feeding sites and food quantity, we examined changes in the inequality of food gains using Gini coefficient. In the short-term, food allocation became unequal immediately after each change but subsequently recovered. Over successive fluctuations, inequality in food acquisition declined in the long-term, while group foraging efficiency increased. We observed a significant influence of sex on food acquisition, while the expected effect of dominance rank was not detected. Our findings provide the first experimental evidence that changing environments can mitigate inequalities in food gains within foraging groups, highlighting the importance of incorporating naturalistic environmental changes into experimental designs for future group-foraging studies."
"Human-modified environments offer novel resources, but their exploitation can be a source of human-wildlife conflict. Residents of Sydney have reported increasing cases of bin-opening behavior by sulphur-crested cockatoos (Cacatua galerita), with evidence this behavior is socially learned between birds. Households protected their bins, yet cockatoos have learned to defeat these defences. In response, residents increased their defence-level, setting the stage for a behavioral ""arms race"". Here, we investigate this arms race by combining field observations with agent-based modeling. We systematically document protections in a suburban locality over two years, revealing spatial clustering of protections indicative of social learning among residents. We find that protections have decreased since 2019, and overly-costly protection is dis-preferred. With a controlled assay, we characterize the knowledge of local cockatoos, finding differential proficiency in defeating protections. Surprisingly, we identified several cockatoos that can defeat high-efficacy protections, such as locks. Finally, we simulate interactions between two populations of learning agents representing households and cockatoos. We find that social learning accelerates adaptation in both species, while coordination reduces costs associated with defensive escalation. However, policy interventions can have unintended consequences, accelerating cockatoos skill acquisition and shifting conflict to neighboring areas. Our findings highlight the dynamic nature of human-wildlife conflict and the importance of considering behavioral feedback loops in urban wildlife management."
"The potential for bioremediation of dichloroanilines (2,3- and 3,4-DCA) and dichloronitrobenzenes (3,4-, 2,5- and 2,3-DCNB) was investigated using inocula from an industrial site in northeast of Brazil. Anaerobic biotransformation of these chlorinated compounds was observed in microcosms simulating site conditions, particularly when electron donor was added. To disentangle specific transformation reactions, sub-cultures from active anaerobic microcosms were enriched with individual DCA or DCNB isomers. In these single-compound enrichment cultures, DCNB isomers were reduced to the corresponding DCA. Each DCA isomer was stoichiometrically dechlorinated to the corresponding monochloroaniline (CA) isomers. Further dechlorination of CA to aniline was noted. The reduction of DCNB to DCA was sustained by known fermenters and possibly Desulfitobacterium, while Dehalobacter was clearly responsible for dechlorination of DCAs. These findings helped to attribute function to microbial community data retrieved from field samples to inform the conceptual site model and enable identification of bioactive zones and rate-limiting conditions at a complex site. More generally, these data broaden the understanding of the metabolic repertoire of Dehalobacter and provide a model for incorporating microbial community data into site remediation efforts.

"The worlds ecosystems are shaped by microbiota. Their niches and their impacts depend on functional profiles influenced by gene gains and losses. While culture-based experiments demonstrate that mobile genetic elements (MGEs) can mediate gene flux, quantitative field data on the rates and impacts of MGE activity remains scarce. Here we leverage large-scale soil meta-omic data to develop and apply analytics for studying MGEs in complex natural systems. In our model permafrost-thaw ecosystem, Stordalen Mire, we identify [~]2.1 million MGE recombinases across 89 microbial phyla to assess ecological distributions, affected functions, past mobility, and current activity. This revealed MGEs shaping natural genetic diversity via differential impacts on major phyla; affecting a wide range of functions, including diverse regulatory and metabolic genes affecting carbon flux and nutrient cycling; and moving at rates that should significantly influence the realized functional profiles of natural microbiomes. These findings and this systematic meta-omic framework open new avenues to better investigate MGE diversity, activity, mobility, and impacts in nature."
"The Pfs230:Pfs48/45 complex forms the basis for leading malaria transmission-blocking vaccine candidates, yet li]le is known about its molecular assembly. Here, we used cryogenic electron microscopy to elucidate the structure of the endogenous Pfs230:Pfs48/45 complex bound to six potent transmission-blocking antibodies. Pfs230 consists of multiple domain clusters rigidified by interactions mediated through insertion domains. Membrane-anchored Pfs48/45 forms a disc-like structure and interacts with a short C-terminal peptide on Pfs230 that is critical for Pfs230 membrane-retention in vivo. Interestingly, membrane retention through this interaction is not essential for transmission to mosquitoes, suggesting that complex disruption is not a mode of action for transmission-blocking antibodies. Analyses of Pfs48/45-and Pfs230-targeted antibodies identify conserved epitopes on the Pfs230:Pfs48/45 complex and provides a structural paradigm for complement-dependent activity of Pfs230-targeting antibodies. Altogether, the antibody-bound Pfs230:Pfs48/45 structure presented improves our molecular understanding of this biological complex, informing the development of next-generation Plasmodium falciparum transmission-blocking interventions."
"The role of mutation rate in evolutionary rescue has been extensively explored, but little work has investigated how evolutionary rescue can promote mutators, lineages with higher mutation rates. Under complete linkage, we investigate the likelihood of evolutionary rescue on a mutator background that either emerges de novo or pre-exists in the population prior to a severe environmental change. If such an evolutionary rescue event occurs, the mutator lineage sweeps into the population, and thus the environmental stress has promoted mutators. Our findings indicate that mutation rate evolution can substantially boost rescue probabilities, but stronger mutators are most effective when the wildtype has a low mutation rate, while their advantage diminishes for higher wildtype mutation rates. Interestingly, at intermediate wildtype mutation rates, emerging mutators can be almost equally likely to sweep no matter how slowly or quickly the environment changes. However, at low wildtype mutation rates, mutators are only likely to sweep for very slow environmental changes due to the sequential nature of necessary mutations for such sweeps to occur. Finally, we show that pre-existing mutators can be significantly more likely to rescue the population compared to the wildtype, provided the wildtypes mutation rate is relatively low. This research opens new avenues for investigating mutator dynamics in response to environmental stress."
"MotivationSequence-to-expression models typically do not consider chromatin accessibility, a major factor limiting gene regulation. We hypothesized that supplying accessibility as an input feature would allow a sequenceto-expression model to focus on important open regions of the genome.

ResultsWe found that the performance of such an augmented model was significantly better than that of sequence-only or accessibility-only models with similar architectures. Specifically, its ability to predict the expression of highly variable genes and gene expression in other cell types improved, and higher attribution scores in the input DNA sequences of the augmented model conformed to accessibility, enabling the learning of cell type-specific sequence patterns. Additionally, we show that fine-tuning a pre-trained sequence-only model with both sequence and accessibility can boost performance further and highlight the importance of sequencing depth in sequence-toexpression prediction.

"The dynamic integration of the lateralized and specialized capacities of the cerebral hemispheres constitutes a hallmark feature of human brain function. This inter-hemispheric exchange of information critically depends upon the corpus callosum. Classical descriptions of callosal organization outline a topographic gradient, such that specific fibers integrate distinct aspects of brain function. Here we present a challenge to this conventional model. Using neuroimaging data obtained from a new cohort of adult corpus callosotomy patients, we leverage modern network neuroscience techniques to show--for the first time--that full inter-hemispheric integration can be achieved via a small proportion ([~]1 cm) of intact posterior callosal fibers. Only complete callosotomy patients demonstrated the expected dissolution of typical inter-hemispheric network architectures, aligning with disconnection syndromes long-thought to reflect diminished information propagation and communication across the brain. These findings motivate a novel mechanistic understanding of synchronized inter-hemispheric neural activity for large-scale human brain function and behavior."
"Cranial radiotherapy causes progressive neurocognitive impairments in cancer survivors. Neuroinflammation is a key contributor, but its dynamics and consequences for brain function remain poorly understood. Here, we performed comprehensive longitudinal profiling from 6 hours to 1 year after irradiation (IR) of the mouse hippocampus, using transcriptomic, protein, and histological analyses. We identified delayed microglial responses initiated by mitotic progression coupled interferon signaling. IR rewired the parenchymal phagocyte profiles, triggered by progressive microglial loss, failure of repopulation through self-renewal, and compensatory generation of microglia-like cells derived from peripheral monocytes. These findings were also observed in autopsied human brain. Finally, we demonstrate two phases of neuronal asynchrony, an early one associated with inflammation and a late one associated with aberrant synaptic regulation. These results provide comprehensive, longitudinal insights into microglia responses that can aid in tailoring therapies to preserve cognition in cancer survivors."
"Sexual conflict over mating has been documented in many species, both in the field and in experimental studies. In pond damselflies (family Coenagrionidae), sexual conflict maintains female-limited colour poly-morphisms, with one female morph typically being a male mimic. However, it is not known whether sexual conflict can also explain the evolutionary origin of novel female morphs, and if so, what ecological factors play a role in this macroevolutionary transition, by modulating the strength of the conflict. Furthermore, the effects of sexual conflict on phylogenetic diversification remain controversial, with studies arguing that the evolution of alternative reproductive morphs, such as female-limited colour morphs, could either hinder or accelerate speciation. Here, we use phylogenetic comparative methods to show that female colour polymorphisms are more likely to evolve when population densities at breeding sites are high, and that these demographic conditions are more common at high latitudes and in open landscapes. We show that female-limited polymorphisms typically evolve from sexually dimorphic ancestors through the addition of a male-like female morph, consistent with the hypothesis of selection for male mimicry. Female polymorphic and sexually dimorphic lineages diversify at a higher rate than sexually monomorphic lineages, suggesting a broad diversity-promoting role of inter-sexual interactions based on visual signals. We conclude that female colour polymorphisms evolve in a predictable fashion, and are likely driven by ecological conditions that increase the rate of pre-mating interactions and thus the intensity of sexual conflict."
"Bacteria and cancer cells inhabit spatially heterogeneous environments, where migration shapes microhabitat structures critical for colonization and metastasis. The interplay between growth, migration, and spatial structure complicates the prediction of population responses to drug treatment--such as clearance or persistence--even under the same spatially averaged growth rate. Accurately predicting these responses is essential for designing effective treatment strategies. Here, we propose a minimal growth-migration model to study population dynamics on discrete microhabitat structures under spatial drug heterogeneity. By applying a kernel transformation, we map the original structure to an effective fully connected graph and derive a new exact criterion for population response based on a regularized Laplacian kernel reweighted by local growth rates. This criterion connects to forest closeness centrality and yields analytical bounds and sufficient conditions for population growth or decline. We find that higher structural connectivity--like increased migration--generally promotes decline. Our framework also informs optimal spatial drug assignments, which reduce to selecting interconnected subcores in the effective complete graph. For partially controllable microhabitats or unknown drug distributions, we identify strategies that ensure population decline. Overall, our results offer a new theoretical perspective on drug response in spatially structured populations and provide practical guidance for optimizing spatially explicit dosing strategies in heterogeneous environments."
"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are receiving increasing attention as biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and therapy. Although there are many computational methods to identify cancer lncRNAs, they do not comprehensively integrate multi-omics features for predictions or systematically evaluate the contribution of each omics to the multifaceted landscape of cancer lncRNAs. In this study, we developed an algorithm, POCALI, to identify cancer lncRNAs by integrating 44 omics features across six categories. We explored the contributions of different omics to identifying cancer lncRNAs and, more specifically, how each feature contributes to a single prediction. We also evaluated our model and benchmarked POCALI with existing methods. Finally, we validated the cancer phenotype and genomics characteristics of the predicted novel cancer lncRNAs. POCALI identified secondary structure and gene expression-related features as strong predictors of cancer lncRNAs, and epigenomic features as moderate predictors. POCALI performed better than other methods, especially in terms of sensitivity, and predicted more candidates. Novel POCALI-predicted cancer lncRNAs had strong relationships with cancer phenotypes, similar to known cancer lncRNAs.

Overall, this study facilitated the identification of previously undetected cancer lncRNAs and the comprehensive exploration of the multifaceted feature contributions to cancer lncRNA prediction."
"Current technological revolutions, involving artificial intelligence, mRNA vaccines, and quantum computing, are largely driven by industry. Despite the existing perception that commercial motives promote cutting-edge innovation, concerns may arise about their risk of limiting scientific exploration from diverse perspectives, which nurtures long-term innovative potential. Here, we investigate the interplay between scientific exploration and industrial influence by analyzing about 20 million papers and US, Chinese, and European patents in genetic research, a domain of far-reaching societal importance. We observe that research on new genes has declined since the early 2000s, but the exploration of novel gene combinations still underpins biotechnology innovation. Fields of highly practical or commercial focus are less likely to adopt the innovative approaches, exhibiting lower research vitality. Additionally, continuous scientific research creates exploratory opportunities for innovation, while industrys R&D efforts are typically short-lived. Alarmingly, up to 42.2-74.4% of these exploratory opportunities could be lost if scientific research is restrained by industry interests, highlighting the cost of over-reliance on commercially-driven research. Given the industrys dominance in recent technologies, our work calls for a balanced approach with long-term scientific exploration to preserve innovation vitality, unlock the full potential of genetic research and biotechnology, and address complex global challenges."
"The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, is a competent vector of arboviruses, such as dengue. After its introduction into southern Europe, this invasive species has been rapidly spreading as well as causing autochthonous cases of arboviral diseases. Both Ae. albopictus presence and potential to transmit arboviruses are facilitated at warm temperatures, hence global warming is expected to affect their presence in temperate regions.

We use a climate- and environmental-driven mechanistic modelling framework to investigate the impact of recent climate change on Ae. albopictus range expansion and its potential to transmit dengue in Western Europe. We simulate climatic suitability, adult density and dengue transmission risk which we compare with a large ensemble of entomological and epidemiological observations over the past 20 years. Most importantly, we analyze a novel spatiotemporal dataset of colonized municipalities in metropolitan France to estimate the spread rate of Ae. albopictus and compare it with model predictions. Lastly, we analyze the sensitivity of entomological and epidemiological risk to changes in temperature, rainfall and human density.

Distribution of simulated mosquito populations and dengue transmission risk satisfactorily match entomological and dengue observations for Western Europe (AUC = 0.90 and 0.75 respectively). While lowlands in southern Europe were already climatically suitable for hosting Ae. albopictus around 2010, Western France, together with large populated cities, such as London, Zagreb and Vienna, have become suitable recently. Importantly, the accelerating colonization of Ae. albopictus in France may be approaching the limit of its theoretical climatic niche; future expansion will depend on the climate-driven enlargement of suitable areas. Area at risk of dengue transmission has recently expanded from the Mediterranean coasts over northern Spain and Western France. The sensitivity analysis suggests that climate change may expose medium-sized cities to the highest epidemiological risk; this finding is consistent with recently reported dengue outbreaks in Europe."
"The risk of viral transmissions from domestic and wild animals to humans is of high concern for human health. Humans can also transmit viral infections back to domestic and wild animals, which can then act as reservoir for the maintenance of viruses, with the risk of epidemic diseases re-emergence. The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causing the COVID-19, likely originated from wildlife and has already been evidenced to be transmitted from humans to captive, domestic and wild animals. In particular, white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) show high-prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 following human contamination, and recent data suggest that white-tailed deer could act as an emerging virus reservoir. Here, we investigated whether SARS-CoV-2 could also have emerged in several longitudinally-monitored populations of European roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) in direct contact with humans in France. We performed indirect tests (serological ELISAs and seroneutralization) on serum collected pre- and post-emergence of the virus in human populations. We also performed direct tests (nasal swabs followed by RT-PCR) to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in those populations in 2022. We also investigated the exposure and prevalence of the virus in three other cervid species in France. ELISA tests were positive for 2.20 % of the sera tested, both pre- and post-emergence of the virus, but all positive samples were negative with seroneutralization. Direct PCR testing showed no positive results in 2022. Thus, although seroprevalence increased after the COVID-19 emergence (2022) in one out of three roe deer population, our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has not emerged in those populations, and that ELISA cross-reaction with another circulating virus, possibly an unidentified bovine coronavirus, is possible."

In particular, white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) show high-prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 following human contamination, and recent data suggest that white-tailed deer could act as an emerging virus reservoir. Here, we investigated whether SARS-CoV-2 could also have emerged in several longitudinally-monitored populations of European roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) in direct contact with humans in France. We performed indirect tests (serological ELISAs and seroneutralization) on serum collected pre- and post-emergence of the virus in human populations. We also performed direct tests (nasal swabs followed by RT-PCR) to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in those populations in 2022. We also investigated the exposure and prevalence of the virus in three other cervid species in France. ELISA tests were positive for 2.20 % of the sera tested, both pre- and post-emergence of the virus, but all positive samples were negative with seroneutralization. Direct PCR testing showed no positive results in 2022. Thus, although seroprevalence increased after the COVID-19 emergence (2022) in one out of three roe deer population, our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has not emerged in those populations, and that ELISA cross-reaction with another circulating virus, possibly an unidentified bovine coronavirus, is possible."
"DNA and RNA nucleotide sequences are ubiquitous in all biological cells, serving as both a comprehensive library of capabilities for the cells and as an impressive regulatory system to control cellular function. The multi-alignment framework (MAF) provided in this study offers a user-friendly platform for sequence alignment and quantification. It is adaptable to various research needs and can incorporate different tools and parameters for in-depth analysis, especially in low read rate scenarios. This framework can be used to compare results from different alignment programs and algorithms on the same dataset, allowing for a comprehensive analysis of subtle to significant differences. This concept is demonstrated in a small RNA case study. MAF is specifically designed for the Linux platform, commonly used in bioinformatics. Its script structure streamlines processing steps, saving time when repeating procedures with various data sets. While the focus is on microRNA analysis, the templates provided can be adapted for all transcriptomic and genomic analyses. The template structure allows for flexible integration of pre- and post-processing steps. MicroRNA analysis indicates that STAR and Bowtie2 alignment programs are more effective than BBMap. Combining STAR with the Salmon quantifier, or with some limitations, the Samtools quantification, appears to be the most reliable approach. This method is ideal for scientists who want to thoroughly analyze their alignment results to ensure quality. The detailed microRNA analysis demonstrates the quality of three alignment and two quantification methods, offering guidance on assessing result quality and reducing false positives."
"Our desktop application MBCO PathNet allows for quick and easy integration and visualization of networks of functionally related pathways predicted from numerous gene and protein lists using the Molecular Biology of the Cell Ontology (MBCO) and other ontologies. Within networks of hierarchical parent-child relationships or functional relationships, pathways are visualized as pie charts where each slice represents a dataset that predicted that pathway. Sizes of pies and slices can be selected to represent statistical significance or other quantitative measures. In addition, MBCO PathNet can generate bar diagrams, heatmaps and timelines.

"The phosphorylation of the microtubule-associated tau protein plays a key role in the regulation of its physiological function. In particular, tau hyperphosphorylation affects its binding on the tubulin surface, destabilizing the tau-microtubule interface and leading to the accumulation of fibrillar aggregates in the brain. In this work, we performed classical Molecular Dynamics simulations for the tau-R2/tubulin assembly with various phosphorylations states of serines 285, 289 and 293. We analyze the resulting trajectories to obtain a detailed view of the protein interface in the complex, and the impact of tau phosphorylations on the stability of this assembly, and on the tubulin disordered C-Terminal tails (CTTs) mobility. We show how the tubulin CTTs help maintaining the tau-R2 fragment on the tubulin surface despite the destabilizing effect induced by phosphorylations. Conversely, tau phosphorylation affects the CTTs flexibility and their potential activity as MAP recruiting hooks. Furthermore, counterion mediated bridges between the phosphate groups and tubulin glutamates also contribute to the binding of tau-R2 on the MT. Overall, the complex dynamics of this fuzzy phosphorylated assembly sheds a new light on the importance of the cytoplasmic environment in neurons in the context of Alzheimers disease."
"Seeds should not germinate in conditions unsuitable for seedling growth. Dormancy, which allows seeds to remain inactive in an environment that would otherwise enable germination, helps optimize the timing of germination. Primary dormancy, developed during seed maturation on the parent plant, prevents immediate germination post-dispersal, regardless of external conditions. Secondary dormancy, however, is triggered post-dispersal when seeds face unfavorable conditions, enabling them to re-enter dormancy even if initially non-dormant. This mechanism allows seeds to fine-tune germination according to environmental conditions. In this study, we examined the role of heat-induced secondary dormancy in local adaptation by analyzing natural variations within 361 Arabidopsis thaliana accessions from across Europe. We discovered that secondary dormancy acquisition varies with primary dormancy levels and after-ripening. Both primary and heat-induced secondary dormancy exhibited adaptive clines along temperature and precipitation gradients, with secondary dormancy showing a steeper cline, indicating its significant role in local adaptation. Using species distribution models, we predicted that genotypes with high secondary dormancy would show greater resilience to future climate changes. Additionally, we identified specific genomic regions controlling secondary dormancy levels, including a novel candidate gene for secondary dormancy variation. Our findings show that secondary dormancy is a complex adaptive mechanism and a predominant contributor to the dormancy trait syndrome that favors plant survival in habitats exposed to harsh summers.

Summary statementSecondary dormancy induced by heat exposure allows seed to adjust their germination strategies to the environment. This study shows that heat-induced secondary dormancy in Arabidopsis thaliana depends on levels of primary dormancy. Its covariance with climatic parameter indicates that it can contribute to population resilience to climate change. This study further identifies the specific genetics underlying the ability to induce dormancy after dispersal."
"Many insects and other animals host heritable endosymbionts that alter host fitness and reproduction. The prevalence of facultative endosymbionts can fluctuate in host populations across time and geography for reasons that are poorly understood. This is particularly true for maternally transmitted Wolbachia bacteria, which infect roughly half of all insect species. For instance, the frequencies of several wMel-like Wolbachia, including wMel in host Drosophila melanogaster, fluctuate over time in certain host populations, but the specific conditions that generate temporal variation in Wolbachia prevalence are unresolved. We implemented a discrete generation model in the new R package symbiontmodeler to evaluate how finite-population stochasticity contributes to Wolbachia fluctuations over time in simulated host populations under a variety of conditions. Using empirical estimates from natural Wolbachia-Drosophila systems, we explored how stochasticity is determined by a broad range of factors, including host population size, maternal transmission rates, and Wolbachia effects on host fitness (modeled as fecundity) and reproduction (cytoplasmic incompatibility; CI). While stochasticity generally increases when host fitness benefits and CI are relaxed, we found that a decline in the maternal transmission rate had the strongest relative impact on increasing the size of fluctuations. We infer that non- or weak-CI-causing strains like wMel, which often show evidence of imperfect maternal transmission, tend to generate larger stochastic fluctuations compared to strains that cause strong CI, like wRi in D. simulans. Additional factors, such as fluctuating host fitness effects, are required to explain the largest examples of temporal variation in Wolbachia. The conditions we simulate here using symbiontmodeler serve as a jumping off point for understanding drivers of temporal and spatial variation in the prevalence of Wolbachia, the most common endosymbionts found in nature."
"Actin-based cell motility drives many neurodevelopmental events including guided axonal growth. Fascin is a major family of F-actin bundling proteins, but its role in axon development in vivo and brain wiring remains unclear. Here, we report that fascin is required for axon development, brain wiring and function. We show that fascin is enriched in the motile filopodia of axonal growth cones and its inhibition impairs axonal extension and branching of hippocampal neurons in culture. We next provide evidence that fascin is essential for axon development and brain wiring in vivo using Drosophila melanogaster as a model. Drosophila expresses a single ortholog of mammalian fascin called Singed (SN), which is expressed in the mushroom body (MB) of the central nervous system. Loss of SN causes severe MB disruption, marked by - and {beta}-lobe defects indicative of altered axonal guidance. SN-null flies also exhibit defective sensorimotor behaviors as assessed by the negative geotaxis assay. MB-specific expression of SN in SN-null flies rescues MB structure and sensorimotor deficits, indicating that SN functions autonomously in MB neurons. Together, our data from primary neuronal culture and in vivo models highlight a critical role for fascin in brain development and function.

"Most neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimers disease (AD) and multiple sclerosis (MS), are associated with abnormal phosphorylation of tau (p-tau) in the brain. Immunostaining studies have revealed an accumulation of p-tau in the AD retina and suggested it may reflect tau pathology in the brain. To validate these findings and further investigate the relationship between retinal and brain tau pathology, we used mass spectrometry to measure p-tau peptides in matched retinal and hippocampal samples from non-demented controls (NC, n=8), AD (n=12), and MS (n=4). We analysed the differences in p-tau levels between diagnoses and explored how retinal p-tau variants correlate with hippocampal p-tau and neuropathological changes. Our results revealed peaks corresponding to tau peptides phosphorylated at T181, S199/S202, T231, S396 + T403/S404, and T403/S404. These p-tau peptides were also detected in the hippocampal samples, along with additional p-tau peptides such as T217 and S262. Total tau phosphorylation and phosphorylation at S199/S202 and T231 were significantly higher in the retina of AD cases compared to NC. These two peptides, along with peptides phosphorylated at S396+T403/S404 and T403/S404, were also higher in cases with high amyloid-beta (A{beta}) Braak stages compared to those with low A{beta} Braak stages. Higher A{beta} Braak stages were also associated with higher mass spectrometry peak intensities of peptides phosphorylated at S199/S202 and S396+T403/S404. Additionally, retinal p-tau peptides at S396+T403/S404 and T403/S404 correlated with neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) Braak stages, and p-tau peptides S396+T403/S404 in the retina were linked to corresponding phosphorylation in the CA1 region. These findings underscore the connection between retinal and brain tau pathology and highlight the potential of retinal tau as a biomarker for AD diagnosis and monitoring while also deepening our understanding of tauopathies in both the retina and brain."
"Adaptation to ant and/or termite consumption (myrmecophagy) in mammals constitutes a textbook example of convergent evolution, being independently derived in several mammalian lineages. Myrmecophagous species are characterized by striking convergent morphological adaptations such as skull elongation, enlargement of salivary glands, and long claws to dig into ant and termite nests. These evolutionary modifications also include anatomical regression, such as dental simplification or loss, reduction of masticatory muscles, and possessing a reduced set of taste buds. To gain insights into the molecular changes underlying the regression of these morpho-anatomical traits, we investigated the functionality of candidate genes related to dentition, gustation, and mastication in nine convergent myrmecophagous mammalian lineages. We examined these genes in a comparative phylogenetic context, paired with molecular evolutionary analyses, to estimate the relative timing of loss of gene function over the evolutionary history of each convergent lineage. We found that gustatory reduction and pseudogenization of masticatory myosin often were associated with the regression of dental genes. Evidence of pseudogenization events linked to oral anatomy dates to as early as the Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary, and is an ongoing process including examples of incipient gene inactivations. Whereas we found evidence for gene inactivations across all three functional categories occurring during distinct temporal intervals, there was variation in the sets of genes lost and the relative timing of inactivation events. The combined evidence suggests that the convergent evolution of myrmecophagy has occurred as a protracted process with distinct phases of anatomical evolution, over timescales as long as 60 Myr."
"Graphs are powerful tools for modeling and analyzing molecular interaction networks. Graphs typically represent either undirected physical interactions or directed regulatory relationships, which can obscure a particular proteins functional context. Graphlets can describe local topologies and patterns within graphs, and combining physical and regulatory interactions offer new graphlet configurations that can provide biological insights. We present GRPhIN, a tool for characterizing graphlets and protein roles within graphlets in mixed physical and regulatory interaction networks. We describe the graphlets of mixed networks in B. subtilis, C. elegans, D. melanogaster, D. rerio, and S. cerevisiae and examine local topologies of proteins and sub- networks related to the oxidative stress response pathway. We found a number of graphlets that were abundant in all species, specific node positions (orbits) within graphlets that were over-represented in stress-associated proteins, and rarely-occurring graphlets that were over-represented in oxidative stress subnetworks. These results showcase the potential for using graphlets in mixed physical and regulatory interaction networks to identify new patterns beyond a single interaction type."
"Pregnancy and postpartum experiences represent transformative physiological states that impose lasting demands on the maternal body and brain, resulting in lifelong neural adaptations1-6. However, the precise molecular mechanisms driving these persistent alterations remain poorly understood. Here, we used brain-wide transcriptomic profiling to define the molecular landscape of parity-induced neural plasticity, identifying the dorsal hippocampal formation (dHF) as a key site of transcriptional remodeling. Combining single-cell RNA sequencing with a maternal-pup separation paradigm, we additionally demonstrated that chronic postpartum stress significantly disrupts dHF adaptations by altering dopamine dynamics, leading to changes in the dopamine-dependent histone post-translational modification - H3 dopaminylation, with further alterations in transcription, cellular plasticity, and behavior. In human dorsal subiculum, a brain structure within the dHF, we uncovered conserved patterns of parity-dependent alterations in H3 dopaminylation and transcription. We further established the sufficiency of dopamine modulation in regulating these parity-induced adaptations via chemogenetic suppression of dopamine release into the dHF, which recapitulated key epigenomic and behavioral features of parity in virgin female mice. In sum, our findings establish dopamine as a central regulator of parity-induced neuroadaptations in humans and mice, revealing a fundamental transcriptional mechanism by which female reproductive experiences remodel the brain to sustain long-term behavioral adaptations."
"A significant challenge for neurofeedback training research and related clinical applications, is participants difficulty in learning to induce specific brain patterns during training. Here, we address this issue in the context of fMRI-based decoded neurofeedback (DecNef). Arguably, discrepancies between the data used to construct the decoder and the data used for neurofeedback training, such as differences in data distributions and experimental contexts, neural and non-neural noise, are likely the cause of the difficulties of the aforementioned participants. Here, we developed a co-adaptation procedure using standard machine learning algorithms. The procedure involves an adaptive decoder algorithm that is updated in real time based on its predictions across neurofeedback trials. First, we tested the procedure via simulations using a previous DecNef dataset. and showed that decoder coadaptation can improve performance during neurofeedback training. Importantly, a drift analysis demonstrated the stability of the co-adapted decoder throughout the neurofeedback training sessions. We then collected real time fMRI data in a DecNef training procedure to provide proof of concept evidence that co-adaptation enhances participants ability to induce the target state during training. Thus, personalized decoders through co-adaptation can improve the precision and reliability of DecNef training protocols to target specific brain representations, with ramifications in translational research. The tools are made openly available to the scientific community."
"Integrins form focal adhesions (FAs) at the cell edge and fibrillar adhesions (FBs) located centrally, with both serving as a link to the actin cytoskeleton. Talins 1 and 2, key mechanosensitive proteins, are not functionally redundant. Talin1 is essential to FAs, while talin2 is found in large FAs and FBs. KANK (kidney ankyrin repeat-containing) family proteins regulate adhesion dynamics, with KANK2 binding both talins in FAs and localizing to FBs where only talin2 is present. Previously, we showed in melanoma cell line MDA-MB-435S that talin2 within integrin V{beta}5 FAs interacts with KANK2 to regulate actin-microtubule (MT) dynamics, and knocking down either protein reduces cell migration. Here, we demonstrate that RPMI-7951 melanoma cells also use integrin V{beta}5 FAs for adhesion but additionally form integrin 5{beta}1 FBs, and that KANK2 and talin2 are present in both structures. KANK2 functionally interacts with talin1 to maintain FAs, and with talin2 to regulate their dynamics. KANK2 within FBs regulates cell migration. This was demonstrated upon KANK2 knockdown that mirrors integrin 5 knockdown, increasing migration via MTs. Overall, our study highlights the distinct roles of KANK2 and talin2 in different adhesion structures, influencing melanoma cell migration."
"Memory formation is necessary for the survival of animals across phyla. Here, we elucidate the mechanism underlying the formation of long-term associative memory (LTAM) formed by treating Caenorhabditis elegans with a volatile chemoattractant and heat. Previous work has shown that training animals with a paradigm involving heat and isoamyl alcohol (IAA) simultaneously, causes C. elegans to lose their attraction to IAA. In this study, we elaborate on the mechanism behind this LTAM formation and suggest that during training with heat and IAA, C. elegans release extracellular vesicles (EVs) that upon being taken up by the same trained animals or their untrained counterparts causes the organism to lose attraction to IAA. Our data suggests that the vesicles are highly specific to the training paradigms used and differ with differing cues. Finally, we show that this mechanism of transfer of LTAM appears to be conserved between C. elegans and C. briggsae allowing for both intra and interspecies transfer of memory."
"Evolutionary studies in population genetics and ecology were mainly focused on predicting and understanding past evolutionary events. Recently, however, a growing trend explores the prediction of evolutionary trajectories toward the future promoted by its wide variety of applications. In this context, we introduce a forecasting protein evolution method that integrates birth-death population models with substitution models that consider selection on protein folding stability. In contrast to traditional population genetics methods that usually make the unrealistic assumption of simulating molecular evolution separately from the evolutionary history, the present method combines both processes to simultaneously model forward-in-time birth-death evolutionary trajectories and protein evolution under structurally constrained substitution models that outperformed traditional empirical substitution models. We implemented the method into a freely available computer framework. We evaluated the accuracy of the predictions with several monitored viral proteins of broad interest. Overall, the method showed acceptable errors in predicting the folding stability of the forecasted protein variants but, expectedly, the errors were larger in the prediction of the corresponding sequences. We conclude that forecasting protein evolution is feasible in certain evolutionary scenarios and provide suggestions to enhance its accuracy by improving the underlying models of evolution."
"ContextBats are the only mammals who have conquered the skies (Gunnell & Simmons, 2005; Thewissen & Babcock, 1992) and the leading mammals in terms of total biomass (Greenspoon et al., 2023) with the exception of domestic mammals. However, the ecology of bats is still a mystery, especially in poorly sampled regions such as Central Africa.

AimsWe present a new method for studying the nocturnal and annual phenologies of cave bat communities in data deficient regions.

MethodsIn two caves (Mont Belo and Boundou) in the Republic of Congo, which are home to several species of insectivorous bats throughout the year, we set up an acoustic monitoring protocol (PAM) over a period of 19 months. In both caves, we collected a total of 2,375,956 acoustic files. We detected the presence of five distinct bat groups or species.

Key resultsOur results showed bimodal activity throughout the year, except during the long rainy season, when tri- or quadri-modal activity was detected. Activity distributed throughout the night is related to the period of juvenile rearing (gestation, parturition and lactation). For all acoustic groups, we also observed high activity from October to March (long rainy season, short dry season and short rainy season) and low activity during the long dry season (June, July, August). This high activity is linked to the lactation period, the independence of young bats and potentially the mating period. Finally, the reproductive activity of insectivorous bat species is synchronized with the period of high resource availability.

ConclusionThis study demonstrated the great variability of activity in five acoustic groups of cave-dwelling insectivorous bats, while at the same time gathering valuable information on bat species in the Congo. These variations are strongly linked to the season and/or the biological cycle of these species. This information is relevant to understanding the mechanisms by which colonies of cave bats can merge and fission.

ImplicationsThe use of this technique can provide essential information to estimate insectivorous bat populations in habitats that have been poorly sampled using this passive acoustic monitoring protocol."
"Many transcription factors regulate DNA accessibility and gene expression by recognizing post-translational modifications on histone tails within nucleosomes. These interactions are often studied in vitro using short peptide mimics of histone tails, which may overlook conformational changes that occur in the full nucleosomal context. Here, we employ molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the binding dynamics of the PHD finger and bromodomain of BPTF, both in solution and bound to either a histone H3 peptide or a full nucleosome. Our results show that BPTF adopts distinct conformational states depending on its binding context, with nucleosome engagement inducing compaction of the multidomain structure. PHD finger binding displaces the H3 tail from DNA, increasing H3 tail flexibility while promoting compensatory binding of the H4 tail to nucleosomal DNA. This redistribution of histone-DNA contacts weakens overall hydrogen bonding with DNA, suggesting localized destabilization of the nucleosome core. Despite electrostatic repulsion limiting direct reader-DNA contacts, strong Van der Waals interactions with the H3 tail stabilize binding. Our results provide atomistic insight into how BPTF engagement modulates nucleosome structure and may facilitate chromatin remodeling."
"Investigating the temporal dynamics of gene expression is crucial for understanding gene regulation across various biological processes. Using the Fluorescent Timer protein (Timer), the Timer-of-cell-kinetics-and-activity (Tocky) system enables analysis of transcriptional dynamics at the single-cell level. However, the complexity of Timer data has limited its broader application. Here, we introduce an integrative approach combining molecular biology and machine learning to elucidate Foxp3 transcriptional dynamics through flow cytometric Timer analysis. We have developed a Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNet) approach that incorporates image conversion and Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) for class-specific feature identification at the single-cell level. Biologically, we developed a novel CRISPR mutant of Foxp3-Tocky lacking the Conserved Non-coding Sequence 2 (CNS2), which has successfully elucidated CNS2-dependent Foxp3 transcription dynamics, revealing novel roles of CNS2 in regulating Foxp3 transcription frequency under specific conditions. Furthermore, generating new data from WT Foxp3 Tocky mice at various ages, the Grad-CAM methods successfully revealed distinct dynamics of Foxp3 expression from neonatal to aged mice, highlighting prominent thymus-like features of neonatal splenic Foxp3+ T cells. In conclusion, our study uncovers previously unrecognised Foxp3 transcriptional dynamics, establishing a proof-of-concept for integrating CRISPR, Tocky, and machine learning methods as advanced techniques to understand transcriptional dynamics in vivo."
"The choroid plexuses (ChPs) are modified epithelial structures that penetrate all four cerebral ventricles and secrete cerebrospinal fluid. They consist of a central stroma that is vascularized with fenestrated blood vessels and connective tissue. The ChPs are of dual embryonic origin, with forebrain neuroepithelial cells contributing to the epithelial component and mesenchymal cells contributing to the stromal cells. The growth of the ChPs into the ventricular spaces is fueled by the migration and proliferation of neuroepithelial progenitor cells originating from the cortical hem. However, the genetic regulation of neuroepithelial progenitor (NEP) migration during ChP development is not well understood. Here we report the role of Mllt11 (Af1q/Tcf7c) in the formation of the ChP in part by regulating the migration of Otx1/2+ NEPs into the base of the fetal ChP, fueling its ""treadmilling"" growth into the lateral ventricle. We used Cux2iresCre/+ allele to selectively ablate Mllt11 in the developing cortical hem and its principal derivatives, the ChP and hippocampus. We discovered that Mllt11 mutants displayed thickened cuboid epithelial architecture of the ChP but maintained the epithelial organization of the outer layer of the ChP. This likely contributed to shorter lateral ventricle ChP stalks in Mllt11 cKO brains."
"Modern chemical production, on which human quality of life depends, is unsustainable. Alternative, sustainable manufacturing routes must therefore be developed. Electrochemical and biological processes offer promise for upgrading waste streams, including recalcitrant carbon dioxide and plastic-derived wastes. However, these processes are challenged by the inherent heterogeneity and high energy input requirements for upcycling of the chemical endpoints of the ""take-make-waste"" economy. Cupriavidus necator is emerging as a potentially useful catalyst to valorize such complex feedstocks because of its extreme metabolic flexibility, which allows it to utilize a wide array of substrates, and its ability to use carbon dioxide directly via the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle. C. necator natively oxidizes hydrogen to power carbon utilization, but its inherent flexibility offers an as-yet unexplored opportunity to couple waste stream oxidation with carbon dioxide utilization instead, potentially enabling carbon conservative waste upcycling. Here, we uncover the constraints on carbon conservative chemical transformation using C. necator as a model. We systematically examine the carbon yield and thermodynamic feasibility of mixotrophic scenarios that combine waste-derived carbon sources with hydrogen oxidation to power carbon reassimilation. Then, we evaluate carbon-carbon mixotrophic scenarios, with one carbon source providing electrons in place of hydrogen oxidation. We show that both hydrogen and ethylene glycol have high potential as electron sources to drive carbon-neutral or carbon-negative mixotrophic upgrading of waste streams such as acetate or butyrate. In contrast, we find that carbon conservation is likely infeasible for most other waste-derived carbon sources. This work provides a roadmap to establishing novel C. necator strains capable of carbon efficient waste upcycling."
"While excess rainfall is associated with mosquito-borne disease because it sup-ports mosquito breeding, drought may also counterintuitively increase disease transmission by altering mosquito and host behavior. This phenomenon is important to understand because climate change is projected to increase both extreme rainfall and drought. In this study, we investigated the extent to which seasonally-driven mosquito and primate behavior drove the first yellow fever virus (YFV) epidemic in an urban area in Brazil in nearly a century, coinciding with an equally rare drought, and to assess the role of interventions in ending the outbreak. We hypothesized that drought triggered the outbreak by driving the forest mosquitoes and non-human primates towards the city in search of water and that the mosquitoes were biting more frequently to avoid desiccation. A dynamical YFV model supports these hypotheses, showing that both behavioral changes were needed to explain the outbreak timing and incidence. Fur-ther, a combination of vector control, conservation measures, and vaccination contributed to ending the outbreak, with the strongest effects from vaccination. Together, these results suggest that drought, likely to become more frequent in this region in the coming decades, can significantly influence mosquito-borne disease transmission, and that sustained control will require multiple interventions."
"BackgroundInfluenza A virus (IAV) poses a significant threat to animal health globally, with its ability to overcome species barriers and cause pandemics. Rapid and accurate IAV subtype and host source prediction are crucial for effective surveillance and pandemic preparedness. Deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing viral genomic sequences, offering new ways to uncover hidden patterns associated with viral characteristics and host adaptation.

FindingsWe introduce WaveSeekerNet, a novel deep learning model for accurate and rapid prediction of IAV subtypes and host source. The model leverages attention-based mechanisms and efficient token mixing schemes, including the Fourier Transform and the Wavelet Transform, to capture intricate patterns within viral RNA and protein sequences. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate WaveSeekerNets superior performance to existing models that use the traditional self-attention mechanism. Notably, WaveSeekerNet rivals VADR (Viral Annotation DefineR) in subtype prediction using the high-quality RNA sequences, achieving the maximum score of 1.0 on metrics including the Balanced Accuracy, F1-score (Macro Average), and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC). Our approach to subtype and host source prediction also exceeds the pre-trained ESM-2 (Evolutionary Scale Modeling) models with respect to generalization performance and computational cost. Furthermore, WaveSeekerNet exhibits remarkable accuracy in distinguishing between human, avian, and other mammalian hosts. The ability of WaveSeekerNet to flag potential cross-species transmission events underscores its significant value for real-time surveillance and proactive pandemic preparedness efforts.

ConclusionsWaveSeekerNets superior performance, efficiency, and ability to flag potential cross-species transmission events highlight its potential for real-time surveillance and pandemic preparedness. This model represents a significant advancement in applying deep learning for IAV classification and holds promise for future epidemiological, veterinary studies, and public health interventions."
"A significant portion of human cancers utilize a recombination-based pathway, Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT), to maintain telomere length. Targeting the ALT is of growing interest as a cancer therapy, yet a substantial knowledge gap remains regarding the basic features of telomeres in ALT-positive cells. To address this, we adopted END-seq, an unbiased sequencing-based approach, to define the identity and regulation of the terminal sequences of chromosomes in ALT cells. Our data reveal that the terminal portions of chromosomes in ALT cells contain canonical telomeric sequences with the same 5 terminus bias (-ATC) observed in non-ALT cells. Furthermore, as reported for non-ALT cells, POT1 is required to preserve the precise regulation of the 5 end in cells that maintain telomere length using the ALT pathway. Thus, the regulation of the terminal 5 of chromosomes occurs independently of the mechanism of telomere elongation. Additionally, we employed an S1 endonuclease-based sequencing method to determine the presence and origin of single-stranded regions within ALT telomeres. These data shed light on conserved and unique features of ALT telomeres."
"Osteoarthritis (OA) induces phenotypic changes in chondrocytes as well as alterations in matrix composition and mechanics. Yet, its impact on active cell-generated forces, a key indicator of cell-matrix interaction, remains poorly characterized. In this study, we systematically compared the force generation capacity and associated proteins of interest between human OA and non-OA articular chondrocytes and how they are affected by cell culture dimensionality (2D versus 3D) and matrix degradability. Using traction force microscopy (TFM) combined with high-resolution immunostainings we show that OA alters the expression and organization of proteins involved in force exertion and transmission across both 2D and 3D cultures, but only in a 3D degradable hydrogel environment do these changes translate into higher cell-generated contractile forces This increased force generation correlates with elevated protrusive activity, higher actomyosin content and engagement, as well as altered localization of adhesion and matrix proteins, all of which could contribute to increased cell-matrix interaction in OA chondrocytes. In contrast, OA chondrocytes display no increase in cell tractions when cultured on 2D hydrogel substrates. These findings demonstrate that the detection and interpretation of OA-related alterations in chondrocyte mechanobiology are strongly dependent on the dimensionality and degradable properties of the culture system. Our results highlight the critical role of 3D degradable environments in revealing disease-associated changes in chondrocyte force generation and emphasize the necessity of carefully selecting model systems when investigating OA mechanobiology."
"AAV capsid serotypes isolated from nature have been widely used in gene delivery and gene therapy. Recently, more than 1,000 distinct AAV capsids were identified from human clinical samples by high-throughput, long-read DNA sequencing. In this study, we tap into this broad natural biodiversity of AAV capsids to develop liver-tropic AAV capsids. We initially screened a subset of variants derived from AAV8 (n=159) for packaging efficiency. The high-yielding variants were subjected to a barcoded vector library screen in mice and ferrets for their ability to mediate liver gene transfer. Although no variant surpassed AAV8 for liver targeting, several exhibited a liver detargeting phenotype. Among these, we focused on the N271D variant (AAV8 VP1 numbering), located in the variable region I (VR-1), which has been previously implicated in influencing liver tropism. The liver detargeting phenotype of AAV8.N271D was confirmed by single vector administration in mice. Additionally, we grafted the N271D variant onto AAV9 and MyoAAV capsids (N270D by AAV9 VP1 numbering). The AAV9.N270D and MyoAAV.N270D vectors showed a similar liver-detargeting phenotype, although muscle targeting was moderately reduced. Although we did not identify any capsid variants that outperform AAV8 in liver transduction, this study reinforces the important role of VR-1 in modulating liver tropism and highlights the potential of engineering VR-1 residues to reduce liver gene transfer and associated toxicity observed in several gene therapy studies."
"Stalk mechanical properties impact plant stability and interactions with pathogenic microorganisms. The evaluation of stalk mechanics has focused primarily on the end-of-season outcomes and defined differences among inbred and hybrid maize genotypes. However, there is a gap in understanding how these different end-of-season outcomes are achieved. This study measured stalk flexural stiffness in maize inbred genotypes across multiple environments and in maize commercial hybrid genotypes under different disease states. Under all conditions, stalk flexural stiffness followed a biphasic trajectory, characterized by a linear increase phase and a sustained phase. Within a genotype, the environment or disease state altered the rate of increase in the linear phase but did not impact the timing of transition to the sustained phase. Whereas between genotypes, the timing of transition between phases varied. Destructive 3-point bend tests of inbred stalks showed that the trajectory of stalk mechanics is defined by the bending modulus, not the geometry. Together, these results define a biphasic trajectory of maize stalk mechanics that can be modulated by internal and external factors. This work provides a foundation for breeding programs to make informed decisions when selecting for optimized stalk mechanical trajectories, which is necessary for enhancing resilience to environmental stresses.

"The TOX protein (thymocyte selection-associated high mobility group box) is a critical transcription factor implicated in both T acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and CD8+ T cell exhaustion. Gene perturbation studies suggest that inhibiting TOX may have therapeutic implications for both leukemia and T cell exhaustion. However, due to its complex molecular mechanisms and intrinsically disordered structure, TOX has not been effectively targeted by small molecules to date. In this study, we used small molecule microarray (SMM) screening and biochemical assays to identify a series of TOX protein-protein interaction (PPI) inhibitors. We identified KI-TOX-A3 as a TOX protein binder and potent TOX PPI inhibitor. In T-ALL, KI-TOX-A3 revealed selective cytotoxicity and proteosome-dependent TOX degradation. In CD8+ T cells, KI-TOX-A3 potently reversed T cell exhaustion by decreasing surface inhibitory receptors, increasing expression of effector cytokines, and enhancing cancer cell killing activity. We also demonstrate the utility of KI-TOX-A3 to probe potential epigenetic regulatory mechanisms of TOX via KAT7 acetylation in T cells."
"Infections caused by fungal pathogens such as Candida and Cryptococcus are associated with high mortality rates, partly due to limitations in the current antifungal arsenal. This highlights the need for antifungal drug targets with novel mechanisms of action. The trehalose biosynthesis pathway is a promising antifungal drug target because trehalose biosynthesis is essential for virulence in Cryptococcus neoformans and Candida albicans and is also a mediator of fungal stress responses, such as thermotolerance. To exploit its untapped antifungal potentials, we screened the St. Jude 3-point pharmacophore library to identify small molecule inhibitors of the first enzyme in the trehalose biosynthesis pathway, trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (Tps1). Structure-guided optimization of a potent hit, SJ6675, yielded a water-soluble inhibitor named 4456dh. Employing biochemical, structural and cell-based assays, we demonstrate that 4456dh inhibits Tps1 enzymatic activity, suppresses trehalose synthesis and exerts a fungicidal effect. Notably, the structure of Tps1 in complex with 4456 reveals that 4456 occupies the substrate binding pocket. Importantly, 4456dh renders normally thermotolerant fungal pathogens unable to survive at elevated temperatures, which is critical as we investigate the emergence of fungi from the environment due to a warming climate. Overall, this work develops the water-soluble 4456dh as an early-stage antifungal drug that has a distinct mechanism of action compared to existing clinical antifungals.

ImportanceThe rise of fungal infections in recent years is alarming due to an increase in the vulnerable immunocompromised population, global temperature increase and limited antifungal treatment options. One of the major hurdles in developing new drugs is the identification of fungal-specific antifungal drug targets due to highly conserved cellular machinery between fungi and humans. Here, we describe a small molecule inhibitor, 4456dh, of the trehalose biosynthesis pathway. This pathway is present in fungi but not humans. Trehalose plays a critical role in stress responses such as thermotolerance in fungal pathogens and is essential for their virulence. We show that treatment with 4456dh blocks production of trehalose and renders fungal cells inviable. Thus far, 4456dh is active against two fungal pathogens of critical importance suggesting a broad-spectrum activity."
"Neural circuits in the brain perform a variety of essential functions, including input classification, pattern completion, and the generation of rhythms and oscillations that support functions such as breathing and locomotion. There is also substantial evidence that the brain encodes memories and processes information via sequences of neural activity. Traditionally, rhythmic activity and pattern generation have been modeled using coupled oscillators, whereas input classification and pattern completion have been modeled using attractor neural networks. Here, we present a theoretical model that demonstrates how attractor-based networks can also generate diverse rhythmic patterns, such as those of central pattern generators (CPGs). Additionally, we propose a mechanism for transitioning between patterns. Specifically, we construct a network that can step through a sequence of five different quadruped gaits. It is composed of two dynamically different networks: a ''counter'' network that can count the number of external inputs it receives, encoded via a sequence of fixed points; and a locomotion network that encodes five different quadruped gaits as limit cycles. A sequence of locomotive gaits is obtained by connecting the sequence of fixed points in the counter network with the dynamic attractors of the locomotion network. To accomplish this, we introduce a new architecture for layering networks that produces ''fusion'' attractors, minimizing interference between the attractors of individual layers. All of this is accomplished within a unified framework of attractor-based models using threshold-linear networks."
"How does the visual system process dynamic inputs? Perception and neural activity are shaped by the spatial and temporal context of sensory input, which has been modeled by divisive normalization over space or time. However, theoretical work has largely treated normalization separately within these dimensions and has not explained how future stimuli can suppress past ones. Here we introduce a dynamic spatiotemporal normalization model (D-STAN) with a unified spatiotemporal receptive field structure that implements normalization across both space and time and ask whether this model captures the bidirectional effects of temporal context on neural responses and behavior. D-STAN implements temporal normalization through excitatory and suppressive drives that depend on the recent history of stimulus input, controlled by separate temporal windows. We found that biphasic temporal receptive fields emerged from this normalization computation, consistent with empirical observations. The model also reproduced several neural response properties, including surround suppression, nonlinear response dynamics, subadditivity, response adaptation, and backwards masking. Further, spatiotemporal normalization captured bidirectional temporal suppression that depended on stimulus contrast, consistent with human behavior. Thus, D-STAN captured a wide range of neural and behavioral effects, demonstrating that a unified spatiotemporal normalization computation could underlie dynamic stimulus processing and perception."
"ObjectiveConverging evidence from neuroimaging studies and genome-wide association study (GWAS) suggests the involvement of prefrontal cortex (PFC) and striatum dysfunction in the pathophysiology of anorexia nervosa (AN). However, identifying the causal role of circuit-specific genes in the development of AN-like phenotype remains challenging and requires the combination of novel molecular tools and preclinical models.

MethodsWe used the activity-based anorexia (ABA) rat model in combination with a novel viral-based translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) technique to identify transcriptional differences within a specific neural pathway that we have previously demonstrated to mediate pathological weight loss in ABA rats (i.e. medial prefrontal cortex neurons that project to the nucleus accumbens shell). We compared actively transcribed genes in rats susceptible to weight loss to the subpopulation of rats resistant to weight loss under the same experimental conditions.

ResultsWe reveal 1424 differentially expressed genes between Susceptible and Resistant rats, highlighting important transcriptional changes associated with ABA within this pathway. The changes observed were independent of current calorie deficit and associated with metabolic, mitochondrial and neural functions. Further, we show that genes upregulated in Resistant rats were involved in mitochondrial function, while downregulated genes were associated with cytoskeletal, postsynaptic and axonal functions, supporting the hypothesis that hyperexcitability of cortico-striatal circuit function is a critical mediator of pathological weight loss in ABA.

DiscussionThese findings represent an essential first step in understanding how circuit-specific gene expression patterns may contribute to susceptibility to ABA and provide potential molecular targets for manipulation in this animal model of AN.

Public SignificanceThis study identifies specific brain gene activity patterns that may explain why some individuals are more vulnerable to extreme weight loss, as seen in anorexia nervosa. Using an advanced molecular technique in a well-established animal model, key differences in a neural pathway linked to cognitive control were observed. These findings pave the way for more targeted treatments that could prevent or reverse this dangerous condition.

SummaryO_LITranscriptional differences within medial prefrontal cortex to nucleus accumbens shell (mPFC-AcbSh) neurons distinguish rats highly susceptible to activity-based anorexia (ABA) from those resistant to pathological weight loss.
C_LIO_LIResistant rats showed upregulation of mitochondrial function genes, while Susceptible rats had upregulation of genes related to synaptic structure and signalling, implicating excitability of this circuit in driving maladaptive weight loss behaviour.
C_LIO_LITranscriptomic changes align with human genome-wide association study (GWAS) findings and support links between anorexia nervosa and both metabolic and psychiatric comorbidities.
C_LIO_LIThe study highlights potential molecular targets for future gene manipulation and therapeutic intervention. It also provides a foundation for creating refined genetic animal models that integrate multiple AN-associated variants to better reflect the polygenic nature of the disorder.

"Neuroscience is replete with evidence that cognitive representations are distributed across many cortical regions. Yet, the scale and content of such distributed processing is unclear. Do findings of widespread information coding suggest a large-scale ""forest"" of regions interacting to represent information or instead imply a multitude of small-scale trees, processing information as localized modules. To investigate this distinction, we used visual and semantic representational analysis of fMRI data from 60 participants viewing everyday objects in multiple task contexts, and we examined the relationships between regions in terms of information coding. We demonstrate that coding of visual content in the occipital lobe is overwhelmingly modular, such that different occipital structures show limited coordination and tend to encode information redundantly. By contrast, the coding of semantic content in the inferior temporal lobe involves a high degree of coordination between regions, which optimize their coding to collectively represent a large semantic space with minimal redundancy between regions. No other brain area - neither the parietal nor prefrontal cortices - shows the preference for large-scale coding seen in the inferior temporal lobe. Taken together, these results outline a framework of how the ventral stream transitions from small-scale to large-scale coding as information progresses from visual to semantic representations.

Significance statementHow does the brain convert incoming signals into usable information? Many studies have investigated this question by attempting to clarify which brain regions encode what information (e.g., V4 encodes color information). We instead aimed to shed light on the degree of coordination among information coding regions. We find that the visual-to-semantic transition as information flows anteriorly in the occipitotemporal cortex is accompanied by a shift from modular to distributed coding. That is, occipital regions encode perceptual information relatively independently with redundancy, while inferior temporal lobe regions cooperate to most efficiently represent a large space of semantic information. By leveraging ideas from information theory, our work introduces coding scale as a new dimension for understanding the architecture of information coding."
"Cryo-Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM) is a pivotal tool for determining the 3D structures of biological macromolecules. Current cryo-EM workflows, while effective, are computationally demanding and require manual intervention, creating bottlenecks for use in high-throughput scenarios such as structure-based drug discovery. Often in structure-based drug discovery, one can assume that all instances of a protein are equivalent at the resolutions needed for alignment and it therefore should be possible to harness information about particle poses from previous refinements. Current methods, however, do not leverage this form of prior knowledge, instead aligning each dataset from scratch. We present cryoPARES, a deep learning pose estimation method trained on pre-aligned datasets. Our method not only provides accurate angular predictions significantly faster than traditional approaches but also introduces automated particle pruning capabilities that eliminate manual intervention. These features, together with its single-pass operation, can enable real-time reconstructions that provide feedback during data acquisition. We demonstrate cryoPARESs effectiveness through the rapid structural determination of six ligand-bound complexes across three distinct protein targets and release three new fragment-bound cryo-EM datasets."
"Phthalates are chemical products used as additives in the synthesis of plastics to increase their flexibility and resistance. Among the most frequently detected phthalates in the environment is dibutyl phthalate (DBP). Although ubiquitous in freshwater environments at concentrations in the ng/L to {micro}g/L range, studies on the effects of DBP on Daphnia magna have overlooked the potential effects of exposure at low concentrations ({micro}g/L order) and without solvent. Our work focuses on the chronic effects of DBP on life history traits (survival, growth, reproduction) in the freshwater model species, D. magna (Crustacea). Organisms were exposed to two exposure regimes: from the beginning of embryonic development or from the adult stage, at the third brood, when most of the energy investment in growth is complete.

The results obtained show that the DBP exposure regime is an essential parameter in the effects on D. magna life history traits. While no significant response was observed in organisms exposed at the adult stage, disturbances to survival, growth and reproduction were observed at concentrations as low as the {micro}g/L range in organisms exposed at the beginning of embryonic development. The results also demonstrated that exposure to a concentration gradient of DBP results in different dose-dependent response typologies, depending on the life history traits measured. For survival, the dose-response relationship was non-monotonic, with greater juvenile mortality at intermediate concentrations (100, 280 and 500 {micro}g/L) than at higher concentrations (1000 and 2000 {micro}g/L). For effects on growth and reproduction, the responses followed classic monotonic dose-response relationships with low sensitivities. At the end of the experiment, the EC10-25d values were 1.01 {micro}g/L for reproduction and 79.22 {micro}g/L for growth. However, when calculated at earlier timepoints, the EC10-4d and the EC10-7d for growth were 0.25 {micro}g/L and 1.16 {micro}g/L. Furthermore, projecting these results to the population level suggests that exposure to DBP from early embryonic development leads to a decrease in growth rate and a change in population structure."
"The inference of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) from high-throughput data constitutes a fundamental and challenging task in systems biology. Boolean networks are a popular modeling framework to understand the dynamic nature of GRNs. In the absence of reliable methods to infer the regulatory logic of Boolean GRN models, researchers frequently assume threshold logic as a default. Using the largest repository of published expert-curated Boolean GRN models as best proxy of reality, we systematically compare the ability of two popular threshold formalisms, the Ising and the 01 formalism, to truthfully recover biological functions and biological system dynamics. While Ising rules match fewer biological functions exactly than 01 rules, they yield a better average agreement. In general, more complex regulatory logic proves harder to be represented by either threshold formalism. Informed by these results and a meta-analysis of regulatory logic, we propose modified versions for both formalisms, which provide a better function-level and dynamic agreement with biological GRN models than the usual threshold formalisms. For small biological GRN models with low connectivity, corresponding threshold networks exhibit similar dynamics. However, they generally fail to recover the dynamics of large networks or highly-connected networks. In conclusion, this study provides new insights into an important question in computational systems biology: how truthfully do Boolean threshold networks capture the dynamics of GRNs?

Significance statementGene regulatory networks (GRNs) describe the complex interactions between genes. GRNs control biological processes, respond to environmental changes, and contribute to diseases. An accurate understanding of the dynamics of GRNs is therefore crucial. Given insufficient data, researchers frequently employ Boolean network models with default threshold logic to study the dynamics of GRNs. We systematically assess the ability of two commonly-used types of threshold networks to recover the true regulatory logic and the dynamics of published expert-curated Boolean GRN models. Inspired by biological insights, we further propose modifications to each threshold formalism that improve their match with biological networks."
"Cognitive flexibility is crucial for adaptive human behaviour. Prior studies have analysed the effect of reward on cognitive flexibility; however, the neural mechanisms underlying these effects remain largely unknown. This study explores how reward influences neural oscillations and how these changes impact behavioural performance. Using time-frequency decomposition, we examined electroencephalographic data from participants engaged in rule-guided task-switching with varying reward prospects. Higher anticipated rewards lead to greater desynchronisation of alpha (8-12Hz) and beta (20-30Hz) oscillations, which in turn correlated with improved task performance. Both alpha power and event-related potential (ERP) coding of reward independently predicted reward-based performance improvements, suggesting distinct mechanisms supporting proactive control. These findings underscore the unique contributions of neural oscillations in mediating motivational effects on cognitive flexibility."
"The Farquhar-von-Caemmerer-Berry (FvCB) model is the most widely-used mechanistic model of C3 net CO2 assimilation, and it plays a significant role in plant physiology, ecology, climate science, and Earth system modeling. As use of the model has grown, multiple variants have appeared across publications. Although many of these are commonly used, there has not been a detailed investigation of existing variants and their impacts on results and interpretations. Here we summarize the types of variants and their prevalence in the literature, and we present a comprehensive comparison of differences between them. A key finding is that a common variant that uses the minimum of assimilation rates rather than the minimum of carboxylation rates, which we call the ""min-A variant,"" makes different predictions than the original ""min-W variant,"" yet appears in approximately half of highly-cited publications and software tools that use the FvCB model. Another concern is that although leaf biochemistry restricts the range of CO2 partial pressures where limitations due to triose phosphate utilization (TPU) can occur, this restriction is commonly omitted from the models equations. Among other potential issues, these variations can introduce errors exceeding 20% when estimating photosynthetic parameter values from CO2 response curves. It is therefore important to be aware of this source of error when fitting the model, to avoid using the min-A variant, and to include the biochemically-derived CO2 threshold for TPU limitations."
"Development of the mammalian visual system is thought to proceed in two stages. In the first stage, before birth in primates and before eye opening in altricial mammals, spontaneous activity generated by the retina and cortex shapes visual brain circuits in an activity-dependent but experience-independent manner. In the second stage, visual activity generated by sensory experience refines receptive fields. Here we investigated the consequences of altering this sequence of events by prematurely opening one or both eyes of ferrets and examining visual receptive fields in monocular cortex after the closure of the critical period for ocular dominance plasticity. We observed that many cells in animals with prematurely-opened eyes exhibited low-pass temporal frequency tuning and increased temporal frequency bandwidths, and these cells showed slightly increased orientation and direction selectivity index values. Spontaneous activity was greatly elevated in both hemispheres following the premature opening of one or both eyes, suggesting a global change in circuit excitability that was not restricted to cells that viewed the world through the prematurely opened eye. No major changes were noted in spatial frequency tuning. These results suggest that premature visual experience alters circuit excitability and visual receptive fields, in particular with respect to temporal processing. We speculate that closed lids in altricial mammals serve to prevent visual experience until circuits are initially established and are ready to be refined by visual experience."
"Parkinsons disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease. It is characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), -synuclein (-syn) and phosphorylated-tau protein (p-tau) aggregation, and dopaminergic neuron cell death. Current drug therapies only provide temporary symptomatic relief and fail to stop or reverse disease progression due to the severe side effects or the blood-brain barrier. This study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective effects of thermal cycling-hyperthermia (TC-HT) in an in vitro PD model using rotenone (ROT)-induced human neural SH-SY5Y cells. Our results revealed that TC-HT pretreatment conferred neuroprotective effects in the ROT-induced in vitro PD model using human SH-SY5Y neuronal cells, including reducing ROT-induced mitochondrial apoptosis and ROS accumulation in SH-SY5Y cells. In addition, TC-HT also inhibited the expression of -syn and p-tau through heat-activated pathways associated with sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and heat-shock protein 70 (Hsp70), involved in protein chaperoning, and resulted in the phosphorylation of Akt and glycogen synthase kinase-3{beta} (GSK-3{beta}), which inhibit p-tau formation. These findings underscore the potential of TC-HT as an effective treatment for PD in vitro, supporting its further investigation in in vivo models or potentially in human trials, with focused ultrasound (FUS) as a feasible heat-delivery approach."
"An important aim of population genetics is to elucidate the processes affecting genetic diversity across regions of the genome and across species. Canonical population genetic models of sexually reproducing species define the rate of meiotic recombination in terms of the frequency of recombination events per site per sexual generation. This paper studies the interplay of several factors with respect to their effects on neutral genetic diversity in a facultatively sexual, diploid, unicellular species such as yeast. The relevant factors are the prevalence of meiosis versus mitosis, the recombination rate, and the selection and dominance coefficients at loci under positive selection. We assume that many generations of mitotic cell divisions are interspersed with episodes of sexual reproduction, in which all individuals in the population undergo meiosis, followed by random matings among the resulting gametes. Our findings reveal that a single hard selective sweep can reduce neutral nucleotide site diversity across the entire genome, provided that the frequency of meiotic events is sufficiently low, and that the effects of a selective sweep on levels of neutral diversity at sites linked to the target of selection can be markedly different from those predicted by standard models of sweeps based on obligate sexuality. Species that reproduce by facultative sex are thus likely to exhibit unusual patterns of genetic diversity.

Author summaryIn this study, we explored how different sexual strategies influence genetic diversity. Specifically, we looked at how the balance between sexual reproduction (which involves meiosis) and asexual reproduction (which involves mitosis) affect genetic variation in a species like yeast. Our research focused on the effects of recombination rates and the role of selective sweeps -- when a beneficial genetic variant spreads rapidly through a population -- on genetic diversity. We found that, in species with facultative sex, a selective sweep can dramatically reduce genetic diversity across the genome, but only if sexual reproduction occurs infrequently. We compared our findings to existing models and also developed a new mathematical framework for understanding the effects of sweeps when sexual reproduction is rare. The fact that facultative sex can reduce genetic diversity over the entire genome is likely to complicate inferences about population size and evolutionary dynamics in species with mixed reproductive strategies."
"Neuropeptides exert broad effects across the brain to influence behavior. However, the mechanism by which the brain uses neuropeptide signaling to exert top-down control over complex behavioral responses remains poorly understood. Prolonged social isolation induces a distinct internal state that results in sweeping changes to behavior, including increased aggression. Here, we find that isolation-induced aggression activates Tachykinin-2 expressing (Tac2+) neurons in the mouse medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Genetic characterization of Tac2+ cells in the mPFC reveals them to be a population of unexplored GABAergic neurons. In-depth behavioral analyses combined with in vivo recordings of neural activity demonstrate that mPFC Tac2+ neurons are tuned to distinct phases of isolation-induced aggression: investigatory behaviors that escalate to attack (aggression escalation) and attack itself (aggression release). Loss-of-function perturbations targeting the release of either Neurokinin B (NkB), the stimulatory peptide encoded by Tac2, or the inhibitory neurotransmitter, GABA, reveal that these signaling molecules exert dissociable control over aggression escalation and release. These findings identify distinct roles for opposing signaling molecules co-released from the same population of cells. This suggests a surprising neurochemical mechanism by which neuropeptidergic populations in the prefrontal cortex exert top-down influence over complex behavior via the co-release of signaling molecules with opposing actions but coordinated impacts on behavior."
"Adult neurogenesis is defined as the process by which new neurons are produced from neural stem cells in the adult brain. A comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms that regulate this process is essential for the development of effective interventions aimed at decelerating the decline of adult neurogenesis associated with ageing. Mathematical models provide a valuable tool for studying the dynamics of neural stem cells and their lineage, and have revealed alterations in these processes during the ageing process. The present study draws upon experimental data to explore how these processes are modulated by investigating regulatory feedback mechanisms among neural populations through the lens of nonlinear differential equations models. Our observations indicate that the time evolution of the neural lineage is predominantly regulated by neural stem cells, with more differentiated neural populations exerting a comparatively weaker influence. urthermore, we shed light on the manner in which different subpopulations govern these regulations and gain insights into the impact of specific perturbations on the system."
"AbstractEvidence accumulation is a fundamental neural computation essential for adaptive behavior, yet its synaptic implementation remains unclear. Addressing this challenge critically depends on linking neural dynamics to circuit structure within the same brain. Here, we combine functional calcium imaging with large-scale ultrastructural electron microscopy (EM) to uncover the wiring logic of visual evidence accumulation in larval zebrafish. In a functionally imaged EM dataset of the anterior hindbrain, we identify conserved morphological cell types whose activity patterns define distinct computational roles. Bilateral inhibition, disinhibition, and recurrent connectivity emerge as key circuit motifs shaping these dynamics. To generalize our findings across animals, we develop a photoconversion-based pipeline to label and reconstruct functionally characterized neurons, enabling us to train a classifier that predicts functional identity from morphology alone. Applying this classifier to a second, whole-brain EM dataset lacking functional data reveals matching connectivity patterns, significantly augmenting its applicability for detailed circuit dissections. Based on these results, we develop and constrain a biophysically realistic neural network model that captures observed dynamics and yields predictions we tested and confirmed experimentally. Our work illustrates how hypothesis-driven connectomics can uncover the synaptic basis of sensory-motor computations and establishes a novel framework for cross-animal circuit dissection in the vertebrate brain."
"Prostate cancer (PCa) is an androgen receptor (AR) driven, high-incidence disease significantly contributing to cancer mortality. PCa is in need of better risk stratification at diagnosis and treatment outcomes in patients at high risk of metastasis. The unfolded protein response (UPR) is an AR-dependent process. However, the impact of the UPR transducer IRE1 on AR-dependent biology and treatment resistance has not been defined. We use diverse pre-clinical models of stress response to describe IRE1 activity impact on multiple disease stages and demonstrate its involvement with poor prognosis (RB1 loss), and cell lineage determination (club phenotypes). Integrating clinical transcriptomic datasets, we chart IRE1 activity throughout PCa evolution by developing a PCa-specific, IRE1 activity gene set (IRE1_18) reflecting both tumoral and micro-environmental niches. IRE1_18 can determine tumoral identity, inform androgen deprivation treatment suitability, prognosticate localised and metastatic disease independently from AR activity, and guide IRE1 modulation as a novel combination therapeutic.

"Inter-annual variation in insect abundance and seasonal phenology can be related to species traits such as body size, larval diet, overwintering stage, and colour variations. We sampled noctuid moths in the canopy of a forest in Western Poland using flight-interception traps during two vegetative seasons. We calculated inter-annual variation for 31 species, and date of peak abundance and length of the flight season for 18 species. We found that for the 23 species for which we had phylogenetic information, larger moths and those with adult colour variation showed less inter-annual abundance variation, which corroborates results of previous studies. We found no indication that phenological traits are associated with the tested species traits. However, species that can feed on the dominant broad-leaved tree in which the traps were placed (Quercus petraea) tended to have a later date of peak abundance than other species. To draw more robust conclusions, future research should encompass a longer time span and a broader range of species.

"Animal African trypanosomosis (AAT), caused by protist parasites of the genus Trypanosoma, puts upward of a million head of livestock at risk across 37 countries in Africa. The economic impact of AAT and the presence of human-infectious trypanosomes in animals place a clear importance on improving diagnostics for animal trypanosomes to map the distribution of the veterinary parasites and identify reservoirs of human-infectious trypanosomes. We have adapted the CRISPR-based detection toolkit SHERLOCK (Specific High-sensitivity Enzymatic Reporter unLOCKing) for trypanosomatid parasites responsible for AAT (SHERLOCK4AAT) including Pan- trypanosomatid, Trypanozoon, T. vivax, T. congolense, T. theileri, T. simiae and T. suis assays. To test the applicability of this technique in the field, we analysed dried blood spots collected from 200 farm and 224 free-ranging pigs in endemic and historical human African trypanosomiasis foci in Guinea and Cote dIvoire, respectively. The results revealed that SHERLOCK4AAT can detect and discriminate between trypanosome species involved in multiple infections with a high sensitivity. 62.7 % [58.1, 67.3] of pigs were found infected with at least one trypanosome species. T. brucei gambiense, a human-infectious trypanosome, was found in one animal at both sites, highlighting the risk that these animals may act as persistent reservoirs. These data suggest that, due to their proximity to humans and their attractiveness to tsetse flies, pigs could act as sentinels to monitor T. b. gambiense circulation using the SHERLOCK4AAT toolbox."
"Gamma oscillations play a crucial role in core cognitive functions such as memory processes. Enhancing gamma oscillatory activity, which is reduced in Alzheimers Disease, may have therapeutic potential, but effective interventions remain to be determined. Previous studies have shown that phase-synchronized electric and magnetic stimulation boosts brain oscillatory activities at theta, alpha, and delta frequency bands in different ways. The high-frequency gamma frequency band remains to be investigated. This study applies novel noninvasive brain stimulation techniques, namely phase-locked 40-Hz intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) and transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), and explores gamma oscillation changes in the brain. Thirty healthy young participants randomly underwent 40-Hz tACS (1), 40-Hz iTBS (2), two combined interventions (phase-locked iTBS to tACS peak sine wave or tACS trough sine wave) (3-4), and a sham condition (5). The target regions were the left and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and were stimulated by simultaneous tACS and iTBS. Gamma oscillatory activities (for 2 hours after intervention) were monitored following each intervention. Our results show that all stimulation protocols enhanced 40-Hz oscillatory power. The iTBS-tACS Peak shows the most significant and stable increase in gamma oscillatory activities (up to 2 hours) followed by 40-Hz tACS and 40-Hz iTBS. The 40-Hz tACS and 40-Hz iTBS protocols showed the strongest acute effects (up to 30 min) on induced gamma oscillations. Phase-synchronizing iTBS with tACS at 40 Hz may be a viable approach for inducing and stabilizing gamma oscillatory activity, particularly in conditions where endogenous gamma oscillatory is attenuated, such as Alzheimers Disease.

"Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are non-pathogenic DNA viruses with potent gene delivery capabilities, making them essential tools in gene therapy and biomedical research. Despite their therapeutic importance, key aspects of AAV natural biology remain obscure, complicating efforts to explain rare AAV-associated diseases and optimize gene therapy vectors. By analyzing sequence data from virus isolates and endogenous viral elements (EVEs), I reveal a striking evolutionary pattern: while AAV sub-lineages, defined by the replication-associated (rep) gene, have broadly co-diverged with host groups over millions of years, capsid (cap) diversity has been shaped by extensive recombination. In particular, one capsid lineage, Mammalian-wide (M-wide), has spread horizontally across diverse rep lineages and host taxa through multiple recombination events. Furthermore, several AAVs with M-wide capsids - including AAV-4, AAV-12, and bovine AAV (BAAV) - originate from historical adenovirus (Ad) stocks, raising the possibility that laboratory conditions contributed to capsid transfer. Distinguishing natural from laboratory-driven recombination is essential for understanding AAV ecology and its implications for gene therapy. A systematic sequencing effort in human and primate populations is needed to assess the extent of recombinant capsid acquisition, determine the impact of laboratory-driven recombination on circulating AAV diversity, and track ongoing recombination events that could affect vector safety and efficacy."
"Proteins play a central role in cancer biology: they are the most common drug targets and biomarkers. Sex influences the proteome in many diseases, ranging from neurological to cardiovascular. In cancer, sex is associated with incidence, progression and therapeutic response, as well as characteristics of the tumour genome and transcriptome. The extent to which sex differences impact the cancer proteome remains largely unknown. To fill this gap, we quantified sex differences across 1,590 proteomes from eight cancer types, identifying 901 genes with sex-differential proteins abundance in adenocarcinomas of the lung, and 20 genes across five other tumour types: squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, hepatocellular carcinomas, clear cell cancers of the kidney, adenocarcinomas of the pancreas and glioblastoma. A subset of these protein differences could be rationalized by sex-differential copy number aberrations. Pathway analysis showed that male-biased proteins in lung adenocarcinoma were enriched in MYC and E2F target pathways. These findings highlight the modest impact of sex on the cancer proteome, but the very limited power of existing proteomics cohorts for these analyses."
"Improving in silico compound-protein interaction (CPI) predictability is critical for productive drug discovery. Current deep learning approaches largely rely on end-to-end models trained on limited labeled CPI datasets, overlooking the representational power of large-scale biochemical foundation models. We present COMRADE (Contrastive Multirepresentation Accelerated Docking Engine), a hybrid virtual screening framework that accelerates docking by triaging compounds using CE-Screen (Contrastive Embedding-Screen). CE-Screen leverages seven high-dimensional pretrained representations - including those from protein language models and molecular transformers, along with an original physics-based interaction potential encoding - for rapid first-pass screening [~]100x faster than docking. Its contrastive compression neural network maps these inputs onto a single compact, discriminative representation optimized for CPI prediction via a lightweight ensemble classifier. CE-Screen outperforms state-of-the-art end-to-end models by up to 111.11% on retrospective benchmarks and is successfully used to triage [~]10.8 million compounds against five targets, yielding novel hits for each one - including a new scaffold for the branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase (BCKDK), an understudied yet high-value target in metabolic disease and oncology."
"Neuroblastoma is characterised by significant intratumoural heterogeneity which complicates treatments. Phenotypic plasticity, i.e., the ability of cells to alter their phenotype without genetic mutations, is a key factor contributing to this heterogeneity. In this study, we quantify cell actions and cell-to-cell interactions that lead to phenotypic adaptation in vitro under stress, specifically low-nutrient conditions. We initially record dynamic cell counts under various nutrient conditions for two neuroblastoma cell lines with known phenotype differences. Subsequently, we compile a list of plausible biological processes that could transpire within the aforementioned systems. We then construct candidate models employing mass-action kinetics. To quantitatively infer processes that lead to phenotypic adaptation, we perform a model selection based on computational Bayesian inference methods.Our results suggest that cell-to-cell interactions promote phenotypic adaptation and that the rate of this adaptation increases with decreasing nutrient concentrations. We perform flow cytometry-based experiments to corroborate changes in phenotype composition in response to both nutrient-deprived and treatment-induced stress conditions."
"Recent computational discoveries have identified numerous bioactive peptides within the human proteome, as well as across the broader tree of life, which were previously unrecognized for their roles in host immunity. These findings have led us to propose the ""cross-talk hypothesis"", suggesting that many molecules, such as proteins and peptides, traditionally viewed as extraneous to immune function may in fact actively contribute to immunity. Building on our earlier studies, which uncovered proteasome-derived peptides with putative antimicrobial activity in the human proteome, here we systematically interrogated the proteasome, a large protein complex responsible for degrading and recycling damaged or surplus proteins, for additional antimicrobial peptides. Using deep learning, we systematically mined ProteasomeDB, a curated repository of proteasomal cleavage and splicing events, to predict antibiotic activity against 11 clinically relevant pathogens. This deep learning approach uncovered 59 candidate peptides (""proteasomins"") with a median minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of [&le;]64LmolLLL1. Refinement yielded 21 sequence-diverse proteasomins, which were characterized for their physicochemical properties. These peptides were enriched in cationic residues and exhibit enhanced amphiphilicity, key attributes for disrupting microbial membranes. Dimensionality reduction via UMAP further showed that proteasomins are sequence-distinct from known antimicrobial peptides, underscoring their novelty and potential for unique mechanisms of action. Moreover, comparative analyses revealed that cis- and trans-spliced proteasomins exhibit similar predicted antimicrobial activities, suggesting that critical structural determinants remain conserved irrespective of splicing modality. Collectively, these findings expand our understanding of the proteasome, underscore the extensive, previously unrecognized repertoire of innate immune peptides, and provide a promising foundation for developing innovative therapeutics to combat multidrug-resistant pathogens."
"Mass Spectrometry Imaging (MSI) provides complex molecular profiling pivotal for advanced biochemical analysis and diagnostics. We have identified an urgent need for computationally sophisticated, interactive, and automated visualization tools specifically designed for MSI analysis that employ dimensionality reduction (DR) methods to preserve global data structure. We present MSI-VISUAL, an open-source framework that enables rapid and intuitive MSI data exploration with automatic and manual region selection, real-time verification, and statistical comparisons. Integrating established DR techniques, MSI-VISUAL introduces four novel visualization strategies: Saliency (SALO) and Spearman (SPEAR) Optimizations enhance global structure preservation across various distance metrics, addressing significant visualization challenges; TOP3 and Percentile Ratio (PR3D) provide memory-efficient and computationally rapid visualizations for large-scale datasets. In this work, comprehensive benchmarking and biological examples confirm that our DR visualizations surpass existing methods, facilitating the determination and quantification of subtle tissue differences on a single-cell level, revealing novel biological insights, and enabling diagnostic applications."
"When populations suffer reduced fitness in novel environments, genotypes that better adjust their phenotype to cope with environmental change can aid persistence by reducing the severity of fitness declines. However, we know little about how plastic changes in phenotype allow different genotypes to track environmental variation across ecological gradients, particularly as environments become novel. We transplanted numerous clones of 19 genotypes of a Sicilian daisy, Senecio chrysanthemifolius, at four elevations on Mt Etna. We assessed fitness at native and novel elevations and quantified leaf plasticity among and within elevations. Genotypes with higher fitness at novel elevations showed lower variance in fitness, lower plasticity across elevations, but higher plasticity within elevations compared to those with higher fitness in the native range. Our results suggest that there are genotypes hidden in a population whose plasticity better tracks novel environmental variation at multiple scales, which will be crucial for population persistence under rapid environmental change."
"The North Seas historical migrations have impacted the genetic structure of its neighbouring populations. We analysed haplotype sharing among 858,635 modern individuals from Denmark and Britain to infer migration history from the Middle Ages to the modern day. We estimated the genetic relationship among 370,259 Danes using Danish healthcare registries and validated those with retrievable pedigree relationships from a national family registry. We also compared their haplotype sharing with 488,376 British individuals from the UK Biobank.

Our analysis revealed the fine-grained population genetic history of Denmark and identified distinct coastal and island communities with a history of genetic isolation and bottlenecks. We observed a significant population decline in Jutland compared to Zealand from the late medieval period to the start of early modern period, accompanied by migration from Jutland to Zealand, corresponding to historical evidence.

We identified two major haplotype sharing patterns between Denmark and Great Britain: (1) early coast-to-coast connections between South Jutland and eastern England, likely driven by migration, settlement, continuous trade and the movement of people across the North Sea from the Middle Ages through early modern times, and (2) later city-to-city connections such as those between London and Kobenhavn, likely shaped by the reorientation of economic and trading centres in Britain and Denmark, and the increased shipping from early modern times towards the Industrial Revolution. Further comparisons using other North Sea countries showed both shared and unique histories of genetic exchange with Denmark and Britain.

Our study provides novel genetic evidence of migration across the North Sea from the Middle Ages to the Industrial Revolution. It highlights the power of nationwide biobanks in reconstructing fine-scale historical population movements among closely related populations."
"The plant apoplast and extracellular vesicles (EVs) contain diverse RNA species, including small RNAs, long non-coding RNAs, and circular RNAs, many of which cross kingdom boundaries through EV-mediated transport. Viroid RNAs--pathogenic circular non-coding RNAs--are known to move from plants to fungi and insects, though the mechanism remains unclear. Using apple scar skin viroid (ASSVd) and cucumber as a host, we demonstrate that viroid RNAs in circular, linear, and small RNA forms are present in cucumber EVs. ASSVd RNA exhibits features of extracellular RNAs, such as m6A methylation and five EXOmotifs. Through mass spectrometry and immunoblotting, we identify tetraspanin 8 (CsTET8) as a conserved EV marker and report CsPP2, a phloem lectin with an RNA-binding domain, as a novel EV-associated protein. RNA co-immunoprecipitation and immuno-enrichment assays reveal that CsPP2 and ASSVd co-localize in CsTET8-positive EVs, with direct interactions between CsPP2-CsTET8 and CsPP2-ASSVd. We propose CsPP2 functions as an RNA-sorting protein that mediates RNA loading into EVs. Further, we show that whiteflies can acquire ASSVd via EVs and transmit it to healthy plants, indicating a cross-kingdom transmission route. These findings establish viroid RNAs as a model system to study the molecular basis of RNA trafficking across biological kingdoms."
"1The vertebrate limb provides a powerful system to study how growth and molecular signaling interact to shape complex skeletal patterns. However, how these processes are coordinated across space and time is not fully understood. This study introduces a computational tool to examine how growth interacts with positional cues and self-organizing patterning mechanisms to shape skeletal structures in both mice and axolotl limbs. We developed the Growth-Processing-Propagation (GPP) framework, a reaction-diffusion system within a growing domain, in which the relative contribution of growth, processing (reaction) and propagation (diffusion) is modulated through two non-dimensional parameters, informed by experimental morphogen maps. This formulation normalizes the reaction-diffusion equation relative to growth, enabling investigation of how different spatiotemporal regimes of growth, processing and propagation interact to produce whole limb patterning. The GPP framework captures the progressive formation of limb segments and digit patterns by varying the relative contributions of reaction, diffusion, and growth to the pattern. Our models indicate that in the proximal region (humerus, radius/ulna) the contributions of growth, reaction and diffusion are equally important to patterning, but in the distal elements (hands) the reaction and diffusion contributions are much greater than the contribution of growth to formation of the digits. A single framework predicts whole-limb skeletal patterns in both mice and axolotls, despite their morphological differences, highlighting its potential to explore conserved and divergent features of limb development from an evolutionary perspective through a unified mechanism across species.

O_TEXTBOXSignificanceUnderstanding limb skeletal patterning is a central question in developmental biology. Numerical models provide a means to explore this process. We introduce the Growth-Processing-Propagation (GPP) framework, which integrates tissue expansion (growth), gene regulation and cellular specification (processing), and signaling spread (propagation). By normalizing patterning dynamics relative to growth, the framework reveals how the relative contributions of growth, processing, and propagation vary across the limb, influencing the timing and positioning of skeletal elements. The model successfully predicts whole-limb skeletal patterning in both mice and axolotls, supporting the idea of a shared underlying mechanism. This cross-species framework offers a versatile computational tool for studying fundamental processes in morphogenesis, with potential applications in developmental biology, and evolutionary studies.

"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) play key roles in physiology and are central targets for drug discovery and development, yet the design of protein agonists and antagonists has been challenging as GPCRs are integral membrane proteins and conformationally dynamic. Here we describe computational de novo design methods and a high throughput ""receptor diversion"" microscopy-based screen for generating GPCR binding miniproteins with high affinity, potency and selectivity, and the use of these methods to generate MRGPRX1 agonists and CXCR4, GLP1R, GIPR, GCGR and CGRPR antagonists. Cryo-electron microscopy data reveals atomic-level agreement between designed and experimentally determined structures for CGRPR-bound antagonists and MRGPRX1-bound agonists, confirming precise conformational control of receptor function. Our de novo design and screening approach opens new frontiers in GPCR drug discovery and development."
"Detergents and lipid nanodiscs affect the cryo-EM structures of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) including ELIC. To determine the structure of a pLGIC in a membrane environment that supports ion channel function, we performed single particle cryo-EM of ELIC in liposomes. ELIC activation and desensitization were confirmed in liposomes with a stopped-flow thallium flux assay. Using WT ELIC and a non-desensitizing mutant (ELIC5), we captured resting, activated and desensitized structures at high resolution. In the desensitized structure, the ion conduction pore has a constriction at the 9 leucine of the pore-lining M2 helix, indicating that 9 is the desensitization gate in ELIC. The agonist-bound structures of ELIC in liposomes are distinct from those in nanodiscs. In general, the transmembrane domain is more loosely packed in liposomes compared to nanodiscs. It has been suggested that large nanodiscs are superior for supporting membrane protein function. However, ELIC localizes to the rim of large circularized nanodiscs, and structures of ELIC in large nanodiscs deviate from the liposome structures more than those in small nanodiscs. Using liposomes for cryo-EM structure determination of a pLGIC increases our confidence that the structures are snapshots of functional states."
"Cognitive modeling in psychology and neuroscience provides a formal approach to formulate and test hypotheses of cognitive processes. Such models rely on cognitive parameters that are intended to represent interpretable and identifiable psychological constructs. However, accurately and reliably estimating model parameters remains challenging due to common issues such as limited data, measurement noise, experimental constraints, and model complexity, hindering the interpretability and identifiability of cognitive parameters. Given the recent success of advanced optimization methods in deep learning, we investigate whether a deep learning pipeline that integrates neural networks and modern optimization techniques can improve parameter estimation in reinforcement learning (RL) models. We compare this approach with the Nelder-Mead method (fminsearch), the de facto optimization approach in cognitive modeling, by fitting RL models to ten diverse value-based decision-making datasets collected from both humans and animals. Surprisingly, while both approaches achieve comparable predictive performance, they produce distinct parameter estimates, indicating fitting performance alone is insufficient in identifying these parameters. We thus systematically evaluate the reliability of parameters estimated by each approach and find that parameters estimated via the deep learning pipeline consistently demonstrate smaller gaps between training and test performance (better generalizability), increased resistance to parameter perturbations (enhanced robustness), improved recovery of ground-truth parameters in low-data regimes (stronger identifiability), and greater consistency across repeated measurements from the same individuals (better test-retest reliability). Our findings advocate for the deep learning pipeline and systematic evaluation of cognitive parameters to better link these parameters to psychological constructs and neural mechanisms."
"Non-invasive measurement of the human brains angioarchitecture is critical for understanding the basis of functional neuroimaging signals, diagnosing cerebrovascular diseases, and tracking neurodegeneration. Ultra-high-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has achieved mesoscopic (< 0.5 mm) imaging of angioarchitecture, revealing fine vascular details that were previously inaccessible in vivo. However, current mesoscopic MRI methods for imaging angioarchitecture face two major limitations. First, acquisition times are prohibitively long--often exceeding 40 minutes--making integration into everyday clinical practice and research projects impractical. Second, even with data successfully acquired, conventional data visualization methods--such as 2D slice browsing and 3D vessel segmentation renders--are rudimentary and have limited effectiveness for navigating and interpreting the complex vascular network. In this paper, we present a fast whole-brain MRI protocol that provides robust images of the brains venous network at 0.35 mm resolution in under seven minutes. Additionally, we introduce novel data processing and visualization techniques that enable identification of specific vessel types and more informative navigation of the complex vascular network. We demonstrate that, with these advancements, we can reproduce, in vivo and without intravenous contrast application, the seminal postmortem vasculature images of Duvernoy and Vannson (1999). Furthermore, leveraging the ability for MRI to cover the entire brain, we achieve, for the first time, whole-brain intracortical mesoscopic vein maps in humans. Our acquisition and post-processing methods lay the groundwork for detailed examination of vascular organization across individuals, brain regions, and cortical layers. More generally, these methods make mesoscopic imaging of angioarchitecture viable for broad neuroscientific and clinical applications."
"The event-related P3 is evoked by most task-relevant or salient stimuli, but its neural generators have remained controversial, limiting the integration of P3 with functional neuroimaging. Here we reevaluate the role of hippocampus and retro-splenial cortex as potential generators of the P3. Combined magneto-and electroencephalography signals were recorded during a visual oddball paradigm. Observers were instructed to respond to rare targets of a deviant shape and ignore rare non-targets of a deviant color. Source analysis was based on noise-normalized minimum-norm estimates in an individual, MRI-based source space. Critically, the cortical source space was extended to include the cornu ammonis of the hippocampus. Source analysis at the P3 peak showed strong sources in retrosplenial cortex and a weaker source in hippocampus. Activity in left somatosensory cortex was related to the button presses indicating target detection. Subsequent activity was observed in insula and anterior mid-cingulate cortex. Further stimulation studies were used to probe the spread of these sources and the plausibility of their combination to explain the data. In these models, EEG was dominated by retro-splenial cortex, while MEG was dominated by activity in primary somatosensory cortex. Except for somatosensory cortex, EEG showed better signal-to-noise ratio than MEG, but the combination of MEG and EEG increased the signal-to-noise ratio and specificity at the source level. Overall, these data support an interpretation of the P3 as physiological indicator of activity in the limbic system for target and distractor stimuli."
"According to the current hydrodynamic theory, teeth sensitivity is mediated by odontoblast cell processes which can be activated by fluid flow in the pericellular space of bulk dentin. To better understand the possible spatial extent of such phenomena, we investigated the topology and connectivity of dentinal porosity of a healthy human tooth. Using confocal fluorescence microscopy, we modeled the porosity as a spatial graph with edges representing dentinal tubules or lateral branches and nodes defining their connections. A large fraction of porosity channels in crown dentin was found to be interconnected, with 47 % of nodes linked in a single component over a millimetric distance from the dentin-enamel junction (DEJ). However, significant differences in network topology were also observed. A sharp transition in connectivity from 83 % to 43 % occurred at 300 {micro}m from the DEJ, which corresponds to an early stage of tooth formation. This was reflected in all graph metrics investigated, in particular the network resilience which dropped by a factor 2. To test the robustness of our observations, an in-depth analysis of potential remaining biases of the graph extraction was conducted. Most graph metrics considered were found to be within a 10 % precision range from a manually annotated ground truth. However, path metrics, which characterize transport properties, proved very sensitive to network defects. Residual errors were classified in 4 topological classes related to fluorescence staining and confocal detection efficiency, instrumental resolution and image processing. Their relative importance was estimated using statistical and physical graph attack simulations in a broad experimental range. Our modeling thus provides a practical framework to estimate the interpretability of calculated graph metrics for a given experimental microscopy setup and image processing pipeline. Overall, this study shows that dentin porosity exhibits typical characteristics of a complex network and quantitatively emphasize the importance of the smallest lateral branches. Our results could be used to model fluid flow more accurately in order to better understand mechanosensing by odontoblasts in dentin."
"Studying human motoneuron activity through electromyography (EMG) can yield insights into the operation of fundamental spinal cord microcircuits. Traditional surface and needle electromyography (EMG) methodologies have limited capacity to shed light on the diversity of motor unit (MU) control strategies that may be unique to each individual. Here, we employed high-density surface EMG (HDsEMG) to sample multiple MUs per subject to investigate the dynamics of inhibitory spinal microcircuits in both upper and lower limb control. We characterised the net inhibition as a function of individual MU firing rates, revealing subject-specific relationships. In silico modelling replicated these experimental characteristics and suggested that properties of the inhibitory currents rather than motoneuron size are responsible for net functional inhibition. Our results show that HDsEMG can highlight distinct control strategies across circuits and motor pools, revealing subject-specific properties of inhibitory spinal microcircuits.

"Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) are a family of enzymes that play important roles in regulating cellular signaling pathways. The activity of these enzymes is regulated by the motion of a catalytic loop that places a critical conserved aspartic acid side chain into the active site for acid-base catalysis upon loop closure. These enzymes also have a conserved phosphate binding loop that is typically highly rigid and forms a well-defined anion binding nest. The intimate links between loop dynamics and chemistry in these enzymes make PTPs an excellent model system for understanding the role of loop dynamics in protein function and evolution. In this context, archaeal PTPs, which have evolved in extremophilic organisms, are highly understudied, despite their unusual biophysical properties. We present here an engineered chimeric PTP (ShufPTP) generated by shuffling the amino acid sequence of five extant hyperthermophilic archaeal PTPs. Despite ShufPTPs high sequence similarity to its natural counterparts, ShufPTP presents a suite of unique properties, including high flexibility of the phosphate binding P-loop, facile oxidation of the active site cysteine, mechanistic promiscuity, and most notably, hyperthermostability, with a denaturation temperature likely >130 {degrees}C (>8{degrees}C higher than the highest recorded growth temperature of any archaeal strain). Our combined structural, biochemical, biophysical and computational analysis provides insight both into how small steps in evolutionary space can radically modulate the biophysical properties of an enzyme, and showcase the tremendous potential of archaeal enzymes for biotechnology, to generate novel enzymes capable of operating under extreme conditions."
"COX6B1 is a nuclear-encoded subunit of the human mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (cIV) located in its intermembrane space-facing region. The relevance of COX6B1 in mitochondrial physiopathology was highlighted by the missense pathogenic variants associated with cIV deficiency. Despite the assigned COX6B1 role as a late incorporation subunit, the COX6B1 human cell line knock-out (KO) exhibited a total loss of cIV. To get a deeper insight into the mechanisms driving the lack of cIV assembly or destabilization in the absence of COX6B1, we used the COX6B1 KO cell background to express alternative oxidase and COX6B1 pathogenic variants. These analyses uncovered that the COX6B1 subunit is indispensable for redox-sensitive early cIV assembly steps, besides its contribution to the stabilization of cIV in the late assembly stages. In addition, we have evidenced the incorporation of partially assembled cIV modules directly into supercomplex structures, supporting the  cooperative assembly model for respiratory chain biogenesis."
"Homologous Recombination (HR) preserves genomic stability by repairing double-strand DNA breaks and ensuring efficient DNA replication. Central to HR is the strand-exchange reaction taking place within the three-stranded synapsis wherein a RAD51 nucleoprotein filament binds to a donor DNA. Here we present the cryoEM structure of a displacement loop of human RAD51 that captures the synaptic state when the filament has become tightly bound to the donor DNA. The structure elucidates the mechanism of strand exchange by RAD51, including the filament engagement with the donor DNA, the strand invasion and pairing with the complementary sequence of the donor DNA, the capture of the non-complementary strand and the polarity of the strand-exchange reaction. Our findings provide fundamental mechanistic insights into the biochemical reaction of eukaryotic HR."
"Activity and renewability are distinctive features of living matter, and constitute a new class of materials that we term renewable active matter. A striking example is the cell cytoskeleton, where myosin filaments bind to the actin meshwork, apply contractile stresses and undergo continual stress/strain dependent turnover, thus acting as both force generators and sensors. As a consequence of nonreciprocity, arising from the independence of action and response, such living matter exhibits unusual mechanical properties like, segregation without attraction, fragility and force chains. Here we show that the interplay between activity and turnover gives rise to mechanical excitability in the form of travelling waves and pulses, and spatiotemporal chaos. We provide a systematic study of the nucleation, movement and shape of the travelling pulse, and present a boundary layer analysis to establish the existence of homoclinic orbits. Our analytical results are supported by detailed numerical analysis of the governing partial differential equations. This study has implications for the observed mechanical excitability in a variety of cellular contexts such as in isolated adherent cells and confluent cells within tissues."
"Ecological communities are often composed of many species, each interacting in complex ways. This complexity makes predictions of species responses to disturbances challenging. Here, we analyze dynamical community models and reveal an unexpectedly simple principle: species stability is governed by a single metric--self-regulation loss (SL). SL quantifies the importance of self-regulatory processes in species population dynamics. In effect, SL captures a collective outcome of species interactions, organizing how individual species respond to disturbances. When applied to data from protist community experiments, SL accurately forecasts species responses to temperature changes. Our work reveals that, despite the complexity of ecological systems, species stability follows a remarkably simple organizing principle."
"The adult visual system is characterised by high-resolution foveal vision and a peripheral field limited by crowding, the disruption to object recognition in clutter that gives a summary  gist over fine detail. In children, crowding is elevated foveally, with the estimated age where foveal crowding drops to adult-like levels varying widely from 5 to 12+ years. As crowding restricts key processes like reading, characterisation of this developmental trajectory is critical. Using methods optimised to measure crowding in children, adults and typically-developing children (n=119; 3-13 years) judged the orientation of a foveal  VacMan target either in isolation or surrounded by  ghost flankers. For isolated elements, acuity (measured as gap-size thresholds) dropped rapidly to adult-like levels at 5-6 years. Thresholds rose when flanked/crowded, with elevations highest at 3-4 years, persisting at 5-6 years, and dropping to adult-like levels at 7-8 years. A meta-analysis of our results with 11 prior studies reveals a consistent developmental trajectory, despite wide methodological variations. We further demonstrate that developmental crowding shows the same selectivity for target-flanker similarity as peripheral crowding, consistent with common mechanisms. This prolonged development reveals a shifting balance in the visual system between the processing of fine detail vs. the  gist of the scene."
"Transposons, or ""jumping genes,"" are mobile genetic elements that reshape genomes. The Tc1/Mariner family, including Tc3a transposase, has been studied for decades, but key aspects of its DNA recognition and cleavage remain unresolved. Existing models propose a homo-dimeric process for DNA excision and integration, yet conflicting hypotheses exist about the initial steps of DNA cleavage and target site recognition. Here, we reveal a previously unrecognized base-flipping mechanism in Tc3a transposase that challenges long-standing models of Mariner transposon activity. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that N-terminal acetylation induces a structural shift in the transposase-DNA complex, forcing a nucleotide in the inverted repeat to flip outward. This base-flipping event alters the local DNA conformation, creating torsional strain that may facilitate transposon inverted terminal repeat association. Unlike prior models, which assumed the entire protein, or protein dimers, were needed to illicit DNA interactions necessary for any types of torsion, our findings indicate that transposase bipartite binding itself actively reshapes DNA structure. We further show that this mechanism is dependent on the bipartite helix-turn-helix domains, which differentially contribute to DNA stabilization and recognition. Our simulations also reveal that the processed N-terminus plays an unexpected role in modulating DNA binding affinity, contradicting previous assumptions that it was structurally inconsequential. Together, the two helix-turn-helix motifs act to propagate the force caused by base flipping along one direction of the cognate DNA double helix axis. The fact that previous structural studies lacked this amino acid modification may explain why this mechanism was overlooked. These results provide a new framework for understanding transposase-DNA interactions, highlighting how a single molecular modification can trigger major DNA rearrangements. This discovery not only redefines the Tc3a transposition process but also calls for a reassessment of long-standing Mariner family transposon models."
"Understanding allosteric communication in proteins remains a critical challenge for structure-based, rational drug design. We present MDPath, a Python toolkit for analyzing allosteric communication paths in molecular dynamics simulations using NMI-based analysis. We demonstrate MDPaths ability to identify both established and novel GPCR allosteric mechanisms using the {beta}2-adrenoceptor, adenosine A2A receptor, and {micro}-opioid receptor as model systems. The toolkit reveals ligand-specific allosteric effects in {beta}2-adrenoceptor and MOR, illustrating how protein-ligand interactions drive conformational changes. Analysis of ABL1 kinase in complex with allosteric and orthosteric inhibitors demonstrates the broader applicability of the approach. Ultimately, MDPath provides an open-source framework for mapping allosteric communication within proteins, advancing structure-based drug design (https://github.com/wolberlab/mdpath)."
"Patients with Alzheimers disease (AD) initially show temporally-graded retrograde amnesia, which gradually progresses into more severe retrograde amnesia. Although mouse models of AD have provided insight into neurobiological mechanisms contributing to impaired formation and retrieval of new memories, the process underlying the progressive loss of remote memories in AD has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate age-dependent remote memory decline in APP/PS1 mice, which coincides with progressive hyperexcitability of parvalbumin (PV) interneurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Analysis of Fos expression showed that the remote memory deficit is not mirrored by changes in reactivation of memory-encoding neurons, so-called engram cells, nor PV interneuron (re)activation, in the mPFC. However, inhibitory input is enhanced onto engram cells compared to non-engram cells specifically in APP/PS1 mice. Our data indicate that age-dependent remote memory impairment in APP/PS1 mice is due to increased innervation of cortical engram cells by hyperexcitable PV interneurons, suggesting that dysfunctional inhibitory microcircuits in the neocortex mediate progressive retrograde amnesia in AD."
"Proper timing is essential for effective neural processing. Yet, how early postnatal vision shapes the temporal stability of human visual cortical processing remains unknown. Here, using electroencephalography, we examined cortical timing properties in individuals who were born pattern vision blind due to congenital cataracts, but surgically recovered sight. While sight-recovery individuals exhibited an attenuated cortical oscillatory phase coherence (i.e., higher temporal variability) during visual processing, their oscillatory strength was unimpaired. Moreover, phase coherence information, but not activation strength, allowed the classification of sight-recovery from control individuals. Finally, exchanging phase information between sight-recovery and control individuals indicated oscillatory timing impairments as the source of group differences in higher-order visual cortical processing. Neural timing impairments were specific for reversed congenital blindness, that is, were not observed in individuals with reversed developmental (late-onset) cataracts. These results suggest that the development of intricately temporally orchestrated visual cortical processing in humans requires early visual experience.

Significance StatementNeural circuit functioning requires an efficient temporal orchestration. The present work investigated how the temporal stability of visual cortical dynamics depends on adequate experience. In rare individuals who were born with pattern vision blindness but later recovered sight, a marked increase in the temporal variability of oscillatory brain activity during visual processing was observed while oscillatory strength was surprisingly unimpaired. Therefore, the emergence of precisely timed visual processing in the human brain seems to crucially depend on early visual experience. We speculate that impaired timing of neural processing, cascading throughout the visual cortical hierarchy, might be a major source of the incomplete visual recovery in individuals with treated congenital blindness."
"Memory retrieval is notoriously variable. Various neurocognitive states have been theorized to affect retrieval success from moment to moment, but the presence and catalysts of these states in the human brain remain largely understudied. Building on previous work, we studied how recent memory experiences (i.e. novelty vs. familiarity) and their corresponding neural activity prepare the brain to reactivate memories. Our data uncover a pronounced neural bias, whereby regions representing episodic information fail to reactivate memories following recent experiences of novelty. Drawing on computational models, we hypothesized that novelty-evoked activity in cholinergic nuclei underlie this bias. The data revealed an unexpected alternative mediator of memory reactivation in response to recent novelty, namely recent dopaminergic nuclei activity. By identifying dopamine as a potential mediator of retrieval variability, our results challenge existing models and open new avenues for investigating how neuromodulatory states dynamically shape memory accessibility."

"Obesity worsens breast cancer survival but how increased adipocyte size, which typifies obese adipose tissue and correlates with poor prognosis, impacts cancer progression remains unclear. Understanding these connections is challenging as adipocyte size is highly heterogeneous and not tunable with traditional experimental approaches. Here, we develop a biomimetic, engineered adipose tissue model to culture size-sorted adipocytes isolated from the same donor and assess their impact on tumor cell behavior. We find that large adipocytes are transcriptionally distinct from small adipocytes and upregulate genes related to adipose tissue dysfunction, including altered lipid processing. In coculture, large adipocytes promote lipid accumulation in cancer cells, increasing their migration and proliferation via enhanced fatty acid oxidation. These changes align with greater extracellular vesicle release by large adipocytes, which transfer lipid to recipient tumor cells. Our findings posit adipocyte size as an independent prognostic biomarker for breast cancer patients and demonstrate the value of biomimetic tissue models for mechanistic studies."
"Rapidly evolving viruses mutate to escape antibodies generated by the human immune system, leading to periodic waves of infection and death. Modern vaccine design approaches typically focus on currently prevalent strains and thus are shortsighted and often rendered ineffective by emerging viral mutations. An ideal strategy for proactive vaccine design requires not only immediate effectiveness, but also control over future viral mutation trajectories and evolutionary fitness landscapes. Here, we introduce fitness landscape design with antibodies (FLD-A) to create optimal antibody repertoires to restrict viral fitness trajectories. By deriving a biophysical fitness model from microscopic chemical reactions, we show that while standard approaches to vaccination do not necessarily restrict evolution of viral escape, our systematic protocol can be used to design effective, proactive antibody repertoires to suppress the replication of future escape variants. Stochastic optimization is performed to discover an antibody ensemble which forces a viral surface protein to evolve according to user-defined fitness penalties against each strain, imposing a reshaped fitness landscape that disfavors viral proliferation. After validating the antibody-imposed fitness landscapes with in silico serial dilution experiments, we apply FLD-A to reshape the relative fitness effects of mutations within two SARS-CoV-2 genotype networks while maintaining overall fitness suppression. Finally, we introduce an iterative FLD-A protocol which consistently discovers vaccination target sequences that generate antibodies which simultaneously restrict wildtype and escape variant fitness trajectories. Biophysical FLD-A thus opens the door to evolutionary control and proactive vaccine, antibody, and peptide design, thinking several steps ahead of pathogen evolution."
"Replication stress is a critical event in cancer development and understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms can help to identify new treatment strategies. Here, we investigate the molecular interplay between the pre-replication complex (pre-RC) and the bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) proteins in orchestrating replication stress response. Our findings reveal a mutual dependency between BET proteins and the pre-RC within cancer cells. Notably, reduction in origin licensing or replication initiation makes cells more susceptible to the BET-inhibitor AZD5153. Furthermore, we observe synergistic effects when combining the CDC7 inhibitor XL413 with AZD5153, effects which were partly dependent on TP53 mutation status. This combination treatment results in unresolved DNA damage and R-loop formation, leading to increased genomic instability. These insights pave the way for novel strategies for targeted cancer therapies and provide a foundation for further investigation into the interplay between CDC7 and BET proteins in replication stress response.

First, XL413 prevents activation of the origin of replication complex, leading to DNA damage. Second, the DNA repair machinery is unable to resolve this damage, resulting in the accumulation of unresolved R-loops and genomic instability. Ultimately, this cascade culminates in cell death."
"Neural excitation/inhibition (E/I) ratio is dynamically regulated on multiple timescales. Adaptive changes in E/I ratio can support healthy development, learning, and cognition, while disordered E/I ratio has been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders, neurodegenerative disorders, and states of impaired vigilance. There has been growing interest in inferring E/I ratio from efficient and noninvasive measurements such as electroencephalography (EEG), and several algorithms have been proposed to estimate E/I ratio from EEG. Despite promising results, there has been a lack of validation studies testing the underlying neurochemical changes leading to increased or decreased EEG-based E/I ratio. Here, using concurrent EEG and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) for over an hour, we assessed which algorithm of EEG-based E/I ratio best matched with MRS-based E/I ratio in humans of both sexes. The MRS-based E/I ratio was obtained by the ratio of glutamate concentration to GABA concentration. We applied 10 candidate indices of EEG-based E/I ratio using four approaches in several spontaneous frequency bands. Uniquely, we quantified the associations between the EEG-based E/I ratio and MRS-based E/I ratio separately for between-subjects and within-subjects variations. We found that each EEG-based E/I algorithm showed reliable and positive associations with MRS-based E/I, and especially EEG-based E/I ratio in alpha band with a criticality theory based approach showed the best association to the MRS-based E/I ratio. While these associations were evident for between-subjects comparisons, they were quite weak for within-subjects comparisons. These results suggest that EEG-based E/I algorithms are likely to reflect, at least in part, relative concentrations of glutamate and GABA."
"Although language neuroscience has largely focused on  core left frontal and temporal brain areas and their right-hemisphere homotopes, numerous other areas--cortical, subcortical, and cerebellar--have been implicated in linguistic processing. However, these areas contributions to language remain unclear given that the evidence for their recruitment comes from diverse paradigms, many of which conflate language processing with perceptual, motor, or task-related cognitive processes. Using fMRI data from 772 participants performing an extensively-validated language  localizer paradigm that isolates language processing from other processes, we a) delineate a comprehensive set of areas that respond reliably to language across written and auditory modalities, and b) evaluate these areas selectivity for language relative to a demanding non-linguistic task. In line with prior claims, many areas outside the core fronto-temporal network respond during language processing, and most of them show selectivity for language relative to general task demands. These language-selective areas of the extended language network include areas around the temporal poles, in the medial frontal cortex, in the hippocampus, and in the cerebellum, among others. Although distributed across many parts of the brain, the extended language-selective network still only comprises [~]1.2% of the brains volume and is about the size of a strawberry, challenging the view that language processing is broadly distributed across the cortical surface. These newly identified language-selective areas can now be systematically characterized to decipher their contributions to language processing, including testing whether these contributions differ from those of the core language areas.

Significance statementLanguage processing consistently recruits a left-lateralized fronto-temporal brain network, but language tasks often engage areas outside this core system. In an fMRI dataset of 772 participants performing a validated language localizer task, we identified 17 brain areas outside the core network that respond to both auditory and written language. Most of these areas show selectivity for language, including regions in the temporal poles, medial frontal cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum. Despite its large number of components, this extended language network still only takes up [~]1.2% of the brains volume, challenging the view that language processing is broadly distributed in the brain. These findings lay the foundation for systematically characterizing these newly identified non-canonical language-selective areas."
"Neural replay, the reactivation of experience-related activity patterns during offline periods, has been implicated in organising memories into cognitive maps. However, how replay processes mature through childhood and adolescence remains unclear. Here we studied 106 participants aged 8-25 who learned a hidden two-dimensional (2D) associative structure and then underwent magnetoencephalography (MEG) during a map-based inference task and post-task rest to detect spontaneous replay. We found that during post-task rest, younger individuals relied primarily on replay alone to represent the 2D relationships, whereas older individuals showed increasingly precise timing alignment between replay events and activity in the default mode network (DMN), particularly when replay occurred at the trough of a DMN theta oscillation. Such replay-DMN coupling predicted the strength of a grid-cell-like code in the entorhinal cortex identified in this cohort with fMRI. Furthermore, resting-state fMRI revealed that DMN functional connectivity strengthened with age, in parallel with reduced reliance on replay and more efficient inference performance. These results reveal a developmental progression in which replay shifts from an isolated process in youth to a coordinated DMN mechanism by adulthood. This transition predicts the maturation of grid-like schema representations, shedding light on how children gradually build internal knowledge structures to support flexible inference."
"Impaired GABAergic inhibition, so-called neural disinhibition, in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus has been linked to cognitive deficits. The novel object recognition (NOR) task has been used widely to study cognitive deficits in rodents. However, the contribution of prefrontal cortex and hippocampal GABAergic inhibition to NOR task performance has not been established. Here, we investigated NOR task performance in male Lister Hooded rats following regional neural disinhibition or functional inhibition, using intra-cerebral microinfusion of the GABA-A receptor antagonist picrotoxin or agonist muscimol, respectively. Our infusion targets were the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), dorsal hippocampus and ventral hippocampus. Using a within-subjects design, we compared NOR task performance (1-min retention delay) following bilateral regional saline, picrotoxin or muscimol infusions made before the acquisition phase. In mPFC, neither functional inhibition nor neural disinhibition affected object recognition memory. However, in both dorsal and ventral hippocampus, neural disinhibition impaired NOR relative to saline control, mainly by reducing novel object exploration time. In addition, functional inhibition of dorsal hippocampus impaired NOR, whereas ventral hippocampal functional inhibition tended to reduce novel object exploration at the highest dose used (alongside substantial non-specific behavioural effects). Overall, our data suggest that hippocampal, but not prefrontal, GABAergic inhibition contributes to NOR at a 1-min retention delay. Moreover, such NOR performance likely requires balanced neural activity in the dorsal hippocampus, with both too little and too much dorsal hippocampal activity impairing NOR memory. Our findings support that the NOR task can be used to investigate hippocampal GABAergic dysfunction in rodent models.

Significance statementImpaired GABAergic neural inhibition in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus has emerged as a key neuropathological feature of cognitive disorders. The novel object recognition (NOR) task is used widely in rodent models to investigate cognitive impairments relevant to cognitive disorders. However, the role of hippocampal and prefrontal GABAergic inhibition in NOR is unclear, limiting interpretations as to how NOR deficits in rodent models may relate to this key pathological feature of many cognitive disorders. Here, we show that impaired hippocampal GABAergic inhibition impairs NOR in rats, whereas prefrontal GABAergic inhibition is not required. Thus, the NOR task may be used to investigate hippocampal GABAergic dysfunction in rodent models."
"Advancements in spatial omics technologies have enabled the measurement of expression profiles of different molecules, such as genes (using spatial transcriptomics), and peptides, lipids, or N-glycans (using mass spectrometry imaging), across thousands of spatial locations within a tissue. While identifying molecules with spatially variable expression is a well-studied statistical problem, robust methodologies for detecting spatially varying co-expression between molecule pairs remain limited. To address this gap, we introduce a Bayesian fused modeling framework for estimating molecular co-expression at both local (location-specific) and global (tissue-wide) levels, offering a refined understanding of cell-cell communication (CCC) mediated through ligand-receptor and other molecular interactions. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that our approach, termed SpaceBF, achieves superior specificity and power compared to existing methods that predominantly rely on geospatial metrics such as bivariate Morans I and Lees L. Applying our framework to real spatial transcriptomics and proteomics datasets, we uncover novel biological insights into molecular interactions across different cancer types."
"The ability to adjust brain resources to manage expected uncertainty is hypothesized to be impaired in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), though the evidence remains limited. To investigate this, we studied 29 neurotypical (NT) and 29 high-functioning adults with ASD performing a probabilistic two-alternative value-based task while undergoing magnetoencephalography (MEG) and pupillometry. The task comprised five sequential blocks with stable reward probabilities (70%:30%), but varying stimulus pairs and reward values, enabling assessment of behavioral and neural adaptation to expected uncertainty. We analyzed a hit rate of advantageous choices, response times, and computational measures of prior belief strength and precision. To examine cortical activation during decision-making, we used MEG source reconstruction to quantify -{beta} oscillation suppression in decision-relevant cortical regions within the pre-decision time window. Linear mixed models assessed trial-by-trial effects.

Behaviorally, ASD participants exhibited lower overall belief precision but intact probabilistic rule generalization, showing gradual performance improvement and strengthening of prior beliefs across blocks. However, unlike NT individuals, they did not show progressive downscaling of neural activation during decision-making or reduction in neural response to feedback signals as performance improved. Furthermore, on a trial-by-trial basis, increased belief precision in ASD was not associated with reduced cortical activation, a pattern observed in NT individuals.

These findings suggest an atypically rigid and enhanced allocation of neural resources to advantageous decisions in individuals with ASD - although they, as NT individuals, rationally judge such decisions as optimal. This pattern may reflect an aversive response to the irreducible uncertainty inherent in probabilistic decision-making."
"Improvements in single-cell sequencing have enabled phenotyping at organism-scale and molecular resolution, but interpreting such experiments poses computational challenges. Identifying the genes and cell types directly impacted by genetic, chemical, or environmental perturbations requires explicit modeling of lineage relationships amongst many cell types, over time, from datasets with millions of cells collected from thousands of specimens. We describe two software tools, ""Hooke"" and ""Platt"", which exploit the rich statistical patterns within single-cell datasets to characterize the direct molecular and cellular consequences of experimental perturbations. We apply Hooke and Platt to a single-cell atlas of thousands of perturbed zebrafish embryos to synthesize a coherent map of lineage dependencies and leverage it to reveal previously unappreciated roles for fate-determining transcription factors. We show that cell type covariation in single-cell datasets is a powerful source of information for inferring how cells depend on genes and one another in the program of vertebrate development."
"Establishing if insects feel pain can have far-reaching consequences for insect husbandry, commercial pollination and scientific research. Research in this field therefore requires careful experiments and strong evidence. One important criterion proposed for measuring insect sentience is the ability to show a motivational trade-off, in which ""the negative value of a noxious or threatening stimulus is weighed (traded-off) against the positive value of an opportunity for reward"". A recent paper investigated motivational trade-offs in bumblebees and concluded that bees can trade-off heat against high sugar rewards. In this paper, we develop a signal detection model to highlight which features would be key to supporting the argument that motivational trade-offs are evidence of the capacity for experiencing pain. We then re-analyze the data from the original paper and find several limitations. Our own re-analysis finds no support for the final conclusions made by the paper. We therefore provide recommendations for future studies investigating the ability of insects to feel pain."
"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWProtein language models are significantly advancing the modeling of sequence-function relationships. However, most of them are not directly informed of homology and evolutionary relationships between protein sequences. Here, we propose a method to make them homology-aware. We introduce RAG-ESM, a retrieval-augmented framework that allows to condition pretrained ESM2 protein language models on homologous sequences, using a minimal number of additional cross-attention parameters and minimal computational cost. We show that RAG-ESM models outperform larger ESM2 models for masked amino acid prediction. We find that sequence alignment capabilities spontaneously emerge in specific cross-attention heads of RAG-ESM. By using a discrete diffusion objective for training, and by conditioning on homologs during inference, RAG-ESM reaches state-of-the-art performance for conditional protein sequence generation and motif scaffolding, among sequence-based models. Our method thus possesses strong potential for scalable, efficient and controlled protein engineering."
"Cationic antimicrobial peptides are a large family of host defense molecules with diverse sequences and structures. Here, we present a computational and experimental pipeline for time-resolved quantification of both membrane-permeabilizing and intracellular effects in Escherichia coli. Applying this pipeline to 12 diverse natural peptides and synthetic peptidomimetics uncovers shared antimicrobial activities, but with different kinetics, forming two classes. With class I peptides, growth arrest is abrupt and predominantly coupled with inner membrane permeabilization and ribosome/DNA reorganization. However, membrane permeabilization leads to rapid peptide absorption by the first exposed bacterial cells, resulting in low efficacy against dense populations. With class II peptides, ribosome/DNA reorganization and growth inhibition occur more gradually, as inner membrane permeabilization is either absent or delayed. This is offset by slower intracellular peptide uptake and greater efficacy against high cell densities. These kinetic differences reveal functional trade-offs between classes that have major immunological and therapeutic implications."
"The ribosome biases the conformations sampled by nascent polypeptide chains along folding pathways towards biologically active states. A hallmark of the co-translational folding (coTF) of many proteins are highly stable folding intermediates that are absent or only transiently populated off the ribosome, yet persist during translation well-beyond complete emergence of the domain from the ribosome exit tunnel. Intermediates are important for folding fidelity; however, their structures have remained elusive. Here, we have structurally characterised two coTF intermediates of an immunoglobulin-like domain by developing comprehensive 19F NMR analyses using chemical shifts, paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE), and protein engineering. We integrated these experimental data with extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to obtain atomistic structures of the folding intermediates on the ribosome. The resulting intermediate structures are distinguished by native-like folds initiated from either their N-or C-termini, and reveal parallel folding pathways, which are structurally conserved within the protein domain family, in contrast to their in vitro refolding mechanisms. By redirecting proteins to fold along hierarchical, parallel routes, the ribosome may promote efficient folding by avoiding kinetic traps, and regulate nascent chain assembly and targeting by auxiliary factors to maintain cellular proteostasis."
"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short RNAs that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression. In canonical miRNA biogenesis, primary miRNAs are transcribed from intergenic loci or intronic regions by RNA polymerase II, sequentially cleaved by the Microprocessor complex and Dicer, and resulting mature miRNAs are loaded into Argonaute to repress target mRNAs. A minority of miRNAs are generated via noncanonical biogenesis pathways that bypass the Microprocessor and/or Dicer. Here, we describe a new Pol III-dependent, Microprocessor -independent, and Dicer-dependent biogenesis pathway exemplified by the mir-1829 family in C. elegans. Although the mir-1829 family loci reside in intronic regions of protein-coding genes, we show that the miRNAs are derived from independent Pol III transcripts. Unlike other Pol III-dependent miRNAs, the mir-1829 family small RNAs are the dominant species derived from their loci, rather than fragments of a larger functional noncoding RNA. These germline-enriched miRNAs are loaded in multiple miRNA Argonautes, including the recently-characterized germline Argonaute ALG-5, which we demonstrate is repressive when tethered to a reporter transcript. We extend these findings, identifying additional Pol III-transcribed and noncanonical small RNAs in C. elegans and human datasets, including human miR-4521. These young, noncanonical miRNAs may represent an early snapshot in the evolution of de novo miRNA genes."
"In dynamic environments, animals must closely monitor the effects of their actions to inform switches in behavioral strategy. Anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) neurons track decision outcomes in these environments. Yet, it remains unclear whether ACC neurons similarly monitor behavioral history in static environments and, if so, whether these signals are distinct from movement representations. We recorded large-scale ACC activity in freely moving mice making visual evidence-accumulation decisions. Many ACC neurons exhibited nonlinear mixed selectivity for previous choices and outcomes (trial history) and were modulated by movements. Trial history could be stably decoded from population activity and accounted for a separable component of neural activity than posture and movements. Trial history encoding was conserved across different subjects and was unaffected by fluctuating behavioral biases. These findings demonstrate that trial history monitoring in ACC is implemented in a conserved population code that is independent of the volatility of subjects task environment."
"Alzheimers disease pathology typically manifests itself across multiple brain regions yet assessment at this scale in mouse models remains a challenge. This hinders the development of novel therapeutic approaches. Here we introduce a novel fiber photometry approach to monitor amyloid pathology in freely behaving mice. We first demonstrated that flat fiber-based photometry can detect amyloid signals across multiple brain regions under anesthesia after injecting a blood-brain barrier permeable tracer, Methoxy-X04. The depth profile of in vivo fluorescent signals was correlated with postmortem histological plaque signals. After confirming its feasibility ex vivo, we chronically implanted a tapered fiber for depth-resolved fiber photometry in freely behaving mice. After injecting Methoxy-X04, fluorescent signals increased in a depth-specific manner in Alzheimers mice, but not in wild-type littermates. While fiber photometry has been widely adopted to monitor neuronal and non-neuronal activity, our approach expands the capabilities to monitor molecular pathologies such as amyloid plaques, even in a freely behaving condition."
"DeepLabCut has notably transformed behavioral and locomotor research by enabling precise, markerless pose estimation through advanced deep learning methods. Despite broad adoption of this approach across species and behaviors, current usage frequently overlooks the challenges of quantitative kinematic analyses due to the complexity and noise within raw model outputs. Researchers are often challenged by the computational expertise required to clean, refine, and interpret the generated data effectively. Here, we introduce refineDLC, a comprehensive post-processing pipeline explicitly designed to streamline the conversion of noisy DeepLabCut outputs into robust, analytically reliable kinematic data.

Our user-friendly pipeline incorporates critical data cleaning steps--including inversion of y-coordinates for intuitive spatial interpretation, removal of zero-value frames, and exclusion of irrelevant body part labels. Additionally, it integrates robust, dual-stage filtering methods based on likelihood scores and positional changes, significantly enhancing the accuracy and consistency of data. Finally, our approach offers multiple interpolation strategies, effectively managing missing values to maintain data continuity and integrity. We evaluated the performance and versatility of our pipeline across two distinct datasets: controlled locomotion in cattle and field-recorded, highly variable trotting horse videos.

Our results demonstrated substantial improvements in the quality and interpretability of processed outputs, transforming initially noisy and inconsistent data into physiologically meaningful kinematic patterns. RefineDLC successfully reduced data variability and eliminated false-positive labeling errors, offering reliable and ready-to-analyze datasets irrespective of recording conditions and animal species. By simplifying the transformation from raw DeepLabCut outputs to meaningful kinematic insights, refineDLC significantly enhances accessibility and usability, enabling a broader range of researchers--especially those with limited programming expertise--to perform precise quantitative analyses.

Looking forward, adaptive filtering algorithms and real-time quality assessment features are potential enhancements that could further optimize performance, expand pipeline applicability, and automate analysis. Thus, RefineDLC not only addresses the current limitations in markerless tracking technologies but also sets the stage for future advancements in precision phenotyping, behavioral ecology, animal science, and conservation biology."
"Quantifying post-stress survival in yeasts is crucial for biological, biomedical, and industrial research. Traditional methods like Colony Forming Unit (CFU) assays are labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this study, we systematically characterize a two-dye (SYTO 9 / Propidium Iodide) LIVE/DEAD assay coupled with flow cytometry to rapidly and scalably quantify post-stress survival in diverse yeast species. By optimizing staining buffer, dye concentrations and staining time, we minimized artifacts and improved reproducibility. Notably, we identify an ""Intermediate"" population containing damaged cells with enhanced SYTO 9 uptake but little propidium iodide (PI) accumulation under sublethal stress, providing finer gradations of cellular damage compared to CFU or PI staining alone. We demonstrate the assays applicability across Candida glabrata, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Candida albicans after hydrogen peroxide treatment and in C. glabrata after Amphotericin B exposure. While CFU is more sensitive at lower stress levels, the SYTO 9/PI staining effectively distinguishes sublethal from lethal doses, offering a valuable alternative for rapid, high-throughput survival quantification."
"The receptive field (RF) of visual cortical neurons is highly dynamic and context-dependent, shaped by both the spatial and temporal properties of stimuli and the complex architecture of cortical circuits. While classical RF mapping through extracellular recordings reveals only the area triggering spiking responses, intracellular recordings reveal a much broader region of subthreshold synaptic input. We investigated how neurons in different cortical layers integrate visual input across space, with a focus on the linearity of spatial summation. Using intracellular recordings, we found that supragranular complex cells integrate input in a highly sublinear manner, in contrast to infragranular complex cells and simple cells, which exhibited near-linear summation. To understand the underlying mechanisms, we employed a large-scale recurrent spiking model of cat primary visual cortex (V1). Modeling results point to the differential patterning of long-range horizontal connections--particularly their targeting of excitatory versus inhibitory neurons--as a potential source of the observed layer-specific integration properties. These findings suggest that RFs emerge from interaction of feedforward, horizontal, and possibly feedback inputs, that are continuous in space, challenging the conventional notions of fixed spatial RF boundaries in early visual processing.

O_LIThe properties of receptive fields (RF) of neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) are not static but change depending on spatiotemporal properties of visual stimulus.
C_LIO_LITo study spatial integration of visual information by V1 neurons in a RF independent way, we made intracellular recordings across the cat V1 in response to drifting gratings confined to either circular apertures of variable diameters (disks), or in annuli with fixed outer diameters and variable inner diameters (rings).
C_LIO_LIWe find that supragranular complex cells integrate input in a sublinear manner, whereas infragranular complex cells and simple cells exhibit near-linear summation.
C_LIO_LIOur large-scale recurrent spiking model shows that these differences between supragranular and infragranular complex cells can be explained by laminar differences in horizontal connectivity properties.
C_LIO_LIThese results highlight the substantial differences in spatial integration of visual information at different stages of visual processing

"The phylogenetic tree of eukaryotes is divided into a handful of highly diverse  supergroups; only a few so-called  orphan lineages branch in uncertain positions outside of these large clades. We found that the mitochondrial genome of one such lineage, the telonemids, is considerably gene-rich, a feature observed in other  orphans as well, raising the possibility that these organisms share a common history. On the contrary, our phylogenomic analyses show that  orphans with gene-rich mitochondria branch into two different positions: telonemids actually belong to the established supergroup Haptista, while provorans and meteorids form a strongly supported clade with hemimastigophorans, in a novel ancient supergroup that we dub here Promethea. Comparative genomics shows that this split reflects differences between mitochondrial gene sets. Thanks to the increased number of available representatives analyzed together, our results further simplify and illuminate the evolutionary relationships between eukaryotes."
"Pediatric diffuse midline gliomas with the Histone 3 lysine 27-to-methionine mutation (H3K27M-pDMG) are aggressive brain tumors characterized by intrinsic resistance to radiation therapy, the current standard of care. These tumors exhibit significant intratumoral heterogeneity, with distinct subclonal populations likely contributing to therapy resistance. Emerging evidence suggests that small extracellular vesicles (sEV) mediate oncogenic signaling within glioma stem cell populations, yet their role under radiation-induced stress remains poorly understood. In this study, we characterized sEV uptake dynamics among H3K27M-pDMG tumor cells, identified key sEV surface proteins, and demonstrated that sEVs derived from radioresistant (RR) H3K27M-pDMG cells confer radioprotective effects on radiosensitive tumor cells. Molecular profiling revealed that RR-sEVs carry proteins, microRNAs (miRNAs), and metabolites associated with glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, and DNA repair. Upon uptake, RR-sEVs reprogrammed recipient cells by altering gene expression and metabolic pathways, and enhancing DNA repair and survival following radiation exposure. These findings provide insights into the role of sEV-mediated intratumoral communication as a contributor to radiation resistance in H3K27M-pDMG and suggest potential therapeutic strategies to disrupt this process and enhance radiation efficacy."
"We present a method that quantifies nearly all pairwise amino acid substitutions, revealing the rates and spectra of mistranslation per amino acid and per codon. While determining error rates is illuminating, understanding why certain mistranslation events are enriched requires further exploration, particularly in relation to the translation-accuracy hypothesis. We found that codons favored in highly expressed genes are not predictive of translational fidelity and are not selected for translational accuracy. We evaluated our method using historically characterized ribosomal variants of Escherichia coli reported to differ in translation fidelity. However, we found no significant differences among their overall translation-error rates, estimated here to be [~]2 per 1,000 amino acids. Instead they each exhibited unique mistranslation profiles, which likely led to prior overestimates of the translation error-rate in the putative error-prone variant. Together, these results underscore the significance of a direct, proteome-wide measure of translation fidelity."
"Biological communities are connected through dispersal, which regulates diversity across local and regional scales. However, dispersal is difficult to measure directly, limiting what is known about dispersals impact on species composition in complex communities. One method to measure dispersal employs the Neutral Community Model (NCM) to quantify how a local community is influenced by the immigration of individuals from a larger source community. Conveniently, the immigration rate NTm of the NCM can be fit from biological sequence abundance datasets, which are plentiful. Yet it is neither known if these estimated values reflect the ground truth, nor what sampling effort is required to yield accurate estimates. In this study we introduce two inference methods, a variance-based and a Dirichlet-Multinomial Log-Likelihood (DM-LL) method, to complement the established occupancy-based inference method. In simulations of communities that resemble activated sludge microbiomes, all inference methods were capable of estimating NTm within 10% of ground-truth, with the variance-based and DM-LL methods requiring less sampling effort. Accurate inferences require read depths greater than NTm in each sample. The three methods agree in their inferred NTm in simulations of communities experiencing weak non-neutral effects (e.g., selection), and in applications to an empirical dataset from wastewater activated sludge. Based on these findings, we propose practical sampling and methodological guidelines for quantifying immigration between highly diverse, complex communities using the NCM."
"Understanding plant phenological responses to climate warming is crucial for predicting changes in plant communities and ecosystems but difficult using sensitivity analysis that is based rates of phenological changes, not on drivers of spring phenology. In this article, we present a new measure phenological lag to quantify the overall effect of phenological constraints including insufficient winter chilling, photoperiod, and environmental stresses, based on observed response and that expected from species-specific changes in spring temperatures, i.e., changes in spring forcing (degree days) from warming and average temperature at budburst with the warmer climate. We applied this new analytical framework to a global dataset with 980 species and 1527 responses to synthesize observed changes in spring budburst (leafing or flowering) and investigate the mechanisms of differential phenological responses reported previously. We found longer phenological lags with experimental studies and native plants in flowering, likely due to more stressful environments associated with warmer and drier climate. Less forcing changes were mainly responsible for the smaller responses in leafing and flowering in boreal region (compared to temperate region) and in grass leafing (compared to trees and shrubs). Higher budburst temperatures also contributed to the smaller responses in flowering for experimental studies and with herbs and grasses. The effects of altitude, latitude, MAT, and average spring temperature change were minor (all combined <2.5% variations), while those of photoperiod and long-term precipitation were not significant in influencing spring phenology. Our method helps to determine mechanisms responsible for changes in spring phenology and differences in plant phenological responses."
"The study of social behavior in mice has grown increasingly relevant for unraveling associated brain circuits and advancing the development of treatments for psychiatric symptoms involving social withdrawal or social anxiety. However, a data-driven understanding of behavior and its modulation in solitary and social contexts is lacking. In this study, we employed motion sequencing (""MoSeq"") to decompose mouse behaviors into discrete units (""Syllables"") and investigate whether--and how--the behavioral repertoire differs between solitary and dyadic (social) settings.

Our results reveal that social context significantly modulates a minority (25%) of syllables, containing predominantly stationary and undirected behaviors. Notably, these changes are associated with spatial proximity to another mouse rather than active social contact. Interestingly, a network analysis of syllable transitions shows that context-sensitive syllables exhibit altered network influence, independent of the number of connected syllables, suggesting a regulatory role. Furthermore, syllable composition changes significantly during social contact events with two distinct sequence families governing approach and withdrawal behaviors. However, no unique syllable sequences mapped to specific social interactions.

Overall, our findings suggest that a subset of syllables drives contextual behavioral adaptation in mice, potentially fascilitating transitions within the broader behavioral repertoire. This highlights the utility of MoSeq in dissecting nuanced, context-dependent behavioral dynamics."
"Blood vessels and axons align outside the brain due to shared growth factors. However, this neuron-axon-synapse and vessel relationship within the brain white matter remains unclear, primarily due to the technical challenges of charting the complex trajectories of fiber tracts and the dense network of arteries. Consequently, the organizational logic and neurometabolic factors shaping white matter vasculature remain poorly understood. Here, we address these questions using high-resolution multimodal MRI, in vitro neuron density, and receptor autoradiography in macaque monkeys. In superficial white matter, vascularity exhibited parallel alignment with the cortical surface. This vascularity showed negligible dependence on overlying gray matter neuron density (R2 = 0.01), minimal dependence on white matter myelination (R2 = 0.10), and moderate correlation with receptor density (R2 = 0.27). These suggest an association of vascularity with energy demands and axonal branching. In deep white matter, axon geometry, density, and proximity to the cortical surface predict vascular volume with high precision (R2 = 0.62). Overall, these findings establish a relation between neuron-axon-synapse architecture and white matter vasculature in the primate brain, offering advances in understanding the organization and pathophysiology of white matter."
"Intracranial electrophysiology offers a unique insight into the nature of information representation in the brain - it can be used to disentangle information encoded in local neuronal activity (gamma and high gamma frequencies) from information encoded via long-range interactions (lower frequencies). We used regularised logistic regression to decode animacy from time-frequency power and phase extracted from electrocorticography (ECoG) grid electrode data recorded on the surface of human vATL. Power in gamma (30 - 60 Hz) and high gamma (60 - 200 Hz) produced reliable decoding, indicating that semantic information is indeed expressed by local populations in vATL. However, power from a wide range of frequencies (4 - 200 Hz) produced significantly higher decoding accuracy and also exhibited the same rapidly-changing dynamic code previously observed when decoding voltage. These findings support the theory that semantic information is encoded by a local vATL ""hub"" that interacts with distributed cortical ""spokes""."
"Vector-based spatial coding has been demonstrated in rodents, yet its neural basis in humans and its contribution to navigation remain poorly understood. Using a novel spatial updating task, we show that egocentric directional signals peak when objects are located behind the navigator, while distance signals emerge only when objects are out of view, suggesting a mnemonic role for vision-independent spatial mapping. Allocentric signals form a clover-shaped, four-axis pattern aligned to visual features, with improved navigation accuracy along its axes. Parallel rodent recordings further show the clover pattern arises from averaged activity of allocentric vectorial neurons, suggesting conserved cross-species mechanisms. Together, our findings uncover vector-based representations in the human brain, potentially serving as a neural reference axis to anchor objects to internal maps and support navigation."
"The marmoset is a highly vocal platyrrhine monkey that shares key anatomical and functional features with humans, offering insights into the evolution of brain connectivity. Although similarities in vocalization features with humans have been reported, it remains unclear whether marmosets possess an arcuate fasciculus (af) homolog. This study delineated white matter tracts in marmosets, establishing homologies with those observed in other primates, including macaques, chimpanzees, and humans. The presence of an af homolog in marmosets was confirmed by tracer and ultra-high-resolution diffusion magnetic resonance imaging datasets. We compared cortical connectivity patterns across these species and found the af in marmosets terminates in the ventral frontal cortex, with greater similarity to humans than macaques. Furthermore, we linked af connectivity with vocalization-related brain activation in both marmosets and humans. Collectively, our findings suggest that a dorsal pathway, which emerged early in marmoset evolution, has evolved convergently with humans, despite their distant phylogenetic kinship."
"Large epidemiological impacts resulting from disease vector control interventions are typically associated with significant disruption of vector populations. While vector density is a frequently measured response, impacts on demography and connectivity are suspected but rarely quantified. We analysed low-coverage whole-genome sequence data of 893 Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes collected between 2014-2015 during a cluster-randomized control trial (cRCT) in Burkina Faso to compare a pyrethroid-only net (ITN) with a pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen (ITN-PPF) net. Despite reductions of clinical malaria by 12%, and vector density by 22% in the ITN-PPF arm, we found no significant changes in An. gambiae population genetic structure or diversity. We found remarkably low population differentiation, and a lack of discernible clustering by treatment, time, or space. Nucleotide diversity and inbreeding coefficient remained stable between treatments, and genome-wide scans showed no putative signatures of selection between trial arms. These results show that ITN-PPF did not alter An. gambiae genetic structure, possibly due to large, vagile populations in West Africa. More widely, this is first evidence that epidemiologically meaningful reductions in vector density may not impact genetic diversity or connectivity, and challenges what constitutes adequate vector control in large populations."
"Prey abundance and catchability shape the spatial ecology of predators. Predators can select habitats where prey are more abundant to maximize encounter rate with prey, or alternatively, habitats where prey are more catchable to maximize prey capture. These hypotheses are commonly referred to as prey-abundance and prey-catchability hypotheses. Although these hypotheses are often tested at the landscape scale, little is known about how between-patch variations in prey abundance and catchability determine the space use of predators. In particular, in savannah ecosystems, waterholes are hotspots of prey and their selection by predators is classically interpreted as supporting the prey-abundance hypothesis. Here, we investigated whether between-waterhole variations in prey abundance and catchability influence the frequency and duration of lion visits to waterholes, testing the prey-abundance and prey-catchability hypotheses at the resource-patch scale. We combined datasets (1) on lion movements recorded from GPS collars deployed on 20 adult males and 16 adult females between 2002 and 2015, (2) on prey abundance evaluated from long-term, regular monitoring of waterholes and (3) on prey catchability evaluated from remote-sensing satellite imagery of vegetation cover around waterholes in Hwange National Park (Zimbabwe). Although lions did not use equally all waterholes in their territory, and there was a high variability in the frequency and duration of visits, surprisingly, between-waterholes variations in prey abundance and catchability only slightly explained these variations in frequency - and even less in duration - of lion visits to waterholes. We discuss the ecological mechanisms and the limits of our work that may explain these findings. First, lions and their prey are involved in a  shell-game that leads them to adopt unpredictable movement strategies. Second, lions have only access to a limited number of waterholes to spread out their hunting effort. Lastly, lions visit waterholes not only to hunt but also to interact with social mates and competitors. This work challenges the implicit assumption that all waterholes are the same from a lions view and calls for further studies investigating the drivers of the variability in lion visits at the resource-patch scale."
"Fungi-based meat is emerging as a promising class of nutritious, sustainable, and minimally processed biomaterials with the potential to complement or replace traditional animal and plant-based meats. However, its mechanical and sensory properties remain largely unknown. Here we characterize the quasi-static and dynamic mechanical behavior of fungi-based steak using multi-axial mechanical testing, rheology, and texture profile analysis. We find that the rate-independent response under quasi-static compression and shear is isotropic, while the rate-dependent response under dynamic compression is markedly anisotropic with stiffnesses and peak forces four times larger cross-plane than in-plane. Automated model discovery reveals that the exponential Demiray model best explains the rate-independent elastic response upon chewing in both directions. The rate-dependent directional stiffening can be linked, at least in part, to the high water content of mushroom root mycelium and to the restricted fluid flow at higher loading rates. Complementary sensory surveys reveal a strong correlation with mechanical metrics and suggest that we perceive the fungi-based steak as more moist, more viscous, and more fibrous than traditional animal- and plant-based meats. Taken together, our findings position fungi-based steak as an attractive, structurally equivalent, and sensorially compelling alternative protein source that is healthy for people and for the planet."
"RNA-based control of gene expression is common across all domains of life, yet shows extraordinary variety in terms of environmental cues recognized, mechanisms of action, and magnitude of gene expression changes. The fitness benefit conferred by RNA-mediated regulation is often subtle and challenging to measure and may be highly influenced by the environment, yet selective forces are sufficient to generate and maintain complex RNA structures that allow rapid and robust response to stimuli. In this work we perform deep mutational scanning to measure the relative fitness conferred by all single mutants of an FMN riboswitch to the opportunistic pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae under seven different conditions. We find that in standard culture conditions the RNA sequence is not under selective pressure, however the dynamic conditions encountered during mouse lung infection reveal an element that is under weak purifying selection, but robust to strongly deleterious mutations. Furthermore, assessment of fitness in the presence of two different targeting antibiotics exposes diverging adaptive landscapes that reveal suites of mutations conferring either constitutive activation or repression of gene expression. Analysis of these landscapes highlights a complex relationship between antibiotic concentration and the fitness benefit conferred by individual mutations as well as provides insights into the mechanism of action for this RNA with lessons broadly applicable to interpretation of bacterial transcriptomics."
"Protein language models (pLMs) have revolutionized computational biology by generating rich protein vector representations--or embeddings--enabling major advancements in de novo protein design, structure prediction, variant effect analysis, and evolutionary studies. Despite these breakthroughs, current pLMs often exhibit biases against proteins from underrepresented species, with viral proteins being particularly affected--frequently referred to as the ""dark matter"" of the biological world due to their vast diversity and ubiquity, yet sparse representation in training datasets. Here, we show that fine-tuning pre-trained pLMs on viral protein sequences, using diverse learning frameworks and parameter-efficient strategies, significantly enhances representation quality and improves performance on downstream tasks. To support further research, we provide source code for fine-tuning pLMs and benchmarking embedding quality. By enabling more accurate modeling of viral proteins, our approach advances tools for understanding viral biology, combating emerging infectious diseases, and driving biotechnological innovation."

"The recent resurgence of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 viruses in North America and Europe has heightened global concerns regarding potential influenza pandemics. Despite significant progress in the surveillance and prevention of emerging influenza viruses, effective tools for rapid and accurate risk assessment remain limited. Here, we present FluRisk, an innovative computational framework that integrates viral genomic data with artificial intelligence (AI) to enable rapid and comprehensive risk evaluation of emerging influenza strains. FluRisk incorporates a curated database of over 1,000 experimentally validated molecular markers linked to key viral phenotypes, including mammalian adaptation, mammalian virulence, mammalian transmission, human receptor-binding preference, and antiviral drug resistance. Leveraging these markers, we developed three state-of-the-art machine learning models to predict human adaptation, mammalian virulence, and human receptor-binding potential, all of which demonstrated superior performance compared to traditional approaches such as BLAST, prior models, and baseline classifiers. In addition, a reference-based method was implemented to provide preliminary estimates of human transmissibility and resistance to six commonly used antiviral drugs. To facilitate broad accessibility and practical application, we developed a user-friendly web server that integrates both the molecular marker atlas and predictive tools for influenza virus phenotyping (available at: http://www.computationalbiology.cn/FluRisk/#/). This computational platform offers a valuable resource for the timely risk assessment of emerging influenza viruses and supports global influenza surveillance efforts."
"Actin microfilaments (F-actin) serve as the track for directional movement of organelles in plants. To understand how the F-actin network is employed for the movement of peroxisomes, essential organelles in plant metabolism, we analyzed mutants of three villin (VLN) genes, which encode the primary actin-bundling factor and are most actively expressed in vegetative tissues in Arabidopsis thaliana. We found that the vln4 mutation greatly exacerbated the growth and subcellular defects in vln2 vln3. Compared to the wild-type cells, the double and triple vln mutants exhibit progressive reduction of stable F-actin bundles and rapid remodeling of the fine filaments. The defective F-actin network did not prevent peroxisomes from taking on both rapid and slow movements along the tracks but caused significantly reduced speed of movement and displacement distance of peroxisomes. Using a correlation analysis method, we classified the complex heterogeneous peroxisome movement patterns into clusters reflecting distinct movement directionalities. The vln triple mutant had significantly reduced number of peroxisomes with long-range and linear movement. Our results provide insights into how VLN-dependent F-actin organization is coupled with the complex pattern of peroxisome movement."
"We have recently identified ERF transcription factor PTI5 as a susceptibility factor, negatively regulating immune response to diverse pathogens. Here we investigated the processes involved in colonisation of potato with beneficial organisms. RNAseq showed that at the time of Bacillus subtilis biofilm establishment, immune responses in interacting roots were attenuated, and complex transcriptional network was triggered, with ethylene signalling being a central module and PTI5 strongly induced. Interestingly, the response is intensified if plants are inoculated by two antagonistic B. subtilis strains. While PTI5 is not involved in the establishment of biofilm on roots, we show that bacterial abundance increases in PTI5-silenced plants. Remarkably, root colonization by the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Rhizophagus irregularis was also higher in the PTI5-silenced plants. PTI5 is thus involved both in blocking defence against harmful and blocking colonisation with beneficial microbes. Such mechanistic understanding of plant-microbe interaction paves the way for sustainable crop management."
"In 2025 alone, H5N1 avian influenza is responsible for thousands of infections across various animal species, including avian and mammalian livestock such as chickens and cows, and poses a threat to human health due to avian-to-mammalian transmission. There have been 70 human cases of H5N1 influenza in the United States since April 2024 and, as shown in recent studies, our current antibody defenses are waning. Thus, it is imperative to discover new therapeutics in the fight against more recent strains of the virus.

In this study, we present the Frankies framework for automated antibody diffusion and assessment. This pipeline was used to automate the generation of 30 novel anti-HA1 Fv anti-body fragment sequences, fold them into 3-dimensional structures, and then dock against a recent H5N1 HA1 antigen structure for binding evaluation. Here we show the utility of artificial intelligence in the discovery of novel antibodies against specific H5N1 strains of interest, which bind similarly to known therapeutic and elicited antibodies."
"Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong alignment with contextualized semantic encoding in the brain, offering a new avenue for studying language processing. However, natural speech often occurs in multi-talker environments, which remain underexplored. We investigated how auditory attention modulates context tracking using electrocorticography (ECoG) and stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) from three epilepsy patients in a two-conversation ""cocktail party"" paradigm. LLM embeddings were used to predict brain responses to attended and unattended speech streams. Results show that LLMs reliably predict brain activity for the attended stream, and notably, contextual features from the unattended stream also contribute to prediction. Importantly, the brain appears to track shorter-range context in the unattended stream compared to the attended one. These findings reveal that the brain processes multiple speech streams in parallel, modulated by attention, and that LLMs can be valuable tools for probing neural language encoding in complex auditory settings."
"ObjectivesThis study aims to explore the brain responses of patients with disorders of consciousness (DoC) to natural speech. Specifically, it focuses on a key characteristic of natural speech: the speech envelope. To achieve this, we employed two distinct measures. The first evaluates how effectively the patients brain activity ""tracks"" the speech envelope, called neural tracking. The second assesses the complexity of the brains responses to the speech stimulus, measured through spectral entropy. These two measures are then compared in their association with the patients clinical diagnosis and their level of behavioral responsiveness, both of which were assessed using the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R).

DesignFour patients with DoC participated in this study, during which their brain activity was recorded using electroen-cephalography (EEG). At the same time, they listened to a narrated story in both Dutch and Swedish. Additionally, EEG baseline recordings were collected. We employed a backward modeling approach to evaluate the speech envelopes neural tracking. This technique involves training a model to map the relationship between EEG signals and the corresponding speech envelope. Once the model is trained, it can use unseen EEG data to reconstruct the speech envelope, which is then compared to the original speech envelope to assess how effectively the patient processed the auditory stimulus. For the behavioral assessment, we recalculated the CRS-R score of each patient into the CSR-R index, a more meaningful score that utilizes all the information contained in the CRS-R instead of only the highest scores on each subscale.

ResultsOur findings revealed positive correlations between spectral entropy and the CRS-R index, which were more pronounced during the listening conditions than the baseline. While neural tracking of the speech envelope did not correlate with the CRS-R index, it did exhibit a positive association with CRS-R diagnoses, indicating that patients with better clinical diagnoses demonstrated higher levels of neural tracking. Additionally, we identified an interaction effect between spectral entropy and neural tracking. Specifically, higher levels of neural tracking were associated with a stronger positive relationship between spectral entropy and the CRS-R index. In contrast, when neural tracking was lower, this relationship disappeared.

ConclusionThis study demonstrated the potential of neural tracking and spectral entropy as complementary tools to investigate patients with DoC. Spectral entropy proved valuable for assessing behavioral responsiveness, while neural tracking shows promise in assessing the DoC diagnosis. Terms: disorders of consciousness (DoC), neural tracking, speech envelope, spectral entropy"
"The McGill-R-Thy1-APP rat is a transgenic model of Alzheimers Disease (AD) which expresses APP with two mutations found in cases of familial AD, resulting in the development of amyloid pathology and cognitive deficits. Motor deficits are common symptoms of AD, emerging early in the disease, and are correlated with AD neuropathology and cognitive symptoms. This study evaluated heterozygous and homozygous McGill-R-Thy1-APP rats and their wildtype littermates for spontaneous alternation and locomotion in the T and Y mazes, and motor behaviour on an accelerating rotarod. Because rats often jumped off the rotarod, the maximum latency to fall across trials was examined. We found no genotype or sex effects in spontaneous alternation in either maze, nor a significant correlation of spontaneous alternation behaviour between the mazes. Female rats travelled greater distances than male rats in both mazes. While there was no genotype effect in the T maze on distance travelled, in the Y maze the hemizygous rats travelled shorter distances than the wildtype rats, while the homozygous rats travelled greater distances. There was a significant correlation between the distances travelled in each maze. Both heterozygous and homozygous rats performed worse than their wildtype littermates on the rotarod, while heavier rats performed worse than lighter rats, and female rats performed worse than male rats once their differences in weights were accounted for. These findings support the continued use of these rats as a model of AD and highlight the need to consider the possible confounding effect motor impairments have on other behavioural tests."
"Iodine-based staining techniques are commonly used in histological imaging and micro-computed tomography (CT) due to the affinity of iodine to bind to specific molecules. However, the basis for tissue-specific contrast has not yet been sufficiently explored. In this study, we analyse the human proteome and try to identify proteins with high potential for iodine binding, especially those rich in aromatic heterocyclic amino acids. Using bioinformatic methods, we assess the occurrence of aromatic/non-aromatic heterocyclic, homocyclic and the remaining 15 other amino acids in over 20,000 proteins, including 8 isoforms. The proteins were categorised into families using curated (HGNC) and automated datasets (UniProt Similarity Index, InterPro). In particular, structural proteins such as titin, nebulin, obscurin, mucin, filaggrin, and hornerin show a high absolute number of aromatic heterocyclic amino acids. These results may explain the high CT contrast in muscle, skin and mucosal tissues. Our results provide a general baseline for iodine-based tissue imaging and are a potential stepping stone for future research, e.g. for cross-species applications and structural and functional effects of iodination."
"While skin microbiome studies have increasingly highlighted its importance in health and disease, our understanding of inter-individual heterogeneity in structure and function remains limited, impacting the ability to develop microbiome-based stratification and therapeutics. Powered by comprehensive skin microbiome characterization in a multi-ethnic population-based cohort (>3,550 shotgun metagenomes across 18 sampling sites), we established significant undescribed inter-individual heterogeneity and the extensive prevalence of distinct microbial configurations (17 species-resolution dermotypes) in seven out of nine body sites. Combining functional in silico and in vitro studies revealed insights into how these dermotypes assemble as a function of niche-dependent microbial interactions (e.g. hypoxia-dependent inhibition of S. hominis by S. epidermidis/M. luteus) and metabolic resource utilization (e.g. differential galactose and histidine metabolism). Integration of demographic, skin physiological, and behavioral data further identified >30 significant associations with host attributes. Cross-site analysis revealed remarkable coordination across disparate skin regions (predictive AUC-ROC>0.8) and bilateral consistency (Pearson {pi}>0.95), emphasizing the role of specific microbial and host factors in shaping dermotypes. Finally, we provide multiple lines of evidence that dermotype states impact the risk for skin discomfort (e.g. irritation, itch) and diseases (e.g. eczema), that when combined with our highly accurate dermotype classifiers (AUC-ROC>0.98), provide a new paradigm for understanding skin microbiome function and stratifying patients in the context of skin and other diseases."
"Background: Understanding and comparing three-dimensional (3D) structures of proteins can advance bioinformatics, molecular biology, and drug discovery. While 3D models offer detailed insights, comparing multiple structures simultaneously remains challenging, especially on two-dimensional (2D) displays. Existing 2D visualization tools lack standardized approaches for pipelined inspection of large protein sets, limiting their utility in large-scale pre-filtering. Results: We introduce FlatProt, a tool designed to complement 3D viewers by enabling standardized 2D visualization of individual protein structures or large sets thereof. By including Foldseek-based family rotation alignment or an inertia-based fallback, FlatProt creates consistent and scalable visual representations for user-defined protein structures. It supports domain-aware decomposition, family-level overlays, and lightweight visual abstraction of secondary structures. FlatProt processes proteins efficiently, as showcased on a subset of the human-proteome. Conclusion: FlatProt provides clear, consistent, user-friendly visualizations that support rapid, comparative inspection of protein structures at scale. By bridging the gap between interactive 3D tools and static visual summaries, it enables users to explore conserved features, detect outliers, and prioritize structures for further analysis.

"PurposeWe used commercially available wearable devices that measure running power (foot- vs. wrist-based) and muscle oxygenation to investigate time-to-exhaustion during level and uphill running at critical intensity.

Methods14 healthy recreational runners participated in this study. They first ran a 3-minute all-out test to derive their critical running intensity. They then performed two time-to-exhaustion trials (TTEs) at this intensity at separate slopes to assess time-to-exhaustion, muscle oxygenation, and rating of perceived exertion.

ResultsWe observed a shorter time-to-exhaustion (539 {+/-} 160 vs. 936 {+/-} 336 s), a faster decline in muscle oxygenation over time (-2.48 {+/-} 1.32 vs. -1.62 {+/-} 2.11 %{middle dot}min-1), a higher rating of perceived exertion at matched time points, and a higher estimated metabolic rate (19.51 {+/-} 1.99 vs. 17.82 {+/-} 1.62 W{middle dot}kg-1) for the level time-to-exhaustion test (TTELevel) compared to the uphill time-to-exhaustion test (TTEIncline) at a 2.86{degrees} (5%) slope.

ConclusionOur data suggests that athletes should be careful when using running power at critical intensity to guide their racing and training in non-level conditions."
"Platelet-derived materials are emerging as promising, cell-free biotherapies for regenerative medicine. While platelet lysates have shown neuroprotective activity in preclinical models, the neurogenic potential of platelet concentrate-derived extracellular vesicles (pEVs) remains underexplored. Here, we evaluated the effects of human pEVs and a neuroprotective heat-treated human platelet lysate (HPPL) on adult hippocampal neurogenesis using both an ex vivo neurosphere assay and an in vivo intranasal administration model. pEVs selectively enhanced dentate gyrus (DG)-derived neurosphere growth, even in the absence of exogenous growth factors, and were internalized by neural precursors. In vivo, short-term pEV delivery increased EdU proliferating cells in the DG, while long-term administration (28 days) elevated the proportion of newborn mature neurons. By contrast, HPPL primarily promoted early neurogenesis by expanding immature DCX neurons. Quantitative proteomics of DG tissue after pEV treatment revealed 111 differentially expressed proteins, with enrichment in pathways related to oxidative phosphorylation, Notch4 signaling, myelination, and MHC class I-mediated antigen presentation. Downregulated proteins included cytoskeletal and translation-related regulators, suggesting a shift toward neuronal differentiation and circuit integration. Biophysical characterization confirmed the purity and vesicular nature of pEVs, with a defined protein cargo including immune modulators and ECM-interacting molecules such as CD44, lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1 (LYVE1), and complement proteins. These findings identify allogeneic pEVs as multifunctional agents that modulate neural precursor cell fate and brain tissue remodeling through coordinated metabolic and immunoregulatory mechanisms. This work supports the translational potential of pEV-based therapeutics for promoting hippocampal neurogenesis and cognitive repair in neurodegenerative and age-related brain disorders."
"Goal-directed actions are those performed with the expectation of producing a specific outcome and are therefore sensitive to changes in the outcomes current value without re-experiencing the action-outcome contingency. Disrupting the action-outcome association by a number of manipulations can reduce responding in humans, but if such interventions also affect the goal-directedness of the response remains unknown. Across two experiments, we trained participants to perform different actions for distinct outcomes. Participants then experienced either extinction (i.e., complete suspension of outcome delivery), or non-contingent training (i.e., outcomes were presented independently of responding). One outcome was then devalued before responding was tested in the absence of outcome presentations. An overall analysis of responding during this test revealed that outcome devaluation decreased responding to a degree that was not significantly reduced by either the extinction or non-contingent training. These results suggest that human goal-directed behavior is resistant to manipulations of the action-outcome contingency. We discuss these results in light of recent theories of goal-directed behavior.

The status of goal-directed actions after manipulations of the action-outcome contingency"
"Cancer progression involves loss of differentiation and acquisition of stem cell-like traits, broadly referred to as ""stemness"". Here, we test whether the level of stemness, assessed by a transcriptome-derived Stemness score, can quantitatively track prostate cancer (PCa) development, progression, therapy resistance, metastasis, plasticity, and patient survival. Integrative analysis of transcriptomic data from 87,183 samples across 26 datasets reveals a progressive increase in Stemness and decline in pro-differentiation androgen receptor activity (AR-A) along the PCa continuum, with metastatic castration-resistant PCa (mCRPC) exhibiting the highest Stemness and lowest AR-A. Both the general Stemness score and a newly developed 12-gene ""PCa-Stem Signature"" correlate with and predict poor clinical outcomes. Mechanistically, increased AR-A may promote Stemness in early-stage PCa while MYC amplification and bi-allelic RB1 loss likely drive greatly elevated Stemness in mCRPC where AR-A is suppressed. Our findings establish Stemness as a robust quantitative measure of PCa aggressiveness and offer a scalable framework for PCa risk stratification."
"Elucidating the anti-tumor role of tumor-draining lymph nodes (tdLNs) in patients could offer critical mechanistic insight and shift therapeutic strategies from a tumor-centric approach to one that considers tumor-immune system interplay. Our study characterizes benign tdLNs T cell anti-tumor responses beyond initial T cell priming in patients with resectable non-small cell lung cancer. We further investigated whether tumor-specific tdLN T cells were altered by immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) locally and systemically. We performed single-cell TCR lineage tracing and transcriptomic profiling on 672,886 CD8 T cells from 41 tumor, benign tdLN, and blood samples in 14 patients treated with or without neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy (ChemoIO). Using deep-integrating clonal tracking with machine learning-based transcriptional analysis, our findings revealed that benign tdLNs locally and independently orchestrate two transcriptionally distinct tumor-specific memory CD8 T cell populations: one with ZNF683+ CXCR6+ tumor tissue-residency potential, and another with cytotoxic memory potential. Furthermore, tdLN-derived clones not only constitute the dominant tumor-infiltrating (75%) and circulating (>90%) tumor-specific expanded T cell populations but also preserve their transcriptionally distinct subset identities within the tumor T cell effector state. ChemoIO selectively increased the clonal diversity and cytotoxic memory/TEMRA programs of tdLN-derived clones locally and systemically, both of which remained unchanged in clones lacking tdLN TCR lineage. In conclusion, the tdLN locally orchestrates tumor-reactive and ChemoIO-reactive transcriptional distinct T cell subsets that shape the circulating blood and tumor T cell environments. These findings represent a clinical paradigm shift with implications regarding the extent of tdLN resection during surgery, timing of ChemoIO treatment, and the development of memory T cell-based immunotherapies."
"Despite their importance for brain function, cortico-subcortical white matter tracts are under-represented in diffusion MRI tractography studies. Their non-invasive mapping is more challenging and less explored compared to other major cortico-cortical bundles. We introduce a set of standardised tractography protocols for delineating tracts between the cortex and various deep subcortical structures, including the caudate, putamen, amygdala, thalamus and hippocampus. To enable comparative studies, our protocols are designed for both human and macaque brains. We demonstrate how tractography reconstructions follow topographical principles obtained from tracers in the macaque and how these translate to humans. We show that the proposed proto-cols are robust against data quality and preserve aspects of individual variability stemming from family structure in humans. Lastly, we demonstrate the value of these species-matched protocols in mapping homologous grey matter regions in humans and macaques, both in cortex and subcortex."

"What constitutes a single species is ultimately arbitrary, resulting in idiosyncrasies in taxonomic praxis determining species counts. One consequence of this arbitrariness is taxonomic synonymization, wherein variation determined not unique enough to constitute distinct species gets merged into one. Synonymization is non-random and subject to taxon and trait-specific biases. We explore these trends using a comprehensive dataset of the worlds marine species for all large phyla and Animalia. We match all accepted species-names from the present day with their synonyms and calculate metrics of synonymization including the time lag between the years of descriptions of a species and its newest synonym. We find that although species description trends across phyla show no consistent, discernible trends, the fraction of names that gets synonymised remains initially constant across phyla, with a subsequent gradual decrease. Most accepted species described around the early 20th century possess synonyms created in the same year, indicating synonyms arising due to new name combinations, suggesting a distinct period of taxonomic praxis. This period was followed by a period of most species descriptions lacking synonyms on moving towards the present. Across taxa, we find the mean lag to be strongly negatively correlated to time, with time not being a limiting factor determining this trend. We also find the number of synonyms per accepted name to also be strongly negatively correlated to time in a taxon-independent manner. Our study considers when the diversity characterising species in the form of once-unique species-names becomes known to science. Our results suggest that across taxa, species described more recently encompass less biological variability, indicating a gradual change in how morphologically delineated species which comprise the vast majority of species described across time are described."
"Making decisions often requires the integration of multiple pieces of information. An extensive body of research has investigated the neural architecture underpinning evidence accumulation in perceptual tasks where information is continuously present, but less is known about how this neural architecture operates in situations affording only intermittent glimpses of an evidence source. In two electroencephalography (EEG) experiments, participants judged the direction of up to two pulses of motion evidence separated by gaps of varying duration. Our behavioural analysis found that participants used both pulses but underutilised the second, and showed no systematic decrease in accuracy as a function of gap duration. At the neural level, motor beta lateralisation tracked cumulative evidence across pulses, maintaining a sustained representation of the decision variable through the gap and until response. In contrast, the centroparietal positivity (CPP), a previously-characterised signature of evidence accumulation, built up transiently to a peak that scaled with each pulses contribution to the decision variable (i.e. the absolute belief update it produced), falling back to baseline in between pulses. These patterns were recapitulated in a model where pulse-information transiently integrated at the CPP level is fed to and maintained at a bounded motor level, so that information presented later on in a trial is integrated only if a bound has not yet been reached."
"Parkinsons disease (PD) is the fastest growing neurodegenerative disease in the world1. Gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction can occur decades before motor impairments and in up to 80% of individuals living with PD2,3,4. We investigated peripheral relationships that may underlie mechanisms along the gut-blood axis that contribute to PD pathogenesis. Single-cell multiomic spatial molecular imaging (SMI) of colonic tissue localized inflammatory injury within epithelial cells that appear to be associated with iron mishandling in both inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and PD biosamples. We found that both the single-cell SMI of RNA and protein revealed parallel cross-modal dysregulation in the gut epithelium, in both IBD and PD biosamples. These data are accompanied by plasma (PD) and stool (IBD) protein depletion of CCL22. Our findings suggest iron mishandling along the gut barrier likely contributes to systemic inflammation, which may be the catalyst that primes circulating immune cells to body-first PD pathogenesis."
"Accurate prediction of protein-ligand complexes remains a central challenge in structural biology. Traditional methods are computationally inefficient and prone to local minima, whereas deep learning approaches struggle to capture structural flexibility and physical plausibility. We introduce PhysDock, a physics-guided diffusion model that uniquely integrates (i) all-atom diffusion to model ligand flexibility and protein precision-flexibility (i.e., subtle conformational adjustments); (ii) physical priors as diffusion conditioning, alongside two-phase physics guidance during the denoising diffusion to ensure physical plausibility. PhysDock demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in redocking benchmarks and excels in the more challenging cross-docking assessments. For practical utility, PhysDock (i) resolves cannabinoid receptor selectivity across diverse molecules, achieving accuracy comparable to experiments; (ii) distinguishes most drug candidates from weak binders in virtual screening of NTRK3 kinase, while uncovering novel candidates with structural insights. PhysDock serves as a versatile tool for protein-ligand complex prediction, with substantial potential to accelerate structure-based drug discovery."
"Petal patterns contribute to the reproductive success of flowering plants by attracting pollinators and protecting reproductive organs from environmental factors. While some transcription factors (TFs) controlling pigment production and cuticle elaboration have been identified, little is known about the upstream developmental processes that first establish the petal regions where these regulators are active--the pre-patterning phase. Here, we developed a computational model of the evolution and development of petal patterns. We selected for gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that could generate the proximo-distal bullseye pattern of Hibiscus trionum petals, which resulted in robust patterning dynamics and a variety of bullseye proportions. We found that the evolution of these bullseye patterns was often accompanied by the spontaneous emergence of a third cell type at the boundary between the proximal and distal regions with a unique gene expression profile. These bullseye boundary cells appeared in the majority of simulations despite not being explicitly selected for, and we validated their presence experimentally in H. trionum petals. Although boundary cell types could emerge spontaneously without apparent function, our results indicate they were more often important for pattern formation and more evolutionarily stable when gene expression was noisy. This suggests that this emergent cell type contributes to reproducible bullseye formation by buffering against developmental variability. Altogether, these results illuminate the early steps of petal pattern formation and demonstrate how novel cell types arising spontaneously and repeatedly from selection on other features can help achieve developmental robustness."
"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is a multifactorial condition influenced by the gut microbiome (GM). While previous studies have reported inconsistent associations between MASLD and key microbial clades using low-resolution 16S rRNA profiling, we employed high-resolution metagenomic sequencing and multi-marker taxonomic classification across three independent cohorts to identify robust microbial and functional signatures of MASLD. We consistently detected a depletion of Agathobacter rectalis, a known butyrate producer, in MASLD patients. Functionally, MASLD was characterized by a depletion of genes involved in butyrate and methane biosynthesis-particularly within the crotonyl-butyryl-CoA axis-alongside an enrichment of genes driving the production of endogenous alcohols such as ethanol and 1-propanol. Genes encoding these fermentative pathways, often organized in operons like pdu and tor, were more abundant in MASLD samples, indicating a potential shift toward alcohol-producing metabolism. These geno-metabolic changes were accompanied by a broader displacement of beneficial taxa and an increase in accessory gene content across the GM, underscoring the limitations of taxonomy-based disease associations. Many of the differentially abundant genes were also found on plasmids, suggesting that horizontal gene transfer contributes to strain-level metabolic variability relevant to MASLD progression. Our findings support a model in which GM-driven metabolic shifts-rather than taxonomic changes alone-play a central role in MASLD pathogenesis, highlighting the importance of functional and mobile genetic element (MGEs) profiling for uncovering mechanistic links between the microbiome and liver disease."
"Most natural proteins alternate between distinct conformational states, each associated with specific functions. Intentional manipulation of conformational equilibria could lead to improved or altered protein properties. Here we develop Conformational Biasing (CB), a rapid and streamlined computational method that utilizes contrastive scoring by inverse folding models to predict variants biased towards desired conformational states. We validated CB across seven diverse deep mutational scanning datasets, successfully predicting variants of K-Ras, SARS-CoV-2 spike, {beta}2 adrenergic receptor, and Src kinase with improved conformation-specific functions including enhanced effector binding or enzymatic activity. Furthermore, applying CB to lipoic acid ligase, a conformation-switching bacterial enzyme that has been used for the development of protein labeling technologies, revealed a previously unknown mechanism for conformational gating of sequence-specificity. Variants biased toward the ""open"" conformation were highly promiscuous, while ""closed"" conformation-biased variants were even more specific than wild-type, enhancing the utility of LplA for site-specific protein labeling with fluorophores in living cells. The speed, simplicity, and versatility of CB (available at: https://github.com/alicetinglab/ConformationalBiasing/) suggest that it may be broadly applicable for understanding and engineering protein conformational dynamics, with implications for basic research, biotechnology, and medicine."
"Transmembrane glycoproteins of enveloped viruses are the targets of neutralizing antibodies and essential vaccine antigens. mRNA-LNP technology allows in situ production of transmembrane glycoproteins upon immunization, but biophysical characterization of transmembrane antigens and in vitro analysis of post-immunization antibody responses typically rely on soluble proteins. Here, we present a methodological platform for assembling transmembrane glycoprotein vaccine candidates into lipid nanodiscs. We demonstrate the utility of the nanodiscs in HIV membrane proximal external region (MPER)-targeting vaccine development by binding assays using surface plasmon resonance (SPR), ex vivo B cell sorting with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), and by determining the structure of a prototypical HIV MPER-targeting immunogen nanodisc in complex with three broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs), including the MPER bnAb 10E8, to 3.5 [A] by cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM), providing a template for structure-based immunogen design for MPER. Overall, the platform offers a tool for accelerating the development of next-generation viral vaccines."
"In recent years, tremendous advances have been made in predicting protein structures and protein-protein interactions. However, progress in predicting the structure of RNA, either alone or in complex with other macromolecules, has been less prominent, although some recent developments have been reported. It remains unclear whether the improved prediction accuracy is sustained for novel RNA structures. Here, we use an independent benchmark to evaluate the performance of the latest methods. First, we show that state-of-the-art methods can sometimes predict the structure of single-chain RNA strands, with accurate models observed for RNAs with well-defined or regular secondary structures. Next, our evaluation was extended to RNA complexes, where prediction accuracy was notably higher for those involving extensive canonical base pairing. Additionally, a structural similarity analysis revealed that prediction success strongly correlates with resemblance to known structures, indicating that current methods recognise recurring motifs rather than generalising to novel folds. Finally, we also noted that the estimation of accuracies for RNA models is far from accurate. Therefore, it is not possible to reliably identify the correctly predicted models with todays methods.

"Short abstractAssigning hedonic value shapes behaviour across organisms, yet how these values translate into motivated behaviour remains unclear. We introduce hedonic foraging as a mechanism by which hedonic evaluation guides behaviour via iterative reward maximisation. This framework integrates hedonic evaluation with active inference, whereby expected free energy encodes wanting--the motivational drive toward rewarding outcomes--while variational free energy corresponds to liking--the hedonic impact of the outcome. Hedonic foraging unifies the mechanisms underlying behaviours ranging from allostasis to art appreciation, casting cognition and motivated behaviour as purposive engagement with the environment and its affordances.

Long abstractHedonic evaluation shapes behaviour across organisms. Yet, the mechanisms that transform hedonic values into motivated behaviour remain poorly understood, and key questions remain unanswered. How do habits, wanting, and liking or disliking interact to generate behaviour? Do common principles govern behaviour across species and cognitive systems, from basic survival mechanisms to complex cultural endeavours? We propose a unifying theory of motivated behaviour that integrates hedonic evaluation with active inference--a framework in which perception, action and cognition emerge from the imperative to minimise free energy. We argue that variational free energy provides a natural measure of liking and disliking, while expected free energy encodes wanting--the motivational drive toward rewarding outcomes. This synthesis, which we term hedonic foraging, offers a principled explanation for how organisms navigate their environments based on pleasure-driven learning and decision-making. It posits that motivated behaviour emerges from the fundamental pursuit of maximising reward, with hedonic evaluation motivating and monitoring actions through wanting and liking mechanisms. We demonstrate that hedonic foraging captures a wide range of behaviours, from allostatic processes common to all animals to sophisticated human activities such as art appreciation and cultural exploration. Crucially, our integrative perspective fosters mutual enrichment between hedonic evaluation and active inference--two fundamental approaches to behaviour. Ultimately, hedonic foraging reinforces the view that cognition is essentially about purposive engagement in adaptive interactions with the environment and its affordances and offers a unified framework for investigating cognition and behaviour."
"Prolyl-hydroxylases (PHDs) are oxygen sensing enzymes that mediate the hydroxylation of proline residues. In mammals, three PHD isoforms (PHD1-3) are responsible for proline hydroxylation of Hypoxia Inducible Factor (HIF) alpha, a key regulator of the hypoxia response. In the accompanying paper (Jiang et. al., 2025) we report development of a mass spectrometry-based method to reliably identify proline hydroxylation (OH-Pro) sites on proteins and use this to identify a PHD-dependent OH-Pro modification at Pro604 on the protein RepoMan (CDCA2), a regulatory subunit for protein phosphatase PP1{gamma}, with important roles in mitotic progression and cell viability.

Here, we investigate the functional significance of hydroxylation of RepoMan at P604. During M phase, the PP1-RepoMan complex dephosphorylates Thr3 of Histone H3 (H3T3) on chromosomes arms to ensure the correct localisation of the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) at centromeres. We show that siRNA depletion of PHD1, but not PHD2, increases H3T3 phosphorylation in prometaphase-arrested cells. In cells depleted of endogenous RepoMan, exogenous expression of wild type RepoMan, but not a RepoMan P604A mutant, restored normal H3T3 phosphorylation localisation in prometaphase arrested cells. RepoMan P604 is located proximal to the Short Linear Motifs (SLiMs) that function as binding sites for the serine/threonine Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A). The interaction of RepoMan and PP2A-B56{gamma} is reduced in cells expressing RepoMan P604A. Moreover, analyses in both fixed and live cells released from a prometaphase arrest, show that expression of the RepoMan P604A mutant delays completion of mitosis, results in defects in chromosome alignment and segregation and increases levels of cell death. These data support a role for PHD1-mediated prolyl hydroxylation in controlling progression through mitosis, acting, at least in part, via hydroxylation of RepoMan at P604 regulating the interaction of RepoMan with PP2A during chromosome alignment and thereby controlling the levels of Histone H3 phosphorylation at Thr3."
"Lipid order parameters are an important metric for quantifying the molecular structure of biological membranes. They can be derived from both molecular simulations and experimental measurements, enabling robust comparisons between the two. Although methods for calculating lipid order parameters from molecular dynamics simulations of membrane systems at various resolutions are well established, a comprehensive and user-friendly package for these calculations is lacking, which has even led some researchers to use tools that are known to perform the calculations incorrectly. To address this, we have developed gorder, an analysis tool capable of calculating lipid order parameters in atomistic, united-atom, and coarse-grained systems, compatible with any force field, and applicable to both planar and curved membrane geometries. gorder is designed to be fast and versatile, providing a unified solution for lipid order calculations. The tool is freely available from crates.io/crates/gorder and github.com/Ladme/gorder under the MIT License."
"The B16 murine melanoma cell lines are considered the gold standard for testing melanoma immunotherapies due to low treatment success rates. However, the clinical relevance of these models has been questioned due to a mutational landscape void of driver mutations typically seen in human melanomas and a tendency to form necrotic cores at high tumor volumes. Creating the YUMM1.7 line addressed these limitations by providing an additional contextually consistent model with a more clinically relevant genetic background. The combined use of both models can generate stronger studies in melanoma immunology and immunotherapy. However, to date, there have been no direct functional comparisons of the characteristics of these two models to inform the design of such studies. To address this, we conducted a series of functional experiments to characterize the kinetics of tumor growth, chemotherapeutic sensitivity, and immunogenicity of these models. We found that the B16F0 model had faster intrinsic tumor growth rates, was more susceptible to lysis by tumor-specific CD8+ T cells, and secreted higher levels of the angiogenic factors VEGF and Ang2. Meanwhile, the YUMM1.7 model was more sensitive to chemotherapeutic treatment, secreted higher levels of chemokines CCL2, CXCL1, and CX3CL1, and showed higher infiltration of lymphocyte and myeloid subsets at the same tumor size. Overall, YUMM1.7 model may be better suited for in vivo studies of mechanisms that require a wider observation window and intervention than the B16F0 model, such as immune response. However, angiogenesis and immunotherapy studies may benefit from a more in-depth comparative analyses of both models."
"RNA decay is essential for maintenance of normal RNA abundances; however how RNA decay is regulated to contribute to changes in RNA abundances is poorly understood. Here, we addressed this question by analyzing rates of RNA abundance change, RNA half- lives (t1/2s), and transcription rates in stimulated Arabidopsis leaf cells. This revealed three mechanisms by which decay influenced RNA abundance changes. First, the biggest changes in RNA abundances resulted from t1/2 changes that reinforced transcriptional regulation (synergistic). Modest RNA abundance changes arose from a second mechanism in which t1/2 changes opposed transcriptional regulation (oppositional). Finally, RNA decay alone also contributed to RNA abundance change, and RNA decays measured capacity influence RNA abundances was similar to that of transcription. RNA decay also contributed to transcriptome homeostasis through stimulus-induced RNA buffering. Oppositional and buffering regulation shared key features, including excessive and commensurate rate changes, which suggested use of a shared regulatory mechanism which we call countercyclical regulation. In this study, countercyclical regulation was widespread and used for regulation of 90% of the RNAs with t1/2 regulation."
"Decision-making tasks involving multiple, simultaneously presented options are mainstays of cognitive neuroscience and psychology and are increasingly important to the emerging field of computational psychiatry. Modeling approaches to these tasks overwhelmingly assume that participants make choices based on explicitly comparing the values of the presented options. Contrary to this long-held assumption, we found instead that humans employ a compare-to-threshold decision process, similar to theories of foraging, when making sequential decisions about concurrently available options. We confirmed this result in a large (1000 participant) dataset with multiple converging lines of evidence comparing both model fits and model generative performance. Value-comparison models were restricted to a reduced area of the potential space of single-trial outcome-dependent behavior, demonstrating an intrinsic limitation in the ability to reproduce strategy diversity. Furthermore, we found that using even the best-fit value-comparison model led to a substantial, systematic bias and a compression of individual differences in reconstructed behavior compared to the foraging-based model, leading to weaker predictions of behavioral health measures. Our results imply that studies using value-comparison models to link behavior with neural activity or psychiatric symptoms may be less sensitive to individual differences than a simple alternative based on ethological foraging."
"Intracellular vesicular transport by kinesin-1 motors through numerous 3-dimensional (3D) microtubule (MT) intersections must be regulated to support proper vesicle delivery. Knowing kinesin-1 can be regulated via autoinhibition, does kinesin-1 exhibit autoinhibition on cargo, and could this regulate vesicular transport through 3D MT intersections in vitro? To answer this question, we compared liposome transport by [~]10 nearly full-length kinesin-1 motors with KLC bound (Kin{Delta}C) versus constitutively active control (K543). In 3D MT intersections, Kin{Delta}C-liposomes terminate (48%), go straight (43%), but rarely turn (9%), starkly contrasting K543-liposomes which go straight (57%), turn (31%), but rarely terminate (12%). On single MTs, Kin{Delta}C-liposomes have reduced run lengths and detachment forces versus K543-liposomes, suggesting autoinhibition reduces MT engagement, as supported by 3-fold lower Kin{Delta}C MT landing rates versus K543, and mechanistic in silico modeling. Furthermore, kinesore, a small molecule that overcomes kinesin-1 autoinhibition, restores Kin{Delta}Cs MT engagement. Thus, we propose that partial kinesin-1 autoinhibition while cargo-bound may fine-tune cargo delivery to support physiological demands.

Statement of significanceKinesin-1 vesicular transport through the cells complex microtubule (MT) network must be spatially and temporally regulated to meet the cells physiological demands. With kinesin-1 being autoinhibited, does this form of regulation impact the directional outcomes of vesicles encountering 3-dimensional (3D) MT-MT intersections as they do in cells? To address this in vitro, liposomes transported by kinesin-1 motors (team of [~]10), which exhibit autoinhibition, are challenged with 3D MT intersections and interestingly, preferentially terminate or go straight and rarely turn, while liposomes transported by constitutively active motors preferentially go straight or turn but rarely terminate. Therefore, autoinhibition reduces the number of MT-engaged motors within the team and provides the cell a means of fine-tuning cargo transport to its destination."
"The actin/spectrin membrane-associated periodic skeleton (MPS), is a cytoskeletal structure that supports axonal integrity and function. Lower spinal motor neurons (MNs) are characterized by exceptionally long axons and are particularly susceptible to degeneration in a wide range of hereditary neuromuscular disorders, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Using confocal and super-resolution imaging, we characterized the spatial distribution {beta}II-spectrin and the assembly pattern of the MPS in human MN axons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). We discovered a striking gap-and-patch pattern in the medial axon, where sharply demarcated {beta}II-spectrin gaps alternate with patches containing a well-organized MPS. The pattern is acutely induced by the kinase inhibitor staurosporine and pharmacological inhibition of actin polymerization prevents patch formation, indicating a requirement for actin nucleation in MPS assembly. Our data supports a model in which spectrin incorporation into nascent MPS patches depletes neighboring regions, producing long-range gaps-and-patches patterns. Key words: actin, spectrin, MPS, cytoskeleton, motor neurons, iPSCs, staurosporine."
"Global university rankings have transformed how certain institutions define success, often elevating metrics over meaning. This study examines universities with rapid research growth that suggest metric-driven behaviors. Among the 1,000 most publishing institutions, 98 showed extreme output increases between 2018-2019 and 2023-2024. Of these, 18 were selected for exhibiting sharp declines in first and corresponding authorship. Compared to national, regional, and international norms, these universities (in India, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates) display patterns consistent with strategic metric optimization. Key findings include publication growth of up to 965%, concentrated in STEM fields; surges in hyper-prolific authors and highly cited articles; and dense internal co-authorship and citation clusters. The group also exhibited elevated shares of publications in delisted journals and high retraction rates. These patterns illustrate vulnerabilities in global ranking systems, as metrics lose meaning when treated as targets (Goodharts Law) and institutions emulate high-performing peers under competitive pressure (institutional isomorphism). Without reform, rankings may continue incentivizing behaviors that distort scholarly contribution and compromise research integrity."
"Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are small metabolites that are produced through the activity of microbes and have important roles in human physiology. These metabolites have varied mechanisms in interacting with the host, of which one such mode is decorating the chromatin landscape. We previously detected specific histone modifications in the mouse gut that can be derived from SCFAs and are regulated by the microbiota. However, the roles of these SCFAs on chromatin and how they impact gene regulation in human cells is largely unknown. Now, our studies demonstrate these microbiota-dependent histone posttranslational modifications (PTMs) are associated with alterations in gene regulation in human cells. We show that histone butyrylation on H3K27 is detected in human colon samples. Furthermore, histone acetylation, butyrylation, and propionylation on H3K9 and H3K27 are responsive to levels of SCFAs in human colon cancer cell lines and are associated with active gene regulatory elements. In addition, treatment of human cancer cell lines with individual metabolites or combinations of SCFAs replicating the intestinal lumen environment result in distinct and overlapping gene program changes, with butyrate largely driving gene regulatory effects of SCFA combinations. Lastly, we define butyrate effects on gene expression that are independent of HDAC inhibition and are dependent on p300/CBP, suggesting potential gene programs regulated by histone butyrylation. Together, these results demonstrate that SCFAs are key regulators of the chromatin landscape and gene programs in human colorectal cancer cells."
"The genetic code allows multiple synonymous codons to encode the same amino acid, creating a vast sequence space for protein-coding regions. Codon choice can impact mRNA function and protein output, a consideration newly relevant with advances in mRNA technology. Genomes preferentially use some codons, but simple optimization methods that select preferred codons miss complex contextual patterns. We present Trias, an encoder-decoder language model trained on millions of eukaryotic coding sequences. Trias learns codon usage rules directly from sequence data, integrating local and global dependencies to generate species-specific codon sequences that align with biological constraints. Without explicit training on protein expression, Trias generates sequences and scores that correlate strongly with experimental measurements of mRNA stability, ribosome load, and protein output. The model outperforms commercial codon optimization tools in generating sequences resembling high-expression codon sequence variants. By modeling codon usage in context, Trias offers a data-driven framework for synthetic mRNA design and for understanding the molecular and evolutionary principles behind codon choice."
"There is a pressing need for the development, characterization, and standardization of animal models of Parkinsons disease (PD) that properly mimic the cardinal features of this disorder, comprising both the motor phenotype and neuropathological signatures. In the past few years, animal modeling has moved from neurotoxin-based approaches toward viral vectors carrying a given genetic payload of interest. Here, to induce pigmentation of the mouse brain upon systemic delivery, we took advantage of a modified adeno-associated viral vector capsid engineered to bypass the blood-brain barrier and coding for the human tyrosinase gene (AAV9-P31-hTyr). Obtained results revealed an ongoing pigmentation of catecholaminergic centers related to the pathophysiology of PD, such as the substantia nigra pars compacta, ventral tegmental area, and locus coeruleus. Moreover, pigmented dopaminergic neurons exhibited Lewy body-like intracytoplasmic inclusions, a progressive nigrostriatal degeneration, and a time-dependent PD motor phenotype. The bilateral pigmented mouse model of PD generated this way is highly reproducible, does not require stereotaxic surgery for viral vector deliveries, and opens unprecedented possibilities for preclinical testing of therapeutic candidates designed to reduce disease progression rates."
"Environmental nucleic acids (eNA), such as DNA and RNA, are powerful tools for monitoring biodiversity. Yet, interpreting eNA detections requires understanding of their environmental persistence. We conducted a decay experiment using seawater from an open enclosure to track degradation of six eNA components derived from Tursiops truncatus: mitochondrial eDNA of varying lengths, ribosomal eRNA, and messenger eRNA. Targets were quantified over seven days via digital droplet PCR (ddPCR). Decay followed a biphasic exponential model with rapid initial loss ([~]24 hours at 15 {degrees}C), followed by slower degradation. Cytb messenger eRNA was least stable, disappearing within four hours. Ribosomal eRNA persisted longer but degraded slightly faster than its eDNA counterpart ({lambda} = 0.236 vs. 0.165 hr-{superscript 1}). Longest eDNA fragments decayed more rapidly ({lambda} = 0.190 hr-1) than shorter ones ({lambda} = 0.114 hr-1). These findings support the use of eDNA fragment length as a proxy for degradation state and reinforce that combining multiple eNA components with distinct stabilities can potentially provide a molecular clock for inferring eNA age. This approach improves the spatiotemporal resolution of eNA-based monitoring, particularly for rare marine-mammal that act as point sources. We also emphasize the importance of explicitly distinguishing between RNA types (ribosomal vs. messenger) in environmental studies, given their divergent stability and interpretability."
"A central question in cognitive neuroscience is how the brain integrates distinct sensory and perceptual inputs to improve cognitive performance. This study investigated this question in the context of human spatial navigation by combining high-field 3T fMRI and desktop virtual reality. Participants encoded and retrieved spatial locations using either landmarks alone (landmark condition), visual self-motion cues alone (i.e., optic flow; self-motion condition), or both cues together (combination condition). Participants behaviorally benefited from cue integration. fMRI analyses revealed a cue integration effect in the hippocampus, which displayed positional coding only in the combination condition, and only in participants who showed behavioral benefits from cue integration. Furthermore, hippocampal positional coding was more strongly associated with actual than self-reported locations, indicating it integrates sensory-perceptual inputs from spatial cues. Our findings suggest that the hippocampuss fundamental function is to integrate diverse sensory-perceptual inputs to support precise memory-guided navigation, rather than representing space per se, thereby challenging the dominant cognitive map theory in spatial navigation. Our findings also offers a unifying framework for understanding the hippocampal function in cue integration, episodic memory, and relational memory.

Significance StatementThe hippocampus is traditionally viewed as a cognitive map that represents spatial environments. However, our findings challenge this longstanding view by demonstrating that hippocampal involvement in spatial navigation lies in the integration of multiple sensory-perceptual inputs to enhance the precision of spatial representations, rather than spatial representation per se. Using high-resolution fMRI and a novel immersive virtual navigation task, we showed that positional coding in the hippocampus emerges only in participants who successfully integrated different spatial cues. Our findings also offers a unifying framework for understanding the hippocampal function across domains, including spatial navigation, cue integration, episodic memory, and relational memory."
"BackgroundParkinsons disease (PD) has traditionally been viewed through the lens of basal ganglia dysfunction, yet emerging research also implicates the cerebellum and its connections to the basal ganglia.

ObjectiveTo investigate cerebellar and basal ganglia beta-band responses during a somatosensory timing task, with a focus on prediction- and evaluation-related activity in individuals with PD compared to controls.

MethodsUsing magnetoencephalography (MEG), we presented participants with tactile stimuli in regular (non-jittered) and irregular (jittered) sequences. In each trial, the final expected stimulus was omitted to probe prediction-related activity before the omission and evaluation-related activity after it. We analyzed beta-band responses and functional connectivity across cerebellum, basal ganglia, thalamus, and motor cortex.

ResultsWe found prediction-related differences between PD and controls in cerebellum and basal ganglia before the omissions, but no differences between PD and controls in the cerebellar evaluation responses after the omissions. In PD participants, basal ganglia activity favored jittered sequences over non-jittered, whereas the reverse was seen in the controls. Moreover, alterations in cerebellar beta-band responses correlated with symptom severity in PD participants. Finally, we found an interaction in functional connectivity within a sensory-integration network between the two participant groups and the regularity of the stimuli.

ConclusionWe interpret these findings as indicating that the cerebellum may play a compensatory role in predictive timing in PD and that in challenging conditions, the jittered condition, the wider sensory-integration network is harder at work in PD in trying to predict upcoming stimuli."
"T cells are critical for immune responses, recognizing antigens via their unique T-cell receptors (TCRs). Analyzing the diverse TCR repertoires, especially the hypervariable CDR3 region, is essential for understanding immune function in health and disease. Current TCR analysis tools often require specialized expertise, computational resources, or sacrifice biological information for efficiency. To address these limitations, we developed TCRanalyzer, a fast and comprehensive TCR analysis pipeline within a user-friendly graphical interface. TCRanalyzer covers all steps from data loading, aggregation and optional sequence clustering, to the analysis of TCR diversity metrics, clonal expansion and antigen specificity. Applied to datasets from patients with either benign or malignant tumors, TCRanalyzer identified changes in TCR clonality, clonal expansion and shifts in antigen specificity across different cohorts or following immunotherapy, thereby demonstrating its potential to dissect critical immunological processes. TCRanalyzer provides a robust and user-friendly tool for TCR sequence analysis, enhancing research in immunology and related fields.

"While the contribution of gene expression (GE) to adaptive evolution is widely accepted, the role of alternative splicing (AS) remains less understood. Here, we investigate AS and GE across three iconic adaptive radiations of African cichlid fishes that evolved within <16,000 to 3.8 million years. We show that AS evolves faster than GE, with both sources of variation being  fine-tuned over evolutionary time to become species-specific and clade-specific, respectively. Ecologically divergent species from younger radiations exhibit greater differences in splicing than those from older radiations. Most of these differentially spliced isoforms arose from standing variation, which was also present at low levels in non-radiating species, and increased in frequency during the adaptive radiation process. We identified several novel isoforms of craniofacial remodelling genes that emerged within each lake radiation and were differentially incorporated in the jaws of herbivorous vs. carnivorous species. Our findings indicate that a complex temporal interplay of GE and AS underlies adaptive radiation, with ancestral splice variation enabling rapid ecological diversification at early stages of speciation."
"Accurate detection of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes is essential for the surveillance, epidemiology and genotypic prediction of AMR. This is typically done by generating an assembly from the sequencing reads of a bacterial isolate and running AMR gene detection tools on the assembly. However, despite advances in long-read sequencing that have greatly improved the quality and completeness of bacterial genome assemblies, assembly tools remain prone to large-scale errors caused by repeats in the genome, leading to inaccurate detection of AMR gene content and consequent impact on resistance prediction. In this work we present Amira, a tool to detect AMR genes directly from unassembled long-read sequencing data. Amira leverages the fact that multiple consecutive genes lie within a single read to construct gene-space de Bruijn graphs where the k-mer alphabet is the set of genes in the pan-genome of the species under study. Through this approach, the reads corresponding to different copies of AMR genes can be effectively separated based on the genomic context of the AMR genes, and used to infer the nucleotide sequence of each copy. Amira achieves significant improvements in genomic copy number recall and nucleotide accuracy, demonstrated through objective simulations and comparison with alternative read and assembly-based methods on samples with manually curated truth assemblies. Applied to a dataset of 32 Escherichia coli samples with diverse AMR gene content, Amira achieves a mean genomic-copy-number recall of 98.4% with precision 97.9% and nucleotide accuracy 99.9%. Finally, we show that Amira consistently detects more true AMR genes across all E. coli, K. pneumoniae and E. faecium nanopore datasets from the ENA (n=8580, 2448 and 415 respectively) than an assembly-based approach."
"We have reached a point where many bio foundation models exist across 4 different scales, from molecules to molecular chains, cells, and tissues. However, while related in many ways, these models do not yet bridge these scales. We present a framework and architecture called Xpressor that enables cross-scale learning by (1) using a novel cross-attention mechanism to compress high-dimensional gene representations into lower-dimensional cell-state vectors, and (2) implementing a multi-scale fine-tuning approach that allows cell models to leverage and adapt protein-level representations. Using a cell Foundation Model as an example, we demonstrate that our architecture improves model performance across multiple tasks, including cell-type prediction (+12%) and embedding quality (+8%). Together, these advances represent first steps toward models that can understand and bridge different scales of biological organization."
"Cancer heterogeneity is recognized as a major barrier to precise molecular subtype classification. Conventional approaches inadequately leverage the complementary nature of multimodal data, resulting in overfitting when handling high-dimensional omics data and constraining the comprehensive characterization of cancer subtype heterogeneity. To address this, Triad-LMF, a novel multi-omics integration framework, is introduced, leveraging a low-rank multimodal fusion mechanism to improve the Accuracy of cancer subtype classification. Triad-LMF consolidates multi-omics datasets, mitigating feature dimension disparities through optimized preprocessing. To enable efficient multimodal information integration, Triad-LMF implements a two-stage hierarchical fusion strategy, where in Local Pairwise Fusion and Global Triadic Fusion are combined via the Two-Feature and Three-way LMF modules, facilitating a progressive transition from local modality interactions to global feature integration. Experimental results demonstrate that Triad-LMF outperforms traditional machine learning methods and previous published methods in classification performance. UMAP verifies that Global Triadic Fusion significantly enhances the ability to discriminate against subtypes in implicit space representation. We further illustrate the effectiveness of Triad-LMF in making full use of multimodal interactive information. Additionally, SHAP feature importance analysis was adopted for extracting the important features. Moreover, across independent datasets, Triad-LMF demonstrates superior generalization capabilities. Triad-LMF offers an efficient and robust framework for multi-omics-driven cancer subtype classification."
"The evolution of eukaryotic cells necessitated the advent of machinery to transport molecular building blocks for organelles to proliferate. Extant eukaryotes share several classes of highly conserved lipid transfer proteins (LTP) that associate with donor membranes, bind individual lipid molecules, and shuttle them to acceptor membranes. Because cells lacking organelles do not require extensive lipid transport networks, it is not known if this machinery pre-dated eukaryotic organelles or had to evolve alongside them. Here we describe a class of putative lipid transporters in the Asgard archaeota superphylum that share a common ancestry with eukaryotic LTPs in the START domain superfamily. We identified three classes of Asgard START proteins, StarAsg1-3, which are conserved across most Asgard phyla. Of these, StarAsg1 family proteins contain the predicted structural features necessary for lipid transfer: large, hydrophobic binding pockets lined with amphipathic motifs for membrane docking. In contrast, StarAsg2 and StarAsg3 family proteins contain smaller binding cavities and minimal predicted membrane interactions. We found that StarAsg1 from Lokiarcheota interacts with anionic membranes both in vitro and in yeast cells and can transfer sterols between liposomes. Phylogenetic analysis of START domains across the tree of life indicates that eukaryotic LTPs share a common ancestry with StarAsg1 homologs, while StarAsg2 and StarAsg3 form a monophyletic group with eukaryotic heat shock protein cochaperones. We propose that the emergence of proteins for inter-membrane lipid transporters in the ancestors of eukaryotic cells could have facilitated the subsequent development of intracellular organelles."
"eIF4G2 (also known as NAT1, p97, or DAP5) is an evolutionally conserved protein homologous to the C-terminal two-thirds portion of eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF) 4G. Despite its abundant and ubiquitous expression, the physiological and pathological functions of eIF4G2 are poorly understood. Here, we show that acute loss of eIF4G2 in adult mice results in rapid weight loss with abnormalities in multiple organs, including impaired maintenance and differentiation of intestinal stem cells. Genome-wide ribosome profiling revealed that eIF4G2 is critical for the translation of key histone modification proteins involved in intestinal stemness. Our study underscores the importance of eIF4G2-mediated translation initiation in multicellular organisms."
"Small intestine neuroendocrine tumor (SI-NET) is typically diagnosed late in life and has several unusual properties, including low proliferation rate, low mutation burden, lack of driver mutations, as well as frequent multifocality, with multiple clonally independent tumors arising within a single intestinal segment. This sets SI-NET aside from other adult cancers and raises questions about the timeline of initiation and progression. Here, we investigate the evolutionary history of multifocal and unifocal SI-NET using whole genome sequencing, obtaining timing information on primary tumors, metastases and key genetic events. Results were validated by re-examination of archival clinical imaging data, allowing longitudinal tracking of individual tumors up to 12 years prior. We show that key molecular events and the establishment of metastatic tumor cell clones can often be traced back to childhood or adolescence in SI-NET. This was supported by historical CT/MR scans, in which metastases were detected at a high degree of consistency and estimated growth rates suggested several additional decades of tumor expansion. Collectively, our data support that slow progression over half a century or more may commonly precede SI-NET diagnosis in late adulthood."
"BackgroundFunctional connectivity (FC) is often used to identify personalized targets for transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). However, existing methods often overlook individual differences in whole-cortex network organization. Furthermore, in some personalized TMS protocols, a lower stimulation intensity is used for targets closer to the scalp. Therefore, near-scalp targets might improve patient tolerance.

ObjectiveWe develop an algorithm to simultaneously optimize FC and scalp proximity for personalized target localization.

MethodsWe use the multi-session hierarchical Bayesian model (MS-HBM) to estimate high-quality individual-specific cortical networks. A tree-based algorithm is then used to select the optimal target location. By essentially having no parameter to tune, our framework might improve generalizability across populations. We compare our approach to existing ""cluster"" and ""cone"" algorithms in terms of scalp proximity, test-retest reliability, and FC to brain regions implicated in depression.

ResultsIn two test-retest datasets of healthy individuals from the United States and Singapore, tree-based MS-HBM reliably identifies personalized TMS targets for depression in close proximity to the scalp. These targets compare favorably with cone and cluster targets in terms of reliability, scalp proximity, and FC to the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex in new out-of-sample MRI sessions from the same individuals. Compared with the cluster algorithm, tree-based MS-HBM targets hypothetically reduce stimulation intensity by 12% using a linear intensity adjustment protocol. To demonstrate versatility, we apply the same algorithm, without having to tune any parameter, to identify personalized TMS targets for anxiety.

ConclusionThe tree-based MS-HBM algorithm provides a robust, generalizable framework to estimate near-scalp personalized targets across different populations."
"Apoptosis plays a central role in shaping tissues and preserving cellular integrity across developmental stages. In the germline, its precise regulation is critical to ensure both the elimination of aberrant cells and the maintenance of reproductive capacity. However, the molecular mechanisms that control apoptotic susceptibility in germline cells remain poorly defined. Here, we identify stand still (stil) as a female germline-specific regulator of apoptosis in Drosophila. Loss of stil leads to near-complete depletion of germline cells at the time of eclosion, associated with upregulation of the pro-apoptotic gene reaper (rpr) and activation of caspase-dependent cell death. Reporter assays in S2 cells show that Stil directly represses rpr transcription through its N-terminal BED-type zinc finger domain. Despite the absence of stil, undifferentiated germline cells remain resistant to apoptosis. Analysis of publicly available chromatin data reveals that the rpr locus in these cells resides in a closed, H3K9me3-enriched chromatin state, suggesting a Stil-independent mode of transcriptional silencing. Together, our findings uncover two distinct mechanisms that protects the female germline from rpr-dependent apoptosis: Stil-mediated transcriptional repression that operates in both undifferentiated and differentiated germline cells, and an additional chromatin-based silencing mechanism that functions specifically in undifferentiated cells. This work provides new insights into the interplay between transcriptional and chromatin-based regulations that maintain germline cell identity and survival."
"There is little understanding of how aging serves as the strongest risk factor for several neurogenerative diseases. Specific neural cell types, such as microglia, undergo age-related maladaptive changes, including increased inflammation, impaired debris clearance, and cellular senescence, yet specific mediators that regulate these processes remain unclear. The aged brain is rejuvenated by youth-associated plasma factors, including tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 2 (TIMP2), which we have shown acts on the extracellular matrix (ECM) to regulate synaptic plasticity. Given emerging roles for microglia in these processes, we examined the impact of TIMP2 on microglial function. We show that TIMP2 deletion exacerbates microglial phenotypes associated with aging, including transcriptomic changes in cell activation, increased microgliosis, and increased levels of stress and inflammatory proteins measured in the brain extracellular space by in vivo microdialysis. Deleting specific cellular pools of TIMP2 in vivo increased microglial activation and altered myelin phagocytosis. Treating aged mice with TIMP2 reversed several phenotypes observed in our deletion models, resulting in decreased microglial activation, reduced proportions of proinflammatory microglia, and enhanced phagocytosis of physiological substrates. Our results identify TIMP2 as a key modulator of age-associated microglia dysfunction. Harnessing its activity may mitigate detrimental effects of age-associated insults on microglia function."
"Growing evidence suggests that the gut microbiota plays a key role in shaping life history in a wide range of species, including well-studied model organisms like Drosophila melanogaster. Although recent studies have explored the relationship between gut microbiota and female life history, the link between gut microbiota and male life history remains understudied. In this study, we explored the role of gut microbiota in shaping male life history traits by correlating variation in life history traits across genetically homogeneous isolines with their naturally occurring gut microbiota. Using 22 isolines from the Drosophila melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP), we measured lifespan, early/late-life reproduction, and early/late-life physiological performance. We characterized the gut microbiota composition in young (5 days old) and old (26 days old) flies using 16S rDNA sequencing. We observed significant variation in male life history traits across isolines, as well as age-related changes in gut microbiota composition. Using machine learning, we showed that gut microbiota composition could predict the age of the organisms with high accuracy. Associations between gut microbiota and life history traits were notable, particularly involving the Acetobacter genus. In early life, the abundance of Acetobacter ascendens was associated with functional aging, while Acetobacter indonesiensis was linked to reproductive senescence. In late life, higher abundances of A. ascendens and Acetobacter pasteurianus were negatively associated with lifespan. These findings highlight the potential role of gut microbiota, especially the Acetobacter genus, in male fitness and aging."
"The in vitro manufacturing of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived platelets (iPSC-platelets) remains limited by low yield and poor quality, thus impeding practical clinical application. To address this, we developed a turbulence-assisted system using defined physical stimulation to enhance platelet production from immortalized megakaryocyte progenitor cell lines (imMKCLs). This approach significantly increases the yield of glycoprotein Ib (GPIb) functional iPSC-platelets. However, the underlying mechanisms remained unclear. Here, we reveal that GPIb iPSC-platelets retain high mitochondrial membrane potential, low phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure, and active ATP-dependent flippases, preserving mitochondrial integrity and platelet functionality. In contrast, GPIb- platelets exhibit PS exposure, ADAM17 activation, and selective GPIb shedding. Notably, turbulent flow induces late-stage actin depolymerization, promoting even mitochondrial distribution within maturing imMKCLs and enhancing mitochondrial inheritance to iPSC-platelets. These findings highlight the key role of turbulence in regulating actin dynamics and mitochondrial allocation during platelet biogenesis, providing a mechanistic foundation for improving in vitro platelet production for therapeutic use."
"Studies of brain-behaviour relationships in hippocampal amnesia largely ignore the presence and explanatory potential of knock-on effects beyond the medial temporal lobes. In a large cohort of patients (n=38) with hippocampal damage due to autoimmune limbic encephalitis, we had reported evidence that extra-hippocampal structural and functional abnormalities in the broader ""hippocampal-diencephalic-cingulate network"" fully mediated the effects of hippocampal damage on several aspects of episodic memory. However, we had not examined the specific diencephalic nuclei affected or the white matter pathways that would help explain these remote effects. In this study, we used recently developed methods of automated segmentation of diencephalic nuclei, as well as a range of analyses of white matter integrity. As expected, we found atrophy in the anterior thalamic nuclei and in the mammillary bodies, but also in the laterodorsal, pulvinar, and dorsomedial nuclei. The extent of atrophy in some of these nuclei was comparable to, if not larger than that observed for the hippocampal formation, even though none of our patients acute clinical scans disclosed thalamic damage. We also present evidence linking these volumes to patients episodic memory impairment over and above any correlation with hippocampal/subicular subfield volumes. White matter integrity was strongly compromised in the hippocampal-diencephalic-cingulate network, and the volumetric relationship between the hippocampal formation and the mammillary bodies was at least partly mediated by the integrity of the fornix across patients, consistent with the assumption of Wallerian degeneration following focal medial temporal lobe damage. However, evidence for the specialisation of the ""hippocampal-diencephalic-cingulate network"" in recollection/recall was mixed, and white matter abnormalities extended to regions well beyond this network. Our findings highlight the need to longitudinally examine diencephalic and white matter integrity in cohorts of hippocampal damage with different aetiologies and update neuroanatomical models of this network."
"Humans are distinguished from our closest living relatives, other great apes, by our extended postmenopausal longevity, later first births, and shorter birth intervals. Those features likely evolved as ancestral grandmothers foraging subsidised dependents in habitats lacking foods that youngsters could manage for themselves. If so, as female post-fertile years increased, older years increased in males too. Those still-fertile old males in the paternity competition pushed average male reproductive success below the female average. According to R. A. Fisher, Mendelian inheritance requires equal contributions from both sexes to descendant gene pools. Higher average reproductive success in one sex makes tendencies to overproduce it pass to more grandchildren, equalizing averages in descendant generations. Yet, mens lower average reproductive success persists, their fertility lasting decades longer than womens. Here, we present a simple mathematical model to investigate this phenomenon. We show that a male-biased adult sex ratio is consistent with an offspring sex ratio of 1:1. Assuming a stable age distribution, we show that if male fertile careers are twice as long as those of females, the corresponding reproductive value of males is larger than that of females, which acts to balance the effect of higher female reproductive success. We propose that extended male fertility balances the sex difference in average reproductive success, maintaining Fishers equilibrium under human life history conditions."
"The intrinsic dynamic asymmetry between homologous PDZ domains in multidomain scaffold proteins offers critical insights into evolutionary mechanisms enabling multivalent partner recognition. Through systematic X-ray crystallographic analysis of human syntenin-1's PDZ1-PDZ2 tandem, we resolve nine high-resolution structures that uncover fundamental differences in conformational plasticity between these sequentially similar domains. Pairwise root-mean-squared deviation (RMSD) analysis of 20 PDZ1 structures across multiple crystal forms reveals substantial structural variability concentrated in the Lys119-Ile125 and Ala181-Glu184 loops - key regions governing ligand specificity within PDZ1's binding cleft. In stark contrast, PDZ2 maintains remarkable structural conservation across all crystallographic environments, indicating divergent evolutionary constraints on these tandem domains. Crucially, comparative analysis of isotropic B-factors demonstrates their inadequacy in capturing the full scope of conformational heterogeneity, emphasizing the necessity of multi-structure comparisons for mapping dynamic landscapes. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations implemented through GROMACS corroborate these crystallographic observations, showing elevated residue-specific fluctuation (RMSF) values in PDZ1's ligand-binding interface compared to analogous PDZ2 regions. This consistency across experimental and computational approaches confirms that PDZ1's conformational diversity represents an inherent biophysical property rather than crystallographic artifact. The observed dynamic asymmetry suggests a functional division of labor: PDZ1's structural plasticity enables broad ligand recognition via conformational selection mechanisms, while PDZ2's rigid architecture likely stabilizes the tandem domain arrangement. These findings provide an atomic-level rationale for syntenin-1's pleiotropic roles in cellular signaling and establish a structural blueprint for developing domain-selective therapeutics. Given syntenin-1's clinical relevance in cancer metastasis, viral pathogenesis, and neurodevelopmental disorders, our work advances strategies for selectively modulating PDZ1-mediated interactions while preserving PDZ2's scaffolding functions through structure-guided inhibitor design."
"Epigenetic clocks based on DNA methylation provide robust biomarkers of biological age, yet the mechanistic basis and functional significance of slowing these clocks remain unclear. Progress has been limited by the lack of short-lived, genetically tractable model organisms with functional DNA methylation systems. The jewel wasp, Nasonia vitripennis, offers a unique solution. It combines a functional DNA methylation system with a short lifespan and established tools for experimental manipulation. We previously developed an epigenetic clock in Nasonia, but whether this clock reflects plastic, environmentally driven ageing processes was unknown. Here, we test this directly by experimentally inducing larval diapause, a naturally occurring developmental arrest triggered by environmental cues. Diapause extended median adult lifespan by 36% and significantly slowed the rate of epigenetic ageing. Using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing across multiple adult timepoints, we show that while diapaused adults initially emerge epigenetically older, their subsequent epigenetic ageing proceeds 29% more slowly than non-diapaused controls. Clock CpGs were enriched for gene ontology terms related to conserved nutrient-sensing and developmental pathways, including insulin/IGF signaling and mTOR, supporting the established mechanistic link between development and epigenetic ageing. These findings demonstrate that epigenetic ageing is plastic and can be experimentally modulated by early-life environment, establishing Nasonia as a tractable system for dissecting the causal mechanisms of epigenetic ageing."
"The 2021 discovery of a divergent lineage (B.1.641) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) from Ontario raised concerns that deer were a potential reservoir. To assess whether white-tailed deer continued to be infected with B.1.641 and to test for spillover into other species, we established a surveillance program in Ontario by sampling wildlife via existing monitoring programs and through active surveillance of captive and wild animals. Between 2022 to 2024, we tested 2,839 animals, identifying one active SARS-CoV-2 infection (a likely spillover of a recombinant XBB.2.3.11.3 lineage), but no cases of B.1.641. Overall, 93 animals (6.8%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, including 89 white-tailed deer, two Virginia opossums (Didelphis virginiana), one American mink (Neogale vison), and one river otter (Lontra canadensis). In Southwestern Ontario, where B.1.641 was originally detected, 15.2% of deer samples were seropositive. Generalized Linear Models demonstrated that seropositive deer were more likely to be found in areas with a higher fall deer harvest and human population density, and closer to previous B.1.641 cases. Our data suggest that deer-associated B.1.641 may have caused a relatively localized epizootic without forming a stable reservoir. This study underscores the importance of One Health-focused surveillance."
"Exposure to progesterone is a recognized risk factor for breast cancer, and PGR polymorphisms are associated with various malignancies. Two progesterone receptor (PR) isoforms, full length PR-B and truncated PR-A, are expressed from the PGR gene in breast tissue and play crucial roles in normal physiology and breast cancer progression. An imbalance in the expression ratio of these isoforms, favoring increased levels of PR-A, is common in breast cancer and is associated with resistance to tamoxifen in luminal A-type tumors. Notably, PRs have recently been implicated in promoting endocrine resistance and driving the expansion of cancer stem-like cell (CSC) populations. Despite this insight, the isoform-specific molecular and epigenetic mechanisms underlying PR action in estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancers remain understudied. Phenotypic studies of T47D cell lines that express exclusively PR-A or PR-B showed that PR isoforms regulate divergent cell fates. PR-B-expressing cells have a higher proliferation rate, while PR-A-expressing cells produce more mammospheres. We profiled progesterone-driven gene expression in cells grown in both adherent (2D) and mammosphere (3D) growth conditions and found differential gene regulation by PR-A and PR-B that is consistent with the observed divergent phenotypes. Only the PR-A-driven gene signature of ER+ breast cancer cells maintained as non-adherent mammospheres robustly predicted poor clinical outcome in the METABRIC data set. We then performed CUT&RUN to identify the genomic binding patterns unique to each PR isoform and their suite of target genes. Our findings indicate that PR-A acts as a regulator of the cell cycle, while PR-B plays a pivotal role in metabolism and intracellular signaling. Our genomic profiling of PRs in this model system has unveiled novel isoform-specific functions of PR. This work has shifted our prior understanding of the role of PRs in gene regulation, offering potential insights for therapeutic interventions in ER+ breast cancer."
"MotivationGenome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous noncoding variants associated with complex human diseases, disorders, and traits. However, resolving the uncertainty between GWAS association and causality remains a significant challenge. The small subset of noncoding GWAS variants with causative effects on gene regulatory elements can only be detected through accurate methods that assess the impact of DNA sequence variation on gene regulatory activity. Deep learning models, such as those based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transformers, have gained prominence in predicting the regulatory effects of genetic variants, particularly in enhancers, by learning patterns from genomic and epigenomic data. Despite their potential, selecting the most suitable model is hindered by the lack of standardized benchmarks, consistent training conditions, and performance evaluation criteria in existing reviews.

ResultsThis study evaluates state-of-the-art deep learning models for predicting the effects of genetic variants on enhancer activity using nine datasets stemming from MPRA, raQTL, and eQTL experiments, profiling the regulatory impact of 54,859 SNPs across four human cell lines. The results reveal that CNN models, such as TREDNet and SEI, consistently outperform other architectures in predicting the regulatory impact of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). However, hybrid CNN-transformer models, such as Borzoi, display superior performance in identifying causal SNPs within a linkage disequilibrium block. While fine-tuning enhances the performance of transformer-based models, it remains insufficient to surpass CNN and hybrid models when evaluated under optimized conditions."
"BackgroundThe Hyrcanian Forests of Iran, a unique 850 km stretch of deciduous forest along the southern coast of the Caspian Sea, are renowned for their exceptional biodiversity, high levels of endemism and ecological integrity. The northern part of this forest massif is part of the Caucasian Biodiversity Hotspot, while its southern fringe extends into the Iranian-Anatolian Hotspot. The recognition of these forests as a UNESCO World Heritage Site has focused global attention on their protection, primarily from human disturbance. While the diversity of vascular plants is well documented, other groups, such as soil-dwelling arthropods, remain underexplored. This study aims to fill this knowledge gap by conducting inventories in different sections of the Hyrcanian forests, with a focus on Collembola, a potentially diverse but understudied group of soil fauna. The study was conducted to answer the following questions: Is the naturalness and degree of conservation of these forests reflected in the biodiversity of springtail communities? To what extent does the composition and diversity of these communities vary between different sites and micro-habitats within these forests?

MethodsTo answer these questions, 89 samples were collected over a two-year period from three different forest sites that had undergone contrasting forest management. Specifically, the study focused on three forest ecosystems, a preserved anthropized (planted) forest (PAF), a preserved natural forest (PNF) and a non-preserved natural forest (NPF), all located in the Bula protected area. Three types of microhabitats were sampled at each site, including moss, litter and dead wood. The springtails collected were identified and counted (approximately 3,000 individuals in total), allowing various biodiversity indices to be calculated for the communities as a whole, as well as by site and microhabitat. Soil samples were also analysed to compare soil properties between the three sites.

ResultsThe results reveal an impressive diversity of springtails, with 73 morphospecies identified, belonging to 39 genera and 12 families. Of these, 49 could be identified to species level. The estimated total species richness ranged from 80 to 110 species. The analyses also revealed significant differences in species richness between sites, with two preserved sites (PAF and PNF) having a greater number of species compared to the non-preserved site (NPF), and in habitats, with greater diversity observed in dead wood, followed by soil and then mosses. A more detailed analysis of the communities showed a high degree of interspecific diversity in terms of abundance and distribution, without revealing strong patterns of ecological specialization for the majority of species. An analysis of cooccurrences showed that, in most cases species interactions appeared to be neutral. However, some pairs of species showed positive associations, while negative interactions were more marginal. The results of the soil properties showed no differences between the sites and no effect on the Collembola community.

DiscussionThe Bula Forest host particularly diverse Collembola communities. The results underline the importance of conserving these environments, which harbours a high diversity of springtails. Additionally, the results highlight the crucial role of dead wood as a substrate in supporting this biodiversity. The results also call for a more in-depth investigation of the factors influencing the presence, absence and abundance of species, as well as an exploration of the underlying causes of positive or negative species covariation."

"Stem cell models can provide insights into human brain development at embryonic stages which are normally inaccessible. We previously developed the Microfluidic Stem Cell Regionalisation (MiSTR) model, which recapitulates the rostro-caudal patterning of human neural tube through a WNT activation (WNTa) gradient. Through temporal single cell transcriptomics of rostro-caudal and dorso-ventral gradient-patterned MiSTR, we found that rostro-caudal subtypes were regionally specified and fate-determined already during the late epiblast stage, several days before onset of neuralisation at day 3-4. Rostral cells were characterised by expression of HESX1 and SHISA2 during pre-neuralisation and PAX6 during early neuralisation, whereas caudal cells expressed FST and HOXA1 during pre-neuralisation and SOX1 as the dominant neuralising factor. In contrast to the early rostro-caudal specification, response to ventralisation in telencephalic progenitors was developmentally delayed and occurred around day 9. We further uncovered temporal events in human midbrain-hindbrain boundary formation and ventral forebrain patterning, contributing new knowledge on early human neural region-specification."
"MotivationHighly mutable viruses continuously evolve, with some posing major pandemic risks. However, standardized neutralization assays and up-to-date viral panels are often lacking, limiting evaluation of immunogens and identification of broadly neutralizing antibodies. Closing these gaps is essential for guiding effective countermeasure development.

ResultsIn this study, we present Viral Protein Panel Design (VIProDesign), a computational tool for designing viral protein panels that address the high sequence diversity of rapidly evolving viruses. VIProDesign uses the Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM) algorithm to select representative strains and applies the elbow-point method based on cumulative Shannon entropy to balance diversity and panel size. We used VIProDesign to generate optimized panels for Betacoronavirus, human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), Influenza virus, Norovirus, and Lassa virus. The tool also supports customizable panel sizes, making it suitable for both resource-limited contexts and early-stage research. This flexible approach streamlines viral panel design across diverse pathogens. Although VIProDesign was originally developed for viral proteins, its underlying framework is broadly applicable to the selection of representative protein panels across diverse taxa, including bacterial species, toxins, and other biologically relevant protein families."
"Seckel syndrome and MCPH are single gene neurodevelopmental disorders with or without dwarfism. The genes are parts of essential cellular pathways but are regulated differently in both forms of microcephaly. These genes have diverged from single ancestral genes in to related but different gene paralogues during evolution. It is suggested that the paralogues might be redundant in other body organs and might rescue any abnormality in case of MCPH but not in Seckel syndrome. The study uncovers the spatio-temporal dynamics of these genes together with their paralogues at mRNA level where the different tissues of embryos might exhibit different transcript variants or different levels of the various transcript variants to find the complementation in case of the MCPH but divergence in case of the Seckel syndrome. Here, we studied Cdk5Rap2-Pde4dip, Phc1-Phc3 (for MCPH) and Cep63-Ccdc67 (for Seckel) in the embryonic mice tissues via RT-PCR throughout the peak of neurogenesis from E12.5 to E18.5. We found already known spatio-temporal differential expression. For MCPH, Cdk5Rap2-Pde4dip had similar profiles and seemed to be redundant whereas Phc1-Phc3 seem to have complementary roles in brain development. The expression profiles of Cep63-Ccdc67 were very different indicative of their diverged roles in development.

Summary StatementThe reverse transcription and relative quantitation in spatio-temporal embryonic mice tissues suggest, the paralogues in MCPH (primary microcephaly, PM) can rescue other organs but Seckel (PM with dwarfism) paralogues cant."
"The dynamics of calcium ions (Ca2+) in skeletal muscles link electrochemical activation and contractile force generation. An improved quantitative understanding of the mechanisms by which Ca2+ dynamics modulate force production is crucial for optimizing muscle performance. Recent experimental data suggest that store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE), the process of extracellular Ca2+ influx upon depletion of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), helps delay the onset of muscle fatigue. However, the mechanistic links between SOCE and sustained force generation in muscle remain unclear. We hypothesize that SOCE regulates force generation during sustained muscle activity by allowing for increased Ca2+ release from the SR. We test this hypothesis with a quantitative biophysical model that simulates the biochemical events of muscle contraction, from initial depolarization at the sarcolemma and T-tubules to Ca2+ release from the SR to Ca2+ binding and force generation throughout the myoplasm. We also consider the balance between Ca2+ removal from the myoplasm and SOCE through the T-tubule membrane. We estimate the free parameters in the model by fitting them to experiments that measured sarcolemma membrane voltage and myoplasmic Ca2+ transients in single muscle fibers in vitro. We then test the effects of SOCE inhibition on Ca2+ dynamics and force production and find that the magnitude of myoplasmic Ca2+ and force are lower than in wild-type cells over repetitive stimuli. Finally, we predict the effects of varying the degree of SOCE inhibition during patterns of stimulus chosen to mimic those observed during resistance exercise or high-intensity interval training. These simulations predict a context-dependent relationship between force generation and SOCE, wherein increased SOCE is associated with greater force production during resistance exercise, but worsens the effects of fatigue in certain cases of high-intensity training."
"PDCD1 (Programmed cell death protein 1) is an immune checkpoint that inhibits the excessive response of antigen-activated T cells to prevent autoimmune tissue damage. In chronic infections or cancers, lasting antigen exposure leads to permanent PDCD1 expression that can limit immune-mediated clearance of pathogens or degenerated cells. Consequently, blocking PDCD1 can enhance T cell function, which is the basis of cancer immune checkpoint therapy. We found that PDCD1 expression can increase within hours of temperature elevation in human leukemic and lymphoblastoid cell lines (such as Jurkat, THP1, HL-60, GM07062, and NK-92) and mouse lymphoid organs (e.g., thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes). Transcriptional upregulation of the PDCD1 gene was associated with the binding of heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) to the promoter, and HSF1 knockout in HL-60 cells resulted in reduced PDCD1 activation. Furthermore, a heat shock-dependent increase in glycosylated (and therefore active) PDCD1 protein levels was associated with PDCD1 exposure on the cell membrane and a reduction in the cytotoxic properties of NK-92 cells. Our observations suggest that the immune response could be attenuated in various physiological conditions accompanied by increased temperatures (infection, heat stroke, etc.). This observation may have clinical implications, and therefore, further research is warranted to understand the importance of fever and PDCD1 in various disease states, as well as their interaction with treatment."
"CRISPR-Cas9-based gene editing is a powerful approach to developing gene and cell therapies for several diseases. Engineering cell therapies requires accurate assessment of gene editing allelism because editing patterns can vary across cells leading to genotypic heterogeneity. This can hinder development of robust cell therapies. Droplet-based targeted single-cell DNA sequencing (scDNAseq) has been used to genotype targeted loci across thousands of cells enabling high-throughput assessment of gene editing efficiency. Here, we constructed a ""ground truth"" gene editing single-cell DNAseq atlas, along with an artifact-aware computational workflow called GUMM (Genotyping Using Mixture Models) to systematically infer single-cell allelism from these data. This resource was created by expanding CRISPR-Cas9-edited HL-60 clones that harbored distinct insertion-deletion (indel) profiles in CLEC12A and mixing them at pre-defined ratios to create artificial cocktails that mimic the potential editing diversity of a CRISPR-Cas9 experiment. This enabled assessment of technical artifacts that confound interpretation of allelism in the readouts of gene edited cells. GUMM was able to accurately genotype cells and infer the original clonal composition of the artificial cocktails even in the presence of artifacts."
"Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging (FLI) is a technique recording the temporal decay of fluorescence emission at every pixel of an image. Analyzing the information embedded in FLI dataset requires either fitting the decay to a predefined model using nonlinear least-square fit or maximum likelihood estimation, or projecting the decay on an orthogonal basis of periodic functions as in phasor analysis. AlliGator is a Windows open source software (BSD license) implementing these approaches in a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) and offering numerous unique features such as F\""{o}rster Resonant Energy Transfer (FRET) stoichiometry analysis, or the creation of maps of lifetime-derived quantities such as membrane potential. It leverages the unique ability of the LabVIEW graphical programming language (G) to design feature-rich GUI, and supports user-developed plugins written in Python to extend its native capabilities."
"AimThis study systematically investigates the radiobiological effects of Very High Energy Electrons (VHEE) generated by a laser-plasma accelerator (LPA), in comparison with Conventional Intermediate Energy Electrons (CIEE) from a conventional linear accelerator (LINAC). Using in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo models, we evaluate and compare their potential toxicity on healthy tissues.

MethodsCell survival, tissue response, and developmental toxicity were assessed across three biological models. In vitro, human fibroblasts (MRC5-hTERT) were used to generate post-irradiation survival curves. Ex vivo, precision-cut lung slices (PCLS) from mice were analyzed for radiation-induced inhibition of cell proliferation. In vivo, zebrafish embryos were used to evaluate developmental toxicity through body length and spinal curvature measurements. VHEE irradiations were performed at 50 MeV using the Salle Jaune LPA (Laboratoire dOptique Appliquee, France), while CIEE exposures were performed with a 7 MeV conventional LINAC (Institut Curie, France).

ResultsIn vitro, MRC5-hTERT cells showed no significant difference in radiosensitivity between VHEE and CIEE, with comparable D10 values (p-value = 0.7). In the ex vivo model, both beams induced a dose-dependent decrease in cell division with no significant inter-beam differences at any dose level (p-value > 0.99). In vivo, zebrafish embryos exhibited dose-dependent body shortening and increased spinal curvature following both VHEE and CIEE exposure. No significant differences were observed between the two modalities at matched doses for any measured metric (p-value[&ge;] 0.5).

ConclusionThis study presents the first comprehensive radiobiological evaluation of a laser-driven VHEE beam across 1 multiple biological models. The results demonstrate that VHEE and CIEE irradiations exhibit similar biological toxicity. These findings support the feasibility and potential of VHEE generated with LPA for future clinical applications."
"Chronic low back pain, frequently associated with intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration, is highly prevalent in individuals with Alzheimers disease (AD), and the pain intensity is highly correlated with the degree of cognitive impairment. While the incidences of both afflictions increase dramatically in the elderly population, it is unknown whether AD exacerbates the health of the IVD. Utilizing one-year-old male and female 5xFAD mice that constitutively express human APP and PSEN1 transgenes with five AD-linked mutations, we measured the lumbar IVDs extracellular matrix composition, the three-dimensional structure, histopathological degeneration, and mechanical behavior. The collagen, glycosaminoglycans, and advanced glycation end-products content of the IVD were not appreciably different between the 5xFAD animals and their wild-type littermates. Likewise, the 5xFAD IVDs were not histopathologically degenerated. However, the IVD volume, measured by contrast-enhanced microCT, was larger in the 5xFAD animals. Furthermore, dynamic microcompression revealed that 5xFAD IVDs exhibited higher loss tangent, indicating altered tissue damping and fluid-flow dynamics within the disc. These results suggest that although the IVDs of mice with AD are not more degenerated, they may be more susceptible to damage accumulation due to the elevated absorption of energy. Elderly individuals with AD may thus be more prone to IVD injuries that lead to eventual degeneration and spinal pain. Future work will focus on defining the molecular mechanisms and the consequences of these mechanical and structural changes in the IVD and their consequences to low back pain in individuals with AD."
"The neuroprotective transfer of mitochondria from astrocytes to neurons has been primarily investigated by labelling astrocytic mitochondria with the dye MitoTracker. Here we report that MitoTracker transfers to neurons from both astrocytes and astrocyte-conditioned media, independently of mitochondrial transfer. Our observations should prompt an essential re-evaluation of the literature concerning astrocyte-neuron mitochondrial transfer and in other systems in which contact-independent transfer has been observed using mitochondrial dyes."
"Parameter inference is a critical step in the process of interpreting biological data using mathematical models. Inference provides a means of deriving quantitative, mechanistic insights from sparse, noisy data. While methods for parameter inference, parameter identifiability, and model prediction are well-developed for deterministic continuum models, working with biological applications often requires stochastic modelling approaches to capture inherent variability and randomness that can be prominent in biological measurements and data. Random walk models are especially useful for capturing spatiotemporal processes, such as ecological population dynamics, molecular transport phenomena, and collective behaviour associated with multicellular phenomena. This article focuses on parameter inference, identifiability analysis, and model prediction for a suite of biologically-inspired random walk models. With a particular emphasis on model prediction, we highlight roles for numerical optimisation and automatic differentiation. Open-source Julia code is provided to support scientific reproducibility. We encourage readers to use this code directly or adapt it to suit their interests and applications."

"MgtE channels play crucial roles in Mg2+ homeostasis and are implicated in bacterial survival under antibiotic exposure. Previous structural and biophysical studies have predominantly focused on the Thermus thermophilus MgtE, leaving the structural and mechanistic diversity of MgtE family proteins largely unexplored. In this study, using a genome mining approach, we identified diverse MgtE homologs, including a novel subclass termed the mini-N type, which lacks the canonical cytoplasmic N and CBS domains but possesses a unique small N-like domain. Despite extensive expression screening, mini-N type homologs could not be stably purified. To address this issue, we designed a series of de novo proteins and determined their crystal structures. A selected de novo protein was fused to a mini-N type MgtE, enabling successful purification and preliminary cryo-EM imaging. Our findings demonstrate that de novo designed protein fusions can serve as powerful tools for stabilizing and purifying otherwise unstable membrane proteins, opening new avenues for the structural and functional studies of otherwise inaccessible membrane proteins."
"Synaptic plasticity is the basis of learning and memory, but the link between synaptic changes and neural function remains elusive. Here, we used automated search algorithms to obtain thousands of strikingly diverse quadruplets of excitatory(E)-to-E, E-to-inhibitory(I), IE, and II plasticity rules, cooperating to stabilize recurrent spiking networks. Despite the fact that quadruplets were selected for homeostasis, more than 90% of them performed well in simple and more difficult memory tasks such as novelty detection, contextual novelty and sequence replay. Co-activity was crucial, i.e., most rules failed in isolation. Our purely local, unsupervised plasticity rules could also help solve computer games such as pong. Our work showcases automated discovery augmenting human intuition to find en masse solutions for high dimensional problems."
"Mutations in the GBA gene, which reduce {beta}-glucocerebrosidase (GCase) activity, represent the most significant genetic risk factor for Parkinsons disease (PD). Decreased GCase activity has also been observed in sporadic PD cases, supporting a broader role for GCase in the poorly understood mechanisms underlying PD etiopathogenesis. While most studies on the relationship between GBA mutations and PD have focused on neurons, evidence suggests that PD pathology promoted by GCase deficiency involves other cell types and, in particular, interactions between neuronal and glial cells.

Here, we identify microglia as primary players undergoing significant alterations at early stages of the pathological processes triggered by a GCase impairment. Using both pharmacological and genetic mouse models of GCase deficiency, we observed microglial morphological, transcriptional and metabolic changes. Interestingly, these changes were associated with a cell-specific, significant reduction of microglial ATP levels. When microglial ATP depletion was reproduced in an in vitro system of co-cultured microglial and neuronal cells, the neuroprotective properties of microglia were compromised and neuronal susceptibility to oxidative stress was enhanced.

These findings underscore the role of microglia in PD pathogenesis and point to a pathogenetic mechanism by which microglial metabolic disturbances leading to ATP depletion enhance neuronal vulnerability to injury and neurodegeneration. This mechanism could be targeted for therapeutic intervention aimed at mitigating PD risk and counteracting the development of PD pathology.

"Infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus are closely linked to its ability to secure essential nutrients, including iron, which is extracted from the heme of human hemoglobin (Hb) through the iron-regulated surface determinant (Isd) system. The compound 4-[[2-[[5- (1H-indol-3-yl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl]sulfanyl]acetyl]amino]benzoate (C35) was recently identified as a new potential antimicrobial agent for its ability to bind Hb and hamper its interaction with the staphylococcal hemophore IsdB in vitro. Here, we show that C35 inhibits S. aureus growth by specifically targeting the hemophore-driven iron acquisition system. Our findings confirm both the potential of C35 as a first-in-class protein-protein interaction inhibitor with antimicrobial activity, and the effectiveness of targeting hemophores as a strategy to inhibit S. aureus growth. To gain information for drug discovery purposes, the X-ray structure of Hb in the presence of the compound was solved. Unexpectedly, we discovered that, rather than the predicted binding pose, the molecule binds to tetrameric Hb in a cleft between the alpha subunits, stabilizing an R2 relaxed Hb conformation. This triggered further investigation of the effect of C35 on Hb functional properties, which showed a pronounced left-shift activity on oxygen binding curve (i.e., it strongly increases the Hb oxygen affinity). These results highlight C35 as a promising dual-acting compound with both antimicrobial activity and the ability to modulate Hb function through non-covalent stabilization of a high-affinity state.

Author SummaryStaphylococcus aureus is a dangerous bacterium that can cause severe infections in humans. To grow and survive it needs iron, which it steals from our red blood cells by taking it from hemoglobin, the protein that carries oxygen in the blood. In this study, we focused on a small molecule, called C35, that blocks the interaction between hemoglobin and a key bacterial protein involved in heme acquisition. We found that C35 strongly inhibits the growth of S. aureus when hemoglobin is the only available source of iron, showing a potential new method to starve the pathogen and consequently fight the infection. Surprisingly, we also found that C35 increases the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen. This dual action makes C35 a unique molecule for future therapeutic development, with potential applications both as a new antimicrobial agent and in the treatment of diseases related to hemoglobin function."
"Local translation at specific subcellular regions is proposed to define appropriate protein destinations and functions. However, our understanding of local translation is still far from complete, due to a lack of versatile analysis tools. Here, we developed a new method, termed ""APEX-Ribo-Seq"", that integrates ribosome profiling (Ribo-Seq) with APEX2-based proximity labeling. We mapped local translation at 14 distinct organelles and identified over 3000 genes that are locally translated. Interpretable machine learning methods based on RNA language models systematically uncovered RNA-binding proteins with key roles in compartment-specific translation. In addition, we revealed slow translation kinetics associated with cotranslational membrane insertion of nascent chains. APEX-Ribo-Seq also captured cell cycle-regulated dynamics at the centrosome and stress-regulated programs at stress granules and autophagosomes. We also demonstrated the utility of APEX-Ribo-Seq in primary neurons, revealing compartment-specific translatomes in dendrites, axons, and presynapses. Our results provide a comprehensive view of the spatiotemporal translatome and its regulation."
"Humans can extract numerosity from different senses and a variety of context. How and where the brain abstract numerical information from low-level sensory inputs remains debated. Using multivariate pattern decoding and representational similarity analysis applied to fMRI data, we comprehensively investigate how the brain represents numerical information (range 2-5) across different modalities (auditory, visual) and presentation formats (sequential, simultaneous; symbolic, non-symbolic). We identify a set of brain regions along the dorsal pathway-from early visual cortex to the intraparietal and frontal regions-that encode specific non-symbolic numerical information across formats and modalities. The numerical distance effect, a hallmark of magnitude encoding, was observed in most of these regions. We found aligned representation of numerical information across visual and auditory modalities in intraparietal and frontal regions, but only when they shared a sequential presentation format. Maintaining a distinction between spatial and temporal numerical representations may thus be a fundamental aspect of numerical processing. RSA further revealed a posterior-to-anterior gradient in the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) showing that the dominant factors influencing distributed numerical representations shifted from sensory modality in the posterior parietal regions to presentation format in the anterior parietal areas. Our study reveals a multifaceted brain representation of numerosity across the senses and presentation formats."
"O_LIWe investigated the potential of wood anatomical traits to improve the reconstruction of masting events--variable and synchronized patterns of seed production --which are key to understanding tree species responses to current and predicted climate variability. Traditional reliance on tree-ring width as a proxy for reproduction is limited, as growth reductions can also result from drought and other stressors.
C_LIO_LIWe analyzed 12 beech cores from North-East Germany, building a 52-year dataset. A wide range of wood anatomical traits was assessed to disentangle the effects of masting and drought. We used multivariate regression and developed a random forest model to evaluate the predictive power of these traits compared to tree ring width alone.
C_LIO_LIResults suggested a complex mechanism of carbon reallocation towards reproduction, while reflecting a compensatory strategy to maintain hydraulic function and mechanical stability under resource-constrained conditions. Number of parenchyma cells, vessel density, and lignin content estimates emerged as key predictors for masting, outperforming tree-ring width in capturing the reproductive signal.
C_LIO_LIOur findings establish a novel link between wood anatomy and masting events, demonstrating that quantitative wood anatomical traits offer a more accurate and ecologically relevant approach for reconstructing past masting dynamics.

"Selenoproteins incorporate the rare selenium-containing amino acid selenocysteine (Sec) and play crucial roles for redox homeostasis, stress response, and hormone regulation. Sec is inserted by co-translational recoding of the UGA codon, normally a stop. As consequence, selenoproteins are often misannotated in public databases and require specialized bioinformatic methods and resources.

Here, we present a refined characterization of the composition and evolution of the vertebrate selenoproteome. Based on analyses of 19 gene families across hundreds of genomes, we show that extant selenoproteomes were shaped by extensive gene duplications (53), losses (41), and Sec-to-cysteine (Cys) conversions (19). Tetrapods including mammals encode 24-25 selenoproteins, with variations in 6 families. Notably, the same genes underwent convergent evolutionary events in multiple tetrapods, namely Sec-to-Cys substitutions (SELENOU1, GPX6) and gene losses (SELENOV). In contrast, ray-finned fish exhibit larger and more dynamic selenoproteomes, reinforcing the hypothesis that the selective advantage of Sec is stronger in aquatic environments. We detected selenoprotein duplications spread across the actinopterygian clade involving 13 families, mainly involved in antioxidant defense. The richest selenoproteomes were found in Salmoninae and Cyprinoidei fish with 55 and 45 selenoproteins, respectively, owing to whole genome duplications. Among our findings, the SELENOP family stands out in lampreys, carrying up to an unprecedented 162 UGAs putatively recoded to Sec.

Our study presents the most comprehensive evolutionary map of vertebrate selenoproteins to date and delineates the specific selenoproteome of each lineage, establishing a foundational framework for selenium biology research in the era of biodiversity genomics."
"Humans effortlessly relate what they see to what they know, drawing on existing knowledge of objects perceptual, conceptual, and contextual attributes while searching for and recognising objects. While prior studies have investigated the temporal dynamics of perceptual and conceptual object properties in the neural signal, it remains unclear whether and when contextual associations are uniquely represented. In this study, we used representational similarity analysis on electroencephalography (EEG) data to explore how the brain processes the perceptual, conceptual, and contextual dimensions of object knowledge over time. Using human similarity judgments of 190 naturalistic object concepts presented as either as images or words, we constructed separate behavioural models of objects perceptual, conceptual, and contextual properties. We correlated these models with neural patterns from two EEG datasets, one publicly available and one newly collected, both recorded while participants passively viewed the same object stimuli. Across both datasets, we found that perceptual features dominated the early EEG response to object images, while conceptual features emerged later. Contextual associations were also reflected in neural patterns, but their explanatory power largely overlapped with that of conceptual models, suggesting limited unique representation of objects contextual attributes under passive viewing conditions. These results highlight the brains integration of perceptual and conceptual information when processing visual objects. By combining high temporal resolution EEG with behaviourally derived models, this study advances our understanding of how distinct dimensions of object knowledge are encoded in the human brain."
"Nucleic acid-protein interactions are fundamental to many cellular processes, including genome stability and replication, and the regulation of gene expression. They rely on the formation of specific contacts between amino acid and nucleotide residues. Accurate detection and classification of these inter-residue contacts in both experimentally determined structures and computationally predicted models of nucleic acid-protein complexes are crucial for achieving a comprehensive, molecular-level understanding of nucleic acid-protein recognition mechanisms. Here, we present ClaPNAC, a classifier that annotates 3D structures of nucleic acid-protein complexes with pairwise contacts. It distinguishes stacking interactions (involving the faces of nucleobases), pseudo pairs (involving the Watson-Crick, Hoogsteen, or sugar edge of the base), and phosphate and ribose interactions on the nucleoside/nucleotide side, as well as side chain and backbone interactions on the amino acid side. ClaPNAC is based on a geometric approach, extending our previous method ClaRNA and uses a database of pre-classified doublets extracted from experimentally solved RNA-protein complex structures. Unlike other tools that focus on specific chemical interactions such as hydrogen bonds or van der Waals contacts, ClaPNAC relies on the geometry of the interacting residues. It is applicable to both RNA- and DNA-protein complexes, and it can also operate on isolated nucleosides/nucleotides and amino acids. It can be extended to support additional interaction types and higher-order spatial relationships. ClaPNAC constitutes a notable advancement in the characterization of amino acid-nucleotide interactions by providing a comprehensive classification framework that deepens our insight into these fundamental biological processes. Its applicability to 3D structure prediction and validation highlights its value as a resource for researchers in structural biology."
"Uta stansburiana are an emerging model system for studying sexual selection, polymorphism, and the evolution of pace-of-life syndromes (POLS) whose distribution covers variable environments and a wide latitudinal gradient. POLS are suites of traits causing variation of life history along a slow maturing-fast maturing continuum. We present a high-quality chromosome-level reference genome for U. stansburiana and pair it with RNA-seq gene expression data to demonstrate, for the first time, the molecular basis for pace-of-life differences between locations with higher and lower climate seasonality and sexual size dimorphism (SSD). Our assembly is 2.1 Gbp, has scaffold N50 of 320 Mbp, includes 104 scaffolds, and has an L50 of 3. The assembly comprises six macrochromosomes and 11 microchromosomes. We annotated 20,350 genes for the assembly and found a repeat element composition of 49.23%, similar to work in other phrynosomatid lizards. RNA-seq data demonstrate differential expression in genes associated with pace-of-life divergence including those related to stress, sexual reproduction, and cell proliferation/carcinogenesis between distinctive environments. Our results provide the first differential gene expression evidence of environmentally mediated pace-of-life processes related to different degrees of SSD in U. stansburiana and demonstrate the utility of RNA-seq gene expression data in detecting POLS.

SummaryThis study presents a high-quality reference genome paired with an RNA-seq dataset collected to explore pace-of-life life history variation within the common side-blotched lizard, Uta stansburiana, an emerging model species for studies of polymorphism, adaptation, and reproduction. The authors paired long-read and Hi-C sequencing to generate a chromosome-length genome assembly, annotated genes, and analyzed patterns of differential gene expression between populations in different environments to reveal the molecular basis for shifts in pace-of-life. These data and resources will provide a valuable tool for evolutionary biologists, herpetologists, and geneticists interested in life history evolution, vertebrate adaptation, and the maintenance of polymorphism."

"Phytochromes are photosensor proteins which detect light in plants, fungi, and bacteria. They photoswitch between red light absorbing (Pr) and far-red light absorbing (Pfr) states, however, thermal reversion in the dark is an equally important factor in controlling their signaling levels. Phytochromes are generally dimeric proteins, and mixed PrPfr states are therefore possible. These states have been implied in the dark reversion studies of plant phytochromes, but not in bacterial phytochromes. Here, we investigate the dark reversion kinetics of the  bathy phytochrome from P. aeruginosa (PaBphP) using UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy. A single set of time-resolved spectra does not conclusively reveal the presence of a mixed PrPfr state, as both a direct Pr[-&gt;] Pfr model or a sequential Pr[-&gt;] PrPfr[-&gt;] Pfr model fit the spectral kinetics. However, a systematic analysis of dark reversion kinetics with varying Pr/Pfr ratios can only be satisfactorily fit by the sequential model, which indicates the presence of an intermediate PrPfr state. A newly designed monomeric variant of PaBphP provides strong support for this interpretation. Temperature-dependent kinetics revealed similarly low activation energies for the dark reversion processes of both proteins, consistent with a previously proposed keto-enol tautomerization preceding dark reversion. Interestingly, our results suggest allosteric regulation of dark reversion across the dimer, which we propose to be a contributing factor in phytochrome signaling."
"Multicellular organisms develop a wide variety of highly-specialized cell types. The consistency and robustness of developmental cell fate trajectories suggests that complex gene regulatory networks effectively act as low-dimensional cell fate landscapes. A complementary set of works draws on the theory of dynamical systems to argue that cell fate transitions can be categorized into universal decision-making classes. However, the theory connecting geometric landscapes and decision-making classes to high-dimensional gene expression space is still in its infancy. Here, we introduce a phenomenological model that allows us to identify gene expression signatures of decision-making classes from single-cell RNA-sequencing time-series data. Our model combines low-dimensional gradient-like dynamical systems and high-dimensional Hopfield networks to capture the interplay between cell fate, gene expression, and signaling pathways. We apply our model to the maturation of alveolar cells in mouse lungs to show that the transient appearance of a mixed alveolar type 1/type 2 state suggests the triple cusp decision-making class. We also analyze lineage-tracing data on hematopoetic differentiation and show that bipotent neutrophil-monocyte progenitors likely undergo a heteroclinic flip bifurcation. Our results suggest it is possible to identify universal decision-making classes for cell fate transitions directly from data."
"A variety of genetic diseases of the kidney tubule are amenable to correction via gene therapy. However, gene delivery to renal tubule epithelial cells mediated by viral vectors via the blood is inefficient due to the permselectivity of the glomerular barrier. We hypothesized that effacement of podocyte foot processes would disrupt typical glomerular limitations on filtration and make renal tubule epithelial cells susceptible to transduction from viral vectors delivered intravenously. We determined that adeno-associated virus serotype 8 (AAV8) transduced significantly more epithelial cells in the kidney under the conditions of LPS-induced proteinuria. Use of AAV1 in tandem with LPS-induced proteinuria yielded an ideal two-pronged effect of both partially detargeting the liver and transducing the kidney with a higher bioluminescent signal than AAV8 did, and at half of the dose. Using adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) in conjunction with LPS-induced proteinuria showed that kidney transduction was enhanced, but only in glomerular cells. These studies mechanistically test the efficacy of different viral vectors and demonstrate their capacity to transduce kidney epithelial cells. This is a fundamental step in designing future treatments for kidney gene therapy.

Significance StatementThe slit diaphragms in the glomerulus of the kidney are too narrow to allow most solute from the blood to enter the nephron. As a result, large particles such as viral vectors generally cannot access tubule epithelial cells necessary to correct genetic disorders. In this study, mice are induced into a state of proteinuria and subsequently administered viral vectors intravenously. This group of mice had higher levels of transduced kidney epithelial cells than the control (non-proteinuria) group. The induction of transient proteinuria before intravenous viral vector administration is a novel approach that could make tubulopathies treatable via gene therapy in both animal models and humans."
"Cellular differentiation processes are largely orchestrated by variation in transcription factor (TF) abundance. Since these proteins are usually expressed at extremely low levels, studying TF-driven cellular processes using single-cell proteomics by mass spectrometry (scp-MS) has been challenging. Here we present informed DIA (iDIA), an acquisition method tailored towards low-input and scp-MS. iDIA combines targeted and global proteomics in a single acquisition scheme and is by design universally applicable on different MS instrumentation. By combining wide window (ww)PRM scans with DIA acquisition, we observed a median 4-fold improvement in limit of quantification with targeted acquisitions, while maintaining biologically meaningful global proteome coverage. We utilize this gained sensitivity to quantify TFs in single murine hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and showcase their lineage-specific regulation."
"Recent advancements in neurotechnology enable precise spatiotemporal patterns of micros- timulations with single-cell resolution. The choice of perturbation sites must satisfy two key criteria: efficacy in evoking significant responses and selectivity for the desired target effects. This choice is currently based on laborious trial-and-error procedures, unfeasible for sequences of multi-site stimulations. Efficient methods to design complex perturbation patterns are ur- gently needed. Can we design a spatiotemporal pattern of stimulation to steer neural activity and behavior towards a desired target? We outline a method for achieving this goal in two steps. First, we identify the most effective perturbation sites, or hubs, only based on short observations of spontaneous neural activity. Second, we provide an efficient method to design multi-site stimulation patterns by combining approaches from nonlinear dynamical systems, control theory and data-driven methods. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach using multi-site stimulation patterns in recurrent network models."
"The Shola Sky Islands of the Western Ghats are isolated montane habitats that harbour significant avian diversity and endemism. This study assessed bird species diversity across five mountain ranges in Wayanad, Kerala (Banasura, Brahmagiri, Camels Hump, Kuricharmala, and Manikunnu) situated above 1200 meters. A total of 114 species were recorded, with the Camels Hump range supporting the highest diversity (81 species). Patterns of species richness were found to correspond with mountain area and degree of isolation, consistent with the principles of island biogeography. Birds were classified by taxonomic order and family, with Passeriformes being the most dominant order. Among families, Muscicapidae recorded the highest number of species, followed by Accipitridae and Phylloscopidae. Invertivores constituted the majority of trophic guilds, and species richness showed a general decline with increasing elevation. These findings highlight the importance of habitat area and connectivity in shaping avian communities within sky island ecosystems. They also underline the urgent need for targeted conservation efforts in this ecologically sensitive region, much of which falls under territorial divisions, including reserve and vested forests."
"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are single-pass membrane proteins central to innate immunity, yet the role of homodimeric transmembrane (TM) domain interactions in cross-membrane signaling remains poorly understood and underexploited for therapeutic intervention. Here, we conduct a de novo computational design campaign to generate synthetic peptides that selectively target the TM domain of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), a key mediator of inflammatory signaling and a clinically relevant drug target. Using in silico modeling and cell-based screening, we identified two peptides that disrupt membrane-embedded interactions essential for receptor activation. Our lead candidate binds sequence-specifically to the native TM-juxtamembrane region, acting as a largely target-selective and preliminarily dose-dependent inhibitor that impairs TLR4 signaling without affecting receptor expression. This work establishes a novel inhibitory mechanism based on structural perturbation of the TM interface and provides a generalizable framework for designing TM-targeting molecules in the absence of structural or evolutionary templates. These findings underscore the functional importance of membrane-spanning interactions and open a new therapeutic avenue for modulating TLR4 activity in the context of infection, autoimmunity, and inflammation."
"Mass spectrometry instrumentation continues to evolve rapidly, yet quantifying these advances beyond conventional peptide and protein detections remains challenging. Here, we evaluate a modified Orbitrap Astral Zoom mass spectrometer (MS) prototype and compare its performance to the standard Orbitrap Astral MS. Across a range of acquisition methods and sample inputs, the prototype instrument outperformed the standard Orbitrap Astral MS in precursor and protein identifications, ion accumulation efficiency, and reproducibility of measurements. To enable meaningful cross-platform comparisons, we implemented an ion calibration framework that converts signal intensity from arbitrary units to absolute ion counts (ions/sec). This benchmarking strategy showed that the prototype sampled 30% more ions per peptide than the original Orbitrap Astral MS. This increase in the ion beam utilization resulted in improved sensitivity and quantitative precision. To make these metrics broadly accessible, we added new metrics to the Skyline document grid to report ion counts directly from data-independent acquisition (DIA) data. Taken together, our results demonstrate the Orbitrap Astral Zoom prototype as a high-performance platform for DIA proteomics and establish a generalizable framework for evaluation of mass spectrometer performance based on the number of ions detected for each analyte."
"Successfully making connections with others is crucial to navigating the social world and general well-being, yet little is known about connection formation and its neurocognitive underpinnings. Increasingly, neuroscientists use interpersonal  neural synchrony within the default mode network (DMN) to measure when two or more people subjectively experience something in similar ways. DMN synchrony as  seeing eye-to-eye is typically observed when multiple people are passively observing the same stimulus. In this study, we tested whether the same DMN synchrony as  seeing eye-to-eye pattern holds during social interactions. We conducted a between-subject naturalistic experiment with 70 pairs of strangers engaged in either shallow or deep conversations while brain activity was measured with functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Stranger dyads successfully formed connections, as indicated by composite connection scores. Replicating Kardas et al. (2021), those in the deep conversation condition felt more connected than those in the shallow conversation condition. DMN neural synchrony significantly predicted self-reported connection, with synchrony in the DMN subregions of medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and right temporoparietal junction (TPJ) each correlating significantly with connection. Using machine learning classification, we distinguished high-versus low-connection dyads based on DMN neural synchrony and the perceived depth of conversation with 64.5% accuracy across 1,000 iterations. This effect was primarily carried by right TPJ, which alone classified connection strength at 62.6% accuracy. We consider implications related to the growing loneliness crisis and the importance of understanding how social connections can be formed and fostered in an era of increased social isolation.

Significance StatementThe current loneliness epidemic has serious consequences on health and well-being. Forming interpersonal connections is crucial for alleviating loneliness, yet little is known about its neural basis. Neural synchrony, a potential biological marker of people being on the  same page, may be an indicator of social connection. We recorded brain activity as strangers engaged in a get-to-know-you conversation and found that neural synchrony--specifically within the default mode network (DMN) and subregions including medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and right temporoparietal junction (TPJ)--predicted self-reported connection. Machine learning accurately classified high- and low-connection dyads based on DMN synchrony and perceived conversation depth. These findings suggest that deeper conversations, though more effortful, may foster stronger social bonds with measurable neural correlates."
"Previous studies on adult mice indicate that the mGluR5 agonist 2-chloro-5-hydroxyphenyl glycine (CHPG), reduces cuprizone-elicited losses in myelin. This effect is partly mediated by CHPG binding to mGluR5 receptors on reactive astrocytes, triggering the release of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which results in an increase in myelin, and alleviates behavioral deficits. However, it remains unclear whether CHPG has similar beneficial effects on human cells. To address this issue, we examined effects of CHPG on human cells using both human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived oligodendrocytes and primary human fetal brain cells. Treatment of hiPSCs (30M, 5 days) or primary cells (30 M, 3 days) with CHPG increases the percent of MBP+O4+ mature oligodendrocytes relative to total O4+cells, without affecting survival. When effects of CHPG were evaluated on proliferating OPCs, effects on proliferation are observed. In contrast, when CHPG was evaluated in young oligodendrocytes, effects on proliferation were gone, suggesting that in this population CHPG is influencing differentiation. Interestingly, in contrast to observations in mice, mGluR5 expression in humans is localized on PDGFR+ oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) and O4+ immature oligodendrocytes, but not astrocytes. Moreover, using purified human OPC cultures, we show a direct effect of CHPG in enhanced differentiation. To identify potential cellular targets of CHPG in the adult human brain, we analyzed postmortem tissue from individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) and healthy controls. In contrast to the hiPSCs or fetal cells, demyelinated white matter from MS patients showed elevated mGluR5 mRNA expression in astrocytes. Taken together, our findings suggest that CHPG enhances the differentiation of human OPCs during development through a mechanism distinct from that observed in adult cuprizone-treated mice. Moreover, astrocytes in MS pathology upregulate mGluR5, suggesting they may become responsive to CHPG under disease conditions."
"In addition to dementia, Alzheimers patients suffer from sleep impairments and aberrations in sleep-dependent brain rhythms. Deficits in inhibitory GABAergic interneuron function disrupt one of those rhythms, slow oscillation in particular, and actively contribute to Alzheimers progression. We tested the degree to which transplantation of healthy donor interneuron progenitors would restore slow oscillation rhythm in young APP mice. We harvested medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) progenitors from mouse embryos and transplanted them into host APP mutant cortices. 3D light-sheet and structured illumination microscopy revealed that transplanted MGE progenitors survived and matured into healthy interneurons. In vivo multiphoton calcium imaging and voltage-sensitive dye imaging showed functional integration and slow oscillation rescue in absence or presence of optogenetic stimulation. Our work provides proof-of-concept evidence that stem cell therapy may serve as a viable strategy to rescue functional impairments in cortical circuits of APP mice and potentially those of Alzheimers patients."
"Combinations of transcription factors (TFs) regulate gene expression and determine cell fate. Much effort has been devoted to understanding TF activity in different tissues and how tissue-specificity is achieved. However, ultimately gene regulation occurs at the single cell level and the recent explosion in the availability of single cell gene expression data now makes it possible to understand TF activity at this granular level of resolution.

Here, we leverage a large collection of Human Cell Atlas (HCA) single cell data to explore TF activity by examining cell-type and tissue-specific sets of target genes, or regulons. We compile a regulon atlas, CellRegulon, and map the activity of TFs in an extensive set of healthy adult and foetal tissues spanning hundreds of cell types. Using CellRegulon, we describe dynamic patterns of co-regulation, associate TF-modules with different cellular functions and characterise the distribution of active TFs and TF families across cell types. We show that CellRegulon can link disease gene expression signatures to cell types and TFs relevant to the disease. Finally, using a newly generated multiome dataset of the adult lung, we show how CellRegulon can be extended into an enhancer-gene regulatory network (eGRN) to improve cell-type associations with genetic risk loci for diseases, such as childhood onset asthma, COPD and IPF, and to identify high risk gene modules. Our database for easy download and interactive exploration allows researchers to understand key gene modules activated at cell type transitions and will therefore be valuable for tasks such as cell type engineering (https://www.cellregulondb.org)."
"Elucidating the role of somatic mutations in cancer, healthy tissues, and aging depends on methods that can accurately characterize somatic mosaicism across different cell types, as well as assay their impact on cellular function. Current technologies to study cell-type-specific somatic mutations within tissues are low-throughput. We developed Duplex-Multiome, incorporating duplex consensus sequencing to accurately identify somatic single-nucleotide variants (sSNV) from the same nucleus simultaneously analyzed for single-nucleus ATAC-seq (snATAC-seq) and RNA-seq (snRNA-seq). By introducing strand-tagging into the construction of snATAC-seq libraries, duplex sequencing reduces sequencing error by >10,000-fold while eliminating artifactual mutational signatures. When applied to 98%/2% mixed cell lines, Duplex-Multiome identified sSNVs present in 2% of cells with 92% precision and accurately captured known sSNV mutational spectra, while revealing unexpected subclonal lineages. Duplex-Multiome of > 51,400 nuclei from postmortem brain tissue captured sSNV burdens and spectra across all major brain cell types and subtypes, including those difficult to assay by single-cell whole-genome sequencing (scWGS). This revealed for the first time that diverse neuronal and glial cell types show distinct rates and patterns of age-related mutation, while also directly discovering developmental cell lineage relationships. Duplex-Multiome identified clonal sSNVs occurring at increased rates in glia of certain aged brains, as well as clonal sSNVs that correlated with changes in expression of nearby genes, in both neurotypical and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) individuals, directly demonstrating that somatic mutagenesis can contribute to gene expression phenotypes. Duplex-Multiome can be easily adopted into the 10X Multiome protocol and will bridge somatic mosaicism to a wide range of phenotypic readouts across cell types and tissues."
"The synaptic mechanisms driving feature selectivity in specific neuron types remains a fundamental and unresolved challenge in neuroscience. In hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons (PNs), the development of place selectivity, manifested as place fields, is believed to result from dendritic integration of spatially distributed inputs combined with behavioral time scale plasticity (BTSP). BTSP involves dendritic spikes that temporally regulate synaptic potentiation and depotentiation. However, the role of excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) synaptic distributions in the emergence of place specificity in CA1 PNs remains unclear, due to the lack of detailed synaptic reconstructions in vivo. Here, we present full synaptic reconstructions from individual CA1 PNs in the mouse hippocampus, revealing that these neurons receive approximately 10,000-15,000 E synapses and 900-1,400 I synapses. Computational modeling of biologically relevant E and I synaptic distributions shows that spatial tuning is preserved with co-tuned, spatially clustered E synapses, but disrupted when E distributions are randomized. Moreover, synapse clustering has a different contribution to spatial tuning in apical vs. basal domains. Our results reveal a complex and finely-tuned interplay between presynaptic input patterns and the spatial organization of their postsynaptic targets in dictating neuronal output in CA1 PNs."

"The ability to vary the mode and loudness of speech is an important part of the expressive range of human vocal communication. However, the encoding of these behaviors in the ventral precentral gyrus (vPCG) has not been studied at the resolution of neuronal firing rates. We investigated this in two participants who had intracortical microelectrode arrays implanted in their vPCG as part of a speech neuroprosthesis clinical trial. Neuronal firing rates modulated strongly in vPCG as a function of attempted mimed, whispered, normal or loud speech. At the neural ensemble level, mode/loudness and phonemic content were encoded in distinct neural subspaces. Attempted mode/loudness could be decoded from vPCG with an accuracy of 94% and 89% for two participants respectively, and corresponding neural preparatory activity could be detected hundreds of milliseconds before speech onset. We then developed a closed-loop loudness decoder that achieved 94% online accuracy in modulating a brain-to-text speech neuroprosthesis output based on attempted loudness. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of decoding mode and loudness from vPCG, paving the way for speech neuroprostheses capable of synthesizing more expressive speech."
"Understanding how the brain integrates multisensory information during detection and decision-making remains an active area of research. While many inferences have been drawn about behavioural outcomes, key questions persist regarding both the nature of environmental cues and the internal mechanisms of integration. These complexities make multisensory integration particularly well suited to investigate through mathematical modelling. In this study, we present three models of audio-visual integration within a biologically motivated mean-field recurrent framework. These models extend a non-linear system of differential equations originally developed for unisensory decision-making. The OR and SUM models represent opposing ends of the integration spectrum: the former simulates independent unisensory processing using a winner-take-all (WTA) strategy, while the latter implements a linear summation model for full integration. A third model--the REPEAT Model--incorporates switch and repeat costs observed in multisensory tasks. We simulate 121 participants with varying unisensory evidence accumulation rates, capturing behavioural diversity from modality dominance to balanced integration. Model outputs (reaction time and accuracy) were compared with empirical results from audio-visual detection tasks. We further fit the outputs to a drift diffusion model, allowing comparison between simulated and theoretically optimal multisensory drift rates. The OR and SUM Models reproduced established unisensory response patterns. Drift diffusion analysis revealed suboptimal integration in the OR Model and optimal integration in the SUM Model. However, the SUM Model also produced supra-optimal responses under certain conditions, inconsistent with behavioural data. The REPEAT Model successfully captured the role of priming in sensory repetition effects, distinguishing it from true multisensory integration. Overall, these models highlight how biologically grounded mathematical frameworks can shed light on the mechanisms underlying multisensory integration, particularly the nuanced contributions of modality repetition and integration efficiency."
"IntroductionDexmedetomidine is a selective 2-adrenergic agonist used as an anesthesia adjunct to produce a state of sleep-like sedation. However, how brain activity compares quantitatively during dexmedetomidine anesthesia to that during natural sleep, and thus just how ""sleep-like"" dexmedetomidine anesthesia is, remains unclear. Previously, we showed that the general anesthetic propofol is associated with changes in connectivity and cortical network structure comparable to those observed during sleep. Here, we compare the effects on brain activity of dexmedetomidine, propofol, and sleep quantitatively using intracranial encephalographic (iEEG) recordings in human research participants.

MethodsiEEG recordings were obtained in 34 epilepsy patients being evaluated for potential seizure resection surgery. Band power and functional connectivity (alpha weighted phase lag index, gamma envelope correlations) and network entropy were measured in recordings during task-free (""resting state"") periods just prior to surgery during anesthesia with either dexmedetomidine or propofol, and during overnight sleep. Anesthesia stage (wake, sedated, unresponsive) was determined using the Observers Assessment of Arousal and Sedation. Sleep was staged using standard polysomnography.

ResultsAs expected, significant differences in delta power were observed during dexmedetomidine and propofol as well as during sleep. However, the magnitude of changes in delta power were smaller and regionally heterogeneous for propofol compared to dexmedetomidine and sleep. Functional connectivity changes were comparable between dexmedetomidine, propofol, and natural sleep. Significant changes in network entropy were observed for dexmedetomidine, propofol, and sleep, but changes were larger for propofol compared to dexmedetomidine and sleep. Quantitative comparisons between changes in delta power and network entropy suggest that unresponsiveness under dexmedetomidine produces a similar brain state to that observed during N2 sleep.

ConclusionsWhile delta power, functional connectivity, and network entropy all showed changes during propofol, dexmedetomidine, and sleep, the magnitudes of these changes suggest that dexmedetomidine is more similar than propofol to sleep, specifically to N2 sleep."
"BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESISSchizophrenia is associated with widespread neuroanatomical abnormalities affecting both grey matter and white matter (WM). Early symptoms are often linked to dysfunctions in the frontal cortex and the temporal lobe. This study investigates WM disruptions and explores how structural connectivity (SC) may contribute to the underlying mechanisms of the disorder.

STUDY DESIGNWe analysed SC derived from diffusion MRI in 127 patients experiencing their first episode of schizophrenia (FES group), compared with healthy controls. Focusing on the fronto-parietal-temporal network, we examined SC across three hierarchical levels: network, node, and connection. SC metrics were compared between groups using 3-factor ANCOVA, accounting for relevant covariates. We also investigated associations between SC metrics and core positive symptoms using non-parametric correlations.

RESULTSThe FES group showed significantly reduced average SC strength and global efficiency within the fronto-parietal-temporal network. At the nodal level, SC strength was significantly lower in the left inferior and middle temporal gyri (L.ITG, L.MTG), and in the right inferior parietal gyrus (R.IPG) and temporal pole (R.TP). No significant group differences emerged at the connection level. Notably, SC strength in the R.IPG was negatively correlated with Conceptual Disorganisation scores.

CONCLUSIONSOur findings reveal global and regional SC disruptions in early psychosis, particularly in areas supporting cognitive, language, and executive functions. The observed association between R.IPG connectivity and Conceptual Disorganisation supports the link between disrupted SC and formal thought disorder, reinforcing the role of impaired structural integration in early psychosis."
"Ruminant products are consumed widely on a global level due to their high protein and micronutrient density. However, ruminant production is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, particularly with respect to methane (CH), with ruminants contributing 33% of all anthropogenic CH emissions. CH is produced due to the natural fermentative processes undertaken by the complex rumen microbiome, primarily via the utilisation of hydrogen by rumen archaea to form CH. Previous studies have shown that feeding the red seaweed Asparagopsis taxiformis (ASP) to ruminants can reduce CHemissions from beef cattle by up to 80% (Roque et al., 2021). Nevertheless, the mechanism of action of this seaweed in terms of effects on the rumen microbiome is largely unknown, which is the main focus of this study. Six Nordic Red cows at 122 {+/-} 13.7 (mean {+/-} SD) days in milk were divided into 3 blocks by milk yield in Latin square design and fed grass silage and a commercial concentrate (60:40) either with or without 0.5% ASP on an organic matter basis. Rumen fluid was collected 19 days into each experimental period, with a holistic approach using both assembly and read mapping based approaches to interrogate taxonomic, functional, and ecological shifts applied to metagenomic data. We show that ASP reduces methane production not only through direct inhibition of methanogens but also by disrupting cobamide-dependent metabolic pathways and redirecting carbon flow toward pyruvate and propionate rather than acetate and methane. For the first time, specific enzymes involved in vitamin B12 (cobamide) biosynthesis are identified as suppressed by ASP, and microbial taxa contributing to these functional changes are elucidated showing both niche displacement and resilience within the rumen microbiome. These findings offer new mechanistic insight into how red seaweed supplementation modulates the rumen microbiome, supporting its potential role in sustainable ruminant production."
"The laboratory contaminant Noodlococcus was named for its coccoid cells and unusual colony morphology, which resembled a pile of noodles. Along with laboratory characterisation and electron microscopy, we generated a complete Noodlococcus genome sequence using Illumina and Oxford Nanopore data. The genome consisted of a single, circular, 2732108 bp chromosome that shared 97.5% Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) with the Kocuria rhizophila type strain TA68. We identified genomic features involved in replication (oriC), carotenoid synthesis (crt), and genome defence (CRISPR-Cas), and discovered four novel mobile elements (ISKrh4-7). Despite its environmental ubiquity and relevance to food production, bioremediation, and human medicine, there have been few genomic studies of the Kocuria genus. We conducted a comparative, phylogenetic, and pangenomic examination of all 257 publicly available Kocuria genomes, with a particular focus on the 56 that were identified as K. rhizophila. We found that there are two phylogenetically distinct clades of K. rhizophila, with within-clade ANI values of 96.7-100.0% and between-clade values of 89.5-90.4%. The second clade, which we refer to as K. pseudorhizophila, exhibited ANI values of <95% relative to TA68 and constitutes a separate species. Delineation of the two clades would be consistent with the rest of the genus, where all other species satisfy the 95% ANI threshold criteria. Differences in the K. rhizophila and K. pseudorhizophila pangenomes likely reflect phenotypic as well as evolutionary divergence. This distinction is relevant to clinical and industrial settings, as strains and genomes from both clades are currently used interchangeably, which may lead to reproducibility issues and phenotype-genotype discordance. Investigating an innocuous laboratory contaminant has therefore provided useful insights into the understudied species K. rhizophila, prompting an unexpected reassessment of its taxonomy.

Impact statementBacterial genome sequence databases are dominated by a relatively small number of medically relevant genera, while most of the global bacterial populations diversity is largely uncharacterised. Kocuria is a widespread bacterial genus with industrial and medical relevance. Despite its ubiquity, only 22 complete and 235 draft Kocuria genomes were publicly available at the outset of this study. Our phylogenetic and pangenomic examination of all available Kocuria genomes was the first for this genus, providing insights into its diversity and taxonomy. Most notably, we found that Kocuria rhizophila is comprised of two clades that are sufficiently divergent to constitute different species, but are frequently used interchangeably in experimental and genomic research. The complete, high-quality Noodlococcus genome generated and characterised here can serve as a reference for true K. rhizophila, particularly while there is only a draft genome sequence available for type strain TA68.

Data summarySequencing reads and the assembled Noodlococcus genome are available from NBCI BioProject accession PRJNA835814 and BioSample accession SAMN28111796. The complete sequence of the Noodlococcus chromosome can be found in the GenBank nucleotide database under accession number CP097204.1. Entries for the novel insertion sequences ISKrh4 to ISKrh7 can be found in the ISFinder database (https://isfinder.biotoul.fr)."
"Bulk RNA sequencing provides an averaged gene expression profile of the numerous cells in a tissue sample, obscuring critical information about cellular heterogeneity. Computational deconvolution methods can estimate cell type proportions in bulk samples, but current approaches can lack precision in key scenarios due to simplistic statistical assumptions, limited modeling of cell-type heterogeneity and poor handling of rare populations. We present MixupVI, a deep generative model that learns representations of single-cell transcriptomic data and introduces a mixup-based regularization to enable reference-free deconvolution of bulk samples. Our method creates a latent representation with an additive property, where the representation of a pseudobulk sample corresponds to the weighted sum of its constituent cell types. We demonstrate how MixupVI enables accurate estimation of cell type proportions through benchmarking on pseudobulks simulated from a large immune single-cell atlas. To support reproducibility and foster progress in the field, we also release PyDeconv, a Python library that implements multiple state-of-the-art deconvolution algorithms and provides a comprehensive benchmark on simulated pseudobulk datasets."
"Nucleic acid synthesis is a dual-use technology that can benefit fields such as biology, medicine, and information storage. However, synthetic nucleic acids could also potentially be used negligently and ultimately cause harm, or be used with malicious intent to cause harm. Thus, this technology needs to be appropriately safeguarded. Sequence screening is one component of a biosecurity protocol for preventing such harm and consists of differentiating Sequences of Concern (SOCs) from benign sequences that are not associated with pathogenicity or toxicity. There exist many fit-for-purpose tools that have been developed for DNA synthesis sequence screening. However, questions remain regarding their performance with respect to consistency of screening. To aid in determining if screening tools are harmonized in regard to baseline sequence screening, NIST constructed a test dataset based on current screening recommendations. NIST then sent blinded datasets to sequence screening tool developers for testing. Overall, there was a general agreement between the tools and NIST assignments of the sequences and all tools had a baseline performance of greater than 95% sensitivity and 97% accuracy. Disagreement on specific sequences largely arose from single tools and could be traced to differences in defining a SOC and/or methodological differences in screening algorithms."
"Caloric restriction (CR) robustly extends the health and lifespan of diverse species. When fed once daily, CR-treated mice rapidly consume their food and endure a prolonged fast between meals. As fasting is associated with a rise in circulating ketones, we decided to investigate the role of ketogenesis in CR using mice with whole-body ablation of Hmgcs2, the rate-limiting enzyme producing the main ketone body {beta}-hydroxybutyrate ({beta}HB). Here, we report that Hmgcs2 is largely dispensable for many metabolic benefits of CR, including CR-driven changes in adiposity, glycemic control, liver autophagy, and energy balance. Although we observed sex-specific effects of Hmgcs2 on insulin sensitivity, fuel selection, and adipocyte gene expression, the overall physiological response to CR remains robust in mice lacking Hmgcs2. To gain insight into why deletion of Hmgcs2 does not disrupt CR, we measured fasting {beta}HB levels as mice began a CR diet. Surprisingly, as CR-fed mice adapt to CR, they no longer engage high levels of ketogenesis during the daily fast. Our work suggests that the benefits of long-term CR in mice are not mediated by ketogenesis."
"Etiologies of neurodevelopmental disorders involve genes and environment however their interactions are understudied. Rett Syndrome (RTT) is an X-linked, dominant neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in MECP2, encoding the epigenetic regulator methyl CpG binding protein. Epigenetic features of MECP2 expression due to X-linked cellular mosaicism and the variability in severity and timing of progression in RTT suggest interaction with environmental neurotoxicants such as lipophilic polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). To understand shared mechanisms, we exposed WT and Mecp2e1-/+ female mice to a human-relevant PCB mixture and dose, then performed single-nucleus 5 RNA-seq from cortex. We identified significant overlap in dysregulated genes and 71 shared pathways between the effects of PCB exposure and MeCP2 mutation, and co-mitigation of their transcriptional impacts. PCBs influenced the non-cell- autonomous transcriptional effects of MeCP2 mutations in wild-type-expressing neurons within the mosaic mutant female cortex in both mouse and human, suggesting that the interactions predominantly involve homeostatic gene networks."
"Heightened soluble FMS-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1) levels is a hallmark of preeclampsia patients and induces a state of angiogenic imbalance by sequestering free vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and placental growth factor (PlGF). The receptors for VEGF and PlGF, membrane-bound VEGFR, are expressed in placental trophoblast cells, but their functions are largely unknown. Placenta production of leptin significantly increases in preeclampsia, and we recently showed leptin induces placental and vascular endothelial dysfunction in pregnancy. We hypothesized that there is a mechanistic link in which inappropriately high sFlt-1 in preeclampsia leads to an increase in trophoblast leptin production. We treated human placental explants and trophoblast cells with sFlt-1 and show an increase in leptin peptide production, which is ablated by coadministration with either VEGF or placental growth factor (PLGF). We further demonstrate that VEGFR1 and 3, not R2, expressions are predominant in human trophoblasts and that reducing activation of these receptors mediates trophoblast leptin production. In pregnant mice, we show that sFlt-1 infusion induces vascular endothelial dysfunction in association with significantly elevated plasma leptin levels. In pregnant sFlt-1-infused mice treatment with leptin receptor antagonist significantly ablated vascular endothelial dysfunction. Collectively, these data indicate that angiogenic imbalance in preeclampsia impacts placental trophoblast endocrine function by suppressing VEGFR1 and 3 activation, resulting in leptin overproduction. Furthermore, sFlt-1 induces vascular endothelial dysfunction in mice dependent on leptin receptor activation."
"(Re)mapping of different environments by hippocampal place cells is thought to reflect incidental learning. Rat ""head scanning"" is a spontaneous and presumed investigatory behavior that can trigger the onset of firing locations in place cells. This behavior was studied on (quasi-)circular tracks, and it was speculated that off-track head scans might have been overlooked or inadvertently discouraged in studies employing more common apparatus. To better understand the general prevalence and significance of off-track scanning, we investigated it in rats running laps on linear tracks in rooms featuring visual landmarks. Rats scanned along the entire length of the track, even in highly familiar conditions and when they were rewarded only at the two ends of the track (albeit less than rats rewarded throughout the track), demonstrating that co-localized rewards are not necessary for the occurrence of this behavior. Scanning rate increased markedly in a novel room and then declined steeply during each daily session in this room over 3 days. Partial daily boosts transiently counteracted this decline, producing a ""seesaw"" profile that is reminiscent of previous observations on rat rearing or place cell plasticity. Moreover, the remapping that place cells are known to undergo in similar context changes could conceivably be facilitated by the putative surge of new place fields induced by increased scanning. Hence, investigatory behaviors could be causally involved in the representational and dynamic properties of hippocampal representations. Addressing these possibilities could help uncover the learning processes governing the incidental creation and update of a cognitive map.

"Accumulating evidence indicates that the auditory pathway integrates movement-related signals with auditory input, yet the precise sources and mechanisms of this integration across various processing levels are incompletely understood. The inferior colliculus (IC), a major midbrain hub in the auditory pathway, shows widespread modulation of neural activity during locomotion, indicating that auditory neurons at this level are sensitive to ongoing movement. However, in hearing animals, it has been challenging to dissociate auditory feedback from other motor-related signals. In this study, to isolate non-auditory contributions, we recorded IC neural activity during locomotion in deafened mice, thereby eliminating all auditory feedback through both air and bone conduction. Even in the absence of auditory input, IC neurons exhibited robust, bidirectional modulation during locomotion. Timing analysis using electromyography revealed both predictive and feedback components relative to locomotion onset. Furthermore, the timing and direction of modulation varied considerably across different locomotion bouts, suggesting convergence of multiple non-auditory inputs. These findings demonstrate that non-auditory, movement-related signals significantly shape auditory midbrain activity through both predictive and feedback mechanisms."
"Chevreul is an open-source R Bioconductor package and interactive R Shiny app for processing and visualization of single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. It differs from other scRNA- seq analysis packages in its ease of use, its capacity to analyze full-length RNA sequencing data for exon coverage and transcript isoform inference, and its support for batch correction. Chevreul enables exploratory analysis of scRNA-seq data using Bioconductor SingleCellExperiment or Seurat objects. Simple processing functions with sensible default settings enable batch integration, quality control filtering, read count normalization and transformation, dimensionality reduction, clustering at a range of resolutions, and cluster marker gene identification. Processed data can be visualized in an interactive R Shiny app with dynamically linked plots. Expression of gene or transcript features can be displayed on PCA, tSNE, and UMAP embeddings, heatmaps, or violin plots while differential expression can be evaluated with several statistical tests without extensive programming. Existing analysis tools do not provide specialized tools for isoform-level analysis or alternative splicing detection. By enabling isoform-level expression analysis for differential expression, dimensionality reduction and batch integration, Chevreul empowers researchers without prior programming experience to analyze full-length scRNA-seq data.

"The gut microbiome plays a crucial role in human health and disease, influencing diverse biological processes such as immune regulation and nutrient metabolism. However, the complexity of micro-bial interactions and their metabolic cross-feeding dynamics remains poorly understood. This study proposes KODA, an agentic framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) and knowledge graphs (KGs) to facilitate the discovery of targets in antimicrobial drugs in the gut microbiome. Our approach employs a multi-agent system to interpret natural language queries and translate them into precise graph database queries, enabling intuitive interactions with complex microbiome data. Focusing on KEGG orthologies related to essential microbial genes, KODA identifies potential antimicrobial drug targets by analyzing microbial metabolic pathways. The system employs a Neo4j-based microbiome KG, which integrates microbial interaction data, metabolic models, and KEGG annotations. A dedicated evaluation framework, which incorporates LLM-based reviewers, assesses the quality of generated queries and analytical reports. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of KODA in providing actionable insights for antimicrobial research, particularly in identifying conserved essential genes as potential drug targets. This framework holds the potential to democratize microbiome research by lowering technical barriers and accelerating hypothesis generation in drug discovery."
"Visual hallucinations occur across many clinical conditions, but can also be induced experimentally in healthy individuals, using high-frequency flicker (Ganzflicker) and sensory deprivation (Ganzfeld). It is unclear how hallucinatory proneness changes across the lifespan, with prior questionnaire-based studies showing mixed results. As factors such as multi-sensory acuity loss and relatively increased reliance on prior knowledge may increase as we age, and these are considered risk factors for hallucination proneness, we hypothesised that reported decreases in hallucinations might reflect stigma-related underreporting. We therefore sought to measure hallucination proneness in 44 healthy adults spanning the adult lifespan (younger age group; n=22; age 19-39 years, mean 27.2 {+/-} 5.5; older age group n=22; age 59-79 years, mean 68.0 {+/-} 5.8), quantifying the tendency to experience complex and simple hallucinations in an experimental environment designed to elicit hallucinations. We find that reports of complex hallucinations (those representing objects, scenes, etc) are lower in older adults than in younger adults, both in real time and retrospectively. None of our measured cognitive or sensory measures (visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, perceptual reorganisation, imagery vividness, memory inhibition, and suggestibility) mediate this relationship. We conclude that reduced complex hallucination proneness appears normative in ageing, and that experiencing hallucinations in older individuals may signal underlying pathology."

We conclude that reduced complex hallucination proneness appears normative in ageing, and that experiencing hallucinations in older individuals may signal underlying pathology."
"Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are among the multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative pathogens that pose a growing threat, necessitating novel preventive measures in addition to traditional antibiotics. By using advanced immunoinformatics methods, highly conserved and immunogenic epitopes for B-cells and T-cells were selected from major virulence-associated proteins (LptE, YiaD, MrkD, PhoE, OprF, and Zot), which exhibited high antigenicity (VaxiJen scores 0.74-2.75) and 98.87% global population coverage. The construct vaccine comprises 50S ribosomal protein L7/L12 adjuvant and PADRE sequence for immunogenicity enhancement, with structural validation indicating stability (96.3% residues in the total allowed Ramachandran regions). High-affinity interactions with TLR2/TLR4 (binding energies: -1009.6 to -1079.6 kcal/mol) were found through molecular docking, and immune simulations suggested strong humoral (IgM/IgG) and cellular (IFN-{gamma}/IL-12) responses. Importantly, MEP vaccines can overcome major drawbacks of traditional vaccines by (1) offering cross-strain protection via conserved epitopes, (2) lowering the need for antibiotics through infection prevention, and (3) providing affordable options for healthcare systems affected by MDR infections. These findings demonstrate the MEP constructs potential as a preventative measure against nosocomial infections, which may have implications for combating the global AMR epidemic. Further experimental validation is needed to verify its efficacy."
"Covariate selection in population pharmacokinetics modelling is essential for understanding interindividual variability in drug response and optimizing dosing. Traditional stepwise covariate modelling is often time-consuming, compared to the new machine learning alternatives. This study investigates the use of Neural Networks with Stochastic Gates for automated covariate selection, aiming to efficiently identify relevant covariates while penalizing excessive covariate inclusion. On various synthetic datasets the approach demonstrated robustness in detecting important covariates, overcoming challenges such as high correlations, low covariate frequencies, high interindividual variability and complex covariate dependencies. In real clinical data from a monalizumab study, the method successfully identified covariates that matched those found by experts. However, for tixagevimab/cilgavimab, it identified a superset of covariates, indicating a potential need for further pruning. This machine learning-based method enhances the covariate pre-selection process in population pharmacokinetics model development, offering significant time savings and improving efficiency even under challenging scenarios.

Traditionally, this process is conducted in a stepwise manner, which can be very time-consuming. Recently, fast machine learning (ML)-based methods for covariate selection have emerged in the literature, offering more efficient alternatives.

WHAT QUESTION DID THIS STUDY ADDRESS?Can we use Neural Networks with Stochastic Gates, incorporating explicit penalization on the number of covariates, to select superior set of covariates compared to prior ML-based methods?

WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD TO OUR KNOWLEDGE?Neural Networks with Stochastic Gates provide a reliable approach in accurately detecting covariates because they can effectively eliminate irrelevant covariates even in cases with high inter-covariates correlation.

HOW MIGHT THIS CHANGE DRUG DISCOVERY, DEVELOPMENT, AND/OR THERAPEUTICS?This approach accelerates pharmacokinetic model development by significantly reducing the time required for covariate evaluation. Additionally, it allows for the screening of a wider set of covariates, potentially leading to fewer falsely missed covariates and better-quality models, a task that would be infeasible with traditional stepwise covariate modelling."
"Background and AimsAntibiotics are natural compounds produced by microorganisms that have long existed in ecosystems. However, the widespread clinical and agricultural use of antibiotics has intensified selective pressures on bacteria, leading to the proliferation of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). The increasing prevalence of these genetic elements now poses a major global health threat. While ARGs are well documented in anthropogenically influenced environments, their distribution and origins in remote ecosystems, such as the boreal forests, remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate the occurrence, diversity, and potential origins of ARGs in the boreal lichen Cladonia stellaris.

MethodsWe conducted the first targeted assessment of ARGs in lichens by analyzing 42 C. stellaris samples from northern and southern lichen woodlands (LWs) in eastern Canada. Using high-throughput quantitative PCR, we screened for 33 ARGs and three mobile genetic elements (MGEs), quantifying their relative abundance. Bacterial community composition was characterized via 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Statistical analyses evaluated geographical patterns, ARGs-taxa association, and the influence of latitude on ARG distribution.

Key ResultsTen ARGs conferring resistance to four antibiotic classes (aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, quinolones and sulfonamides), along with one MGE, were detected. Three ARGs, blaCTX-M-1, qnrB, and qepA, were highly prevalent, with qepA often surpassing 16S rRNA gene abundance. Latitude significantly influenced ARG profiles, whereas bacterial community composition did not. Network analysis identified Connexibacter, Granulicella, and Novosphingobium as potential hosts for qnrB, and Tundrisphaera and Terriglobus for qepA. To explain ARGs presence, we explored two hypotheses: bioaerosol dispersal from anthropogenic sources, and endogenous development through co-evolution between lichen-produced antimicrobial compounds and their associated bacterial communities.

ConclusionsOur findings demonstrate that C. stellaris harbors diverse ARGs in remote boreal ecosystems, highlighting the ecological complexity of ARG persistence and the need to investigate not only ARG presence, but also the processes driving their distribution in natural environments."
"The accurate representation of color is important in applications involving species identification. Environmental variations introduce inconsistencies in color perception, affecting the reliability of automated image processing algorithms. In previous work, we developed a hybrid algorithm, AInsectID Version 1.1 Color Merge, to overcome challenges posed by over-segmentation and under-segmentation in insect wing color clustering. We achieved this by using color differences between superpixels to measure homogeneity during the superpixels segmentation process. Nevertheless, our algorithm remains sensitive to environmental effects, affecting its performance and accuracy in color analyses. Here, we introduce a standard imaging method for insect species, as a pre-requisite to analysis in AInsectID Version 1.1 Color Merge. We systematically examine the effects of varying lighting conditions, angle of observation, and working distance in a controlled environment to assess their impact on the performance of the algorithm. We find that by meticulously controlling lighting, working distance, and lighting angle, we develop an evidence-based standard approach to imaging colors that is robust and repeatable. By following our standardized procedure, consistent color analyses are possible under varying environmental conditions. The method was tested using the Delta E2000 ({Delta}E) color difference metric with a threshold of 1, demonstrating that our standard approach maintains perceptual accuracy within the Just Noticeable Difference (JND) range, while improving the reliability of color analyses of insect wings in diverse environments. Finally, to validate the robustness of our standardization method, we evaluated the certainty of our results at different levels of confidence."
"BackgroundThe primary cholinergic input to the cerebral cortex arises from the nucleus basalis of Meynert (nbM), a group of magnocellular neurons clustered within the posterior basal forebrain cholinergic system (BFCS). Postmortem and in vivo neuroimaging studies have demonstrated significant neuronal loss and BFCS atrophy, most prominently in the nbM, in both mild cognitive impairment and dementia due to Alzheimers disease (AD). However, less is known surrounding the relationship between accumulating Alzheimers pathology, BFCS atrophy, and cognition during early preclinical stages of AD.

MethodsThe current study investigates the relationship between sub-structural BFCS volume and cortical A{beta} burden in cognitively unimpaired middle-aged individuals at varying genetic risk for AD. Cognitively unimpaired participants aged 50-65 with a first-degree family history for AD were genetically screened to select three groups: APOE genotype {varepsilon}4{varepsilon}4 (n=15), {varepsilon}3{varepsilon}4 (n=15), and {varepsilon}3{varepsilon}3 (n=15), matched for age and sex. Participants underwent imaging with [11C]PiB PET and structural 3T MRI. Distribution volumes ratios (DVR) with a whole cerebellum reference region were calculated for [11C]PiB PET analyses. BFCS sub-structural volumes were obtained from regions of interest generated from the SPM8 Anatomy Toolbox (Ch1-3, Ch4).

ResultsBFCS amyloid burden was highest among APOE {varepsilon}4 homozygotes (Ch1-3, F(2, 42)=3.26, P=0.048; Ch4, F(2, 42)=3.82, P= 0.03). Ch4(nbM), but not Ch1-3 volume, was found to be inversely associated with global A{beta} burden (Pearson r=-0.40, P=0.007). Exploratory analyses in groups stratified by amyloid positivity demonstrated reduced Ch4 volume (P=0.032) and significant inverse associations between Ch4 volume and amyloid burden (Pearson r = -0.70, P=0.02) in A{beta}+ participants. Medial temporal lobe (MTL) volumes were neither significantly different between A{beta}+ vs. A{beta}-participants nor were they associated with global amyloid burden in either A{beta}+ participants, A{beta}-participants, or the pooled sample.

ConclusionsWe observed nbM (Ch4), but not MTL volume, to be significantly inversely associated with cortical amyloid burden in cognitively unimpaired, A{beta}+, older adults at varying genetic risk for AD. These findings provide further in vivo evidence suggesting BFCS (specifically nbM) atrophy may precede medial temporal atrophy in the preclinical stage of AD and that nbM atrophy is an early structural correlate of AD pathogenesis."
"How does the brain adjust its decision processes to ensure timely decision completion? Computational modelling and electrophysiological investigations have pointed to dynamic  urgency processes that serve to progressively reduce the quantity of evidence required to reach choice commitment as time elapses. To date, such urgency dynamics have been observed exclusively in neural signals that accumulate evidence for a specific motor plan. Across three complementary experiments, we show that a classic ERP component, the Contingent Negative Variation (CNV), also traces dynamic urgency but exhibits unique properties not observed in effector-selective signals. Firstly, it provides a representation of urgency alone, growing only as a function of time and not evidence strength. Secondly, when choice reports must be withheld until a response cue, the CNV peaks and decays long before response execution, mirroring the early termination dynamics of a motor-independent evidence accumulation signal. These properties suggest that the brain may use urgency signals not only to expedite motor planning but also to hasten cognitive deliberation. These data demonstrate that urgency processes operate in a variety of perceptual choice scenarios and that they can be monitored in a model-independent manner via non-invasive brain signals.

Significance StatementComputational models suggest that, when decisions are time-constrained the brain progressively lowers the amount of evidence it requires to reach choice commitment, thus increasingly sacrificing accuracy for timely decision completion. To date, neurophysiological investigations have identified signatures of these  urgency effects exclusively in areas of the brain that plan the decision-reporting actions. Here, we characterise a human electroencephalogram signature of urgency that exhibits several novel properties: it traces the urgency component of the decision and terminates upon choice commitment even when the decision-reporting action is deferred until later. These observations suggest that urgency can serve to hasten the deliberation process and not just the movements that a decision entails."
"Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a severe skin disorder affecting 1% of the global population, with a complex and poorly understood pathogenesis involving aberrant keratinization and autoinflammation. It remains unclear whether autoinflammatory events precede or follow hyperkeratotic changes in hair follicle (HF) epithelia.

Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we characterized HF cell populations in HS patients and investigated their role in disease pathogenesis. We uncovered two distinct differentiation trajectories of HF stem cells (HF-SCs): one leading to interfollicular epidermis (IFE) basal cells enriched in inflammatory pathways, and another giving rise to outer root sheath (ORS) cells associated with keratinization. In HS lesions, both populations displayed altered inflammatory phenotypes and were closely linked to immune cell infiltration, pointing to a role in disease heterogeneity. By integrating clinical features with HF cell composition from 49 HS patients, we identified three major endotypes: (i) an inflammatory subtype, marked by T cell infiltration and an expansion of IFE basal cells; (ii) a keratinizing subtype, characterized by ORS enrichment and minimal inflammation; and a mixed subtype, exhibiting features of follicular remodeling, fistula formation, and variable immune involvement.

These findings provide novel insights into the epithelial-immune interactions that drive HS and support a stratified therapeutic approach tailored to the specific HF dysfunctions of each patient subgroup.

"Plasmodial infection induces systemic inflammation with great potential to contribute to the development of severe illness and lethality. It is known that the hippocampus and cortex both play a pivotal role in memory processes and are affected by the neuroinflammation associated with cerebral malaria that causes long-lasting cognitive and behavioral sequelae. Since these sequelae are also associated with the non-severe form of malaria, it is important to correlate brain morphology, particularly glial cell involvement, and neuroimmune and neuroinflammatory features with memory acquisition and consolidation processes, in this clinical presentation of malaria, the most frequent worldwide. Here, we aimed to investigate cellular and molecular neuroimmune aspects of non-severe experimental malaria-associated cognitive dysfunction. Female C57BL/6 mice were infected with Plasmodium berghei ANKA and treated with chloroquine before any clinical signs of cerebral malaria emerged. No histopathological alteration, in hematoxylin-eosin staining, or axonal damage, in Bielschowskys silver-impregnated brain sections, was observed. However, morphological alterations in GFAP+ and Iba-1+ cells suggest that: i) astrocytes in the hippocampal dentate gyrus and the cornu Ammonis 1 regions and ii) microglia in the cornu Ammonis 1 region are responding to infection. Curiously, the effect persisted only in Iba-1+ cells up to 22 days post-infection. An increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines levels and expression was observed, in both the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus. Also, serum and spleen cytokine levels were increased at 4 days post-infection. At 22 days post-infection, infected and treated mice showed an increase in serum cytokine levels that had homeostatic levels at 155 days post-infection. This dynamic points to both an immune stimulus persistence and a cytokine autoregulation post-infection. Infected mice exhibited acquisition and consolidation memory deficits in behavioral tests early after treatment (22 days post-infection). In conclusion, in a context of sustained systemic inflammation, mild neuroinflammatory alterations of glial cells may be involved in cognitive sequelae following a single episode of non-severe experimental malaria."
"The ligand dependent transcription factor aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is an environmental sensor whose activation can have physiologically beneficial or detrimental consequences for host immune responses depending on the ligand. Here we investigated the hypothesis that prolonged AHR activation either due to inefficient ligand metabolism or due to genetic manipulation may underlie the distinction between beneficial and detrimental effects. Our data indicate that prolonged AHR activation caused toxic endpoints for liver and thymus but was not per se interfering with the host response to infection with the intestinal pathogen C.rodentium. Genetically driven constitutive AHR activation improved resistance to infection, whereas prolonged AHR activation by the pollutant TCDD resulted in delayed clearance of C.rodentium associated with a suppression in antibody production. Combined single cell RNAseq and ATAC-seq analysis provided evidence that TCDD, but not genetic AHR activation, negatively affected dendritic cell functions such as activation, maturation and antigen presentation. Thus, the detrimental impact of environmental pollutants such as TCDD on immune responses cannot solely be attributed to aberrantly prolonged activation of AHR."
"Fluorescence in phytoplankton and other autotrophic organisms originates within the cell chloroplasts, where a fraction of the absorbed solar radiation is reemitted at longer wavelengths by photopigments. While traditionally employed as an indicator of physiological status, emerging evidence suggests that natural chlorophyll fluorescence (ChlF) may also play unanticipated functional roles in the marine environment. Here, we examine the ChlF emission fields generated by pennate planktonic diatoms, a key phytoplankton group playing a critical role in global biogeochemical cycles. Using cell micromanipulation experiments, we demonstrate that the ChlF emitted by Pseudonitzschia fraudulenta (Bacillariophyceae) is markedly anisotropic, a feature attributed to both the cells elongated morphology and the arrangement of chloroplasts within the cytoplasm. In these diatoms, fluorescence is preferentially emitted in the transapical direction, accounting for up to 35% of total emission. However, peak ChlF intensities occur at the cell apices, suggesting that the silica frustule focuses fluorescent light emission along the longitudinal axis. At elevated cell densities ([~]106 cells/L), the underwater light field is modulated by the combined effects of ChlF emission anisotropy and the preferential alignment of diatom cells within the water column. Numerical simulations indicate that ChlF intensity can vary by up to 15% depending on whether cells are predominantly aligned --commonly in stratified water columns-- or randomly oriented. These results suggest that diatom-driven modulation of the light field through structured ChlF emission may influence microscale optical environments, with potential consequences for processes ranging from intercellular signaling to large-scale phytoplankton dynamics, including remote sensing-based assessments of phytoplankton physiology.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTPhytoplankton are microscopic organisms that underpin marine food webs and play a central role in global carbon cycling. This study shows that certain diatoms, a major group of phytoplankton, emit chlorophyll fluorescence in a strongly directional manner, influenced by their shape, internal structure, and collective orientation. At natural population densities, this anisotropic fluorescence emission can significantly modify the distribution of light underwater. Such biologically driven alterations to the ocean light field may impact phytoplankton interactions, growth dynamics, and how they are observed by satellite remote sensing. These findings uncover a previously overlooked mechanism by which phytoplankton influence their optical environment, with important implications for understanding marine ecosystem processes, improving interpretation of ocean color data, and enhancing models of ocean productivity."
"Commercial beekeepers in the US reported severe colony losses early in 2025, as colonies were being staged for their critical role in the almond pollination season in California. Average reported losses since the preceding spring exceeded 60%, with substantial variation among operations. Many colonies were still actively collapsing in January, 2025, when pooled and individual samples were collected then screened for levels of known honey bee pathogens and parasites. Deformed wing virus strains A and B, along with Acute bee paralysis virus, were found at unusually high levels, either in pooled colony samples or in individual bees exhibiting shaking behaviors and morbidity.

Differences between these two analyses suggest that direct collections of morbid bees provide a superior diagnostic for causal viruses, a suggestion borne out by confirmation of symptoms and morbidity following isolation and new inoculations. Since these viruses are known to be vectored by parasitic Varroa mites, mites from collapsed colonies were in turn screened for resistance to amitraz, a critical miticide used widely by beekeepers. Miticide resistance was found in all collected Varroa, underscoring the urgent need for new control strategies for this parasite. While viruses are a likely end-stage cause of colony death, other stressors such as nutritional stress and agrochemicals may have also played significant roles."
"Global epistasis is a phenomenon in which the effects of genetic perturbations depend on the fitness of the individuals in which they occur. In populations with natural genetic variation, global epistasis arises from interactions between perturbations and polymorphic loci that are mediated by fitness. To investigate the prevalence and characteristics of loci involved in these interactions in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we used combinatorial DNA barcode sequencing to measure the fitness of 169 cross progeny (segregants) subjected to 8,126 CRISPRi perturbations across two environments. Global epistasis was evident in these data, with more fit segregants within each environment exhibiting greater sensitivity to genetic perturbations than less fit segregants. We dissected the genetic basis of this global epistasis by scanning the genome for loci whose effects covary with CRISPRi-induced reductions in population fitness. This approach identified 58 loci that interact with fitness, most of which exhibited larger effects in the absence of genetic perturbations. In aggregate, these loci explained the observed global epistasis in each environment and demonstrated that the loci contributing to global epistasis largely overlap with those influencing fitness in unperturbed conditions."
"Bridging the gap between how breeding genotypes perform in trials and how they might fare as commercial varieties or cultivars remains one of the enduring challenges in plant breeding, further compounded by the complexities of genotype-by-environment (GxE) interactions. This study implemented and evaluated an unstructured -  uns - bivariate enviromic reaction-norm model capable of predicting breeding genotypes  as cultivars by integrating genomic and environmental data. All model components were developed from scratch in R, ensuring full methodological transparency and reproducibility. The model jointly estimated genetic and residual variance-covariance matrices for experimental trials and commercial stands using a derivative-free restricted maximum likelihood (DF-REML) approach with the BOBYQA algorithm. Results demonstrated that employing a SNP-based genomic relationship matrix yielded biologically consistent estimates and enabled the construction of spatial recommendation maps for genotype deployment across diverse environments (e.g., in fields established by farmers or growers). These findings underscore the importance of modeling experimental versus commercial performance as distinct but genetically correlated traits, while also demonstrating the feasibility of implementing complex enviromic models without reliance on specialized software. This approach offers methodological advances for predictive breeding, supporting more efficient selection and reducing reliance on extensive multi-environment trials."
"Spatial transcriptomics (ST) promises to reveal the principles of tissue organization and regional variation. With the advent of high-resolution capture-based ST methods such as Visium HD, new approaches are needed that faithfully assign transcripts to individual cells and enable the analysis of cells in complex tissue substructures. Here we introduce the Segmentation and Manifold UnRolling Framework (SMURF), a computational tool for the analysis of high-resolution ST data. SMURF introduces a novel ""soft-segmentation"" approach that accurately aggregates and assigns the mRNAs from capture spots to nearby cells. SMURF is also able to ""unroll"" cells contained in complex tissue structures and place them on standard Cartesian coordinates, thus empowering studies of cellular organization and regional specification. We demonstrate the power of SMURF in the mouse small intestine. We identified the zonation of metabolic programs along the maturing intestinal villus and the transcription factors that regulate them. We used SMURF to investigate an important outstanding question - how are functionally important proximal-to-distal gene expression gradients in the intestine specified. We discovered that regionally specific gene programs along the proximal-distal axis accumulate in the villus tip and that the tip is reprogrammed by environmental signals in the lumen, suggesting these inputs are a major determinant of regional transcriptional identity. SMURF promises to accelerate the effective use of high-resolution ST data by enabling more accurate segmentation and assignment of mRNAs to cells and by providing a unique toolbox for the analysis of regional transcriptional programs along tissue manifolds."
"Crossing-over between Chr X and Chr Y was first observed 90 years ago, in the brown rat, Rattus norvegicus. However, the sequence of the rat pseudoautosomal region (PAR) has remained a mystery. We produced a near-complete sequence of Chr Y from the SHR strain, along with nearly a megabase of sequence from both telomeres of Chr X. Both telomeric ends of Chr Y display extensive homology to Chr X, but no homology to the ancestral PAR of placental mammals. Using rat Y BACs probes for FISH on meiotic cells, we show that pairing almost always occurs between the tips of Yq and Xp, which are virtually identical in nucleotide sequence, but contain no protein-coding genes. Homology at the other ends of Chr X and Chr Y is likely the result of a recent transposition of five genes from Xq to Yp. These sequences are only 99.5% identical and pair infrequently, but show signs that it may have been pseudoautosomal in the ancestor of the rat genus. The rat Chr Y sequence presents opportunities for experimental studies of meiotic phenomena in a tractable model organism. The short PAR, with a correspondingly high recombination rate, represents a unique substrate for molecular studies of crossing-over. Likewise, the absence of extensively co-amplified testis gene families on the rat X and Y suggests they might serve as control for the intense competition between selfish elements that completely remodeled the mouse sex chromosomes."
"BackgroundUnderstanding heterogeneity in sperm motility requires tools capable of capturing both dynamic patterns and interpretable structure. Symbolic encoding methods offer a novel way to represent motion trajectories through discrete motifs.

ObjectiveThis study explores whether symbolic time-series representations can uncover latent structure in sperm motility data, focusing on patterns of symbolic monotony and entropy.

MethodsWe applied Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX) to 1176 sperm trajectories and computed motif entropy and dominance across multiple parameterizations (a = 3-7, k = 2-4). Trajectories were embedded using UMAP and evaluated for symbolic convergence.

ResultsA compact trajectory cluster (82/1176, 7%) consistently emerged across SAX configurations, characterized by very low entropy (median: 0.00) and high motif dominance (median: 0.97), with >85% of motifs consisting of the ""DDD"" triplet. The cluster exhibited a markedly negative VSL slope (median: -0.00021), in contrast to non-clustered trajectories (median: +0.00002). No external labels were available to determine functional significance.

ConclusionsSymbolic encoding revealed a highly consistent pattern of motion monotony. While these findings may reflect constrained or declining motility, their biological interpretation remains uncertain. Symbolic representations may serve as useful hypothesis-generating tools in the discovery of emergent sperm motility phenotypes."
"Mass spectrometry (MS) is the method of choice for high-throughput identification of immunopeptides, which are generated by intracellular proteases, unlike proteomics peptides that are typically derived from trypsin-digested proteins. Therefore, the searching space for immunopeptides is not limited by proteolytic specificity, requiring more sophisticated software algorithms to handle the increased complexity. Despite the widespread use of MS in immunopeptidomics, there is a lack of systematic evaluation of data processing software, making it challenging to identify the optimal solution. In this study, we provide a comprehensive benchmarking of the most widespread/used data-dependent acquisition (DDA)-based software platforms for immunopeptidomics: MaxQuant, FragPipe, PEAKS and MHCquant. The evaluation was conducted using data obtained from the JY cell line using the Thunder-DDA-PASEF method. We assessed each softwares ability to identify immunopeptides and compared their identification confidence. Additionally, we examined potential biases in the results and tested the impact of database size on immunopeptide identification efficiency. Our findings demonstrate that all software platforms successfully identify the most prominent subset of immunopeptides with 1% false discovery rate (FDR) control, achieving medium to high identification confidence correlations. The largest number of immunopeptides were identified using the commercial PEAKS software, which is closely followed by FragPipe, making it a viable non-commercial alternative. However, we observed that larger database sizes negatively impacted the performance of some software platforms more than others. These results provide valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of current MS data processing tools for immunopeptidomics, supporting the immunopeptidomics/MS community in determining the right choice of software."
"Peptides and proteins produced by programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) are well-known in viruses. In non-viral systems, only a few examples of such chimeric sequences have been documented until recently. Two new studies, one in humans and one in plants, showed that chimeric peptides are numerous and diverse. In humans, their discovery was possible due to focusing on sequences with naturally repeated codons. This way, many candidate sequences with mass spectrometry (MS) proteomics-based support for translation have been identified. In the plant study, our group discovered MS-validated chimeric peptides using a unique modeling algorithm, which is described and made available here. Our pipeline enables the identification of chimeric peptides in any organism for which transcript sequences and MS proteomic data are available. By design, our approach does not require prior knowledge about sequence similarity to already characterized PRF sites and can detect forward and backward frameshifts by 1 and 2 nucleotides. Thus, our pipeline opens a path for uncovering previously unknown PRF events across various transcript types, potentially broadening our understanding of proteome diversity."
"It was long suspected that for specific DNA binding by a transcription factor, the flanks of the binding motifs can play an important role. By a thorough analysis of the DNA sequence in the broad context (5000 bp) of in vivo binding sites (as identified in a ChIP-seq or a Cut&Tag experiment), we show that the average GC content is in most cases statistically significantly increased around the binding site in a patch spanning 1000- 1500 bp. This increase was observed consistently in experiment targeting the same TF in different cell lines. The surrounding of binding sites of certain TFs like MYC display a directional alteration of dinucleotide frequencies. We attempt to explain these preferences by alteration in DNA shape features as well as by potential cooperation with other TFs. We observed differences in sequence affinity to various potential cooperating TFs between cell lines. Altogether, we propose that the observed feature distortion is indicative of a coarse scanning mechanism that helps TFs find the target binding site."
"MotivationEnrichment analysis across multiple databases often results in a high level of redundancy due to overlapping terms, complicating the interpretation of biological data. To address this, we developed SummArIzeR, an R package to cluster and annotate enrichment results across multiple databases, enabling fast, intuitive interpretation and comparison across multiple conditions. SummArIzeR clusters enrichment results based on shared genes, calculates a pooled p-value for each cluster and facilitates the cluster annotation using large-language models. It further allows an easyly interpretable vizualisisation of the results.

ResultsCompared to existing tools, SummArIzeR provides unbiased and fast cluster annotation using large language models. We demonstrate that SummArIzeR achieves clustering comparable to manual curation while offering superior grouping based on shared underlying genes.

Availability and ImplementationThe SummArIzeR package is available as an open-source R package, with a comprehensive user manual provided in its GitHub repository: https://github.com/bonellilab/SummArIzeR."
"Single-cell sequencing has revolutionized biomedical research by uncovering cellular heterogeneity in disease mechanisms, with significant potential for advancing personalized medicine. However, participation in single-cell data analysis is limited by the programming experience required to access data. Several existing browsers allow the interrogation of single-cell data through a point-and-click interface accessible to non-programmers, but many of these browsers are limited in the depth of analysis that can be performed, or the flexibility of input data formats accepted. Thus, programming experience is still required for comprehensive data analysis. We developed scExploreR to address these limitations and extend the range of analysis tasks that can be performed by non-programmers. scExploreR is implemented as a packaged R Shiny app that can be run locally or easily deployed for multiple users on a server. scExploreR offers extensive customization options for plots, allowing users to generate publication quality figures. Leveraging our SCUBA package, scExploreR seamlessly handles multimodal data, providing identical plotting capabilities regardless of input format. By empowering researchers to directly explore and analyze single-cell data, scExploreR bridges communication gaps between biological and computational scientists, streamlining insight generation."
"Histopathological data are foundational in both biological research and clinical diagnostics but remain siloed from modern multimodal and single-cell frameworks. We introduce LazySlide, an open-source Python package built on the scverse ecosystem for efficient whole-slide image (WSI) analysis and multimodal integration. By leveraging vision-language foundation models and adhering to scverse data standards, LazySlide bridges histopathology with omics workflows. It supports tissue and cell segmentation, feature extraction, cross-modal querying, and zero-shot classification, with minimal setup. Its modular design empowers both novice and expert users, lowering the barrier to advanced histopathology analysis and accelerating AI-driven discovery in tissue biology and pathology."
"SummaryThe number of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) is rapidly increasing with the growing scale of metagenomic studies, driving fast progress in microbiome research. Sample-wise assembly has become the standard due to its computational efficiency and strain-level resolution. It requires dereplication, the removal of near-identical genomes assembled in different metagenomic samples. We present MAGmax, an efficient dereplication tool that enhances both the quantity and quality of MAGs through a strategy of bin merging and re-assembly. Unlike dRep, which selects a single representative bin per genome cluster, MAGmax merges multiple bins within a cluster and reassembles them to increase coverage. MAGmax produces more dereplicated, higher-quality MAGs than dRep at 1.6x its speed and using three times less memory.

Availability and implementationThe MAGmax open source software, implemented in Rust, is available under the GPLv3 license at https://github.com/soedinglab/MAGmax."
"Mutual information (MI) has been traditionally employed in many areas including biology to identify the non-linear relationships between features. This technique is particularly useful in the biological context to identify features such as genes, histone post-translational modifications (PTMs), transcriptional factors etc. In this work, instead of considering the conventional pairwise MI between PTM features, we evaluate multivariate mutual information (MMI) between PTM triplets, to identify a set of outlier features. This enables us to form a small subset of PTMs that serve as principal features for the prediction of the values of any histone PTM across the epigenome. We also compare the principal MMI features with those from the traditional feature selection techniques such as PCA and Orthogonal Matching Pursuit. We predict all the remaining histone PTM intensities using XGBoost based regression on the selected features. The accuracy of this technique is demonstrated on the ChIP-seq datasets from the yeast and the human epigenomes.The results indicate that the proposed MMI based feature selection technique can serve as a useful method across various biological datasets."
"Deep learning methods like AlphaFold2 have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in predicting static protein structures. However, accurately modeling alternative conformations and dynamic structures remains a significant challenge. Here, we introduce trRosettaX2-Dynamics (trX2-D), a novel approach to addressing this challenge through physics-based iterative sampling of the trRosettaX2-predicted inter-residue geometric distributions. trX2-D was first pre-trained on high-resolution X-ray structures and then fine-tuned on [~]7,000 dynamic NMR structures, enhancing its inherent ability to predict alternative conformations and dynamic structures. Leveraging a transformer-based neural network, it first predicts an initial set of inter-residue geometric constraints, which are then sampled to generate dynamic structures iteratively, without requiring any prior knowledge of native structural states. Comprehensive benchmarks on three datasets, two for alternative conformations and one for dynamic structures, demonstrate that trX2-D shows promise in predicting alternative conformations and capturing structural dynamics. This work illustrates the potential of combining deep learning predictions with physics-based sampling for advancing the prediction of protein dynamic structures."
"Cells regularly adapt their metabolism in response to changes in their microenvironment or biosynthetic needs. Prostate cancer cells leverage this metabolic plasticity to evade therapies targeting the androgen receptor (AR) signaling pathway. For example, nucleotide metabolism plays a critical role in treatment-resistant prostate cancer by supporting DNA replication, DNA damage response and cell fate decisions. Identifying novel regulators of nucleotide metabolism in treatment-resistant cancer that are dispensable for the health of normal cells may lead to new therapeutic approaches less toxic than commonly used chemotherapies targeting nucleotide metabolism. We identify the metabolic enzyme Oxoglutarate Dehydrogenase-Like (OGDHL), named for its structural similarity to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzyme Oxoglutarate Dehydrogenase (OGDH), as a regulator of nucleotide metabolism, tumor growth, and treatment-induced plasticity in prostate cancer. While OGDHL is a tumor-suppressor in various cancers, we find that its loss impairs prostate cancer cell proliferation and tumor formation while having minimal impact on TCA cycle activity. Loss of OGDHL profoundly decreases nucleotide metabolite pools, induces the DNA damage response marker {gamma}2AX, and alters androgen receptor inhibition-induced plasticity, including suppressing the neuroendocrine markers DLL3 and HES6. Finally, OGDHL is highly expressed in neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC). These findings support an unexpected role of OGDHL in prostate cancer, where it functions to sustain nucleotide pools for proliferation, DNA repair, and AR inhibition-induced plasticity."
"Polysaccharides are the main components present in plant cell walls. They form a network that is dynamically modified during growth and upon both abiotic and biotic stress. We investigated how the cell wall of Arabidopsis rosettes is remodeled during periods of dark-induced starvation in the wild type and in plastidic phosphoglucomutase (pgm) mutants, which suffer from periodic starvation due to starch deficiency. Time-course analysis demonstrated that up to one fifth of the galactose present in leaf cell walls is reversibly released upon starvation, while other cell wall monosaccharides were less affected. An investigation of BETA-GALACTOSIDASE (BGAL) expression and the analysis of bgal mutants indicated that BGAL1 and BGAL4 contribute to the release of cell wall galactose upon starvation. Increased transcript abundance of UDP-GLUCOSE 4-EPIMERASE (UGE) 1 and 3 under starvation proposed an increased flux through the galactose salvage pathway, however an analysis of the UDP- galactose pool in mutant plants indicated redundancy with other UGEs. Simultaneously to galactan degradation, GALACTAN SYNTHASE1 (GALS1) expression was reduced, attenuating the synthesis of new galactan chains. We show that overexpression of GALS1 prevents depletion of the recyclable cell wall galactose pool and is sufficient to rescue impaired penetration resistance to the hemibiotrophic fungal pathogen Colletotrichum higginsianum upon dark-induced and periodic starvation. Our data suggest that pectic galactan in the plant cell wall serves as a sugar resource during starvation conditions. However, galactose release from the wall leads to impaired penetration resistance against a fungal pathogen, causing a tradeoff between sugar supply for plant metabolism and preformed defense.

Significance statementPolysaccharides present in plant cell walls must be dynamically modified in response to external stimuli, but it is not well understood how cell wall remodeling is adjusted in response to metabolic cues and how this affects defense against pathogens. Here, we report that galactose is reversibly released from cell walls upon carbon starvation, which critically affects penetration resistance to a fungal pathogen."
"As in mammals, the plant embryo is surrounded by maternal tissues that provide protection from the external environment. In angiosperms, a double fertilization process results in the formation of a diploid embryo and a triploid endosperm, both of which develop within maternal sporophytic integuments. Thus, the seed of angiosperms is a combined structure of three genetically distinct components: embryo, endosperm, and maternal integuments. It has long been assumed that the maternal plant influences embryo development, but there is limited molecular evidence for a direct pathway through which the maternal sporophyte aYects embryogenesis. Here we show that secondary small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) generated upon exosome impairment lead to embryo abortion through a maternal sporophytic eYect. Depletion of the core subunit of the RNA-processing exosome RRP45B (CER7) causes globular embryo arrest connected to ectopic post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS). Seed coat expression of CER7 suppresses seed abortion, demonstrating a maternal sporophytic control of embryo development through an RNA decay safeguard pathway. Our data support a model in which a primary siRNA trigger originates in the maternal integuments of the cer7 seed coat and drives PTGS amplification in reproductive tissues after fertilization, ultimately leading to seed abortion. In addition, our genetic and molecular data suggest that overloading of AGO1 with siRNAs impairs miRNA function, likely leading to embryo arrest. Our data highlight the complex interplay between maternal and embryonic gene regulation, reinforcing the importance of controlled RNA decay in plant development."
"We built and characterised a mass spectrometer capable of performing CID (both beam type and resonant type), UVPD, EID and ECD in an automated fashion during an LCMS type experiment. We exploited this ability to generate large datasets through multienzyme deep proteomics experiments for characterisation of these activation techniques. As a further step, motivated by the complexity generated by these dissociation techniques, we developed a single Prosit deep learning model for fragment ion intensity prediction covering all of these techniques. The generated model has been made publicly available and has been utilised in FragPipe within its MSBooster module. Rescoring allowed both data-dependent acquisition (DDA) and data-independent acquisition (DIA) to achieve on average more than 10% increase in protein identifications across all dissociation techniques and enzymatic digestions. We demonstrate that these alternative fragmentation approaches can now be used within standard data analysis pipelines and can produce data competitive to CID in terms of eficiency, but in the cases of EID and UVPD with far richer and more comprehensive spectra."
"Across teleosts, feeding by biting substrate-attached prey has evolved multiple times and is associated with convergent morphologies that include a deep body and an elongated, tapered head. However, the functional role of these morphologies in substrate-biting fish is not established. Here, we tested the hypothesis that these morphologies function as control surfaces that affect feeding kinematics during biting. To test this hypothesis, we used simplified physical models of substrate-biting fish and examined the role of head, body, and fin morphology in determining feeding kinematics that facilitate the removal of substrate-attached prey. Models simulated the swift lateral movement of the head, previously documented in species biting substrate-attached algae. Using models that capture the natural morphological variation of biters, we tested (i) how different head morphologies affect the speed of the head and (ii) how different body morphologies affect the stability of the body during head movements. We found that the moment of inertia (MOI) of the head and body explained most of the variation in head speed and body displacement. A decrease in head MOI resulted in faster lateral head movements, known to facilitate removal of attached prey. An increase in body MOI, relative to that of the head, stabilized the lateral displacement of the body during bites. Overall, our results suggest that the laterally compressed bodies and tapered snouts function as control surfaces during feeding in substrate-biting fish. We propose that a selective pressure to extend the lateral surface area underlies the prevailing morphological convergence of biting reef fishes."
"Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a group of heterogeneous, behaviorally defined neurodevelopmental conditions influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Here, we show that nutrients--an important environmental factor--can modulate synaptic proteomes, reconfigure neural ensembles, and improve social behaviors in ASD mouse genetic models. We analyzed Tbr1+/- mice, a well-established model of ASD, using proteomic approaches and in vivo calcium imaging. Synaptic and metabolic proteomes were found to be sensitive to Tbr1 haploinsufficiency. Our results also revealed that Tbr1 haploinsufficiency promotes hyperactivation and hyperconnectivity of basolateral amygdala (BLA) neurons, enhancing the activity correlation between individual neurons and their corresponding ensembles. Zinc, branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), and serine--all nutrients known to regulate synapse formation and activity--were then combined into supplement cocktails and administered to Tbr1+/- mice. This treatment altered synaptic and metabolic proteomes and normalized the activity and connectivity of the BLA in Tbr1+/- mice during social interactions. We further show that although a low dose of individual nutrients did not alter social behaviors, treatment with supplement cocktails containing low-dose individual nutrients improved social behaviors and associative memory of Tbr1+/- mice, implying a synergistic effect of combining low-dose zinc, BCAA, and serine. Moreover, the supplement cocktails also improved social behaviors in Nf1+/- and Cttnbp2+/M120I mice, two additional ASD mouse models. Thus, our findings reveal aberrant neural connectivity in the BLA of Tbr1+/- mice and indicate that dietary supplementation with zinc, BCAA, and/or serine offers a safe and accessible approach to mitigate neural connectivity and social behaviors across multiple ASD models."
"Nicotine pouches are increasingly popular as a smokeless alternative to tobacco, yet their long-term neurological effects remain poorly understood. In this preclinical study, we investigated the time-dependent impact of oral nicotine pouch exposure on seizure susceptibility, glymphatic function, and neuroinflammation in mice, and evaluated the therapeutic potential of inhaled cannabidiol (CBD). Using the Racine scale, we found that acute nicotine exposure transiently reduced seizure severity, while chronic exposure significantly exacerbated seizures and impaired glymphatic integrity, as evidenced by downregulation of aquaporin-4 (AQP4). Chronic nicotine also elevated circulating levels of HMGB1 and IL-6, indicating sustained systemic inflammation. Notably, inhaled CBD reversed these pathological changes, reducing seizure severity, restoring AQP4 expression, and normalizing inflammatory markers. Molecular analyses further revealed upregulation of BDNF and c-FOS with chronic nicotine exposure, which was also mitigated by CBD.

In conclusion, these findings suggest that while nicotine pouches may confer short-term neurophysiological modulation, chronic use poses significant risks for seizure vulnerability and glymphatic dysfunction. Inhaled CBD demonstrates strong neuroprotective potential and may serve as a promising therapeutic approach for individuals exposed to prolonged nicotine use.

"Variation in antibody (Ab) responses contributes to disease outcomes and therapeutic responsiveness, the determinants of which remain incompletely understood. This study demonstrates that polymorphisms in immunoglobulin kappa (IGK) and lambda (IGL) loci influence baseline differences in the Ab repertoire that preclude antigen-driven responses. We pair IGK/IGL genomic sequencing with Ab repertoire profiling to comprehensively resolve coding and non-coding single nucleotide and structural variants that explain gene usage variation at >70% of light chain genes, with direct impacts on the amino acid composition of complementarity determining regions. The identification of both intergenic and coding repertoire-associated variants indicates genetic modulation of gene usage via diverse mechanisms. Relative to IGL, IGK is characterized by extensive linkage disequilibrium and genetic co-regulation of gene usage, highlighting differential regulatory and evolutionary features. These results establish the contribution of IG polymorphism in the formation of the Ab repertoire, shedding light on our understanding of Ab-mediated immunity.

TeaserThis study demonstrates that germline polymorphisms in the immunoglobulin light chain loci modulate inter-individual variation in the repertoire of expressed antibody light chains, directly influencing the composition of the antibody antigen-binding landscape through impacts on light chain gene usage."
"Rising ocean temperatures pose significant threats to marine ectotherms. Sensitivity to temperature change varies across life stages, with embryos often being less tolerant to thermal perturbation than adults. Antarctic notothenioid fishes evolved to occupy a narrow, cold thermal regime (-2 to +2{degrees}C) as the high-latitude Southern Ocean (SO) cooled to its present icy temperatures, and they are particularly vulnerable to small temperature changes, which makes them ideal sentinel species for assessing climate change impacts. Here, we detail how predicted warming of the SO may affect embryonic development in the Antarctic bullhead notothen, Notothenia coriiceps. Experimental embryos were incubated at +4{degrees}C, a temperature projected for the high-latitude SO within the next 100-200 years under high emission climate models, whereas control embryos were incubated at present-day ambient temperature, [~]0{degrees}C. Elevated temperature caused a high incidence of embryonic morphological abnormalities, including body axis kinking/curvature and reduced body size. Experimental embryos also developed more rapidly, such that they hatched 68 days earlier than controls (87 vs. 155 days post-fertilization). Accelerated development disrupted the evolved timing of seasonal hatching, shifting larval emergence into the polar winter when food availability is scarce. Transcriptomic analyses revealed molecular signatures of hypoxia and disrupted protein-folding in near-hatching embryos, indicative of severe cellular stress. Predictive modeling suggested that temperature-induced developmental disruptions would narrow seasonal reproductive windows, thereby threatening population viability under future climate scenarios. Together, our findings underscore the vulnerability of Antarctic fish embryos to higher water temperature and highlight the urgent need to understand the consequences of disruption of this important trophic component on ecosystem stability in the SO.

Significance StatementAntarctic fishes evolved cold-adapted phenotypes suited to the stable thermal conditions of the Southern Ocean, yet are threatened by rising temperatures. The impact of rising temperatures on early life stages in Antarctic fishes is not well understood; our findings show that projected warming may induce premature hatching, developmental abnormalities, and molecular stress responses in embryos, potentially reducing recruitment and leading to population instability and trophic-level ecosystem disruptions. These results underscore the urgency of assessing climate-driven vulnerabilities across life stages of Antarctic marine organisms to refine population projections and enhance conservation strategies amid ongoing environmental change."
"Granulosa cells (GCs), as the largest somatic cell group in follicles, provide nutrients and microenvironment for oocyte growth and maturation. GC proliferation and apoptosis are influenced by several genes, with the Kruppel Like Factor 12 (KLF12) gene contributing to the modulation of several cellular activities. Nevertheless, the precise modulatory function of this gene within the context of ovarian GCs remains unelucidated. We cloned the KLF12 gene of New Zealand female rabbits, and evaluated its expression and localization in the ovaries of female rabbits of different ages by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). In order to determine the role of KLF12 in ovarian GCs, we used qRT-PCR, WB, CCK-8 and Annexin V-FITC/PI to detect the effect of KLF12 on GCs proliferation and apoptosis. The coding sequence of KLF12 gene of New Zealand female rabbit was predicted and cloned for the first time in this study. The coding region was 1209 bp, encoding 402 amino acids. KLF12 overexpression has a negative effect on the proliferation and cell cycle progression of rabbit GCs. KLF12 knockdown partially rescues GCs proliferation, accelerates GCs cycle progression, and promotes Estradiol (E2) and Progesterone (P) secretion. In addition, KLF12 was also proved to be a key regulator of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in GCs. In conclusion, the study provides evidence that KLF12 plays a pivotal role in the maturation and proliferation of ovarian GCs in female rabbits. This work establishes a conceptual foundation for investigating deeper into the possible regulatory mechanisms underlying follicular development and growth.

Author summaryGCs are essential for oocyte growth, not only providing necessary nutritional support for oocyte growth and maturation, but also constructing a key microenvironment. In this study, the biological function of KLF12 gene was systematically elucidated in rabbit for the first time. It was found that KLF12 inhibited follicular development by negatively regulating GCs proliferation and cell cycle. Combined with its effect on E2 and P secretion, the important regulatory role of KLF12 in follicular maturation and hormone balance was revealed. These innovative findings not only deepen the understanding of the regulatory network of ovarian development, but also provide a new theoretical basis for the basic research of reproductive biology. More importantly, it provides a potential molecular target for the development of new technologies to improve the reproductive efficiency of livestock. It also provides a valuable reference model for the study of the mechanism of human reproductive dysfunction related diseases."
"Rice cultivation in Europe is declining as consumers increasingly prefer imported exotic varieties, such as aromatic and basmati rice, which are prone to fraudulent varietal claims due to their higher market value. To address this issue, we sequenced 20 high-value rice cultivars circulating in the Mediterranean market, analyzing their phylogeny and whole-genome polymorphisms. Our results revealed that two basmati varieties are genetically closer to two Mediterranean varieties, and that no direct link exists between genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) patterns and the rice commercial category. We further discuss genes located in previously described quantitative trait loci (QTLs) related to eating quality and seed properties. A variant in the WX1 gene, associated with higher amylose content, was found in both the Basmati group and Mediterranean varieties. Additionally, a SNP that could disrupt the drought tolerance gene OsbHLH148 was identified in five European varieties, while a variant affecting splicing of OsPol lambda, related to drought response, was present in four of those. This data could assist certification offices in reducing fraud in the rice market and provide valuable insights for researchers and breeders, particularly regarding the production, consumption, and adaptation of these cultivars to the Mediterranean region."
"Structural variants such as chromosomal rearrangements and gene duplications can play an important role in the adaptation and diversification of organisms. Here, we used comparative genomics to study the functional implications of structural variants across two families of flies. We compared the reference genomes of eight Asilidae species and six Stratiomyidae species, including the black soldier fly (Hermetia illucens), a species with an ability to convert organic waste into biomass and a recently expanded global range. The genomes of Stratiomyidae are generally larger than Asilidae and contain a higher proportion of transposable elements, many of which are recently expanded. Gene families showing more gene duplications are enriched for life history related functions such as metabolism in Stratiomyidae and proteolysis and longevity in Asilidae. Gene families showing more gene duplications that are specific to H. illucens are mostly related to olfactory and immune responses, while across the Stratiomyidae there is enrichment of digestive and metabolic functions such as proteolysis. Together, our results shed light on gene family expansions that have likely played a role in the ecological success of the black soldier fly."
"As sequencing technologies advance and costs decline, there has been a surge in the application of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in understanding biological processes. In addition to the typical uses of RNA-seq for transcriptomics, gene annotation, novel gene discovery, and network analysis, these data can enable a deeper understanding of cellular processes through the identification of RNA modifications (epitranscriptome) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). To expedite discovery, we developed a portable, centralized computational pipeline for High-throughput Annotation of Modified Ribonucleotides and Long Non-Coding ribonucleic acids (HAMRLNC). HAMRLNC differs from existing methods by incorporating three workflows for quantifying transcript abundance, inferring RNA modifications, and lncRNA annotation using the same RNA- seq pre-processing and mapping steps. This facilitates reproducibility across multiple analyses and allows researchers to perform post-hoc analyses of archived sequencing data. In addition, we include novel analysis features to enable downstream visualization of annotated modified RNAs. HAMRLNC generates over a dozen well-defined and labeled figures as output, including gene ontology heatmaps, modification enrichment landscape, and modification clustering statistics.

Availability and ImplementationHAMRLNC is an open-source software, and the source code is available at https://github.com/bdgregory/HAMRLNC. The pipeline can be installed and used through a docker container (https://hub.docker.com/r/chosenobih/HAMRLNC/tags). HAMRLNC is also available as an app in the CyVerse Discovery Environment https://de.cyverse.org/.

"Structural elucidation using untargeted tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) has played a critical role in advancing scientific discovery [1, 2]. However, differentiating molecular fragmentation patterns between isobaric structures remains a prominent challenge in metabolomics [3-10], drug discovery [11-13], and reaction screening [14-17], presenting a significant barrier to the cost-effective and rapid identification of unknown molecular structures. Here, we present a geometric deep learning model, ICEBERG, that simulates collision-induced dissociation in mass spectrometry to generate chemically plausible fragments and their relative intensities with awareness of collision energies and polarities. We utilize ICEBERG predictions to facilitate structure elucidation by ranking a set of candidate structures based on the similarity between their predicted in silico MS/MS spectra and an experimental MS/MS spectrum of interest. This integrated elucidation pipeline enables state-of-the-art performance in compound annotation, with 40% top-1 accuracy on the NIST20 [M+H]+ adduct subset and with 92% of correct structures appearing in the top ten predictions in the same dataset. We demonstrate several real-world case studies, including identifying clinical biomarkers of depression and tuberculous meningitis, annotating an aqueous abiotic degradation product of the pesticide thiophanate methyl, disambiguating isobaric products in pooled reaction screening, and annotating biosynthetic pathways in Withania somnifera. Overall, this deep learning-based, chemically-interpretable paradigm for structural elucidation enables rapid molecular annotation from complex mixtures, driving discoveries across diverse scientific domains."
"PurposeRadiopharmaceutical therapies (RPTs) are showing significant value in targeting various forms of cancer; meanwhile, as an emerging paradigm there is significant room for optimization of RPTs. We developed a computational model towards improving therapeutic strategies via modification of dosage and timing of RPT injections.

MethodsOur model simulates tumor growth, the pharmacokinetics of RPTs, and the radiobiological impact of radionuclide decay through energy deposition on tumor tissue. Specifically, we use the Hybrid Automata Library (HAL) to simulate tissue containing a heterogeneous tumor and its vasculature, along with oxygen and radiopharmaceutical concentration. Therapeutic interventions are modeled using a multiscale approach that connects whole-body compartmental modeling of radiopharmaceutical concentrations to the linear-quadratic survival model for tumor cells. We evaluated several treatment schedules applied to tumors with different conditions resulting in insights on how to improve RPTs.

ResultsTumors with varying vascular densities responded differently to identical therapeutic regimens. We also found that the timing and frequency of therapeutic interventions played important roles in the effectiveness of RPTs. Overall, we demonstrated that a one-size-fits-all approach is inadequate for achieving optimal therapies.

ConclusionsOur model provided insights for improving treatment schedules that highlight the potential for personalized approaches to achieve better outcomes. The code for the model is publicly available on GitHub: github.com/Elahe-hmh/HAL_RPT"
"Organotropism results from the functional versatility of metastatic cancer cells to survive and proliferate in diverse microenvironments. This adaptivity can originate in clonal variation of the spreading tumor and is often empowered by epigenetic and molecular reprogramming of cell regulatory circuits. Related to organotropic colonization of metastatic sites are environmentally-sensitive, differential responses of cancer cells to therapeutic attack. Accordingly, understanding the organotropic profile of a cancer and probing the underlying driver mechanisms are of high clinical importance. However, determining systematically the organotropism of one cancer versus the organotropism of another cancer, potentially with the granularity of comparing the same cancer type between patients or tracking the evolution of a cancer in a single patient for the purpose of personalized treatment, has remained very challenging. It requires a host organism that allows observation of the spreading pattern over relatively short experimental times. Moreover, organotropic patterns often tend to be statistically weak and superimposed by experimental variation. Thus, an assay for organotropism must give access to statistical powers that can separate  meaningful heterogeneity, i.e., heterogeneity that determines organotropism, from  meaningless heterogeneity, i.e., heterogeneity that causes experimental noise. Here we describe an experimental workflow that leverages the physiological properties of zebrafish larvae for an imaging-based assessment of organotropic patterns over a time-frame of 3 days. The workflow incorporates computer vision pipelines to automatically integrate the stochastic spreading behavior of a particular cancer xenograft in tens to hundreds of larvae allowing subtle trends in the colonization of particular organs to emerge above random cell depositions throughout the host organism. We validate our approach with positive control experiments comparing the spreading patterns of a metastatic sarcoma against non-transformed fibroblasts and the spreading patterns of two melanoma cell lines with previously established differences in metastatic propensity. We then show that integration of the spreading pattern of xenografts in 40 - 50 larvae is necessary and sufficient to generate a Fish Metastatic Atlas page that is representative of the organotropism of a particular oncogenotype and experimental condition. Finally, we apply the power of this assay to determine the function of the EWSR1::FLI1 fusion oncogene and its transcriptional target SOX6 as plasticity factors that enhance the adaptive capacity of metastatic Ewing sarcoma."
"Physical activity improves health, yet the molecular mechanisms remain partially understood. This study presents a high-resolution, time-resolved atlas profiling 10,127 proteins across plasma, saliva, and urine from healthy adults post-acute exercise. Exercise regulated over 3,000 proteins, revealing distinct, fluid-specific temporal dynamics. By integrating fluid-specific exercise signatures with tissue and disease atlases, we delineated the contribution of tissues and associations to various diseases. Network analysis across body fluids elucidated coordinated remodeling in the extracellular matrix and immune activation orchestrating exercise-induced networks. Many exercise-responsive plasma proteins were robust across age, sex, and exercise modalities, indicating a conserved systemic signature. Integration with genetic data established exercise-regulated proteins as modulators of metabolic traits and identified over 200 targeted by approved drugs, highlighting their impact on disease-relevant pathways. This comprehensive atlas, available as an open-access resource https://cbmr.ku.dk/research/research-groups/deshmukh-group/shiny-apps/, advances our molecular insight into exercise adaptations and enables exerkine discovery, biomarker development, and pharmacological exercise-mimetic strategies.

"Visual rivalry paradigms provide a powerful tool for probing the mechanisms of visual awareness and perceptual suppression. While the dynamics and determinants of perceptual switches in visual rivalry have been extensively studied and modeled, recent advances in experimental design - particularly those that quantify the depth and variability of perceptual suppression - have outpaced the development of computational models. Here we extend an existing dynamical model of binocular rivalry to encompass two novel experimental paradigms: a threshold detection variant of binocular rivalry, and tracking continuous flash suppression. Together, these tasks provide complementary measures of the dynamics and magnitude of perceptual suppression. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that a single mechanism, competitive (hysteretic) inhibition between slowly adapting monocular populations, can account for the suppression depth findings across both paradigms. This unified model offers a foundation for the development of a quantitative theory of perceptual suppression in visual rivalry."
"The central nervous system is characterized by its limited regenerative potential, yet striking examples of functional recovery after injury in animal models and humans highlight its capacity for repair. Little is known about repair of pathways/circuits after traumatic brain injury (TBI), which results in disruption of connectivity. Here we utilize a mouse model of diffuse traumatic axonal injury (Impact-acceleration TBI) in order to explore, for the first time, the evolution of structural and functional changes in the terminal fields of the injured visual system. Retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons and synapses were genetically labeled via AAV transduction, while anterograde and transsynaptic tracers were used to mark terminals and postsynaptic cells. Functional connectivity and visual integrity were assessed by monitoring c-Fos expression following light stimulation and visual evoked potentials (VEPs). Our findings demonstrate that, although TAI results in approximately a 50% loss of RGC axons and terminals, surviving RGCs generate collateral sprouting, a form of compensatory branching of surviving axons, that restores terminal density to pre-injury levels. Transsynaptic tracing and c-Fos mapping confirmed the reestablishment of connectivity, which was also associated with significant improvements in visual function as measured by pVEPs. Interestingly, the recovery process exhibited sexual dimorphism, with female mice showing delayed or incomplete repair. Moreover, collateral sprouting proceeded normally in Sarm1 knockout mice, evidence of some independence from Wallerian degeneration. Our findings show that collateral sprouting may be an important mechanism of circuit repair in TAI independent of Wallerian degeneration and may represent a promising target for therapeutic interventions.

SignificanceHomotypic collateral sprouting -the process by which uninjured axons from the same neuronal source extend new branches to reinnervate targets deprived of their original connections-is a fundamental yet understudied mechanism for CNS repair following injury. Unlike heterotypic sprouting, involving sprouting from unrelated pathways, homotypic sprouting offers potential to restore circuit architecture after partial lesions. Here, we employed a model of diffuse axonal injury in the mouse visual system to examine this mechanism. Our research demonstrates surviving retinal ganglion cell axons can re-establish terminal fields, achieving structural and functional connectivity. Importantly, we discovered significant sex differences: female mice showed delayed/incomplete recovery compared to males. These findings provide evidence of repair of brain circuits perturbed by TBI and the role of homotypic sprouting."
"Germ cell proliferation and proper genome inheritance are critical for maintaining fertility through generations. To promote proper germ cell development, small RNA pathways employ Argonaute proteins (AGOs) to modulate gene expression and protect against deleterious genomic elements while not silencing against self. Here we identify sexual dimorphisms in localization and function of protein structural features of the Argonaute WAGO-1 that affects sex-specific gene regulation during C. elegans germ cell development. During meiotic prophase I progression, we find that germ granule structural proteins and the PIWI AGO, PRG-1, display dynamic and distinct localization patterns between egg and sperm development which coincide with differential WAGO-1 localization and biophysical properties. Sexually dimorphic functions of specific WAGO-1 protein structural domains underpin these differences. Disruption or modification to the N-terminus intrinsically disordered region (IDR) of WAGO-1 leads to loss of PGL-1 phase separation only during spermatogenesis. Further, we find that these germ granule disruptions are likely due to prolonged association of the IDR with the RNA-binding pocket of WAGO-1. In addition, deletion of the MID and part of the PIWI domains causes male-specific sterility and disruption to WAGO-1 localization with PGL-1 during oogenesis. Finally, we demonstrate that these disruptions to WAGO-1 protein structure dynamically change the mRNA and sRNA landscape of adult males and hermaphrodites, in which the AGOs ALG-3/4 and VSRA-1 are misregulated. Together, these data suggest that WAGO-1 differentially regulates genes during oogenesis versus spermatogenesis, and that these differences in gene regulation may be due to the sex-specific configuration and biophysical properties of WAGO-1 within the germ granule."
"The risk of climate maladaptation is increasing for numerous species, including trees. Developing robust methods to assess population maladaptation remains a critical challenge. Genomic offset approaches aim to predict climate maladaptation by characterising the genomic changes required for populations to maintain their fitness under changing climates. In this study, we assessed the risk of climate maladaptation in European populations of English yew (Taxus baccata), a long-lived tree with a patchy distribution across Europe, the Atlas Mountains, and the Near East, where many populations are small or threatened. We found evidence suggesting local climate adaptation by analysing 8,616 SNPs in 475 trees from 29 European T. baccata populations, with climate explaining 18.1% of genetic variance and 100 unlinked climate-associated loci identified via genotype- environment association (GEA). Then, we evaluated the deviation of populations from the overall gene-climate association to assess variability in local adaptation or different adaptation trajectories across populations and found the highest deviations in low latitude populations. Moreover, we predicted genomic offsets and successfully validated these predictions using fitness proxies assessed in plants from 26 populations grown in a comparative experiment. Finally, we integrated information from current local adaptation, genomic offset, historical genetic differentiation and effective migration rates to show that Mediterranean and high-elevation T. baccata populations face higher vulnerability to climate change than low-elevation Atlantic and continental populations. Our study demonstrates the practical use of the genomic offset framework in conservation genetics, offers insights for its further development, and highlights the need for a population-centred approach that incorporates additional statistics and data sources to credibly assess climate vulnerability in wild plant populations."
"Alzheimers disease is a specific neurodegenerative disorder, distinct from normal aging, with a growing unmet medical need. It is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid plaques in the brain, primarily consisting of amyloid beta (A{beta}) fibrils. Therapeutic antibodies can slow down the disease, but are associated with potential severe side effects, motivating the development of small molecules to halt disease progression. This study investigates the interaction between the clinical drug candidate small molecule anle138b and lipidic A{beta}40 fibrils of type 1 (L1). L1 fibrils were previously shown to closely resemble fibrils from Alzheimers patients18. Using high-resolution structural biology techniques, including cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy enhanced by dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP), and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we find that anle138b selectively binds to a cavity within the fibril. This structural insight provides a deeper understanding of a potential drug-binding mechanism at the atomic level and may inform the development of novel therapies and diagnostic approaches. In addition, anle138b reduces fibril formation in the presence of lipids by approximately 75%. This may suggest a mechanistic connection to its previously reported activity in animal models of Alzheimers disease15."
"Spatial transcriptomics provides researchers with a powerful tool to investigate gene expression patterns within their native positional context in tissues, revealing intricate cellular relationships. However, analyzing spatial transcriptomics data presents unique challenges due to their high dimensionality and complexity. Several competitive tools have emerged, each aiming to integrate spatial dependencies into their workflow. Yet, the overall performance of these approaches remains constrained by limitations in prediction accuracy and compatibility with specific data types. Here, we introduce the third version of the KODAMA algorithm, specifically tailored for spatial transcriptomics analysis. This upgraded version incorporates a novel approach that effectively reduces data dimensionality while preserving spatial information. At its core, the KODAMA algorithm employs parallel iterations that enforce spatial constraints throughout an embedded clustering process. Our method provides the flexibility to simultaneously analyze multiple samples, streamlining analysis workflows. Additionally, it extends beyond traditional 2D analysis to accommodate multidimensional datasets, including 3D spatial information. KODAMA seamlessly integrates into various pipelines, such as Seurat and Giotto. Extensive evaluations of KODAMA on 10x Visium, Visium HD, and image-based 3D datasets demonstrate its high accuracy in spatial domain prediction. Comparative analyses against alternative dimensionality reduction techniques and spatial analysis tools consistently validate and highlight KODAMAs superior performance in unraveling the spatial organization of cellular components across both single and integrated tissue samples."
"Late blight caused by Phytophthora infestans poses a significant global threat to potato and tomato cultivation with profound historical and ongoing impacts on food security. In Central America, particularly in Guatemala and Honduras, the disease has intensified over the last decade, possibly due to favorable climatic conditions and changes in local pathogen populations.

This study identified four distinct clonal lineages of the A2 mating type, US7A2, US8A2, and 13A2, and a newly identified lineage exhibiting genetic variation. Mitochondrial haplotype analysis confirmed that the patterns aligned with those reported in previous studies, thereby reflecting the diverse genetic composition of this pathogen. The genetic variability of P. infestans, including its reduced sensitivity to fungicides such as metalaxyl, and its ability to overcome host resistance, underscores the importance of understanding its population dynamics. Approximately 61% of the genetic variation was observed between lineages, likely because of the introduction of genetically distinct propagules into infected seeds.

These findings underscore the urgent need for region-specific disease management strategies guided by local genetic data to effectively mitigate the impact of late blight and suggest the need to strengthen local seed production to minimize the import of new genotypes."

"Atherogenic endothelial activation arises from both the local arterial microenvironment--characterized by altered extracellular matrix composition and disturbed blood flow--and soluble proinflammatory stimuli such as oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL). Fibronectin, a provisional extracellular matrix protein enriched at atheroprone sites, enhances endothelial activation and inflammation triggered by oxLDL and disturbed flow. Although endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress contributes to vascular dysfunction, the role of matrix composition in regulating ER stress remains unknown. We show that oxLDL and disturbed flow induce ER stress selectively in endothelial cells adhered to fibronectin, whereas both stimuli fail to induce ER stress in cells on basement membrane proteins. This matrix-specific ER stress response requires integrin activation, as endothelial cells deficient for integrin activation (talin1 L325R mutation) fail to activate ER stress in response to disturbed flow and oxLDL and direct stimulation of integrin activation using CHAMP peptides is sufficient to trigger ER stress. Blunting endothelial expression of fibronectin-binding integrins (5, v) using siRNA prevents ER stress in response to atherogenic stimuli in vitro, whereas endothelial 5 and v deletion reduces ER stress at atheroprone sites in vivo. The mechanisms driving integrin-dependent ER stress remain unclear, since matrix composition does not affect protein translation, unfolded protein accumulation, or superoxide production, and scavenging superoxide (TEMPOL) does not reduce integrin-dependent ER stress. Inhibiting ER stress with TUDCA reduces proinflammatory and metabolic gene expression (bulk RNAseq) but does not prevent NF-{kappa}B activation, a classic proinflammatory transcription factor. Rather, TUDCA prevents activation of c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and c-jun activation, and blocking JNK (SP600126) or c-Jun activity (TAM67) prevents proinflammatory gene expression following both stimuli. Together, these findings offer new insight into how the arterial microenvironment contributes to atherogenesis, with fibronectin-binding integrin signaling promotes ER stress in response to mechanical and metabolic stressors, thereby amplying proinflammatory endothelial activation through JNK-c-Jun signaling.

"Astrocytes are essential for brain homeostasis and are involved in amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) clearance, but whether they can produce and release A{beta} aggregates remains unclear. Using human iPSC-derived astrocytes, we show that astrocytes cell autonomously generate small, diffusible A{beta} aggregates under baseline conditions. By combining ultrasensitive single-molecule imaging (DNA-PAINT) and immunoassays, we detect intracellular aggregates and their release into the media. Notably, lysosomal membrane damage induced by L-leucyl-L-leucine methyl ester (LLOMe) significantly increases A{beta} aggregate secretion without altering their size or morphology. Transcriptomic analysis and cytokine profiling reveal that lysosomal stress triggers a reactive astrocyte phenotype marked by upregulation of inflammatory genes and secreted cytokines. These findings suggest that astrocytes are not merely passive A{beta} scavengers but can actively contribute to extracellular A{beta} accumulation under lysosomal stress. Our study highlights astrocytes as active players in Alzheimers disease pathology."
"To compensate for its sensory intangibility, humans often rely on spatial metaphors, gestures, and visual tools to represent the passage of time. These spatial tools, i.e. heuristics, range from everyday practices--such as directional hand gestures to indicate past or future events--to more abstract scientific conceptualizations, such as the ""curving of space-time"" in the theory of relativity. Despite this widespread spatialization of time, it remains unclear to what extent space is an inherent component of the brains representation of time and its role in monitoring temporal durations. Here, we combine EEG-behavioral methods and neural network models of optimal decision-making to show that space is a late compensatory mechanism of time representation recruited when faster and non-spatial timekeeping mechanisms are suboptimally engaged. EEG analyses reveal a cascade-like process: spatial engagement in timekeeping follows the insufficient non-spatial encoding of time intervals, leading to delayed decisions on their length and slower response selection. Computational modelling further indicates that trial-by-trial fluctuations in the spatialization of time are explained by stochastic variations in the activity of the dopaminergic/noradrenergic (DA/NE) system and its interaction with the anterior cingulate cortex. These findings provide the first clear evidence of when, why, and how the brain recruits spatial mechanisms in the service of temporal processing and demonstrate that non-spatial and spatial timekeeping systems can be dissociated at both behavioural and electrophysiological levels."
"Rust diseases on plants are caused by fungi in the order Pucciniales. Typically, rust fungi have narrow host specificity however the pandemic biotype of Austropuccinia psidii has an unusually broad host range causing disease on over 480 myrtaceous species globally. We assembled and analysed a fully phased chromosome-level genome for the pandemic A. psidii and addressed key outstanding questions of its infection biology. Our research revealed a conserved rust fungal karyotype of 18 haploid chromosomes, in line with fungi for distantly related cereal rusts. We observed chromosomal re-assortment between the two nuclei, with one nucleus carrying 19 and the other 17 chromosomes. The synteny of universal single-copy orthologs is mostly maintained with the distantly related rust fungus Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici. In contrast, nucleotide composition and methylation profiles of A. psidii are distinct compared to rust fungi with smaller genome sizes that have not undergone massive transposable element expansions. Our analysis of mating type loci supports a tetrapolar mating system for A. psidii with a novel finding of expanded numbers of pheromone peptide precursors. We show that infection dynamics of A. psidii are consistent on four different susceptible host species separated by 65 mya of evolution and that transcriptional regulation during infection reveals two distinct waves of gene expression in early and late infection, including allele-specific expression of candidate effectors. Together, these findings enhance the understanding of the genome biology and pathology of A. psidii, while also providing a valuable resource for future research on this serious rust pathogen."
"Pseudoalteromonas has been used as a model system to study cold adaptation and is of widespread interest in biotechnology and ecology. To explore its physiological responses to extreme cold, uncover functional genes, and clarify their ecological roles, efficient genetic tools are essential. However, existing genetic manipulation methods in Pseudoalteromonas rely on traditional homology-based recombination, which is inefficient and time-consuming. Consequently, improving editing efficiency is crucial for advancing both basic research and applied potential. Here, we introduced the CRISPR/Cas9 system into Pseudoalteromonas for the first time, and conducted an extensive investigation into the application of the Type II CRISPR/Cas9 system for gene editing in Pseudoalteromonas fuliginea, a representative species thriving in the frigid polar oceans. To validate the feasibility of the CRISPR/Cas system in P. fuliginea, multiple genes were selected as targets and confirmed the gene editing effects through phenotypic changes or gene expression. We have successfully achieved both gene knockouts and insertions in P. fuliginea, encompassing the deletion of genes such as fliJ, indA, and genes encoding Pf sRNAs, as well as the in vivo insertion of 3xflag and the gfp gene. The average CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing efficiency in P. fuliginea exceeded 70% (range: 73.3%-95.8%), which is significantly higher than the traditional homology-based approach (less than 0.1%). In summary, we developed an efficient CRISPR/Cas9-based editing system in P. fuliginea, which can be utilized to accelerate the development of Pseudoalteromonas as a model system for addressing fundamental questions related to extreme environmental adaptation and to fulfill its potential biotechnological applications.

IMPORTANCEPseudoalteromonas fuliginea is a marine bacterium with great potential for ecological and biotechnological research, yet its genetic manipulation has long been a technical challenge. In this study, we developed a gene editing system based on CRISPR technology that enables efficient and precise genome modification in this organism. Using this system, we successfully deleted, inserted, and tagged multiple genes, including regulatory and non-coding elements, with high success rates. Notably, several of these genes are linked to key traits such as motility and stress response, which contribute to microbial adaptation in polar environments. This tool allows researchers to directly test gene function and study microbial adaptation in cold marine environments. The ability to perform reliable genetic edits in Pseudoalteromonas fuliginea opens new possibilities for its use as a model organism and will support future advances in microbial ecology, environmental microbiology, and marine biotechnology."
"Dental implants commonly suffer from chronic peri-implantitis arising from infection and inflammation at the abutment/gingiva interface, primarily because they fail to replicate the collagen-rich soft tissue interface between natural teeth and the jawbone. Current treatment strategies involve frequent administration of systemic antibiotics and collagenase inhibitors which complicates clinical management. A localized controlled drug-release approach may offer a way to simplify this clinical management. In this study, we investigate doxycycline loading and release from a collagen hydrogel containing entrapped oligomers of {gamma}-cyclodextrin (CD). Incorporating these cyclodextrin oligomers increased the releasable amount of doxycycline by 220% and reduced its release rate fivefold. The resulting enhancement in both drug loading and release control expands the potential for further development of a collagen-coated dental implant."
"DNA methylation dynamics, including 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and 5-methylcytosine (5mC), critically regulate brain function, yet conventional methods cannot distinguish these modifications, obscuring their distinct roles in gene regulation and aging. We present Joint- Cabernet, a bisulfite-free single-cell platform enabling simultaneous profiling of 5hmC, 5mC, and transcriptomes. Applying Joint-Cabernet to 84,071 nuclei from adult and aged mouse brains, we resolved cell-type-specific DNA hydroxymethylation landscapes, revealing elevated 5hmCG and 5hmCH levels in transcriptionally active genes across neuronal subtypes and spatial gradients in cortical layers. During aging, 5hmCG accumulates globally but is selectively enriched at open chromatin loci, aligning with the upregulation of cell-type-specific genes in distinct brain cell types. This single-cell DNA methylation brain cell atlas provides a framework for studying methylation- driven mechanisms in brain aging and neurodegenerative diseases."
"2.Members of the family Rhizobiaceae typically have multipartite genomes, that are split between two or more replicons, including the chromosome and a variable number of extrachromosomal replicons (chromids and plasmids). Nearly all Rhizobiaceae replicons sequenced and described to date have a circular topology, with the exception of the linear chromid found in the genomes of most Agrobacterium spp. In this study, genomes of five nonpathogenic Agrobacterium strains and one plant tumorigenic Allorhizobium strain were fully sequenced. Surprisingly, genome analysis revealed that these six strains each carry an 80-kbp linear plasmid. Linear plasmids were so far not identified in this bacterial family or other bacteria within the class Alphaproteobacteria. The ends of all six plasmids identified in this study have a hairpin structure with covalently closed ends. The plasmid sequences showed a high degree of homology, clearly indicating their common ancestry. Database searches led to the identification of additional linear plasmids in previously published Rhizobiaceae genome assemblies that were not previously recognized to have linear plasmids, suggesting that these replicons may be more widespread. Most likely, linear plasmids may be even more widely distributed than anticipated. Although the biological functions of the linear plasmids identified in this study remain unknown, they are associated with both nonpathogenic and plant tumorigenic Rhizobiaceae strains.

3. Impact statementThe family Rhizobiaceae includes some remarkable and important representatives, such as plant symbiotic bacteria (rhizobia) and plant pathogenic bacteria associated with neoplasia (agrobacteria). In this study, the complete genome sequences of six Rhizobiaceae strains were generated and their genome organizations were examined. Strikingly, our results showed that these six strains harbor a linear plasmid. Moreover, GenBank searches suggested that linear plasmids may be even more widespread in the family Rhizobiaceae. Linear plasmids may go undetected in genome sequencing studies if the assemblies are not specifically examined for linear plasmid. Overall, this study provides further evidence for the extraordinary genome plasticity of members of the family Rhizobiaceae and expands the taxonomic range in which linear plasmids have been identified. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of linear plasmids in the family Rhizobiaceae or the class Alphaproteobacteria.

"BackgroundAcute myeloid leukemia (AML) progresses by the accumulation of somatic mutations and clonal expansion of pre-leukemic cells. Patients may respond to initial therapy, but often relapse, underscoring an evolving disease. Next generation sequencing technologies are being applied to AML for risk stratification and monitoring treatment response. We aimed to evaluate the efficiency of whole exome sequencing (WES) and single-cell DNA sequencing (scDNA-seq) for determining clonal heterogeneity and evolution in AML induced by treatment, assessing strengths and limitations of each technology.

MethodsWe conducted WES and scDNA-seq on samples from 6 patients with AML, including sequential samples from four patients. We identified somatic variants, clonal composition and phylogeny using both technologies and compared the results.

ResultsWES detected more variants and clones due to broader coverage, while scDNA-seq provided clonality results for targeted genes revealing zygosity and rare clones. Both techniques missed clinically important variants, posing challenges for clinical application. However, they identified similar founding clones and strong correlation of variant allele frequencies and clonal prevalences.

ConclusionsAs both technologies can overlook variants, multiple technologies should be utilized to understand clonality in heterogeneous diseases such as AML. Careful scDNA-seq target panel planning, utilizing knowledge obtained from bulk sequencing, can offer more information on clonal heterogeneity.

"Mutational signatures of single-base substitutions (SBSs) characterize somatic mutation processes which contribute to cancer development and progression. However, current mutational signatures do not distinguish the two independent steps that generate SBSs: the initial DNA damage followed by erroneous repair. To address this modelling gap we developed DAMUTA, a hierarchical Bayesian probabilistic model that infers separate signatures for each process, and captures their sample-specific interaction. We applied DAMUTA to 18,974 pan-cancer whole genome sequencing mutation catalogues from 23 cancer types and show that tissue-specificity in mutation patterns is driven largely by variability in damage processes. We also show that misrepair processes are predictive of DNA damage response deficiencies. Unlike existing approaches, DAMUTA distinguishes damage from misrepair contributions, and we demonstrate significant improvements over a mutational-burden baseline or signatures from the COSMIC database. Our analysis reveals a shared pan-cancer pattern of early clonal transition-mutations which shifts to a more uniform substitution pattern consistent with increased reliance on translesion synthesis for damage tolerance. DAMUTA thus generates a compact set of signatures which resolves redundancies of current signature models, disentangles the effects of DNA damage and misrepair processes, and facilitates improved stratification of tumours, while providing a framework towards a unified pan-cancer model of the cellular response to DNA damage."
"BackgroundWith the rapid development of high-throughput RNA-seq technologies, the transcriptome of prokaryotes can now be studied in unprecedented detail. Transcription start site (TSS) identification provides critical insights into transcriptional regulation, yet current command-line tools for the prediction of TSS remain challenging with respect to their usability and lack of integrated exploration features.

ResultsWe introduce TSSpredator-Web an interactive web application that enhances the usability of the established yet unpublished tool, TSSpredator. TSSpredator-Web facilitates TSS prediction from non-enriched and enriched RNA-seq data, classifies TSS relative to annotated genes, and allows users to explore results through dynamic visualizations and interactive tables. For the visualizations we provide an UpSet plot summarizing TSS distribution across experiments or classes, and a genome viewer that integrates transcriptomic and genomic data that contextualizes the insights of the TSS predictions. To illustrate the usage of TSSpredator-Web, we provide a use case with Cappable-seq data from Escherichia coli. TSSpredator-Web is available at the TueVis visualization web-server at https://tsspredator-tuevis.cs.uni-tuebingen.de/.

ConclusionsBy combining user-friendly accessibility with interactive data exploration, TSSpredator-Web significantly facilitates genome-wide TSS analysis and interpretation in prokaryotes, empowering a broader range of researchers to generate biological insights from transcriptomic data."
"Advances in spatial transcriptomics (ST) allow high-resolution mapping of gene expression within intact tissues, revealing spatially regulated biology. However, accurately quantifying gene set activity in spatial contexts remains inadequate. We present EnrichMap, a Python package designed to compute gene set enrichment scores in ST data by integrating batch correction, smoothing and spatial confounder adjustment. EnrichMap generates enrichment scores for signatures or pathways, with an optional framework for incorporating gene weights. To assess performance, we benchmark EnrichMap against established scoring techniques using spatial autocorrelation metrics such as Morans I. Our results show that EnrichMap improves spatial coherence, producing scores that capture both local and global spatial patterns, while conventional approaches tend to exhibit higher heterogeneity or diminished spatial structure. EnrichMap is demonstrated to be generalisable across a variety of ST platforms, including Visium, Xenium, MERFISH and imaging mass cytometry, maintaining consistent performance despite differences in spatial resolution and detection chemistry. Our method offers a platform-agnostic, spatially and biologically meaningful representation of gene set activity across complex tissue landscapes."
"Protein language models (PLMs) pretrained via a masked language modeling objective have proven effective across a range of structure-related tasks, including high-resolution structure prediction. However, it remains unclear to what extent these models factorize protein structural categories among their learned parameters. In this work, we introduce trainable subnetworks, which mask out the PLM weights responsible for language modeling performance on a structural category of proteins. We systematically train 36 PLM subnet-works targeting both sequence- and residue-level features at varying degrees of resolution using annotations defined by the CATH taxonomy and secondary structure elements. Using these PLM subnetworks, we assess how structural factorization in PLMs influences down-stream structure prediction. Our results show that PLMs are highly sensitive to sequence-level features and can predominantly disentangle extremely coarse or fine-grained information. Furthermore, we observe that structure prediction is highly responsive to factorized PLM representations and that small changes in language modeling performance can significantly impair PLM-based structure prediction capabilities. Our work presents a framework for studying feature entanglement within pretrained PLMs and can be leveraged to improve the alignment of learned PLM representations with known biological concepts."
"The transformer architecture in deep learning has revolutionized protein sequence analysis. Recent advancements in protein language models have paved the way for significant progress across various domains, including protein function and structure prediction, multiple sequence alignments and mutation effect prediction. A protein language model is commonly trained on individual proteins, ignoring the interdependencies between sequences within a genome. However, biological understanding reveals that protein-protein interactions span entire genomic regions, underscoring the limitations of focusing solely on individual proteins. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach that extends the context size of transformer models across the entire viral genome. By training on large genomic fragments, our method captures long-range interprotein interactions and encodes protein sequences with integrated information from distant proteins within the same genome, offering substantial benefits in various tasks. Viruses, with their densely packed genomes, minimal intergenic regions, and protein annotation challenges, are ideal candidates for genome-wide learning. We introduce a long-context protein language model, trained on entire viral genomes, leveraging a sparse attention mechanism based on protein-protein interactions. Our semi-supervised approach supports long sequences of up to 61,000 amino acids (aa). Our evaluations demonstrate that the resulting embeddings significantly surpass those generated by single-protein models and outperform alternative large-context architectures that rely on static masking or non-transformer frameworks."

"Use of strong complex I inhibitors in clinical trials for cancer treatment failed to give desired outcomes due to drug-induced toxicity, which rekindled the focus towards metformin: a known mild mitochondrial complex I inhibitor. Metformin has been extensively explored for its anticancer activity, and the results obtained have indicated mixed outcomes. Our results indicate that alterations in mitochondrial dynamics following metformin treatment are associated with cell survival and tumor progression. Interestingly, targeting these alterations induces death in metformin-treated cancer cells.

"Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) is a promising bioenergy crop due in part to its resilience to drought stress. However, the significance of drought timing remains poorly understood, both from a plant biology perspective and its impact on downstream biofuel production. This study determines the developmental stage-specific physiological and metabolic responses of switchgrass to drought stress and its implications for biofuel production using a custom-built programmable irrigation system. Vegetative, flowering, and senescence-stage drought significantly reduced CO2 assimilation, and stomatal conductance without affecting biomass yield. Metabolic profiling revealed significant accumulation of glucose, fructose, quinic acid, shikimate and GABA during vegetative-stage drought, while flowering and senescence stages exhibited limited metabolic changes. Similarly, specialized metabolites also displayed distinct developmental patterns, with vegetative-stage drought driving the most pronounced metabolic alterations. Thermochemically-treated and hydrolyzed switchgrass biomass from vegetative-stage drought showed elevated lignocellulose-derived compounds and saponins with the latter most positively correlating with fermentation lag times. Conversely, senescence-stage drought enhanced ethanol yields while lowering saponin levels in the hydrolysates. While vegetative-stage drought enhanced physiological resilience, it compromises downstream biofuel production by introducing fermentation inhibitors, particularly saponins."
"Multicellular morphogenesis must balance organismal cohesion with local tissue differentiation. Migratory stem cells commonly fulfill these dual needs by orchestrating region-specific tissue differentiation, yet how they balance the maintenance of stemness with positional sensitivity is unclear. Here, we show that in the developing avian beak, early arriving neural crest-derived mesenchymal (NCM) cells transiently match protein profiles of the overlying epithelium, which diverges as development proceeds. This ""local mimicry"" phase propagates region-specific epithelial signaling into the mesenchyme, producing distinct boundaries that anchor mesenchymal cell condensations. As NCM cells accumulate, cells within condensations undergo morphological and molecular homogenization, erasing regional differences in protein expression and restoring cellular multipotency. These cycles of transient specialization and homogenization - driven by universal processes of cell proliferation and migration - enable NCM cells to reconcile location-specific anchoring signals with stemness needed for ongoing regional specification of growing beak. By balancing global coordination with local divergence, this developmental organization can facilitate the remarkable evolutionary diversification of avian beaks."
"The Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) pathway is the ancestral signalling system defining the dorsoventral axis in bilaterally symmetrical animals. However, Spiralia, a large bilaterian clade including molluscs and annelids, uses the Fibroblast Growth Factor pathway and ERK1/2 as the ancestral cue to establish their posterodorsal side. How this profound change in axial patterning evolved and what it implied for BMPs developmental role remains elusive. Here, we studied four annelid species and combined disruption of the BMP and Activin/Nodal pathways with transcriptomics and blastomere deletions to demonstrate that BMP is ancestrally downstream of ERK1/2 and promotes dorsoventral development in Spiralia. Importantly, this signalling hierarchy is lost in annelids that secondarily transitioned into a maternally controlled, autonomous development. While some, like Capitella teleta, use Activin/Nodal, Platynereis dumerilii relies on BMP to establish dorsoventral polarity only in the head.

Unexpectedly, this divergence in upstream axial regulators implied extensive rewiring of downstream targets, as inferred by comparing C. teleta and Owenia fusiformis. Our data clarify the ancestral axial role for BMP in Spiralia, unveiling a potential causal link between parallel shifts to autonomous cell-fate specification in early development and the emergence of developmental system drift, a pervasive yet poorly understood phenomenon in animal embryogenesis."
"To achieve the current Nature Positive goals, it is important to identify the effects of chemicals on ecosystems and strategically reduce their risks. We therefore estimated the safe concentration (SC) of linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS) by investigating the relationship between benthic communities detected via environmental RNA (eRNA) and environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding and the water quality in a river contaminated with LAS. Non-metric multidimensional scaling of benthic communities detected via eRNA indicated significant differences between contaminated and non-contaminated sites, and redundancy analysis showed significant correlation between the benthic communities and LAS concentration. These results demonstrate that eRNA is more sensitive than eDNA for capturing the community changes that result from LAS contamination. No significant differences were observed in biodiversity indices between the highest LAS concentration site and non-contaminated site; thus, the SC was estimated at >47 {micro}g/L. The results suggest that, although hazard assessment using the assessment factor (AF) leads to conservative estimation of the effects of chemicals because the predicted no-effect concentration in previous studies is lower than the SC, hazard assessment based on the response of biological communities using eRNA metabarcoding can refine such ecological assessments, developing the environmental management standards to achieve nature-positive goals."
"Aristolochia subgenus Siphisia constitutes a monophyletic lineage of predominantly lianescent species, with occasional shrubs or herbs, and is characterized by remarkable diversity in perianth morphology. Members of Siphisia serve as larval hosts for endangered Lepidoptera and are widely used in traditional medicine. Despite its ecological and ethnobotanical significance, Siphisia systematics remains unresolved due to limited genomic resources and insufficient phylogenetic signal across previously sampled loci. Here, we present a phylogenomically informed framework for Siphisia, integrating 46 newly collected accessions and seven public datasets across 44 taxa. Using genome skimming ([~]30x coverage) and HybPiper, we recovered Angiosperms353 nuclear loci, including supercontigs, for phylogenetic reconstruction via concatenation and coalescent approaches. The resulting species trees resolve seven strongly supported monophyletic clades, each defined by distinct biogeographic patterns and morphological synapomorphies. Comparative plastome analyses from de novo assemblies explored quadripartite structure, plastid phylogeny, GC content, and gene synteny. Cytonuclear discordance was concentrated in species-rich Asian clades, while hybridization signals were rare and limited to deep backbone nodes in North American lineages. These results indicate that incomplete lineage sorting, rather than introgression, accounts for most gene-species tree conflicts and likely reflects strong reproductive isolation following speciation. We also revise a previously taxonomically ambiguous complex--the now well-supported A. versicolor species group--based on integrated phylogenomic and morphological evidence. Within this group, we describe five previously unrecognized cryptic species and identify a novel pollination syndrome involving floral adaptations for pollinator filtering. This syndrome may contribute to prezygotic isolation and recent diversification, and it challenges the prevailing assumption that Aristolochia pollination is universally governed by a trapping-release mechanism--suggesting this model may not apply to subg. Siphisia."
"The Na+-pumping NADH-quinone oxidoreductase (Na+-NQR) is a key respiratory enzyme in many marine and pathogenic bacteria that couples electron transfer to Na+-pumping across the membrane. Earlier X-ray and cryo-EM structures of Na+-NQR from Vibrio cholerae suggested that the subunits harboring redox cofactors undergo conformational changes during catalytic turnover. However, these proposed rearrangements have not yet been confirmed. Here, we have identified at least five distinct conformational states of Na+-NQR using: mutants that lack specific cofactors, specific inhibitors or low-sodium conditions. Molecular dynamics simulations based on these structural insights indicate that 2Fe-2S reduction in NqrD/E plays a crucial role in triggering Na+ translocation by driving structural rearrangements in the NqrD/E subunits, which subsequently influence NqrC and NqrF positioning. This study provides the first structural insights into the mechanism of Na+ translocation coupled to electron transfer in Na-NQR."
"The Na+-pumping NADH-quinone oxidoreductase (Na+-NQR) is a key respiratory enzyme in many marine and pathogenic bacteria that couples electron transfer to Na+-pumping across the membrane.

However, these proposed rearrangements have not yet been confirmed.

"Bottom-up proteomics is a powerful technique for comprehensive analysis of proteins by proteolytic cleavage followed by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry to identify the resulting peptides. Trypsin is the gold-standard protease for bottom-up proteomics, though its cleavage specificity limits peptide identification, depending on the protein sequence. In addition, its optimal pH is weakly alkaline, which can cause modification artifacts such as deamidation. We hypothesized that these limitations might be overcome by using protease type XIII (P13ase) from Aspergillus saitoi, which is active at low pH. P13ase has been used for protein structural analysis by hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, but its cleavage preferences have not been clarified. Here, we show that P13ase primarily cleaves the C-terminal side of Lys, Arg, and Leu, and the optimal P13ase digestion conditions for bottom-up proteomics are pH 3.5, 37{degrees}C for 60 min. Under these conditions, sequence coverage of more than 90% was achieved for several proteins in HeLa cell extracts, which is unachievable with trypsin. In addition, P13ase digestion reduced artifacts such as deamidation products generated by cyclization reactions and subsequent hydrolysis. These results indicate that P13ase is a promising new tool for precision proteomics."
"Recent advances in spatial proteomics enable quantification of the spatial distribution of protein expression across a variety of scales, resolutions, and multiplexing. Registering images from such technologies across modalities is an essential task that enables both the integration of complementary imaging technologies and validation of biological findings. This can be particularly challenging when the modalities capture fundamentally different types of data, such as light intensity, probe counts, or heavy metal counts. However, few datasets and methods address this problem at scale. Here, we introduce the largest dataset to date of cross-modality imaging of both cell line and tissue slides suitable for benchmarking registration methods. We further present Twocan, a Bayesian optimization framework that enables robust automated registration between immunofluorescence imaging and highly multiplex spatial proteomics data. Our method achieves significantly higher registration success rates compared to existing approaches across our comprehensive dataset of 954 image pairs."
"The behavioral differences, individually but also on group level has been evaluated in Baltic salmon parr in a repeated test combining open field and mirror test with focus on aggressive, bold and active behavior. The 164 salmon parr was tested twice and distance moved in arena, activity, was the variable which had the highest correlation between the trials. No correlation was found between aggression and activity or between boldness and activity. The groups which expressed lower aggression had a larger variance in their behavior compared to the highly aggressive groups which had a very strict behavioral repertoire."
"IntroductionMacrophages (M{Phi}) modulate both myocardial inflammatory and reparative phases following ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is thought to play an important role in M{Phi} phenotype and functionality, but studies report conflicting net influences suggesting dependence on disease context and downstream signaling. Here, we tested the impact of M{Phi} with constitutive mTORC1 activation induced by targeted deletion of tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) on cardiac responses to I/R injury.

Methods/ResultsMyeloid TSC2 depleted (M{Phi}TSC2-/-) mice were generated by crossing Lys2Cre x TSC2flx/flx. Bone-marrow derived M{Phi}TSC2-/- vs control M{Phi} had basal increased mTORC1 and reduced mTORC2 activity. M{Phi}TSC2-/- were differentially responsive to stimulation by lipopoly- saccharide/IFN-{gamma} or IL-4 in vitro, and all disparities were prevented by rapamycin confirming the model. In vivo, M{Phi}TSC2-/- mice were strongly protected against I/R injury, with minimal change in ejection fraction, less LV dilation, hypertrophy, lung edema, or activation of stress/pro fibrotic genes. Mice pre-treated with anti-LY6G Ab to deplete neutrophils were still similarly protected, suggesting that the impact was primarily related to M{Phi}. M{Phi}TSC2-/- mice had less myocardial pro- inflammatory macrophages (CCR2+MHC-IIhi), LY6C+ monocytes, neutrophils, and CD8+ T cells 5 days post-I/R, and fewer CCR2+ but more CCR2- M{Phi} 2 weeks post I/R. Both M{Phi}TSC2-/- in vitro and in vivo post I/R phenotypes were converted to WT by rapamycin, supporting mTORC1 dependence. Lastly, synthesis of glycoprotein nonmetastatic melanoma protein B (GPNMB), a principally M{Phi} anti-inflammatory secreted protein protective against myocardial infarction was enhanced in M{Phi}TSC2-/- macrophages and hearts following I/R in an mTORC1 dependent manner. Conclusion: Constitutive macrophage-specific mTORC1 activation via TSC2 deletion reduces pro-inflammatory cell infiltration, increases GPNMB protein expression and preserves heart function following I/R injury. Rapamycin eliminates these effects. These results identify a cardioprotective mTORC1-GPNMB signaling nexus in M{Phi} in vivo."
"Interferon-induced transmembrane (IFITM) proteins are potent innate immune factors that restrict an array of viruses at the entry stage of infection. We previously characterized a GxxxG motif in the CD225 domain of human IFITM3 that mediates its multimerization, which is essential for the reduction of membrane fluidity by IFITM3 and for its antiviral activity against Influenza A virus. Here, using an unbiased approach coupling immunoprecipitation with mass spectrometry, we show that the GxxxG motif is also important for the interaction of IFITM3 with other proteins, including IFITM1. While IFITM1 is primarily regarded as a cell surface protein that restricts the entry of viruses fusing at the plasma membrane, this model is based mostly on overexpression studies and is at odds with some studies showing that it can restrict endocytic viruses. Here, we show that endogenous IFITM1 and IFITM3 co-reside in membranes of acidic late endosomes and lysosomes (endolysosomes) and form a protein-protein complex as determined by co-immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assay. Knockdown of endogenous IFITM3 resulted in enhanced localization of IFITM1 at the plasma membrane, indicating that IFITM3 promotes IFITM1 localization to endolysosomes. To assess the antiviral protection conferred by endogenous IFITM1 and IFITM3 against viruses fusing at endolysosomal membranes, we measured cell entry mediated by the Influenza A fusogen hemagglutinin (HA). While knockdown of IFITM3 significantly boosted HA-mediated entry, combined knockdown of both IFITM3 and IFITM1 boosted entry even further. These results suggest that endogenous IFITM1 restricts Influenza A virus entry in a manner that is non-redundant with IFITM3, and that IFITM1 and IFITM3 inhibit virus entry in a cooperative manner."
"Although opioids are effective analgesics, they can lead to problematic drug use behaviors that underlie opioid use disorder (OUD). Opioids also drive gut microbiota dysbiosis which is linked to altered opioid responses tied to OUD. To interrogate the role of the gut microbiota in a mouse model of OUD, we used a longitudinal paradigm of voluntary oral morphine self-administration to capture multiple facets of drug seeking and preserve both individual behavioral response and gut microbiota variation to examine associations between these two variables. After prolonged morphine consumption, only a subset of mice transitioned to a state we define statistically as compulsive. In compulsive mice, morphine fragmented the microbiota networks which subsequently reorganized to form robust novel connections. In contrast, the communities of non-compulsive mice also changed but were highly interconnected during morphine disturbance and maintained more continuity post morphine suggesting dynamic flexibility. Compulsive mice displayed a greater loss of functional diversity and a shift towards a new stable state dominated by potential pathobionts, whereas non-compulsive mice better preserved genera associated with gut health and broader functional diversity. These findings highlight how persistent and stable gut microbiota dysbiosis aligns with long-term behavioral changes underlying OUD, potentially contributing to relapse."
"Cyanobacteria have adapted to daily fluctuations in light intensity through a circadian clock that aligns their physiology and metabolism to the external daytime. In the model cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, the rhythm generated by a molecular pacemaker is converted into a global transcriptional oscillation by the central regulator RpaA. Mutants in RpaA and other components have been instrumental in elucidating the clocks molecular architecture and physiological role. Extensive evidence suggests that one of the central functions of circadian regulation is to prevent the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during nighttime. However, circadian mutants are unable to grow under natural day/night cycles and require constant illumination, hindering our ability to study the clock function during the night, a phase where circadian regulation is critical for redox homeostasis. Here, we show that the darkness lethality phenotype of circadian mutants can be overcome by high CO2 levels. When grown under a 3% CO2 atmosphere, RpaA-null mutants exhibited growth rates similar to the wt. An analysis of the ROS levels under different CO2 and light intensity conditions revealed carbon scarcity to be the most significant contributor to redox stress. Nighttime ROS accumulation can be modulated by CO2 abundance, an observation that will allow the characterization of heretofore lethal mutants in circadian regulation. The dispensability of the circadian clock in a high CO2 environment suggests that the clock may have evolved as an adaptation to the decrease in atmospheric CO2 levels that occurred after the Great Oxygenation Events, in the Paleoproterozoic era.

IMPORTANCECyanobacterial circadian clocks are considered essential for survival under natural day/night conditions, and many circadian mutants are lethal under diel cycles. Results presented here challenge this assumption, showing that these mutants grow normally when CO2 is abundant. This suggests that the major adaptive role of the clock is to manage the redox stress caused by carbon limitation. By separating the effects of carbon availability from circadian control, we identify a key environmental factor that shaped the evolution of biological timekeeping. Using high CO2 to bypass clock dependency will allow the study of circadian function in otherwise lethal mutants. These findings reframe the clock as a specific adaptation to atmospheric carbon, stressing its key role in the regulation of the redox balance."
"ObjectiveThe incidence of ulcerative colitis (UC) and obesity has risen in recent years, potentially linked through metabolic dysregulation and chronic inflammation. The nuclear receptor NR1D1 is pivotal in regulating circadian rhythms and plays a significant role in inflammation and metabolism. This study investigates the therapeutic effects and mechanisms of the NR1D1 agonist SR9009 on obesity-related UC.

MethodsWe established a mouse model of obesity-induced UC utilizing a high-fat diet alongside dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). 32 male C57BL/6 mice were divided into four groups: control (DZ), high-fat diet (GZ), obesity associated UC model group (UC), and SR9009 intervention group (JD), with eight mice each. We evaluated body weight, blood lipids, colonic tissue alterations, IL-1{beta}, IL-18, macrophage polarization, and NR1D1 expression levels.

ResultsMice in the UC group demonstrated significantly elevated body weight, spleen index, TG, CHOL and inflammatory markers (P<0.01). Pathological scores of colonic tissues increased markedly (P=0.000), with a rise in M1 macrophages (CD68) and a decline in M2 macrophages (CD206) (P<0.001). NR1D1 expression was notably downregulated (P<0.01). Post-SR9009 intervention, the JD group showed significantly reduced serum TG and CHOL levels (P=0.001, 0.011), IL-1{beta} and IL-18 (P<0.001), improved colonic pathology (P=0.000), a decrease in M1 macrophages, an increase in M2 macrophages, and an enhanced M1/M2 ratio (P<0.001).

ConclusionSR9009 mitigates intestinal inflammation in obesity associated UC by activating NR1D1, inhibiting the NF-{kappa}B pathway, and modulating macrophage polarization (suppressing M1 and enhancing M2). These findings propose a novel strategy for targeting NR1D1 in the treatment of obesity-related ulcerative colitis."
"There was a huge variability in the pharmacokinetics of drugs between species, which means in the way it will be transformed, degraded and eliminated, as well as the variation in drug absorption, plasma concentration over time, half-life, bioavailability, volume of distribution, metabolism rate, and routes of excretion. To understand the reasons of such a variability between species, we have studied here the evolution of genes encoding drug-metabolizing enzymes, i.e. the 9 key genes that are known to play a principal role in this process: UGT1A6, UGT1A, CYP2B, CYP2C, CYP2D, UGT2B, CYP3A, NAT1, GSTP1. We show here that a lot of these genes have been lost during evolution in several vertebrate species: UGT1A6 in gorilla, cat dog, ruminants, pig, UGT1A in artiodactyla, UGT2B in all vertebrate species except human and gorilla, CYP2C in all vertebrate species except primates and mouse. Several of these genes have duplicated such as UGT1A in human (4 copies), CYP3A in most of vertebrate species studied here except the cat, CYP2D in the mouse (9 copies). Furthermore, several of these genes undergone evolution by positive selection such as CYP2D6, UGT1A, CYP2C (particularly in squirrel), UGT1A. Overall, this study shows that the evolution by gene death, gene duplication, and positive selection is partly responsible for the great variability in the ability of vertebrate species to metabolize drugs."
"Gaining a complete and unbiased understanding of the non-tryptic peptide repertoire presented by HLA-I complexes by LC-MS/MS is indispensable for therapy design for cancer, autoimmunity and infectious diseases. A serious concern in HLA peptide analysis is that the routinely used, collision-based fragmentation methods (CID/HCD) do not always render sufficiently informative MS2 spectra, whereby gaps in the fragmentation sequence coverage prevent unambiguous assignments. EThcD can be utilized to generate complementary ion series, i.e. b/y ions and c/z ions, resulting in richer, more informative MS2 spectra, thereby filling in the gaps. Here, we present data generated on a novel hybrid Orbitrap mass spectrometer, facilitating fast and efficient hybrid fragmentation due to the implementation of EThcD in the ion routing multipole. We hypothesized that this would enable more comprehensive and less error-prone analysis of immunopeptidomes at minimal costs in duty-cycle. First, we optimized ETD/EThcD methods using an elastase-digested cell lysate, as this contains peptides of similar length and charge distributions to immunopeptides. Next, we compared HCD and EThcD on immunopeptidomes originating from three cell lines with distinct HLA-I complexes that present peptides with varying physicochemical properties. We demonstrate that the new instrument not only enables efficient and fast ETD reactions, but when combined with collision-based supplemental activation, i.e. EThcD, also consistently increases the sequence coverage and identification of peptide sequences, otherwise missed by using solely HCD. We reveal several of the biochemical properties that make HLA peptides preferably identifiable by EThcD, with internal Arg residues being one of the most dominant determinants. Finally, we demonstrate the power of EThcD for the identification and localization of HLA peptides harboring post-translational modifications, focusing here on HLA Arg mono-/di-methylation. We foresee that this new instrument with efficient EThcD capabilities enhances not only immunopeptidomics analysis, but also analysis of peptides harboring post-translational modifications and de novo sequencing."
"Rubrerythrins are a group of proteins within the Ferritin-like superfamily that display a defining four-helix bundle domain. They also show multiple structural features that are crucial to their functionality as iron storage proteins and in detoxification and oxidative stress response. Here we investigate rubrerythrin (Rbr) in multiple metalated states, from the pathogen Burkholderia pseudomallei (Bp). We use X-ray crystallography for structure determination of Rbr to probe the capacity and specificity of metal binding. BpRbr lacks the rubredoxin moiety found in canonical Rbrs from anaerobic lineages, and we demonstrate that BpRbr also possesses a domain-swapped dimer, which has functional implications for its putative role in oxidative stress response. We also carry out in crystallo spectroscopic assessment of BpRbr with various metals, using energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy. We observe that samples can contain metals other than those supplied in crystallization conditions, and developed a strategy of utilizing EDX spectroscopy to select those samples with single metal incorporation for downstream diffraction data collection. Our work underscores the importance of spectroscopic probing for definitive metal identification and characterization.

"The Achilles tendon is composed of three distinct fascicle bundles, or ""subtendons,"" each originating from the head of one of the three triceps surae muscles. In a healthy tendon, these subtendons slide relative to each other during muscle contractions. This subtendon sliding is reduced in older adults and younger adults who suffer an Achilles tendon injury. However, subtendon sliding is challenging to quantify in low-load scenarios that are critical for monitoring subtendon biomechanics in patients with mechanically compromised tendons, like following an Achilles tendon rupture and repair surgery. The purpose of this study was to develop a reliable method to characterize subtendon behavior in vivo using combined transverse plane ultrasound imaging and neuromuscular electrical stimulation of individual gastrocnemii. We used a Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi point tracking algorithm to quantify tendon displacement during isolated muscle stimulations. Next, we applied k-means clustering to characterize heterogeneous subtendon behavior within the tendon cross section. The tendon cross section displayed differential displacement patterns depending on the stimulated muscle (p<0.0001), and these displacements differed along the free tendon during lateral gastrocnemius stimulations (p=0.004). These results reflect possible differences in load-sharing between adjacent subtendons and differing muscle-tendon dynamics among the triceps surae muscles. Finally, this method confirmed bilaterally symmetric subtendon behavior and demonstrated high inter-session reliability (ICC>0.83). Overall, this study furthers our understanding of differential muscle-tendon dynamics of individual Achilles subtendons both within the tendon cross section and along the free tendon. Future work will apply this method to injured populations to develop biomarkers of altered subtendon function.

NEW & NOTEWORTHYAchilles subtendon function and morphology are challenging to characterize in vivo. This study employed transverse plane ultrasound imaging and neuromuscular electrical stimulation to characterize behavior of individual subtendons both within the tendon cross section and along the free tendon. It is the first study to demonstrate functional behavior within the Achilles tendon using these combined tools in identifying subtendon dynamics. Additional findings of bilateral symmetry in healthy individuals present this tools potential to quantify altered subtendon function post-injury."
"Genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs) enable noninvasive, high-speed monitoring of electrical activity but are constrained by limited brightness and rapid photobleaching under continuous illumination. Here, we present Vega, a highly photostable green fluorescence GEVI with both high sensitivity ({Delta}F/F = -33% per 100 mV) and fast response (1.34 ms). Under one-photon excitation at 1 W/cm2, Vega exhibits more than 20-fold slower photobleaching than the spectrally similar GEVI, Ace-mNeon2. In acute mouse brain slice, Vega enabled wide-field high-fidelity recording of action potentials from 51 neurons simultaneously. In pancreatic islets, it revealed heterogeneous {beta}-cell activation and intercellular coupling in response to glucose elevation. Finally, one-photon imaging in awake mice demonstrated stable cortical voltage mapping in vivo. Vega thus overcomes the longstanding photostability-performance trade-off, enabling chronic, high-fidelity voltage imaging across preparations."

"Obesity is a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes, yet not all individuals with obesity develop metabolic disease, underscoring the need for mechanistic biomarkers. Adipocyte hypertrophy is a hypothesized driver of insulin resistance, but current methods for quantifying adipocyte size are invasive. Here, we propose and validate a non-invasive MRI approach based on ""short diffusion time"" diffusion-weighted MR spectroscopy to estimate adipocyte size in vivo. Monte Carlo simulations confirmed the methods accuracy across a physiologic range of adipocyte sizes (20 - 150 m) and signal-to-noise ratios (SNR > 40). We applied this technique to the epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) of rats using in vivo 4.7T and ex vivo 11.7T MRI. Adipocyte sizes derived from diffusion MRI showed good agreement with histology, with minor systematic underestimation corrected by empirical factors. This approach does not require complex modeling or high diffusion weighting, increasing its translatability to the laboratory and clinical settings. Diffusion MRI may serve as a non-invasive ""virtual biopsy"" to monitor adipocyte morphology and improve understanding of obesity-related metabolic dysfunction."
"SignificanceOxygen metabolism is important to retinal disease development, but current imaging methods face challenges in resolution, throughput, and depth sectioning to spatially map microvascular oxygen.

AimTo develop a multimodal system capable of simultaneous phosphorescence lifetime imaging scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (PLIM-SLO) and visible light optical coherence tomography (VIS-OCT) to capture capillary-level oxygen partial pressure (pO2) and structural volumes in rodents.

ApproachC57BL/6 mice were imaged by VIS-OCT with high-definition (10 kHz raster) and Doppler (100 kHz circular) protocols. Phosphorescent probe Oxyphor 2P was retro-orbitally injected to enable intravascular PLIM-SLO imaging (200 {micro}s pixel dwell time), while a tunable lens was used to adjust the focal depth. The extracted phosphorescence lifetimes were used for pO2 calculation. Simultaneous imaging utilized a shared imaging path and synchronized data collection.

ResultsVIS-OCT images revealed detailed anatomy and Doppler shifts, while PLIM-SLO provided capillary pO2 at multiple depths. A hemoglobin oxygen dissociation curve related retinal arterial pO2 to systemic oxygen saturation as inhaled oxygen was varied. Registered simultaneous images were captured and pO2 was empirically adjusted for the combined excitation.

ConclusionsDetailed anatomical structures and capillary pO2 levels can be simultaneously imaged, providing a useful tool to study oxygen metabolism in rodent disease models."
"Precision medicine is the gold standard we strive to achieve to tailor therapy to individual patients, maximising effect while minimising toxicities. Many methodologies have improved the quality of biomarker research toward this aim; however, few capture whether checkpoint proteins and genes are actively functioning, termed checkpoint interactions, in an individual. Our team has created novel methodology to directly quantify checkpoint interactions in the tumour-immune microenvironment (TiME) and have early data supporting that this approach better predicts patients outcomes in melanoma.

We performed digital spatial profiling (DSP) with Lunaphore-COMET of PD1 in pre- and post-treatment melanoma tumours from patients undergoing standard neoadjuvant immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Three treatment response categories were utilised: responder, partial-responder and non-responder. The functional oncology mapping (FuncOmap) of the PD1-PDL1 interactions of the same tissue sections revealed, via their individual violin plots, the heterogeneity of the interactive states of PD1-PDL1. FuncOmap, significantly enhances spatial resolution to 30^106 PD1-PDL1 interactive state data points to produce global violin plots pre-and post-neoadjuvant ICB. The global plots show significantly higher checkpoint interaction, ie. failed checkpoint blockade, in non-responder tissue post-treatment. The co-expressions of PD1 versus PDL1 did not show any correlation pre- or post-treatment.

By exploiting an entirely new computational framework and a pattern matching algorithm, we directly mapped, the interactive states of PD1-PDL1 on the COMET PD1 expression image, demonstrating no correlation between high expression of COMET-PD1 and the corresponding interactive states.

Our new computational spatial platform, FuncO:TiME, successfully maps functional states of immune checkpoints directly onto expression-based DSP of the tumour-immune microenvironment (TiME). Functional proteomics of this nature stand to close critical gaps in biomarker discovery and revolutionise ICB application in melanoma and cancers broadly."
"Salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) regulate plant defense against pathogens and herbivores. The SA-JA pathways often interact antagonistically with the induction of one, leading to the suppression of the other. However, the effect of combined SA/JA concentrations on plant responses is unknown. Here, we show transcriptional responses specific to combinations of SA and JA concentrations and develop transcriptomic biomarkers to estimate SA/JA response states. Combinatorial treatments with eight concentrations of SA and JA, combined with large-scale transcriptome analysis, revealed 43 different expression patterns, including not only well-known antagonistic responses but also responses specific to combinations of SA/JA concentrations. Notably, the expression of CYP94B3, a key enzyme involved in JA-Ile turnover, was finely tuned by specific SA/JA concentration combinations being induced under high SA conditions in a JA dose-dependent manner. In addition, the expression peaks of indole glucosinolate biosynthesis genes were found at approximately 30-fold higher JA concentrations than aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis genes. Furthermore, to quantitatively estimate SA/JA response states, we developed transcriptomic biomarkers using a machine learning approach. The marker specifically estimated response states to target phytohormones. Through analysis of npr3/4 double mutants, we confirmed that the biomarkers were applicable to the analysis of mutants. The biomarkers will allow us to extract insights into phytohormone responses from various large-scale transcriptome data, e.g., field transcriptomics and single-cell RNA-Seq."

"Missense variants in EXOSC3, an RNA exosome subunit, have been identified in patients with PCH1b. We investigated three missense variants in the S1 domain of EXOSC3, including one variant of uncertain significance (VUS) and two pathogenic variants (hence S1 variants). EXOSC3 S1 variant cell lines were generated using CRISPR-Cas9 resulting in widespread proteome changes including decreases in some RNA exosome subunits paired with increases in the catalytic subunit DIS3. Thermal stability, analyzed by PISA, revealed extensive destabilization of RNA exosome cap subunits and the cap-associated exonuclease EXOSC10. Functionally, S1 variants altered rRNA processing with corresponding protein compensation observed in rRNA processing proteins outside the RNA exosome. Exogenous overexpression of EXOSC3 rescues many molecular defects caused by S1 variants suggesting that protein destabilization and turnover strongly contribute to molecular defects. Overall, our findings define the mechanisms through which cells respond to EXOSC3 S1 variant disruption of RNA processing homeostasis."
"Osteopontin is a protein with many physiological roles and is widely expressed by many cell types, tissues, and bodily fluids, including breastmilk. The functions of breastmilk osteopontin are not clearly defined, however, it is known to impact intestinal and brain development in infants. Although it is known that endogenous osteopontin influences the survival of intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL)2, the impact of breastmilk osteopontin on developing intestinal immune cells remains unclear. In this report, mouse models lacking expression of osteopontin were used to demonstrate that milk-derived osteopontin is important for the development of IELs, with observed effects in both juvenile and adult mice. These changes are most prevalent in IELs expressing CD8: however, the impact of these alterations is unclear, as mice with disrupted IEL compartments are not more susceptible to DSS-induced colitis or infection by Citrobacter rodentium."
"Extracellular contractile injection systems (eCISs) are phage-derived nanomachines used by bacteria to deliver effectors into target cells. Well-studied examples include the Photorhabdus asymbiotica virulence cassettes and the antifeeding prophage from Serratia entomophila, which have been engineered for heterologous cargo delivery. Recent genomic analyses identified previously uncharacterized eCIS gene clusters in the opportunistic human pathogen Salmonella enterica subspecies salamae, but their structure, function, and biotechnological potential remain unexplored. Here, we report a high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure of the S. enterica eCIS. Our atomic models reveal a unique sheath architecture, an expansive cage-like shell around a central spike, and an associated transmembrane hydrolase. We identify a putative effector encoded within the operon exhibiting periplasmic toxicity and provide evidence that the S. enterica eCIS deviates from canonical eCISs by interacting with the inner membrane. Guided by these structural features, we uncover a previously unannotated cluster of contractile injection systems (CISs). Together, our findings expand the known diversity of CISs structures and functions and lay the groundwork for engineering customizable protein delivery platforms."

"ObjectiveTo delineate the evolutionary trajectory of immunomodulatory biomaterials in implant osseointegration through bibliometric analysis, identifying pivotal theoretical breakthroughs and technological advancements.

MethodsA total of 419 articles (2005-2025) from the Web of Science Core Collection were analyzed using a multi-tool framework. Current research status and hotspots were evaluated by co-occurrence analysis of keywords and institutions using VOSviewer. The evolution and bursts of the knowledge base were assessed through co-citation analysis of references, authors, and journals via CiteSpace. Thematic evolution and keyword trends were mapped using the bibliometrix package in R.

Burst detection revealed shifting frontiers toward clinical translation (2023-2025 burst: ""3D printing"", strength=4.05) and precision modulation (""macrophage polarization"", strength=9.02).

ConclusionImmunomodulatory biomaterials are transitioning from mechanistic exploration to clinical adaptation. Future development requires integrating dynamic microenvironment-responsive designs with multi-omics validation to address macrophage heterogeneity, ultimately enabling personalized osseointegration therapies."
"Autophagy inhibitors are promising compounds to treat pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) but their efficacy in patients is unclear, highlighting a need to understand mechanisms of resistance. We used a novel approach to uncover metabolic adaptations that bypass autophagy inhibition. Utilizing PDA cells with acquired resistance to different autophagy inhibitors, we found that severe autophagy depletion induces metabolic rewiring to sustain TCA intermediates and nucleotides for biosynthesis. Long-term autophagy inhibition results in altered pyruvate metabolism likely regulated by lower pyrimidine pools. Cells adapting to loss of autophagy preferentially salvage pyrimidines to replenish these pools instead of synthesizing them de novo. Exploiting this metabolic vulnerability, we found that acquired resistance to autophagy inhibition promotes increased salvage and therefore sensitivity to pyrimidine analogues, including gemcitabine and trifluridine/tipiracil leading to combinatory effects with autophagy inhibitors and pyrimidine analogs. These studies provide mechanistic insight defining how autophagy inhibition can be leveraged to treat pancreatic cancer."

"In nonclinical safety assessments of cosmetic ingredients applied topically, it is essential to investigate the rate and extent of dermal penetration to reach the systemic circulation. The initial step in skin absorption involves the partitioning of an ingredient from the formulation into the upper layer of the stratum corneum and this plays a key role in determining the delivery of an ingredient. Currently, there is a lack of reliable methods to accurately predict this important parameter. To address this, we measured the partitioning of three chemicals from seven different vehicles into a surrogate PDMS membrane; these measurements were then used to parameterize a dermal absorption model. The evaluation of receptor fluid kinetics and skin absorption percentages, comparing measured and predicted data, demonstrated that incorporating the vehicle partitioning parameter derived from the PDMS system improved the accuracy of model predictions for the three chemicals in most vehicles."
"Recent advances in electron microscopy (EM) and automated image segmentation have produced synaptic wiring diagrams of the Drosophila central nervous system. A limitation of existing fly connectome datasets is that most sensory neurons are excised during sample preparation, creating a gap between the central and peripheral nervous systems. Here, we bridge this gap by reconstructing wing sensory axons from the Female Adult Nerve Cord (FANC) EM dataset and mapping them to peripheral sensory structures using genetic tools and light microscopy. We confirm the location and identity of known wing mechanosensory neurons and identify previously uncharacterized axons, including a novel population of putative proprioceptors that make monosynaptic connections onto wing steering motor neurons. We also find that proprioceptors of adjacent campaniform sensilla on the wing have distinct axon morphologies and postsynaptic partners, suggesting a high degree of specialization in axon pathfinding and synaptic partner matching. The peripheral location and central projections of wing sensory neurons are stereotyped across flies, allowing this wing proprioceptor atlas and genetic toolkit to guide analysis of other fly connectome datasets."
"BackgroundThe nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a reward circuitry hub associated with major depressive disorder (MDD) and chronic stress in rodents. While transcriptional adaptations in NAc medium spiny neuron (MSN) subtypes, those enriched in dopamine receptor 1(D1) or dopamine receptor 2 (D2) and adenosine 2a receptor (A2A) are well characterized in socially stressed male rodents, there is less knowledge of MSN subtype adaptations in socially stressed females.

MethodsChronic witness defeat stress (CWDS) was performed in female D1-Cre-RiboTag and A2A-Cre-RiboTag mice. After stress, mice were separated into high- and low-social interactors with a three Chamber Social Interaction test. Following isolation of ribosome-associated mRNA, MSN subtype-specific gene expression profiles were determined with RNA sequencing followed by differential gene expression analysis (DEG) and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Consensus WGCNA with male mouse social defeat stress and clinically relevant human transcriptomic datasets was performed to examine the translational sex-specific molecular signatures.

Results9 DEGs in D1-MSNs and 630 in A2A-MSNs were identified in female stress groups (FDR < 0.05). D1-MSN DEGs were mostly upregulated in CWDS low vs high interactors and were enriched for functions related to energy homeostasis and cell adhesion. A2A-MSN DEGs upregulated in low interactors involved structural molecules while downregulated genes involved neurotransmission. WGCNA identified 9 significant D1- and 5 significant A2A-MSN modules related to cell structure, protein synthesis, synapse and mitochondria. The most impacted modules from each subtype (based on DEG count) were enriched for PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway and regulated by the Nf1 transcription factor. Consensus module analysis identified a module significantly associated with social stress in a sex- and subtype-specific manner in both mice and humans enriched for genes involved in the PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway.

ConclusionChronic social stress-induced sex-specific molecular signatures were uncovered in female subjects. Consensus modules across stress and clinical populations implicate alterations in MSN subtypes could contribute to MDD signatures among female populations."
"Hippocampal area CA2 plays an important role in social memory formation. However, CA2 is characterised by plasticity-resistant Schaffer collateral-CA2 (SC-CA2) synapses and highly plastic entorhinal cortex-CA2 (EC-CA2) synapses. Despite abundant dopaminergic input, the relationship between dopamine signalling and area CA2 synaptic plasticity remains unexplored. Here, we show that SKF-38393-mediated Dopamine D1-like receptor (dopamine D1 and D5 receptors) activation differentially primes CA2 inputs in an NMDAR and protein synthesis-dependent manner. We defined an inverted-U shape relationship between SKF-38393 concentration and EC-CA2 potentiation. Additionally, we observed a priming effect on SC-CA2 plasticity with 50M SKF-38393, relieving plasticity resistance. We also demonstrated that this effect follows canonical protein kinase A (PKA) signalling. Collectively, our results show that D1R activation primes the CA2 for synaptic plasticity. Thus, we propose a link between neuropsychiatric diseases related to impaired dopamine transmission and deficits in hippocampus-dependent social memory."

"Adaptation is a fundamental aspect of motor learning. Intelligent systems must adapt to perturbations in the environment while simultaneously maintaining stable memories. Classic work has argued that this trade-off could be resolved by complementary learning systems operating at different speeds; yet the mechanisms enabling coordination between slow and fast systems remain unknown. Here, we propose a multi-region distributed learning model in which learning is shared between two populations of neurons with distinct roles and structures: a recurrent  controller network which stores a slowly evolving memory, and a feedforward  adapter network that rapidly learns to respond to perturbations in the environment. In our model, supervised learning in the adapter produces a predictive error signal that simultaneously tutors consolidation in the controller through a local plasticity rule. Our model offers insight into the mechanisms that may support distributed computations in the motor cortex and cerebellum during motor adaptation."
"The visual world is inherently complex, presenting far more information than a human visual system can process in full. To manage this overload, the visual brain employs several mechanisms. One mechanism that possibly contributes to the reduction of information is redundancy masking (RM): the reduction of the number of perceived items in repeating patterns. For example, when three identical lines are presented in the periphery, observers often perceive only two. The underlying neural mechanisms of RM remain unclear. Here, we use steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) to examine whether redundancy-masked items are neurally suppressed or integrated with neighboring items. Three identical arcs (quarter-circles; 0.44{degrees} line width) were presented in the periphery (eccentricities: 17.3{degrees}, 19.5{degrees}, and 21.7{degrees}), each tagged with a unique frequency. Participants maintained central fixation, monitored via a gaze-contingent control, and reported the number of arcs they predominantly perceived after each 10s trial. We analyzed baseline-corrected amplitudes at each tagged frequency and calculated signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) for fundamental and intermodulation (IM) components, separating trials by behavioral responses (RM: 2 items perceived, non-RM: 3 items perceived). Fundamental frequency comparisons revealed that the outer arc elicited higher SSVEP responses than the inner and middle one under RM, with no significant differences between arcs under non-RM. However, fundamental frequency SNRs did not differ between RM and non-RM perceptions. When we compared IM SNRs, the middle and outer arcs combination was significantly higher during RM compared to non-RM, suggesting increased neural integration between them. These results indicate that RM involves a loss of conscious access to visual information, yet corresponding neural signals are not entirely suppressed. Instead, the neural signatures we found suggest the integration with neighboring elements across space and time. We suggest that redundancy-masked items - although unavailable for conscious report- are still observed in the neural signatures of RM."
"Enhancers are key gene regulatory elements that ensure the precise spatiotemporal execution of developmental gene expression programmes. However recent findings indicate that approaches to identify enhancers may not capture the full repertoire of active enhancers in mammalian genomes. Here, we combine massively parallel enhancer assays with chromatin structure and transcriptome profiling to functionally annotate enhancers genome-wide in human induced pluripotent stem cells. We find that a substantial fraction ([~]40%) of accessible chromatin regions with enhancer function lack key features associated with active enhancers, including the active enhancer mark histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation and enhancer-associated RNAs. Perturbation of this class of non-canonical enhancers by CRISPR-mediated epigenome editing results in decreased levels of target gene expression and, in one instance, loss of pluripotent stem cell characteristics. Collectively, our data demonstrate enhancer activity for a class of gene regulatory elements that had until now only been associated with a neutral or inactive status, challenging current models of enhancer function."
"BackgroundChronic stress increases risk for neuropsychiatric disorders in humans. By modeling stress-induced changes in animals, we may improve diagnosis or treatment of these disorders. Successful translation benefits from studies with sufficient statistical power and outcome measurements that can be directly compared across species. We performed a meta-analysis to examine the impact of chronic stress on the whole blood transcriptome.

MethodsDatasets were systematically identified in Gemma, a database of reprocessed public transcriptional profiling studies; datasets GSE68076, GSE72262, and GSE84185 met inclusion/exclusion parameters. Each study exposed eight-week old mice to chronic stress (5-10 days social defeat stress or 6-8 weeks chronic mild stress). The final sample size was n=92 (n=45 Non-Stress/n=47 Stress). Stress-related differential expression in each dataset was quantified using the Limma pipeline followed by empirical Bayes moderation. For the 9,219 genes represented in all three datasets, we ran a meta-analysis of Log(2) Fold Changes using a random effects model and corrected for false discovery rate (FDR). Functional patterns were assessed with fast Gene Set Enrichment Analysis. Cell type specific enrichment for each of the differentially expressed genes was further explored using a public 10x genomics scRNA-Seq dataset from mouse peripheral blood mononuclear cells.

ResultsFindings included 23 downregulated and 16 upregulated transcripts in stress-exposed mice (FDR<0.05). Results indicated a down-regulation in gene sets related to B cells, immune response, DNA and chromatin regulation, ribosomal activity, translation, and catabolic cellular processes. Upregulated gene sets related to erythrocytes and oxygen binding.

ConclusionOur results provide molecular insight into stress-related immune dysregulation and add weight to the hypothesis that environmental stress escalates cellular aging, supporting the use of blood transcriptome as a bridge between human and rodent models.

The present report is a meta-analysis of three mouse experiments examining the impact of chronic stress on the whole blood transcriptome.

These findings illustrate the utility of the blood transcriptome as a bridge between human and rodent models."
"MicroRNAs (miRNA) are small non-coding RNAs that are key negative regulators of gene expression. Their roles include shaping the gene expression landscape during and after brain development by defining and maintaining levels of proteins that generate the distinct morphological and functional properties of neurons and other brain cell types. HT22, N2A, and SH-SY5Y are common immortalized neuronal cell lines that offer simple, less expensive, and time-saving options for in vitro modelling to evaluate miRNA functions. The extent to which these lines reflect primary neurons remains, however, unclear. Here, we benchmarked the miRNA profiles of cultured mouse hippocampal neurons against Argonaute-loaded miRNAs in the adult mouse hippocampus and miRNA data from the hippocampus of patients with drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy. We then compared the miRNA expression landscape in HT22, N2A and SH-SY5Y against mouse hippocampal primary cell cultures. We profiled over 700 miRNAs across the lines and detected 310 miRNAs in all four cell types. This included detection of neuron-enriched miRNAs such as miR-124 and miR-128, although the cell lines typically displayed lower levels of these than in primary neurons and reference adult hippocampal tissue. The miRNA profile in the HT22 cell line showed the highest correlation to the mouse primary neuronal cultures. Together, this study provides a dataset on basal miRNA expression across commonly used cell lines for neuroscience research and evidence for both conserved and distinct profiles that should be used to inform decisions on cell lines for modelling brain and miRNA research."
"The rise and fall of motivational states may take place over timescales as long as many days. We used mouse mating behavior to model how the brain orchestrates slow-timescale changes in motivation. Male mice become sexually satiated after successful matings, and their motivation to mate gradually recovers over a week. Using deep-brain fluorescence-lifetime imaging in the medial preoptic area (MPOA), we found that tonic dopamine transmission--which regulates mating drive--also declined after mating and re-emerged over a week. Two mechanisms regulated dopamine transmission. First, successful mating transiently reduced tonic firing of hypothalamic dopamine-releasing neurons, thereby inhibiting dopamine release and mating behavior. Second, mating reduced the ability of these neurons to produce and release dopamine, and this ability gradually returned over the week-long recovery time course. Therefore, fast and slow mechanisms of neuronal plasticity cooperate to control the early and late phases of motivational dynamics, respectively."
"Microglia response is proposed to be relevant in the neurogenerative process associated with -synuclein (-syn) pathology in Parkinsons disease (PD). STING is a protein related to the immune sensing of DNA and autophagy, and it has been proposed to be involved in PD neurodegeneration. To investigate this, we injected 10 {micro}g of murine pre-formed fibrils (PFFs) of -syn (or monomeric and PBS as controls) into the striatum of wild-type (WT) and STINGgt/gt mice, which lack functional STING. We examined motor behavior and brain pathology at 1- and 6-months post-injection. STINGgt/gt mice showed more motor changes associated with PFF injection than WT mice. STINGgt/gt mice had a differential immune response to PFF with early and sustained increased microglia numbers and earlier macrophagic CD68 response, but milder changes in the expression of immune-relevant markers such as TLR2, TLR4, IL1b, and TREM2. However, the lack of STING did not induce changes in the extent of -syn pathology nor the p62 accumulation seen in the model. Altogether, this resulted in a faster but similar degree of nigrostriatal dopaminergic degeneration after 6 months. Therefore, the data do not support a necessary role for STING in the -syn induced nigral neuronal loss in the PFF-PD mouse model used here. However, the results suggest a functional relevance for STING in the brain response to the excess of amylogenic proteins such as -syn that can contribute to symptomatic changes."
"Moore swabs have been used extensively for passive sampling in wastewater surveillance, typically yielding presence/absence information for targets of interest. Quantitative analysis of Moore swab data is only possible if target uptake is well characterized, specifically the relationship between quantity of the target in the liquid sample matrix and the quantity of target sorbing to the Moore swab as a function of time. The mechanism of Moore swab absorption remains unclear and is important to understand toward using them more quantitatively. We conducted viral adsorption and desorption experiments using nonpathogenic SARS-CoV-2 surrogates: {Phi}6, MHV, and BCoV as well as heat-inactivated Zika virus (ZIKV). We fit empirical adsorption data from batch experiments to Langmuir, Freundlich and Redlich-Peterson isotherm models. We observed the adsorption behavior of viral targets onto Moore swabs is best characterized by the Redlich-Peterson isotherm model. Moore swabs retained the highest viral RNA concentrations after exposure durations between 9-12 hours in the presence of target microbes during kinetic viral adsorption experiments. The results inform current and future use of Moore swabs to produce quantitative data during wastewater surveillance, especially in settings where composite sampling remains infeasible.

ImportanceThis paper describes the adsorption behavior of viruses and bacteriophages to Moore swabs. Passive sampling via Moore swabs is among the most scalable form of passive wastewater sampling, considered critical to advance wastewater surveillance globally. But key unknowns constrain the utility of Moore swabs and all passive sampling approaches, including the quantitative relationship between targets in wastewater and recovery via Moore swabs. Practical questions such as how long they should be deployed and whether they can be interpreted quantitatively really depend on a characterization of viral target loading behaviors on Moore swab material as a function of time and concentration in the wastewater. Here, we use an approach that is seldom applied to microbial targets to examine adsorption behavior of viruses to Moore swabs, deriving isotherms that describe the relationships between concentration of the viral targets in wastewater and time on attachment to swab material. This is a critical step in advancing the application of Moore swab passive sampling for wastewater surveillance, with potential relevance to other microbial targets of interest."
"Human chorionic gonadotropin beta (beta-hCG) is an oncofetal antigen expressed by trophoblast cells of the placenta, with minimal expression in adult somatic tissues. Numerous studies have demonstrated that beta-hCG-encoding genes are expressed in various cancers, but expression of these genes (CGB3, CGB5, CGB7, and CGB8) across diverse cancers has not been systematically evaluated. Here, we report that CGB genes are more widely expressed across diverse cancer types than previously appreciated and that secreted beta-hCG is readily detected. In particular, CGB genes are expressed in the majority of urothelial bladder cancers, where CGB7 is most frequently expressed and significantly associated with an immunosuppressed tumor microenvironment, including decreased CD8+ T cell infiltration. Multiple CGB genes are associated with failure to respond to immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy, and CGB7 is particularly strongly predictive of poor prognosis. Overall, our findings indicate that beta-hCG is a clinically accessible, predictive biomarker of immunotherapeutic response."
"Aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA) is a major cause of primary aldosteronism (PA), the most frequent form of secondary hypertension. Although somatic mutations in ion channels within APA have been shown to activate Ca2+ signaling and drive aldosterone production, the pathophysiology of PA remains partially understood. Substance P (SP), encoded by the TAC1 gene, is a neuropeptide of the tachykinin family, known for its role in stimulating aldosterone production through activation of the neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1R) in the human adrenal cortex. The aim of our work was to investigate the presence of SP nerve fibers and the NK1 receptor in a large series of APA to assess the potential role of this neuropeptide in the pathophysiology of PA. We analyzed 56 APA tissues using molecular, immunohistochemical, and functional techniques to assess the expression of SP and NK1R and examine the action of SP on aldosterone secretion. SP-positive nerve fibers were detected in 90% of the APA tissues, appearing localized both within and around the adenomas, which also showed strong NK1R expression. Functional studies revealed that SP stimulated aldosterone secretion in 6 of 10 APA cultures. The NK1R antagonist aprepitant inhibited SP-induced aldosterone secretion in 3 of the 4 SP-responsive APA cultures on which the antagonist was tested. Additionally, in perifused APA explants, SP influenced aldosterone pulsatility, resulting in enhanced mineralocorticoid secretion. These findings suggest that the SP-NK1R signaling pathway may contribute to APA pathophysiology and represent a novel potential target for the pharmacological treatment of PA in a subset of patients."
"ObjectiveTo assess the effect of morning resistance exercise on afternoon physical and cognitive performance in male rugby union players.

MethodsOn two occasions (randomised, crossover design), 25 male rugby union players completed morning physical (countermovement jump, 40 m linear sprint) and cognitive (rapid visual information processing; spatial working memory; paired associates of learning) assessments. Control (passive rest) or intervention (barbell back squat, 3 x 3 repetitions at 85% of one repetition maximum and barbell squat jump, 5 x 3 repetitions at 40% one repetition maximum) trials were implemented 5.5 h before afternoon assessments.

ResultsDifferences between morning and afternoon assessments were found in sprinting performance following intervention for 30 m fly (-0.08 {+/-} 0.13 s, P = 0.001, ES: -0.75) and 40 m (-0.12 {+/-} 0.17 s, P = 0.004, ES: -0.62) relative to control (0.03 {+/-} 0.07 s, 0.01 {+/-} 0.09 s, 30 m fly and 40 m, respectively). Afternoon countermovement jump flight time improved following intervention compared to control (2% vs. 0%, p = 0.012). Delta analysis discovered significant differences from morning to afternoon in intervention (0.385 ms {+/-} 0.053) but not control (0.405 ms {+/-} 0.057). No changes were found for cognitive assessments (P > 0.05).

ConclusionMorning lower body resistance exercise, incorporating a combination of high intensity and ballistic exercises, was an effective morning strategy to improve afternoon markers of physical but not cognitive performance in male rugby union players."
"Developing crop varieties that maintain productivity under drought is essential for future food security. Here, we investigated the potential of time-resolved high-throughput phenotyping to predict harvest-related traits and identify drought-stressed plants. Six barley lines (Hordeum vulgare) were grown in a greenhouse environment with well-watered and drought treatments, and phenotyped using RGB, thermal infrared, chlorophyll fluorescence and hyperspectral imaging sensors. Temporal phenomic classification model accurately distinguished between drought-treated and control plants, achieving high accuracy (R2 [&ge;] 0.97) even when exclusively using predictors only from the early phase after drought induction. Canopy temperature depression at the early stage and RGB-derived plant size estimates at the late stage were identified as key classification features. Temporal phenomic prediction model of harvest-related traits achieved particularly high mean R2 values for total biomass dry weight (0.97) and total spike weight (0.93), with RGB plant size estimators emerging as important predictors. Prediction accuracy for these traits remained high (R2 [&ge;] 0.84) when using only predictors from the first half of the experiment. Models trained on pooled drought and control data outperformed single-treatment models and retained high accuracy when applied across treatments. These findings support the integration of high-throughput phenotyping and temporal modelling to enable timely and more cost-effective selection of drought-resilient genotypes, and illustrate the broader potential of phenomics-driven approaches in accelerating crop improvement under stress-prone conditions."
"We updated a recent meta-analysis of active learnings impact on student achievement in undergraduate STEM courses by following the same protocol to evaluate studies published from 2010-2017. We screened 1659 papers, coded 1294, and found 210 that met five pre-established inclusion criteria and six pre-established criteria for methodological quality. After further dropping 76 studies with no exam scores data, 134 of these studies contained data on student performance on identical or equivalent exams. We found that on average, active learnings effect size on exam scores was 0.519 {+/-} 0.049, meaning that when students are in active learning classes, they perform roughly half a standard deviation higher on an identical exam. Funnel plots and sensitivity analyses indicated that these results were not due to sampling bias. Active learning had a positive impact on student outcomes regardless of class size, course level, or STEM discipline, though there was heterogeneity in the effects. All of these results are very similar when compared to earlier meta-analyses, however increased resolution in the studies analyzed here revealed two novel results. First, student performance was significantly better in courses that employed high-intensity active learning, defined as students being on task at least two-thirds of class time, versus lower-intensities. Additionally, there was significant heterogeneity in efficacy across different types of active learning employed. These results suggest that most, if not all types of active learning are effective, and that when innovating in their classes, instructors should continually work to increase active learning intensity. We urge caution in interpreting the results on active learning types, however, and propose a preliminary framework for making more-sophisticated and reliable analyses of variation in course design. Finally, the evidence presented here for active learnings impact on student outcomes creates a strong foundation for faculty professional development and administration."
"Upper limb motor deficits are common after stroke and often persist despite rehabilitation. While clinical assessments emphasize movement quality, they do not capture the underlying neuromuscular impairments, particularly in individuals with mild deficits. This study aimed to characterize stroke-related changes in muscle recruitment during reaching by separating tonic (gravity-compensating) and phasic (intersegmental dynamics-related) components of EMG activity.

We recorded surface EMG from 12 upper limb muscles during goal-directed reaching in 8 individuals with unilateral ischemic stroke and 9 controls. Using principal component analysis, we extracted tonic and phasic components and compared their amplitude, directional tuning, and coactivation patterns across groups. Group differences were evaluated with generalized linear mixed-effects models, regression, and correlation analyses.

Even individuals with mild stroke exhibited abnormal muscle recruitment. Proximal muscles were over-recruited in directions that typically require less activation, indicating altered directional tuning. Phasic activation of distal muscles was significantly reduced and worsened with time post-stroke (R2 = 0.52, p = 0.002). Tonic overactivation of proximal muscles was present across all stroke participants. Muscle coactivation patterns were hemisphere-specific: right-hemisphere stroke reduced tonic coactivation in contralateral arms, whereas left-hemisphere stroke increased it. Abnormal phasic coactivation between proximal and distal muscles correlated with impaired intersegmental dynamics compensation (R2 = 0.67, p = 0.013). Tonic and phasic impairments were often correlated, suggesting shared disruption of corticospinal and reticulospinal pathways.

These findings reveal distinct yet interacting deficits in muscle recruitment following stroke, supporting the development of neuromechanically-informed tools for individualized rehabilitation."

"Tuberculosis (TB) remains the second leading cause of infectious disease mortality worldwide, killing over one million people annually. Rising antibiotic resistance has created an urgent need for host-directed therapeutics (HDTs) -- preferably by repurposing existing approved drugs -- that modulate host immune responses rather than directly targeting the pathogen. Repurposed therapeutics have been successfully identified for cancer and COVID-19 by finding drugs that reverse disease gene expression patterns (an approach called  connectivity scoring), but this approach remains largely unexplored for bacterial infections like TB. The application of transcriptome-based methods to TB faces significant challenges, including dataset heterogeneity across transcriptomics platforms and biological conditions, uncertainty about optimal scoring methods, and lack of systematic approaches to identify robust disease signatures. Here, we developed an integrative computational workflow combining multiple connectivity scoring methods with consensus disease signature construction and used it to systematically identify FDA-approved drugs as promising TB host-directed therapeutics. Our framework integrates six complementary connectivity methods and constructs weighted consensus signatures from 21 TB gene expression datasets spanning microarray and RNA-seq platforms, diverse cell types, and infection conditions. Our approach prioritized 140 high-confidence drug candidates that consistently reverse TB-associated gene expression changes, successfully recovering known HDTs, including statins (atorvastatin, lovastatin, fluvastatin) and vitamin D receptor agonists (calcitriol). We identified promising novel candidates such as niclosamide and tamoxifen, both recently validated in experimental TB models, and revealed enrichment for therapeutically relevant mechanisms, e.g., cholesterol metabolism inhibition and immune modulation pathways. Network analysis of disease-drug interactions identified 10 key bridging genes (including MYD88, RELA, and CXCR2) that represent potential novel druggable targets for TB host-directed therapy. This work establishes transcriptome-based connectivity mapping as a viable approach for systematic HDT discovery in bacterial infections and provides a robust computational framework applicable to other infectious diseases. Our findings offer immediate opportunities for experimental validation of prioritized drug candidates and mechanistic investigation of identified druggable targets in TB pathogenesis."
"Cells are capable of sensing mechanical changes in their cytoskeletal network via stress-sensitive actin-binding proteins. Recently, a novel stress-sensing mechanism was described whereby LIM domains from diverse protein families bind directly to stressed actin filaments. It remains unclear, however, how the interaction of these domains with actin is regulated in the context of full-length proteins. Here, we show that the LIM domain containing region (LCR) of the planar cell polarity protein Prickle2 (Pk2) associated with stressed actin filaments in Xenopus mesoderm alongside known stress-sensitive LIM domains. By contrast, the full-length Pk2 did not exhibit similar recruitment along actin filaments. Structure function analysis revealed that both the structured PET domain and unstructured C-terminal region of Pk2 suppress recruitment of Pk2s LCR to stressed actin and promote recruitment to Pk2-rich nodes. Finally, we show that two human patient-derived variants associated with epilepsy result in a loss of Pk2-LCR recruitment to actin filaments. These data provide new insights into the regulation of stress-sensitive LIM domains and may inform our understanding of planar cell polarity."
"Mass spectrometry (MS) proteomics is currently the most powerful tool for identifying both annotated proteins and proteins translated from non-canonical open reading frames or unusual genetic events. With this method, numerous novel protein-coding loci have been discovered by searching for short fragments of hypothetical longer peptides and polypeptides. Apart from the validation of translation from mRNA transcripts, MS proteomics has been instrumental for the detection of peptides encoded by non-mRNA transcripts. A special application field of MS proteomics is studies on programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF), where the detection of chimeric peptides produced from two different reading frames is vital. Each novel chimeric peptide is thought to originate from a certain genetic locus. However, due to the short length of MS peptides, there is a possibility that MS-supported chimeric peptides are produced by additional (alternative) loci via PRF. This scenario evaded due attention because the contribution of non-canonical peptides and proteins to the functional diversity of proteomes is still thought to be minor. Recent studies have challenged this paradigm. To the best of our knowledge, our group was the first to include alternative chimeric sources into the analysis pipeline. This resulted in a much higher certainty about loci responsible for the production of unusual peptides. This certainty is crucial for the functional characterization of such loci. At the same time, our study revealed enormous diversity of potential alternative sources for a subset of MS-supported non-canonical peptides. Here, we present a highly flexible program that predicts alternative chimeric and non-chimeric sources of peptides detected by MS proteomics."
"A quantitative measurement can have variation, referred to here as measurement variation, which is a probability distribution. Machine Learning models typically produce a prediction corresponding to the mode of the measurement variation. The Deviation Error is a novel metric, described here, to assess predictions that accounts for measurement variation.

Measurement variations in genomics data were explored. Towards a general prescription for modelling genomics measurements to reduce the Deviation Error, different loss functions were used to fit models on synthetically generated data that mimics genomics measurements. Compared to using the Mean Squared Error as the loss function, none of the other loss functions examined yielded models that performed significantly better. However, using variants of the Mean Squared Log Error and the Negative Log Likelihood as loss functions yielded models that performed significantly worse."
"The assessment of monomer targets in the Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction Round 16 (CASP16) underscores that the problem of single-domain protein fold prediction is nearly solved--no target folds were missed across all Evaluation Units. However, challenges remain in accurately modeling truncated sequences, irregular secondary structures, and interchain-induced conformational changes. The release of AlphaFold3 (AF3) during CASP16, and its effective integration by many groups, demonstrated its superiority over AlphaFold2 (AF2), particularly in confidence estimation and model selection. Additional improvements in multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) and construct design, i.e., selecting the optimal fragment of the full sequence for modeling, also contributed to enhanced prediction accuracy. The top three groups--all from the Yang lab--consistently outperformed others across CASP16 monomer targets, reflecting their robust modeling pipelines and successful adoption of AF3. CASP16 also introduced three new challenges: Phase 0, in which stoichiometry was withheld; Phase 2, which supplied [~]8,000 MassiveFold models per target to test model selection strategies; and Model 6, which limited predictors to using MSAs provided by the organizers. While we evaluated group performance in these additional challenges, the insights gained were limited due to low participation and design flaws in the experiments. We suggest improvements for the organization of these challenges and encourage broader engagement from the prediction community. The progress in monomer modeling from CASP15 to CASP16 was very subtle, but more groups in CASP16 were able to outperform ColabFold, reflecting increased expertise in optimizing AF2 and the growing adoption of AF3. We anticipate that the recent release of the AF3 source code will stimulate future progress through user-driven optimization and innovations in model architecture. Finally, model ranking remains a persistent weakness across most groups, highlighting a critical area for future development."
"Complex biosystems exhibit ordered, functional, self-organized features. How-ever, a universal framework for exploring their logical paradigms and dynamic characteristics remains lacking. Here we describe BioLogical, a user-friendly R package, designed for analyzing properties of biosystems. We demonstrate its versatile capacities of deciphering multi-valued logical paradigms, calculating order parameters, and simulating system dynamic, even multi-valued Quine-McCluskey and logical satisfiability analysis. The open-source software is available at https://github.com/YuxiangYao/BioLogical."
"The human brain consists of functionally specialized areas that process specific types of information and interact with one another. Magnetoencephalog- raphy (MEG) is a neuroimaging technique that captures brain activity at high tem- poral resolution. However, its spatial resolution is insufficient to accurately localize neural activation, and thus cannot capture the interactive nature of human brain ac- tivity. To resolve this issue, various MEG source estimation models have been pro- posed. In particular, models incorporating prior information from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which offers superior spatial resolution, have improved source estimation accuracy. However, these models typically ignore the similarity of activity across different brain areas, and still fall short in tracking dynamic brain activity pattern at a sufficient spatial scale. In this study, we developed a block-structured model that integrates information about functional areas and the interareal relationships of the human brain into MEG source estimation based on a hierarchical Bayesian framework. We evaluated our model performance using simulation data with sequential activation across multiple brain areas. Results showed that our model outperformed conventional approaches in source estimation accuracy, suggesting that incorporating the functional areal information and inter-areal relationships may enhance MEG source estimation, enabling human neuroimaging at high spatiotemporal resolution."
"Functional connectivity (FC) patterns in the human brain form a reproducible, individual-specific ""fingerprint"" that allows reliable identification of the same participant across scans acquired over different sessions. While brain fingerprinting is robust across healthy individuals and neuroimaging modalities, little is known about whether the fingerprinting principle extends beyond the brain. Here, we used multiple spinal functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets acquired at different sites to examine whether a fingerprint can be revealed from FCs of the cervical region of the human spinal cord.

Our results demonstrate that the functional organisation of the cervical spinal cord also exhibits individual-specific properties, suggesting the potential existence of a spine-print within the same acquisition session.

This study provides the first evidence of a spinal cord connectivity fingerprint, underscoring the importance of considering a more comprehensive view of the entire central nervous system. Eventually, these spine-specific signatures could contribute to identifying individualized biomarkers of neuronal connectivity, with potential clinical applications in neurology and neurosurgery."
"The ability to store information in visual working memory is essential to plan and successfully execute memory-guided actions in natural human behavior. Typically, visual working memory research investigates how storing affects subsequent action. In doing so, however, the importance of how the action affects prior storing remains underappreciated. Therefore, we here question how the required precision for an action to succeed, affects how relevant visual information is encoded, maintained and finally acted on. To this end, we had participant memorize 1, 2 or 4 colors for delayed continuous report. Crucially, we manipulated how (im)precise the report was allowed to still be marked correct. Behavioral results showed that for actions with higher required precision, reports became more precise, but only when one or two colors were memorized. Also, reports became slower with higher required precision, regardless of the number of colors. By leveraging pupillometry, we further showed that with higher required precision, 1) colors were encoded deeper (since pupils constricted more during presentation), and 2) more effort was exerted to maintain the colors (since pupils dilated more during retention). Moreover, we found that participants kept exerting more effort to be precise (with increasing precision requirements), even when additional effort did not result in better performance anymore. Our findings demonstrate that humans consider their intended actions when encoding and maintaining information in visual working memory. Our results highlight the essential role of action in understanding how visual information is stored during natural goal-directed behavior. 242 words"
"Genetic variants that introduce a premature termination codon (PTC) are often assumed equivalent and functionally null. Exceptions depend on the specific architectures of the affected mRNA and protein. Here we address phenotypic differences among early truncating variants of mouse Zfp423, whose phenotypes resemble Joubert Syndrome and Related Disorders (JSRD). We replicate quantitative differences previously seen between presumptive null PTC variants based on their position in the coding sequence. We show with reciprocal congenic strains that large phenotype differences between two PTC variants with the same predicted stop and reinitiation codons is due to the specific allele rather than different strain backgrounds, with no evidence for induced exon skipping. Differences in RNA structure, however, could influence translation rate across the affected exon. Using a reporter assay, we find differences in translational reinitiation between two deletion variants that corelate with predicted RNA structure rather than distance from the canonical initiation codon. These results confirm and extend earlier evidence for differences among Zfp423 PTC variants, identify parameters for translational reinitiation after an early termination codon, and reinforce caution in the null interpretation of early PTC variants."
"Small-scale structures on biological surfaces can profoundly impact how animals move, appear, and interact with their environments. Such textures may be especially important for limbless reptiles, such as snakes and legless lizards, because their skin serves as the primary interface with the world around them. Here, we examine ventral microstructures of several limbless reptiles, which are hypothesized to be highly specialized to aid locomotion via frictional interactions. Inspired by prior studies that investigated potential links between microtextures, phylogeny, habitat, and locomotion--but that were limited by their reliance on shed skins--we characterized the structures present on preserved museum specimens and found that they are quantitatively similar to those found on shed skins. Using this result, we confirmed a previously hypothesized--but untested due to the lack of shed skins--third independent evolution of sidewinding-specific isotropic microtexture. Specifically, we examined a museum-preserved Bitis peringueyi specimen and identified a new instance of convergent evolution in sidewinding viper microstructures: the loss of micro-spikes (present on many snake species) and the appearance of micro-pits with a characteristic spacing. Our results reveal that museum-preserved specimens retain intact microtextures, greatly expanding the availability of samples for evolutionary studies."
"The cornerstone treatment for aggressive prostate cancer (PCa) is androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Eventually PCa cells develop castration resistance, i.e. resistance to ADT. Castration resistant PCa initially responds to androgen signaling inhibitors such as bicalutamide and enzalutamide, but the cells become resistant to these drugs as well overtime.

We used long-term cell cultures to create testosterone-dependent, testosterone-independent (CT), bicalutamide-resistant (BR), enzalutamide-resistant (ER), and sequential resistant BR-ER VCaP cell lines to investigate transcriptomic and proteomic changes during the development of drug resistance. Phenotypical changes were evaluated based on cellular morphology and sensitivity to docetaxel.

We observed marked changes in transcriptome during the development of drug resistance and differences between ER and sequential BRER. Androgen response and fatty acid metabolism were upregulated in both ER and BRER. MYC target hallmarks were positively enriched only in BRER. Negative regulation of cell death was upregulated in ER while in BRER cell cycle related pathways were upregulated. Direct comparison of ER and BRER revealed androgen signaling signature being higher in ER than in BRER. BRER was more resistant to docetaxel than ER. Clinical significance of our results was confirmed using Finnish patient data and public patient data. In castration resistant patients response to enzalutamide treatment were decreased in patients first treated with bicalutamide comparing patients treated only with enzalutamide.

In conclusion, we showed that transcriptomic and phenotypic changes occurring during formation of drug resistances and docetaxel sensitivity depend on the sequence of treatments. Treatment responses were also different in sequentially treated patients. In the future, this may inform treatment sequencing to retain the PCa cells more sensitivity to subsequent treatment lines."
"Heat stress poses a significant threat to crop productivity; however, the thermotolerance mechanisms in underutilised oilseed crops, such as chia (Salvia hispanica L.), remain poorly understood. Despite the growing interest in chia as a rich source of {omega}-3 fatty acids, its molecular response to heat stress, particularly in vegetative tissues, has not been explored. We conducted transcriptomic and lipidomic profiling to examine how chia leaves respond to short-term (3 h) and prolonged (27 h) heat stress, followed by recovery under ambient conditions. Heat stress induced differential expression in over 20% of transcripts in chia leaves, with distinct patterns involving Ca{superscript 2} signalling, heat shock factors, and other biological pathways contributing to cellular homeostasis. Gene expression and lipid profiles in chia leaves responded dynamically to both short-term (3 h) and prolonged (27 h) heat stress (38{degrees}C/20{degrees}C). An almost complete return to baseline was observed, with all but 0.3% of heat-responsive genes reverting to control expression levels after 24 h. Our analysis confirms the role of Ca{superscript 2}-mediated signalling pathways and molecular chaperones, including heat shock proteins and heat shock factors, which have been previously shown to contribute to maintaining cellular function during heat stress in other plant species. Among 287 annotated lipid species, TGs exhibited the most significant and reversible changes (>2-fold), suggesting their involvement in membrane remodelling. Our findings reveal adaptive mechanisms in chia that may open avenues for enhancing thermotolerance in other heat-sensitive oilseed crops.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTUnderstanding how crops respond to heat stress is crucial as global temperatures rise. This study indicates that in chia (Salvia hispanica), pathways responding to heat stress, like calcium signalling and heat shock proteins, are rapidly activated, and leaf triacylglycerol levels rise under heat stress before returning to baseline during recovery. By demonstrating near-complete recovery of gene expression following heat exposure, these findings highlight mechanisms of thermotolerance that may support improved stress tolerance in other crops."
"A GGGGCC repeat expansion in C9orf72 is the most common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). The repeat expansion is translated into five different dipeptide repeat proteins: polyGA, polyGP, polyGR, polyAP and polyPR. To investigate the effect of polyGA, which is the most abundant dipeptide repeat protein in patient brains, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to insert 400 codon-optimized polyGA repeats immediately downstream of the mouse C9orf72 start codon. This generated (GA)400 knock-in mice driven by the endogenous mouse C9orf72 promoter, coupled with heterozygous C9orf72 reduction. (GA)400 mice develop subtle pathology including mild motor dysfunction characterized by impaired rotarod performance. Quantitative proteomics revealed polyGA expression caused protein alterations in the spinal cord, including changes in previously identified polyGA interactors. Our findings show that (GA)400 mice are a complementary in vivo model to better understand C9ALS/FTD pathology and determine the specific role of single DPRs in disease."
"The intestinal microbiota of fishes support digestion, nutrient uptake and play an important role in the immune system, development and reproduction. Flatfish live in close contact with the seafloor, and are particularly exposed to anthropogenic disturbances such as bottom trawling. Bottom trawling impacts the ecosystem in various ways and it recent evidence indicates that the microbial composition and diversity in marine sediments varies with fishing intensity. It is presently unknown whether this trawling signal applies to the seafloor alone, or may also extend to microbiota of marine holobionts inhabiting it, such as flatfishes. Here, three flatfish species (Buglossidium luteum, Limanda limanda and Pleuronectes platessa) were sampled across the southeastern North Sea. We characterized the intestinal microbiota using 16S rDNA metabarcoding of 162 individuals, and disentangled how intestinal microbial composition and diversity are jointly shaped by various host traits (species, sex, age, weight, and condition factor) and environmental factors (sediment type and trawling intensity). Intestinal diversity varied among species and changed with age, weight and sediment type. Community composition was dependent on species, age, condition factor and sediment type. In addition, we found that trawling intensity explained shifts in intestinal microbial community composition, suggesting that the known impacts of bottom trawling on the benthic environment may cascade to intestinal microbiota of flatfish. Our findings provide important insight into host-microbiota interactions in marine ecosystems and highlight the interplay between host traits and environment as drivers of intestinal microbial diversity and community composition in flatfish.

"In recent years, genome-wide data from thousands of ancient human remains have been sequenced, offering unprecedented insights into past populations. This vast dataset of ancient human genomes and their associated metadata holds immense value for archaeologists, anthropologists, and biologists. However, extracting insights often requires advanced bioinformatics knowledge, creating barriers for non-experts. To address this challenge, we present a curated dataset and user-friendly web application for published genome-wide data from ancient Britain and Ireland, including new data produced by the COMMIOS Project. The platform integrates visualization tools, enabling researchers to explore genetic connections between ancient and modern populations without requiring bioinformatics expertise."
"idTracker and idtracker.ai approach multi-animal tracking from video as an image classification problem. For this classification, both rely on segments of video where all animals are visible to extract images and their identity labels. When these segments are too short, tracking can become slow and inaccurate and, if they are absent, tracking is impossible. Here, we introduce a new idtracker.ai that reframes multi-animal tracking as a representation learning problem rather than a classification task. Specifically, we apply contrastive learning to image pairs that, based on video structure, are known to belong to the same or different identities. This approach maps animal images into a representation space where they cluster by animal identity. As a result, the new idtracker.ai eliminates the need for video segments with all animals visible, is more accurate, and tracks up to 440 times faster."
"Coordinated actions are fundamental to human behavior. Even without explicit communication, stable coordination patterns and implicit leadership roles can emerge. This study examines the dynamic nature of leadership and its impact on perceptuomotor learning in a dyadic coordination task. Paired participants (dyads) controlled targets using joysticks to produce a novel coordination pattern, which was learned using visual feedback without direct communication over multiple sessions. Results showed that leadership was an emergent property of the system, dynamically shaped by the interplay between individual and system-level stability. At the system level, leadership role transitions modulated the dyads learning, characterized by distinct learning models. At the individual level, leaders maintained overall stability but exhibited occasional bursts of instability to assert control and reinforce coordination. These findings highlight the role of leader-follower dynamics in learning and performance, showing that leadership is both a limiting factor and a facilitator for coordination."
"Understanding the mechanism of action (MoA) of bioactive compounds is a central challenge in drug discovery and chemical biology. In this article, we propose a strategy for integrating morphological data with proteomics to provide deeper insights into the MoA of compounds. We combine the rich phenotypic profiles of Cell Painting (CP) with the unbiased protein target detection of Thermal Proteome Profiling (TPP), and construct protein-protein interaction networks based on potential targets identified using both assays. We evaluate our method on public TPP data sets for the five compounds (+)-JQ1, I-BET151, Vemurafenib, Crizotinib and Panobinostat, together with Cell Painting data for 5270 drugs on U2OS cells. We show that the combined approach could accurately identify known MoAs for four out of five compounds. This work highlights the value of multimodal profiling for chemical biology and opens new avenues for data-driven discovery of therapeutic mechanisms."
"Parasitic infections often alter host behavior, including foraging and the consumption of bioactive substances. In honeybees (Apis mellifera), infection with the common gut parasite Nosema ceranae causes metabolic disruption and increased mortality. Ethanol is a naturally occurring bioactive compound found in nectar, and honeybees exhibit high tolerance and resilience to chronic exposure. However, whether bees actively use ethanol during infection remains unclear. Here, we investigated whether N. ceranae-infected honeybees alter their ethanol consumption. In a feeding experiment, infected and uninfected bees were given a choice between plain sucrose solution and ethanol-spiked food (0.5% or 1% ethanol). We measured food consumption, survival, and spore load. Although overall food intake did not differ between groups, infected bees consumed a significantly higher proportion of ethanol-spiked food. Survival analysis showed that a diet containing 1% ethanol caused higher mortality than a diet containing 0.5% ethanol; however, among bees on a 1% ethanol diet, this negative effect was less pronounced in infected individuals than in controls. Spore load did not differ between treatments. These results suggest that N. ceranae infection induces a shift in feeding behavior towards increased ethanol intake, which may benefit infected bees by reducing mortality. This may reflect a self-medication response, although alternative explanations - such as parasite-induced manipulation or ethanol-induced changes in host physiology and immunity - remain possible. Further research into ethanols effects on Nosema spores is needed. Nonetheless, our findings provide insights into honeybee interactions with bioactive compounds and suggest that ethanol may be a behaviorally relevant dietary substance."
"The dynamic evolution of SARS-CoV-2 virus since the COVID-19 outbreak in late 2019 has raised questions about potential evolutionary trends in protein-coding sequences and their adaptation to the human host. To address this, we compiled a dataset of 94,571 complete genomes with known collection dates, spanning from January 2020 to October 2024. Using a novel representation of codon usage, we recoded SARS-CoV-2 protein-coding sequences to strings of labels reflecting the human synonymous codon usage. Our analysis reveals different evolutionary pathways in the codon usage between structural, non-structural and accessory protein-coding sequences from the coronavirus. The genes coding for structural proteins tend to exhibit a less optimal adaptation to the human codon usage, whereas open reading frames ORF1a and ORF1ab encoding non-structural proteins show an opposite trend. The sequences for the accessory proteins demonstrated a variable tendency to change the codon preferences. The evolution of the more optimal codon usage in ORF1a and ORF1ab sequences can be associated with a higher speed and efficiency of translation of the coded polyproteins. Following their cleavage, the products play important roles in viral replication and transcription. Thus, the adaptation of their codons can increase the virus proliferation. In contrast, alterations in codon usage within structural protein-coding sequences may be associated with changes in their less accurate translation and folding during the synthesis, which can provide an advantage in evading the host immune response. The results show that codon usage adaptations to the human host differ based on the gene type and function, reflecting a balance between their conflicting evolutionary pressures. Our findings on variations in codon usage among coronavirus genes provide valuable insights that can aid in developing new strategies for the optimization of codons in vaccine mRNA and DNA for emerging strains."
"Tall fescue (Lolium arundinaceum) is an important forage and turf grass that covers 35 million acres (140,000 square kilometers) in the transition zone of the southeastern United States. Most tall fescue in the US is infected with a symbiotic fungus, Epichloe coenophiala, which confers biotic and abiotic stress tolerance for the plant but also produces toxic alkaloids that harm livestock. Although there has been prior evidence that the grass host can influence alkaloid production levels, these have never been precisely quantified. Here, we report on testing alkaloid production and relative fungal biomass on >1000 genetically distinct tall fescue plants. We find that these two traits are weakly correlated, and that both show evidence of moderate to high influence by the host genome. Genome-wide association find only a single marginally significant hit, however, implying that any genetic control by the host is spread among a large number of genes. These results indicate that the host plant exerts moderate influence on these endophytic traits, that the two are largely independent of each other, and that the hosts influence is likely due to a large number of genes of small effect. These results have relevance for breeding tall fescue for forage and turf production, and especially for optimizing the endophyte relationship for tall fescue management."
"Malaria parasites develop within a specialized vacuole delimited by the parasitophorous vacuolar membrane (PVM). The exit of Plasmodium from host cells is a well-regulated process involving several molecules that disrupt the PVM to continue the life cycle. While several protein classes play a role in Plasmodium PVM rupture and merozoite egress, the first class of enzymes one would consider to act on membranes is lipases. However, the role of a lipase in PVM disruption remains unknown. Here, we characterized the role of UIS28 (upregulated in infective sporozoite gene 28) in Plasmodium berghei. Bioinformatic studies indicated that UIS28 is a class 3 lipase containing a fungal lipase-like domain. We found that UIS28 localizes to the PVM in infected hepatocytes. To understand the role of UIS28 in PVM disruption, we validated its lipase activity and found that it breaks down lipids into glycerol. Parasites lacking UIS28 develop normally in the blood and mosquito stages and mature fully into hepatic merozoites but show a defect in egress from host hepatocytes. We quantified the PVM rupture and reported that mutant parasites exhibit delayed egress due to impaired PVM disruption. Together, our results demonstrate that UIS28 is a lipase involved in the disruption of the PVM and the successful egress of hepatic merozoites.

Author SummaryAn essential step in the life cycle of malaria parasites is their egress from hepatocytes, allowing them to transition from the liver stage to the blood stage. Liver stage parasites reside in a PV, which is surrounded by a PVM. Parasites must breakdown the PVM before they can infect other cells. This complex, multistep process is orchestrated by the parasite and involves several molecules to disrupt the PVM. However, little is known about these molecules. Here, we validated that UIS28 is indeed a lipase. We show that UIS28 is expressed in sporozoites and in the liver stage, and that it localizes to the PVM of parasites within hepatocytes. Disruption of UIS28 gene does not affect blood and mosquito stage development. However, mutant parasites show a defect in the disruption of the PVM and egress of hepatic merozoites. For the first time, we demonstrate the role of a lipase in PVM rupture during the release of liver-stage merozoites."
"The global use of bisphenol F (BPF) has led to widespread environmental contamination, posing significant threats to ecosystems and human health. However, the genes involved in BPF degradation remained unknown. In this study, a novel oxidase gene, bpfA, was obtained from strain Microbacterium sp. F2 through a four-step purification strategy. BpfA is classified as a member of the 4-phenol oxidizing (4PO) subfamily and contains a conserved FAD-binding domain (Asp152 and His393) as well as a Tyr-Tyr-Arg triad (Tyr93, Tyr474, Arg475). BpfA catalyzes the conversion of BPF to 4,4-dihydroxydibenzophenone (DHBP) through a series of three consecutive reactions. In addition, BpfA exhibits catalytic activity towards 4-alkylphenols, such as vanillyl alcohol (VA), 4-n-propylguaiacol (4PG), and 4-(methoxymethyl)phenol (4MOP). BpfA homologs are widely distributed in the environment, particularly in soil. Bioinformatics-based taxonomic profiling revealed that BpfA homologs are widely distributed in metagenomes from cultivated land and forests, mainly belonging to Pseudomonadota and Actinomycetota. This study enhances our understanding of the microbial degradation mechanism of BPF, elucidates the catalytic function of the novel oxidase gene bpfA and its distribution pattern in the environment, and provides important insights into the evolutionary origin of BPF degradation genes and the targeted mining of environmental microbial resources."
"High-risk neonatal sepsis resulting in up to four million infants mortality and organ damages during the first 28 days of life predominates in low-income countries. We investigated genotypic antibiotic-resistant genes in emerging bacterial pathogens from newborn sepsis cases in Lagos.

A cross-sectional study of 294 at-risk hospitalised newborns in prominent paediatrics hospitals throughout three senatorial districts of Lagos utilised the socio-demographic data of their mothers and informed consents. We aseptically collected approximately 3 mL of venous blood from neonates, subsequently isolated and identified the associated bacteria using agar culture on Mueller Hinton agar. To evaluate the antibiotic resistance genes, we used Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion technique; MICROBACTTM Identification System and molecular techniques including PCR, RAPD-PCR, sequencing and docking.

From 294 patient samples, 110 (37.4%) were cultured positive, with men (47%), females (53%), ages [&le;] 72 hours (71.8%), and ages > 72 hours (28.1%). Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Enterobacter gergoviae, Serratia rubidiae, Escherichia coli, and Cronobacter sakazakii were the involved Gram- negative bacteria, whereas Coagulase-negative Staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis were the involved Gram-positive bacteria. Fourteen (12.7%) positive bacteria were resistant to only three antibiotic classes, whereas 73 (66.4%) were resistant to over three antibiotics. Antibiotic- resistant genes bla-CTX, bla-SHV, and bla-TEM were found in Serratia rubidiae and Enterobacter gergoviae, unusual aetiology of newborn sepsis. Molecular docking proved Meropenems antibacterial effectiveness.

The identified antimicrobial-resistant genes are crucial for improved patient management, as high- resistance strains of ampicillin, gentamicin, and cefotaxime remain ineffective against bacterial sepsis, leaving Meropenem as the sole feasible therapeutic option."
"Microbes are ubiquitous in the rhizosphere and play crucial roles in plant health, yet the metabolisms and physiologies of individual species in planta remain poorly understood. In this study, we examined microbial gene expression in response to the maize root environment for seven bacterial species originally isolated from maize roots. We grew each species individually, both in vitro in a minimal medium and in planta, and used differential metaproteomics to identify functions upregulated specifically when bacteria are grown on maize roots. We identified between 1,500 and 2,100 proteins from each species, with approximately 30-70% of these proteins being differentially abundant between the two conditions. While we found that transporter proteins were upregulated in all species in planta, all other differentially abundant functions varied greatly between species, suggesting niche specialization in root-associated microbes. Indeed, in vitro assays confirmed that Curtobacterium pusillum likely degrades plant hemicellulose, Enterobacter ludwigii may benefit the plant by phosphate solubilization, and Herbaspirillum robiniae colonizes maize roots more effectively when both of its Type VI Secretion Systems are functional. Together, our findings highlight both conserved and species-specific bacterial strategies for growth in the root environment and lay a foundation for future work investigating the mechanisms underlying plant-microbiota interactions."
"A prevailing hypothesis for the emergence of life on Earth holds that it might have originated in hydrothermal vents, where the environmental conditions, although physically and chemically extreme (acidity, lack of oxygen, high pressure, very high temperature), vary very little. According to this view, single-celled organisms appeared under these conditions subsequently began to colonize all aquatic environments, followed by terrestrial ones. Here, I study the proteomes of more than 250 reference proteomes of archaea as well as those of a few non-reference Promethearchaeati (ASGARD), which have an optimal growth temperature of between 10{degrees}C and 100{degrees}C. I found a correlation between the chaperome present in these organisms, and in particular the presence/absence of the HSP70 family (DnaK-DnaJ-GrpE, KJE for brevity) and the optimal growth temperature. These findings suggest that appearance of HSP70s in mesophilic living conditions was the key to greater adaptability of the organisms, to their ability to colonize different environments and, ultimately, led to the appearance of eukaryotes."
"Abelson-1 (ABL-1) is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that plays essential roles in various cellular processes, including proliferation, survival, differentiation and its kinase activity is tightly regulated. The dysregulated ABL-1 kinase activity is linked to disease pathogenesis like Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML), where the BCR::ABL-1 fusion oncoprotein drives oncogenic signaling. Due to its central role in CML pathogenesis, understanding the structure of ABL-1 is crucial for the effective management of the disease and drug development studies. This study focuses on optimizing the expression, purification and crystallization of the recombinant human ABL-1 kinase domain for its structural analysis via X-ray crystallography and structure-based drug screening applications. The human ABL-1 kinase domain, fused with a SUMO-tag, was expressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta2 BL21 using the pET28(a)+ expression vector. The ABL-1 aggregates seen under native culture conditions were successfully solubilized by mild ionic detergent sarkosyl. After obtaining soluble expression of the protein, Ni-NTA affinity chromatography was performed and high tiled of purified ABL-1 was obtained. The 6X-His-SUMO-tag of purified ABL1 was cleaved by ULP1 protease. The recombinant ABL-1 was subsequently used in crystallization trials for enlightening structural features of ABL-1 that could guide the development of novel therapeutics and drug screening platforms targeting ABL-1 in CML."
"AbstractMetabolites play critical roles in modulating gut-microbe interactions and are closely related to health and disease consequences. One critical aspect of the gut-microbe interactions is spatial heterogeneity, particularly at the interface space between gut tissue and luminal contents, where a unique microhabitat of diverse microbial functions encounters the host tissues. Exploring the spatial heterogeneity of this interface enables insights into these gut-microbe interactions. Previous studies commonly investigated metabolome through tissue homogenization and bulk analysis, but these methods result in the loss of spatial information. In this project, we use high-resolution matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) approaches to reveal the chemical spatial heterogeneity of colon tissue, luminal contents, and the tissue-lumen interface across multiple colonic regions. We applied a swiping technique to aid the preservation of luminal content integrity and used two MALDI matrices to cover a wide range of metabolites. The MALDI-MSI analyses revealed distinct patterns of metabolite spatial localization across the gut tissue-lumen interfaces, amongst which the interface-enriched features are of particular interest due to their possibly connection to the gut-microbe interactions. Overall, the rich spatial heterogeneity of metabolomic profiles across the gut tissue-lumen interfaces highlight the molecular participants in host-microbe interactions, providing new opportunities for examining host-microbiome-metabolome dynamics."
"Clostridium kluyveri is a promising biocatalyst for producing medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) from waste-derived carbon via chain elongation. MCFAs are platform chemicals with diverse applications across agriculture, food, cosmetics, and fuels, and could support efforts towards tandem resource recovery and sustainable chemical production. However, genetic intractability has hindered efforts to engineer C. kluyveri for improved product yields, control over chain length and selectivity, and production of non-native oleochemicals. Here, we report a streamlined, biparental methylation-conjugation system developed for C. kluyveri DSM555T to bypass the organisms restriction-modification barriers and enable stable plasmid delivery. We use this system to demonstrate heterologous expression of the Fluorescence-Activated absorption-Shifting Tag (FAST), an anaerobic fluorescent reporter. This system supports advances in metabolic engineering of C. kluyveri and the broader adoption of genetic tools in chain elongating bacteria to expand the applications of anaerobic chain elongation in industrial biomanufacturing.

"Clostridium kluyveri is a promising biocatalyst for producing medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) from waste-derived carbon via chain elongation. MCFAs are platform chemicals with diverse applications across agriculture, food, cosmetics, and fuels, and could support efforts towards tandem resource recovery and sustainable chemical production.

"This study developed a biocompatible multifunctional thiol-ene resin system for adhesion to dentin mineralized tissue. Adhesive resins maintain the strength and longevity of dental composite restorations through chemophysical bonding to exposed dentin surfaces after cavity preparations. Dental pulp cells are exposed to residual monomers transported through dentinal tubules. Monomers of conventional adhesive systems may result in inhomogeneous polymer networks and the release of residual monomers that cause cytotoxicity. In this study, we develop a one-step multi-functional polymeric resin system by incorporating trimethylolpropane triacrylate (TMPTA) and bis[2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl] phosphate (BMEP) to enhance both mechanical properties and adhesion to dentin. Molecular dynamics simulations identified an optimal triacylate:trithiol ratio of 2.5:1, which was consistent with rheological and mechanical tests that yielded a storage modulus of ~30 MPa with or without BMEP. Shear bond tests demonstrated that the addition of BMEP significantly improved dentin adhesion, achieving a shear bond strength of 10.8 MPa, comparable to the commercial primer Clearfil SE Bond. Nanoindentation modulus mapping characterized the hybrid layer and mechanical gradient of the adhesive resin system. Further, the triacrylate-BMEP resin showed biocompatibility with fibroblasts in vitro. These findings suggest the triacrylate-trithiol crosslinking and chemophysical bonding of BMEP provide enhanced bond strength and biocompatibility for dental applications."
"Long-read RNA-sequencing enables the profiling of full-length transcripts, but its quantification accuracy data has still not been robustly established. This is especially true for PacBio lrRNA-seq data, which were previously only available at low to moderate depth. Using a high-depth PacBio Kinnex lrRNA-seq dataset, sample-matched with Illumina short-read RNA-seq, we performed rigorous benchmarking to characterize quantification accuracy between platforms on a dataset representing differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells into primordial endothelial cells. We identified biases impacting transcript quantification, including inferential variability within Illumina data, which can bias transcript abundance estimates for genes with complex splicing, as well as length biases in Kinnex data. Overall, PacBio and Illumina quantifications were strongly concordant, supporting that PacBio Kinnex is a reliable method for transcriptome profiling and enabling downstream biological analyses."
"Cancer (tumorigenic) cells exhibit cellular properties such as tumorigenicity, evasion of anti-tumor immunity and cell death, metastasis, etc. We showed previously that the core property of cancer cells is neural stemness, which represents general stemness and confers cancer cells with tumorigenicity and pluripotency. Immunogenicity of cancer cells plays the key role in anti-tumor immunity. While tumorigenicity is defined by neural stemness and its regulatory networks, how immunogenicity of cancer cells is determined and how tumorigenicity is related with immunogenicity remained unknown. In the present study, we show that genes conferring tumorigenicity and genes conferring immunogenicity are inversely correlated with differentiation status of cells. Cancer cells can be induced to differentiate into different types of cells either by lineage specific differentiation factors, e.g., muscle differentiation factor MYOD1 or adipocyte differentiation factor PPARG, or by blocking cell-intrinsic oncofactors, e.g., SETDB1. Induced differentiation reprograms both cellular properties and transcriptomes of cancer cells, leading to suppression of genes conferring tumorigenicity and upregulation of genes conferring immunogenicity, and ultimately, leading to loss of neural stemness, suppression of tumorigenicity and enhancement of immunogenicity in cancer cells after differentiation. Vice versa, dedifferentiation leads to the opposite effect. The results identified the cellular mechanism that tumorigenicity and immunogenicity of cancer cells are inversely connected and determined by differentiation status. Such a mechanism, together with our previous studies, reinforces that cancer cell properties should be understood by understanding neural stemness and the principle of embryonic cell/tissue differentiation, and novel cancer therapies can be developed by employing differentiation effect of cancer cells induced by differentiation factors. As a proof of concept test, we showed that muscle differentiation factor MYOD1 suppresses tumorigenesis in a mouse model of hepatocellular carcinoma."
"Study objectivesThe presence of APOE4, a genetic risk factor for Alzheimers Disease (AD), is associated with reduced functional connectivity of brain regions that regulate sleep, which may predispose persons to AD via altered sleep architecture. However, little is known about differences in sleep architecture by APOE genotype, and whether they vary by age and sex.

MethodsThis cross-sectional study examined the association between APOE genotype and sleep architecture, using in-home polysomnography (Sleep Heart Health Study, N=3,107). APOE genotype included: APOE4 heterozygotes, APOE4 homozygotes, APOE2 carriers, and APOE3 homozygotes (reference). Sleep architecture was quantified using the percentage of time spent in rapid eye movement sleep (%REM), N1 (N1%), N2 (%N2), N3 (%N3), and arousal index. Linear regression was employed, adjusting for age, sex, marital status, race, education, and parent cohort. Interactions with age and sex-stratified analyses examined variations by age and sex, respectively.

ResultsThe median age was 67 years, 27.4% carried at least one APOE4 allele, and 52.9% were females. Without age by APOE genotype interaction, %REM, %N1, %N2, %N3, and arousal index were comparable across APOE genotypes in the full sample, males, and females. When an age by APOE genotype interaction was introduced, APOE4 homozygotes showed fewer arousals with each year of age ({beta}=-0.33 arousals, p=0.04), leading to significantly less arousals at age [&ge;]70 (marginal difference=-2.98, p=0.04).

ConclusionsCompared with APOE3 homozygotes, APOE4 homozygotes showed comparable proportions of REM, N1, N2, and N3, but exhibited fewer arousals in old age. APOE4 homozygotes may have an elevated arousal threshold."
"Signaling by formyl peptide receptor 1 (FPR1), the prototype G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) expressed in neutrophil leukocytes, is initiated by an activation of a G protein containing a Gi subunit. FPR1 activation results in an increase in the cytosolic concentration of free calcium ions ([Ca2+]i), and an activation of the superoxide anion producing NADPH oxidase. Receptor downstream signals generated by the danger molecule ATP recognized by the purinergic receptor P2Y2 are transduced by a G protein containing a Gq subunit. The neutrophil response induced by ATP also includes a transient rise in [Ca2+]i, but the downstream signals do not activate the NADPH oxidase. ATP can, however, activate this enzyme system through a receptor transactivation mechanism dependent not only on the ATP receptor but also on the free fatty acid receptor FFA2R, provided that this receptor is allosterically modulated. This occurs through a novel mechanism whereby FFA2R is activated from the cytosolic side of the plasma membrane by Gq transduced signals generated by the ATP receptor. Furthermore, in neutrophils with a disrupted actin cytoskeleton, ATP (as well as platelet activating factor; recognized by the Gq-coupled PAFR) becomes a potent NADPH oxidase activating agonist. At high concentrations of the actin cytoskeleton disrupting drug latrunculin A the activation was only partly reduced by Gq inhibition. More importantly, this response was also partly inhibited by pertussis toxin. The effects on the ATP-induced NADPH oxidase activity, of the Gq inhibitor and pertussis toxin were more and less pronounced, respectively, when the concentration of latrunculin A was reduced. Taken together, we show that in primary human neutrophils the actin cytoskeleton is part of the regulatory machinery that determines the activation of NADPH oxidase activation and the G protein recruitment profile downstream of activated of Gq-coupled GPCRs.

"Saccharibacteria are episymbionts that require host-bacteria to grow. They are positively associated with inflammatory diseases within the human microbiome, yet their mechanisms for interacting with the human host and contributing to diseases remain unknown. This study investigated interactions between a Saccharibacterium (Nanosynbacter lyticus), its host-bacteria (Schaalia odontolytica), and oral epithelial cells. The host-bacteria induced proinflammatory cytokines in epithelial cells, while Saccharibacteria were immune silent. Remarkably, Saccharibacteria dampened cytokine responses to host-bacteria during coinfection. This effect was driven by Saccharibacteria-induced clustering of TLR2 receptors, a process likely facilitated by type IV, ultimately leading to reduced TLR2-mediated cytokine signalling. High resolution imaging showed that Saccharibacteria were endocytosed by oral epithelial cells, and colocalized with endosome markers, eventually trafficking to lysosomes. Moreover, a subset of the Saccharibacteria survive endocytosis long-term, and retains their capability to reinfect host-bacteria, highlighting a mechanism for persistence in the oral microbiome and a vital role in mammalian immune system modulation."
"Candida auris is a growing public health concern, capable of causing long-term contamination of healthcare settings, skin colonization, and life-threatening bloodstream infections. However, C. auris pathogenesis is not well understood, which is exacerbated by limitations and discrepancies in existing animal infection models. Further, the effects of C. auris growth phase on virulence have not been examined, despite growth phase being linked to virulence in many bacterial species. To address this question, and to develop an immunocompetent murine model of infection, we directly compared log and stationary phase C. auris systemic infection in immunocompetent C57BL/6J mice at high and low doses of infection. Systemic infection with high dose log-phase C. auris results in rapid mortality between 2 hours and 1 day post infection, whereas stationary phase C. auris results in significantly extended survival. However, at low doses of infection, there was no difference in mortality kinetics between log and stationary phase cells. We observed that C. auris initially colonizes multiple organs but is rapidly cleared from the lungs and spleen, while kidney fungal burdens remain stable. Decreased fibrinogen levels and blood clotting in the lungs of mice infected with high dose log-phase C. auris suggest that blood clotting may drive rapid mortality, potentially associated with increased {beta}-glucan exposure and mannan abundance observed in log phase C. auris. These results will inform the development of a more standardized animal model of systemic C. auris infection, which can be used to reveal key aspects of C. auris pathogenesis.

ImportanceDespite its growing medical importance, there is limited understanding of Candida auris pathogenesis, due in part to limitations of existing laboratory models of infection. To develop a more complete understanding of factors that contribute to C. auris pathogenesis, it will be necessary to establish consistent parameters for animal models of infection. To address this need, we directly compared log and stationary growth phases on C. auris pathogenesis in immunocompetent C57BL/6J mice using a single Clade I isolate. At a high dose of infection, host survival was dramatically different between log or stationary phase C. auris, suggesting that growth phase can affect C. auris virulence. These differences correlated with increased exposure of pathogen-associated molecular patterns in the C. auris cell wall in log phase cells. These results will be instrumental in the future development of standardized animal models to study C. auris pathogenesis."
"Vibrio vulnificus is a natural inhabitant of coastal brackish waters worldwide and an opportunistic pathogen that can cause severe infections and septicemia through seafood consumption or wound exposure. Due to global warming, its abundance is increasing at high latitudes. While the species harbors diverse virulence factors, its precise disease mechanisms remain unclear. Comparative genomics between clinical and environmental isolates can help identify key virulence genes, but the limited availability of genomes from environmental isolates has hindered progress. In this study, we sequenced the genomes of 82 V. vulnificus isolates from water, sediment, and seagrass along the Baltic Sea coast and complemented with published genomes from 208 clinical and 117 globally distributed isolates for comparative analysis. Phylogenetic reconstruction confirmed four major lineages, with Baltic Sea strains confined to lineage L2 and L4, while clinical and environmental strains were distributed across all lineages. This suggests that the phylogenetic structure of V. vulnificus reflects adaptation to environmental conditions rather than pathogenicity. Using the PhyloBOTL pipeline developed here, we identified 128 orthologs significantly enriched in clinical isolates, grouped into 36 co-localization clusters based on proximity in the genomes. These included genes linked to virulence, such as those for capsular polysaccharide synthesis and biofilm formation, as well as previously unrecognized candidates, including chaperone-usher pilus biosynthesis, spermidine synthesis, Type VI secretion effectors, and an RTX toxin-like protein. Several of the clinically enriched gene clusters have been independently lost in three V. vulnificus clades, suggesting convergent evolution and a distinct ecological niche shared by these claded. Finally, we used the clinically enriched genes to design PCR primers for detecting and monitoring pathogenic V. vulnificus strains, providing a valuable tool for surveillance and public health efforts."
"Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a ubiquitous pathogen that persists throughout the lifetime of the host due in part to the establishment of latency in CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) and CD14+ monocytes. HCMV encodes four putative G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs): US27, US28, UL33, and UL78. While the roles of most of these receptors have been investigated, a definitive role for UL78 in HCMV infection has yet to be elucidated. Utilizing an in vitro CD34+ HPC model, we demonstrate that a recombinant virus lacking UL78 protein expression fails to efficiently reactivate from latent infection. Furthermore, we show using a Lumit-based assay that UL78 preferentially couples to the Gi family of G proteins and that a recombinant HCMV containing mutations in the UL78 G protein-coupling DRL motif also fails to reactivate from latent infection. Together our findings indicate that Gi coupling is important for UL78 function during reactivation in latently infected CD34+ HPCs, however the protein is not required to establish or maintain latency. To better understand the role of UL78, we conducted proximity-dependent labeling analyses in HCMV-UL78-TurboID infected fibroblasts and CD34+ HPCs undergoing reactivation from latency. Congruent with our coupling data, we found Gi was the only heterotrimeric G protein in proximity to UL78. Pathway analysis of the UL78 interactome revealed proteins associated with membrane trafficking, signaling, and the nuclear pore complex as enriched in both cell types. In addition, the UL78 interactome contained viral proteins with nuclear localization including viral transcription and DNA replication machinery. Nuclear localization of UL78 was validated using cell fractionation, immunofluorescence microscopy, and proximity-dependent labelling of isolated nuclei. Together, our results provide novel insights into the localization and function of UL78, previously unknown to contribute to reactivation from latent infection.

Author SummaryHuman cytomegalovirus (HCMV) remains one of the most widespread viral infections globally. Primary HCMV infection is typically asymptomatic and leads to the establishment of latency in myeloid lineage cells, where the virus persists for the hosts lifetime. Reactivation of latent HCMV can cause severe complications, particularly in immunocompromised individuals such as transplant recipients and people living with HIV. Several factors influence the transition from latent to lytic infection, including signal transduction through the viral G protein-coupled receptors: US27, US28, UL33, and UL78. Using an advanced in vitro model, we show that recombinant viruses lacking UL78 fail to efficiently reactivate from latent infection. Moreover, we show that UL78 preferentially couples to the Gi family of G proteins via a conserved DRL motif, and this coupling is required for efficient reactivation. These results were confirmed by proximity-dependent labeling experiments where we identified Gi and several other proteins involved in trafficking, signaling, transcription, and nuclear localization. Nuclear localization of UL78 was confirmed by cell fractionation, immunofluorescence microscopy, and proximity-dependent labeling in isolated nuclei. Collectively, our results uncover a novel role for UL78 in reactivation from latency and shed new light on its localization and function."
"The global distribution of biodiversity is shaped by a complex interplay of evolutionary history and ecological processes. While biogeographic patterns are well defined for animals and plants, the global distributions of protists remain unclear. A key question is whether protists follow the same broad biogeographic principles as macroscopic life. To address this, we compiled 88 marine COI metabarcoding studies performing population-genetic analyses across ocean basins. Our results reveal that most protist phyla exhibit pronounced genetic structure among oceans, a pattern exceeding that reported for Archaeplastida and Metazoa. This likely reflects recent, and potentially human-mediated, introductions, influencing protist dispersal and contemporary community assembly. By demonstrating that protist distributions are not historically cosmopolitan, our study supports the existence of common eukaryotic biogeographic patterns that transcend organismal size."
"Understanding bird diversity across land use and land cover (LULC) in fragmented land-scapes is essential for effective conservation planning in human-modified landscapes. Using one year of eBird data from 2023, this study assessed bird species richness, diversity indices, and feeding guild composition across ten LULC classes in Wayanad, southern India. We employed rarefaction methods to estimate effort-adjusted species richness due to unequal sampling effort across classes, and analysed community composition using Jaccard dissimilarity and Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA). Natural habitats, primarily evergreen and moist deciduous forests, supported the most diverse and functionally specialised bird communities. In contrast, agricultural and urban areas were dominated by generalist guilds such as omnivores and granivores, indicating ecological simplification. Interestingly, tea plantations exhibited high rarefied richness despite lower overall diversity, likely due to uneven sampling patterns. The study demonstrates that citizen science data can reveal meaningful patterns in bird community structure across varied land use types with appropriate analytical corrections. These findings highlight the potential of eBird for landscape-scale biodiversity monitoring and support the value of integrating functional guild perspectives into conservation strategies."

"AbstractThe use of drones has become a commonly used tool by plant scientists to aid in plant phenotyping endeavors. Iron deficiency chlorosis (IDC) is a commonly observed abiotic stress in soybean fields with high soil pH levels. IDC severity is visually classified, and recent work has shown that digital imaging techniques using both ground and UAS-acquired imagery can be utilized for automated severity ratings. In our study, we compared the classification accuracy of two flight altitudes to determine the optimal flight parameters for IDC phenotyping. In addition to this, we investigated the ability to use image-predicted scores for genome wide association study (GWAS), as well as the effect of IDC on traits such as canopy area and canopy growth and development. We also report a tool for semi-automated plot extraction from orthomosaic images that can be easily integrated with UAS. We noted that 43 days after planting was an ideal time for IDC severity ratings as the highest number of significant SNPs were reported at this timepoint."
"ContextIps typographus, a major pest of Norway spruce (Picea abies) in Europe, is experiencing more frequent outbreaks due to climate change. These outbreaks involve shifts in population dynamics and phenotypic traits, influencing beetle responses to olfactory cues from stressed host trees.

AimsThe study examines the size-dependent behavioral and antennal responses of female I. typographus to two host selection-deciding volatiles with contrasting ecological roles: 1,8-cineole, which inhibits attraction to unsuitable trees, and (+)-isopinocamphone, a pheromone synergist. Size-linked morphological and olfactory adaptations may influence females ability to select suitable host trees for reproduction.

MethodsIn field trap experiments conducted in 2019 and 2022, the body size of I. typographus females caught in response to different doses of (+)-isopinocamphone or 1,8-cineole in combination with pheromone was compared. Female Ips typographus were sorted based on body length, the size of the antennal club was measured, and size-dependent antennal responses to these volatiles were analyzed using electroantennography.

ResultsLarger females were more attracted to (+)-isopinocamphone in combination with pheromone in the field, showed stronger antennal detection, and had proportionally larger antennal clubs than smaller females. In contrast, smaller females were less repelled by 1,8-cineole added to pheromone but, in contradiction, antennally detected it more strongly than larger females despite having smaller antennal clubs.

ConclusionThe total body length significantly influences semiochemical detection in I. typographus females. (+)-isopinocamphone was detected more effectively by larger females, implying an advantage in the selection of suitable host trees. In contrast, the discrepancy between behavioral and antennal responses to 1,8-cineole in smaller females suggests the involvement of not only peripheral detection but also central nervous processing of olfactory signals driving behavior. This adaptation may enable smaller females to reduce competition with large ones by selecting less suitable trees. These findings provide new insights into the ecological relationship between beetle morphology and olfactory cues, with implications for tree-bark beetle interactions.

Key messageThis study revealed differing behavioral and antennal responses between large and small female I. typographus to two bioactive oxygenated monoterpenes, (+)-isopinocamphone and 1,8-cineole, which serve contrasting ecological roles as aggregation pheromone synergist and inhibitor. Larger females were more attracted to (+)-isopinocamphone and had larger antennal clubs leading to enhanced antennal sensitivity, potentially improving their ability to select suitable host trees. In contrast, smaller females were less repelled by 1,8-cineole but had higher antennal sensitivity despite having smaller antennae. This discrepancy can be explained by behavioral decisions made after downstream olfactory signal processing in the central nervous system (CNS) and by the co-localization of 1,8-cineole with pheromone-sensitive neurons. Ecologically, small females may avoid competition with larger females by selecting less suitable trees. In conclusion, females body size influences olfactory-driven response to potential host selection decisive volatiles, which can impact reproductive success and bark beetle population dynamics."
"Mammalian organs are composed of cells, whose properties differ depending upon their spatial location. Gene expression in liver varies between periportal and pericentral hepatocytes1-3, and in intestine from crypts to villus tips4,5. A key element of tissue spatial organization is likely metabolic, but direct assessments of spatial metabolism remain limited. Here we map spatial metabolic gradients in murine liver and intestine. We developed an integrated experimental-computational workflow using MALDI imaging mass spectrometry, isotope tracing, and deep-learning artificial intelligence. Most measured metabolites (> 95%) showed significant spatial concentration gradients in liver lobules and intestinal villi. In the liver, tricarboxylic acid (TCA)-cycle metabolites and their labeling from both glutamine and lactate localized periportally. Energy-stress metabolites including adenosine monophosphate (AMP) also localized periportally, consistent with high periportal energy demand. In intestine, the TCA intermediates malate (tip) and citrate (crypt) showed opposite spatial patterns, which aligned with higher glutamine catabolism in tips and lactate oxidation in crypts based on isotope tracing. Finally, we mapped the fate of the obesogenic dietary sugar fructose. In the intestine, oral fructose was catabolized faster in the villus bottom than the tips. In the liver, fructose-derived carbon accumulated pericentrally as fructose-1-phosphate and triggered pericentral adenosine triphosphate (ATP) depletion. Thus, we both provide foundational knowledge regarding intestine and liver metabolic organization and identify fructose-induced focal derangements in liver metabolism."
"Data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry (DIA-MS) has emerged as a powerful approach for comprehensive proteome profiling. Spectral library search and library-free search are the two major approaches for DIA data analysis. The spectral library search requires high-quality spectral libraries derived from the search results of data-dependent acquisition (DDA) experiments, while library-free approaches rely on prediction models to generate in silico libraries. Both methodologies constrain the search space to the peptide list in the database, limiting the discovery of variant peptides arising from genetic variations or mutations. We present a novel computational method DIAVariant designed to identify peptide sequence variants directly and solely from complex DIA spectra while rigorously controlling the false discovery rate. Our experimental results demonstrate that DIAVariant successfully identifies sequence variants previously detected through proteogenomic approaches, while maintaining high specificity across multiple datasets. When integrated with existing DIA database search solutions, our approach constitutes a comprehensive analytical workflow capable of identifying peptides both represented within reference protein databases and those arising from sequence variations not captured in standard databases."

"Modern agriculture depends on chemically synthesized nitrogen fertilizer, which ensures high yields but also can carry significant environmental and economic costs. Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) already supplies nitrogen to legume crops and several avenues of research are underway to extend it to non-legume crops. In maize (Zea mays), aerial roots have been shown to contribute to BNF in some varieties, and both having many aerial roots and large aerial roots contributes to the fixation trait. However, much of the genetics controlling aerial root number and size is still unknown. Here we validate and quantify BNF in maize varieties from Southern Mexico under controlled conditions and evaluate a population of double haploids derived from the elite inbred PHZ51 crossed with these varieties. We find that most aerial root traits (root number, nodes with roots, root size) are reasonably heritable (h2 0.5-0.75) and generally uncorrelated with each other. QTL mapping identifies 5 QTL each affecting nodes with aerial roots and aerial root number per node; in both cases all but 1 QTL show an increase from the landrace allele. We also identify 11 QTL for aerial root diameter, with most positive QTL coming from PHZ51. Between the two populations, only a few QTL overlap, indicating a presumably high diversity of genes affecting aerial root morphology in landrace populations. Combining the best QTL into elite material may provide a path toward meaningful levels of BNF for maize, and additional work is needed to determine how viable this approach will be in field settings."
"Bovine Parainfluenza Virus Type 3 (BPIV3) is a leading cause of respiratory illness in cattle and a primary component of Bovine Respiratory Disease Complex (BRDC), resulting in significant economic losses. Understanding the mechanisms of BPIV3 infection, particularly the entry process, is essential for developing effective control measures. Identifying specific host factors that viruses exploit during their life cycle can reveal critical vulnerabilities for potential antiviral targets. We established a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screen in bovine cells to identify host factors involved in viral infections. Our screen identified several key host factors required for BPIV3 infection, including the sialic acid transporter SLC35A1 and the protein LSM12. Further mechanistic analysis revealed that these factors play critical roles at distinct stages of the BPIV3 entry process. These findings not only advance our understanding of how BPIV3 infects host cells, but also identify potential host targets for inhibiting infection and developing novel antiviral strategies."
"Swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) is an emerging bat-origin alphacoronavirus causing severe disease in neonatal piglets, with significant economic losses to the swine industry as a consequence. The virus exhibits a broad species tropism, infecting cells derived from pigs, humans and mice, highlighting its potential for cross-species transmission. Due to drawbacks associated with the use of young piglets, there is a need for an appropriate small animal model to study SADS-CoV biology. Here we established a mouse infection model based on a murinized mutant of the virus, mSADS-CoV, in which the ectodomain of the viral spike protein was replaced by that of the murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). This chimeric virus, generated through targeted RNA recombination, replicated efficiently in murine cell cultures and exhibited an age-dependent infection in neonatal mice that was lethal in 2-day-old BALB/c mice affecting various organs, notably the intestine. We validated our infection model by successfully verifying the efficacy of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor remdesivir (RDV). The model will serve as a valuable tool for studying SADS-CoV pathogenesis and for elucidating the roles of host factors in viral replication as well as for preclinical evaluation of vaccine candidates and antiviral compounds targeting the viral replication machinery.

Author SummarySADS-CoV poses a dual threat to the swine industry and public health because of its broad species tropism and potential for cross-species transmission. The emergence of other bat-derived coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), SARS-CoV-2, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), underscores the need for robust models to study these pathogens. The successful rescue of mSADS-CoV and the development of a mouse infection model represent significant advancements in SADS-CoV research. This model not only enables the evaluation of antiviral therapeutics such as RDV but also provides a powerful platform for investigating viral replication mechanisms and host-pathogen interactions, offering critical insights for pandemic preparedness."
"PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are a group of short ([~]21-31 nucleotide) non-coding RNAs that protect the germline of metazoans against the activity of genomic parasites known as transposable elements (TEs). Although originally discovered in Drosophila where they are germ-line restricted, recent studies in arthropods have shown piRNAs are often expressed also in somatic cells suggesting they might have originally evolved as a somatic immune system protecting against the detrimental action of TEs in the last common ancestor. Beyond their classic TE-silencing roles piRNAs functions range from sex determination in moths, to degradation of maternal mRNAs during the maternal-to-zygotic transition, thus highlighting the need for more sampling across the tree of life, particularly in underrepresented speciose rich subphyla such as the crustaceans were to date only two representatives have been analysed. In this study we sequenced and analysed putative piRNAs in the amphipod Parhyale hawaiensis, throughout a time-course of embryogenesis. Initially, during early embryogenesis piRNAs-mapping reads were abundant, maternally loaded piRNAs and showed the hallmark signatures of piRNA processing suggesting active targeting of TEs. Interestingly, this initial high content was followed by a dramatic loss of piRNA-mapping transcripts and signatures during mid-embryogenesis shortly after germ cell specification. This was confirmed by in-situ hybridization of key mRNAs coding for piRNA pathway proteins which revealed their expression becomes restricted specifically to the germ cells by early germband formation, providing an explanation for the observed reduction in piRNA abundance at later stages, and suggesting that piRNAs are absent in Parhyale post embryonic somatic cells."
"The evolution of the human pathogen M. tuberculosis is shaped by various but interconnected processes of drug treatment pressure and host adaptation. We hypothesize that rarely accounted dinucleotide substitutions within a single codon, which allow for a broader range of amino acid substitutions than single nucleotide changes, are a significant aspect of diversifying selection.

From the analysis of 43 studies, comprising 11,730 clinical isolates with resistance to rifampicin, 11 different dinucleotide substitutions were identified in 54 codons of resistance-determining regions of the rpoB gene. The prevalence of such substitutions is approaching 4%. Although rifampicin was introduced in treatment regimens in the 1970s, dinucleotide substitutions were also found in resistance determinants for newer drugs, linezolid and bedaquiline, rplC, and atpE, despite the significantly smaller number of resistant clinical isolates reported.

Conducting a genome-wide analysis of dinucleotide mutations in the dataset of 9,941 genomes studied by the CRYpTIC Consortium, in addition to resistance determinants, we discovered three genes with a significantly elevated number of dinucleotide substitutions, which are presumably related to virulence and host adaptation. Two substitutions, cyp138 P114F and L191A are supposed to occur early in the evolutionary history of lineage 2 and are now under strong selection for reverse substitutions. Two amino acid substitutions in the third gene, rv2024c N508T and C514L, could also be obtained by single nucleotide changes and therefore are supposedly being selected based on frequency of codon usage.

The signature of dinucleotide mutations introduces a novel approach to understanding the evolution of pathogen and identifying potential targets for antivirulence drugs. They underscore the complexity of the evolutionary dynamics within this pathogen, driven by diverse selection pressures, shedding light on the ongoing battle between M. tuberculosis and its human host."
"Homozygous loss-of-function mutations in LNPK, the gene encoding the endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein lunapark, have previously been linked to an autosomal recessive neurodevelopmental syndrome. Here, we describe an individual harboring compound heterozygous predicted splice site mutations with an overall matching phenotype. In cultured fibroblasts, these mutations result in a dearth of transcript and severe loss of protein, thereby establishing their likely pathogenicity. The underlying reduction in gene expression is due to the activation of the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway as a consequence of exon-skipping rather than intron retention, leading to aberrant transcripts. We further demonstrate that LNPK is subject to genetic compensation, as both cells from the affected individual and her mother exhibit a significant increase in transcript compared to a control cell line when treated with an inhibitor of NMD. Together, this report describes novel disease-causing variants in LNPK and reveals their impact on transcription and mRNA stability."
"Interindividual differences in nest defense towards a single predator type have been shown to be repeatable in multiple species, supporting the presence of personality. Here, we assessed if the nest defense of female northern house wrens (Troglodytes aedon) was repeatable across different types of predators, which is predicted by personality and largely untested. Over three years, we placed a decoy of a common nest predator, the eastern rat snake (Pantherophis alleghaniensis), on top of nest boxes and measured female behavior. Each season, we also presented a second stimulus of varying threat level, including an eastern chipmunk decoy (Tamias striatus), a taxidermied Coopers hawk (Accipiter cooperii), and a novel object of unknown threat. We measured repeatability between each pair of threats and compared the population-level response to the snake across years. Nest defense was significantly repeatable between the snake and chipmunk, which presented similar risks. It was also repeatable between the snake and novel object despite the population-level response to the object being significantly weaker. In contrast, nest defense was not repeatable between the snake and the hawk, which posed a significant threat to adult survival that may have disrupted the consistency of the female response. Finally, the average, population-level response to the snake did not detectably differ among years, indicating stability in this behavior despite high turnover in breeding adults. These results suggest the presence of personality in nest defense, but more research is needed to evaluate the effect of high-risk predators on the repeatability of this behavior.

Significance StatementDifferences among individuals in the strength of nest defense are often repeatable towards a specific predator, indicating the presence of personality. However, few studies have tested the repeatability of nest defense across different predators of varying threat levels. Personality predicts that weak/strong responders to one predator should also be weak/strong to another. We tested this prediction in female northern house wrens by placing decoys of different predators and a novel object on top of their nest boxes to measure nest defense. Nest defense was repeatable between two predators of similar risk and between a predator and a novel object of unknown risk. However, nest defense was not repeatable between a low and high-risk predator. The results suggest the presence of personality, but research is needed on the effects of high-risk predators that appear to disrupt behavioral consistency."
"Pangenomics, the identification of shared genes across a taxonomic range, is essential for understanding microbial genetic diversity and functional capacities.

This study introduces PyamilySeq, a flexible and transparent framework designed to systematically identify challenges in gene clustering and pangenomic analysis, and to support the development of practical solutions. By evaluating widely used gene clustering and pangenome tools, we can observe how clustering thresholds (often hardcoded or provided without a clear reason) and paralog handling impact gene family composition. More strikingly, while such tools are operated under the assumption that running them with broadly the same parameters will yield consistent results, this study demonstrates how parameters unrelated to clustering thresholds, such as parameter decimal precision (0.8 vs. 0.80), output selection, and even CPU and memory allocation, can alter gene family assignments. Additionally, sequence clustering and pangenome tools often fail to report biologically meaningful or representative sequences for gene families, further complicating downstream analyses.

This work highlights key limitations in current gene clustering and pangenome methodologies, demonstrating their potential to influence biological interpretations in fundamental ways. To advance the field, we must prioritise adaptable and transparent approaches that refine gene clustering methodologies and move beyond rigid, one-size-fits-all tools and parameter choices."
"In-silico prediction of protein mutant stability, measured by the difference in Gibbs free energy change ({Delta}{Delta}G), is fundamental for protein engineering. Current sequence-to-label methods typically employ the two-stage pipeline: (i) encoding mutant sequences using neural networks (e.g., transformers), followed by (ii) the {Delta}{Delta}G regression from the latent representations. Although these methods have demonstrated promising performance, their dependence on specialized neural network encoders significantly increases the complexity. Additionally, the requirement to individually compute latent representations for each mutant site negatively impacts computational efficiency and poses the risk of overfitting. This work proposes the Venus-MO_SCPLOWAXWELLC_SCPLOW framework, which reformulates mutation {Delta}{Delta}G prediction as a sequence-to-landscape task. In Venus-MO_SCPLOWAXWELLC_SCPLOW, mutations of a protein and their corresponding {Delta}{Delta}G values are organized into a landscape matrix, allowing our framework to learn the {Delta}{Delta}G landscape of a protein with a single forward and backward pass during training. Besides, to facilitate future works, we also curated a large-scale {Delta}{Delta}G dataset with strict controls on data leakage and redundancy to ensure robust evaluation. Venus-MO_SCPLOWAXWELLC_SCPLOW is compatible with multiple protein language models and enables these models for accurate and efficient {Delta}{Delta}G prediction. For example, when integrated with the ESM-IF, Venus-MO_SCPLOWAXWELLC_SCPLOW achieves higher accuracy than ThermoMPNN with 10x faster in inference speed (despite having 50x more parameters than ThermoMPNN). The training codes, model weights, and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/ai4protein/Venus-MAXWELL."
"Allele-specific expression (ASE) captures the functional impact of genetic variation on transcription, offering a high-resolution view of cis-regulatory effects, but its quality can be diminished by technical, biological, and analysis artifacts. We introduce aseQC, a statistical framework that quantifies sample-level ASE quality in terms of the overall expected extra-binomial variation to exclude uncharacteristically noisy samples in a cohort to improve robustness of downstream analyses. Applying aseQC to a dataset of rare mendelian muscular disorders, successfully identified previously annotated low-quality cases demonstrating clinical genomic utility. When applied to 15,253 samples in extensively quality controlled GTEx project data, aseQC uncovered 563 low-quality samples that exhibit excessive allelic imbalance. We identify these to be associated with specific processing dates but not otherwise described adequately by any other quality control measures and metadata available in GTEx data. We show that these low-quality samples lead to 23.6 and 31.6 -fold increased ASE, and splicing outliers, degrading the performance of transcriptome analysis for rare variant interpretation. In contrast, we did not observe any adverse effect associated with inclusion of these samples in common-variant analysis using quantitative traits loci mapping. By enabling quick and reliable assessment of sample quality, aseQC presents a critical step for identifying subtle quality issues that remain critical for a successful analysis of rare variant effects using transcriptome data."

"Preparation of single-cell sequencing libraries includes adding nucleotide barcodes to assist with pooling samples or cells together for sequencing. The popularity of droplet-based single-cell protocols has spurred the development of computational tools that expect the read structure of the assay to include a cell barcode (CB). Microwell plate-based protocols, such as the Switching Mechanism At the 5 end of the RNA Transcript (SMART) single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) family of methods, typically do not add a CB as part of the library preparation method as there is typically one cell per well and standard unique dual indices are sufficient for multiplexing. While several tools exist to manipulate and parse varying single-cell read structures, no tool is currently available to easily add synthetic CBs to enable use of computational tooling that expects the presence of a CB, such as STARsolo, zUMIs, and Alevin. Synthbar fills this gap as a lightweight tool that is assay agnostic, can add user-defined CBs, and modify read structures.

"BackgroundHigh-dimensional genomic studies in cancer research face significant challenges when analyzing survival outcomes, particularly in p >> n scenarios where thousands of genes are measured across relatively small patient cohorts. Traditional penalized regression methods like lasso and ridge regression apply uniform shrinkage without considering underlying biological relationships between genes, often resulting in unstable feature selection and reduced interpretability. Network-regularized methods that incorporate prior biological knowledge have emerged as promising alternatives, yet systematic comparisons of different network penalties in accelerated failure time (AFT) models remain limited.

MethodsWe developed and evaluated Weibull AFT models incorporating two network-regularized approaches: inverse-degree penalties that apply stronger shrinkage to highly connected hub genes, and graph Laplacian penalties that promote smoothness across connected nodes. We conducted comprehensive simulations across varying signal strengths, censoring rates (30%, 50%, 80%), and noise levels, followed by real-data applications on three cancer datasets (TCGA-KIRC, TCGA-COAD, and IDH-wildtype gliomas) using both STRING protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and co-expression networks. Performance was assessed using estimation and prediction mean squared error, false positive/negative rates, concordance index, and pathway enrichment analysis.

ResultsThe inverse-degree penalty demonstrated consistently more conservative feature selection behavior, achieving substantially lower false positive rates while maintaining competitive predictive performance compared to Laplacian penalties. In simulation studies, the inverse-degree method achieved false positive rates of 0.126 versus 0.299 for Laplacian penalties under strong signal conditions. Real-data applications showed comparable predictive accuracy (C-index: 0.61-0.73) between methods across cancer types. Both methods successfully identified biologically relevant pathways including mTORC1 regulation and fatty acid metabolism in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), and IL-17/chemokine signaling in IDH-wildtype gliomas. Notably, in colorectal adenocarcinoma (COAD) analysis, the inverse-degree method identified ten coherent pathways centered on inflammation, cell-cycle regulation, and proteasome function, while the Laplacian approach introduced potentially spurious neurotransmitter-release associations, demonstrating the inverse-degree penaltys superior biological interpretability.

ConclusionsNetwork-regularized AFT models with inverse-degree penalties offer a valuable tool for biomarker discovery in high-dimensional genomic survival analysis, providing conservative feature selection and superior biological interpretability while maintaining competitive predictive performance. The accompanying DegreeAFT R package makes these methods accessible to the broader research community, facilitating adoption in precision oncology applications where identifying reliable prognostic signatures is critical for treatment decision-making."
"Trained with large datasets, foundation models can capture complex patterns within these datasets to create embeddings that can be used for a variety of useful applications. Here we created a gene set foundation model that was trained on a massive collection of unlabeled gene sets from two databases: Rummagene and RummaGEO. Rummagene automatically extracts gene sets from supplemental tables of publications; and RummaGEO has gene sets automatically computed from comparing groups of samples from RNA-seq studies deposited into the gene expression omnibus. Several foundation model architectures and data sources for training were benchmarked in the task of predicting gene function. Such predictions were also compared to other state-of-the-art gene function prediction methods and models. One of the GSFM architectures achieves superior performance compared to all other methods and models. This model was used to systematically predict gene functions for all human gene. These predictions are served on gene pages that are accessible from https://gsfm.maayanlab.cloud."
"Understanding conserved and divergent cell types across plant species is essential for ad- vancing comparative genomics and improving crop traits. Accurate and scalable ortholog detection is central to this goal, particularly in cross-species single-cell analysis. However, conventional methods are time-consuming and perform poorly with distantly related species, limiting their effectiveness. To address these limitations, we introduce PLM-OMG, a protein language model-based framework for orthogroup classification and cross-species cell type mapping. We benchmark five deep learning models including ESM2, ProGen2, ProteinBERT, ProtGPT2, and LSTM, using a curated 15-species dataset and large-scale monocot and dicot datasets from PLAZA. Transformer-based models, particularly ProtGPT2 and ESM2, achieve superior accuracy and generalization across evolutionary distances. Our results show that PLM-OMG enables scalable and reusable orthogroup detection without recomputing existing groups, significantly reducing computational overhead and highlighting its potential to transform cross-species transcriptomic analysis in plant genomics."
"Biomedical research underpins progress in our understanding of human health and disease, drug discovery, and clinical care. However, with the growth of complex lab experiments, large datasets, many analytical tools, and expansive literature, biomedical research is increasingly constrained by repetitive and fragmented workflows that slow discovery and limit innovation, underscoring the need for a fundamentally new way to scale scientific expertise. Here, we introduce Biomni, a general-purpose biomedical AI agent designed to autonomously execute a wide spectrum of research tasks across diverse biomedical subfields. To systematically map the biomedical action space, Biomni first employs an action discovery agent to create the first unified agentic environment - mining essential tools, databases, and protocols from tens of thousands of publications across 25 biomedical domains. Built on this foundation, Biomni features a generalist agentic architecture that integrates large language model (LLM) reasoning with retrieval-augmented planning and code-based execution, enabling it to dynamically compose and carry out complex biomedical workflows - entirely without relying on predefined templates or rigid task flows. Systematic benchmarking demonstrates that Biomni achieves strong generalization across heterogeneous biomedical tasks - including causal gene prioritization, drug repurposing, rare disease diagnosis, micro-biome analysis, and molecular cloning - without any task-specific prompt tuning. Real-world case studies further showcase Biomnis ability to interpret complex, multi-modal biomedical datasets and autonomously generate experimentally testable protocols. Biomni envisions a future where virtual AI biologists operate alongside and augment human scientists to dramatically enhance research productivity, clinical insight, and healthcare. Biomni is ready to use at https://biomni.stanford.edu, and we invite scientists to explore its capabilities, stress-test its limits, and co-create the next era of biomedical discoveries."
"The accurate prediction of chromosomal instability from the morphology of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) enables real-time detection of CTCs with high metastatic potential in the context of liquid biopsy diagnostics. However, it presents a significant challenge due to the high dimensionality and complexity of single-cell digital pathology data. Here, we introduce the application of Quantum Cognition Machine Learning (QCML), a quantum-inspired computational framework, to estimate morphology-predicted chromosomal instability in CTCs from patients with metastatic breast cancer. QCML leverages quantum mechanical principles to represent data as state vectors in a Hilbert space, enabling context-aware feature modeling, dimensionality reduction, and enhanced generalization without requiring curated feature selection. QCML outperforms conventional machine learning methods when tested on out of sample verification CTCs, achieving higher accuracy in identifying predicted large-scale state transitions (pLST) status from CTC-derived morphology features. These preliminary findings support the application of QCML as a novel machine learning tool with superior performance in high-dimensional, low-sample-size biomedical contexts. QCML enables the simulation of cognition-like learning for the identification of biologically meaningful prediction of chromosomal instability from CTC morphology, offering a novel tool for CTC classification in liquid biopsy."
"Within the Genomic SEM framework, common factors are often used to index shared genetic etiology across constellations of GWAS phenotypes. A standard common pathway model, in which a genetic association is estimated between an external GWAS phenotype and a common factor, assumes that all genetic associations between the external GWAS phenotype and the individual indicator phenotypes are mediated through the factor. This assumption can be tested using the QTrait statistic, which compares the common pathway model to an independent pathways model that allows for direct genetic associations between the external GWAS phenotype and the individual indicators of the factor. We expand upon the QTrait approach by describing an effect size index that quantifies the degree to which the common pathways model is violated, and we provide a systematic approach for empirically identifying specific direct pathways between an external trait and indicator traits. Our method comprises a series of omnibus tests and outlier detection algorithms indexing the heterogeneity of associations between the genetic component of external traits and the individual indicators of common factors. We provide a set of automated functions which we apply to investigate the patterns of genetic associations across a set of external correlates with respect to indicators of general cognitive ability and case-control and proxy GWAS indices of Alzheimers disease."
"Memories that differ in content or duration differ in the extent to which they depend on the hippocampus, and also the part of the hippocampus, posterior (pHPC) or anterior (aHPC), that they implicate. Inter-individual differences in learning-related activation in different hippocampal subregions have been found to predict specific differences in memory abilities. The complexity of these relationships creates a setting that is ripe for theoretically informative investigation, but that can also lead to reports of spurious relationships that do not reflect underlying neurobiological associations. Across-study replication is therefore a critical first step toward understanding how differences in hippocampal activity drive individual differences in memory ability. In the domain of verbal memory, Wig et al. (2008) identified a negative relationship between task-induced activation in pHPC and out-of-scanner verbal memory test performance. Replicating this result in an independent sample of 86 participants, we identified the same negative correlation between pHPC activation during a Lithuanian word learning task and out-of-scanner California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT-II) performance. This replication represents a critical step toward understanding how pHPC supports verbal memory by answering the basic question of whether the relationship can be reliably observed."
"Profound autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is frequently attributable to single-gene mutations, with SCN2A (voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.2) protein-truncating variants (PTVs) being one of the most penetrant. Although cortico-striatal circuitry is implicated as a key node in ASD, the impact of SCN2A deficiency on human neural circuits is unknown. Using the human cortico-striatal assembloid model, we show that the autism-causing PTV SCN2A-C959X impairs long-range cortical axonal projections, reduces striatal spine density, and attenuates excitatory cortical-striatal synaptic transmission. Surprisingly, these assembloids carrying the heterozygous SCN2A nonsense mutation exhibited pronounced network hyperexcitability, a human cell-specific phenotype not observed in Scn2a+/- mice, highlighting a human-specific circuit vulnerability. Collectively, our study unveils human circuit-specific dysfunctions of SCN2A deficiency and SCN2A-mediated ASD.

"The brains ability to regulate blood flow is fundamental to both its function and development. In the context of neurodevelopmental disorders such as schizophrenia, understanding the complex interactions between cerebrovascular health and brain function is crucial for unraveling the pathophysiology of psychosis. This study investigates the developmental trajectory of cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) in 22q11 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) compared to healthy controls, and its association with psychosis susceptibility. Using a longitudinal data-set of resting-state fMRI, we mapped voxel-level CVR across development. We found significant and early CVR impairments in 22q11.2DS, and in particular in those who later developed positive psychotic symptoms (PPS+). These impairments were evident within the anterior cingulate cortex, frontal lobes, and globi pallidi (GB). We propose that the pattern of CVR reduction presenting early during childhood is possibly linked to blood brain barrier impairment. A decrease in CVR during childhood and within the frontal regions and GB was predictive of subsequent development of positive psychotic symptoms (PPS), which often occurs during adolescence in 22q11.2DS patients. These findings suggest that cerebrovascular health is critical for normal brain development, particularly in regions like the striatum, which are vulnerable to vascular damage due to their anatomical features. These results underline the potential of CVR as an early biomarker for psychosis vulnerability, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions to mitigate neurodevelopmental disruptions of cerebrovascular health in 22q11.2DS."
"Natural language comprehension is a complex task that relies on coordinated activity across a network of cortical regions. In this study, we propose that regions of the language network are coupled to one another through subspaces of shared linguistic features. To test this idea, we developed a model-based connectivity framework to quantify stimulus-driven, feature-specific functional connectivity between language areas during natural language comprehension. Using fMRI data acquired while subjects listened to spoken narratives, we tested three types of features extracted from a unified neural network model for speech and language: low-level acoustic embeddings, mid-level speech embeddings, and high-level language embeddings. Our modeling framework enabled us to quantify the stimulus features that drive connectivity between regions: early auditory areas were coupled to intermediate language areas via lower-level acoustic and speech features; in contrast, higher-order language and default-mode regions were predominantly coupled through more abstract language features. We observed a clear progression of feature-specific connectivity from early auditory to lateral temporal areas, advancing from acoustic connectivity to speech- and finally to language-driven connectivity. These findings suggest that regions of the language network are coupled through feature-specific communication channels to facilitate efficient and context-sensitive language processing."
"How does the brain process language over time? Research suggests that natural human language is processed hierarchically across brain regions over time. However, attempts to characterize this computation have thus far been limited to tightly controlled experimental settings that capture only a coarse picture of the brain dynamics underlying human natural language comprehension. The recent emergence of LLM encoding models promises a new avenue to discover and characterize rich semantic information in the brain, yet interpretable methods for linking information in LLMs to language processing over time are limited. In this work, we develop a low-rank tensor regression method to decompose LLM encoding models into interpretable components of semantics, time, and brain region activation, and apply the method to a Magnetoencephalography (MEG) dataset in which subjects listened to narrative stories. With only a few components, we show improved performance compared to a standard ridge regression encoding model, suggesting the low-rank models provide a good inductive bias for language encoding. In addition, our method discovers a diverse spectrum of interpretable response components that are sensitive to a rich set of low-level and semantic language features, showing that our method is able to separate distinct language processing features in neural signals. After controlling for low-level audio and sentence features, we demonstrate better capture of semantic features. Through use of low-rank tensor encoding models we are able to decompose neural responses to language features, showing improved encoding performance and interpretable processing components, suggesting our method as a useful tool for uncovering language processes in naturalistic settings."
"Neural circuits composed of multitudes of diverse synaptic connections self-organize during mammalian brain development. A balance between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic function is required for information processing by these neural circuits. Despite the importance of this balance, the interplay between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic assembly during circuit establishment remains unclear due to a lack of means to monitor both processes simultaneously. Here, we develop imaging approaches to visualize and track excitatory and inhibitory synapses concurrently. By applying these approaches, we find that despite continual dynamics, excitatory and inhibitory synaptic density remain at synchronized levels during synaptogenesis. These results support coordinated excitatory and inhibitory synapse assembly to maintain functional balance despite continual synaptic turnover."
"Neuronal anatomical differentiation relies on coordinated neurite dynamics to establish class-type morphology during development. Recent advances in high-throughput time-lapse imaging techniques have transformed our ability to track such growth dynamics, yielding comprehensive anatomical datasets of neuronal morphologies at unprecedented rates. However, analyzing these complex datasets using traditional morphometrics requires manual feature selection, which leads to costly and biased quantifications. To overcome these limitations, we applied the Topological Morphology Descriptor (TMD) to extract topological representations of neurons from time-lapse imaging of two cell types within the well-established Drosophila larval sensory dendritic arborization (da) system. We first used TMD to accurately classify the developmental trajectory of Class I da sensory neurons across embryonic and larval stages. However, TMD alone failed to distinguish class-type-specific morphology in Class III neurons, particularly in detecting altered branching rate dynamics in genetically modified mutants. To address this, we extended TMD to a Temporal Topological Morphology Descriptor (TTMD) to incorporate temporal dynamics. TTMD successfully classified mutations in Drosophila Class III da neurons, capturing altered branching rate dynamics in mutant phenotypes. These findings highlight the power of TTMD as an unbiased, scalable framework for analyzing neuronal growth dynamics and linking structural development to genetic and functional variation."
"The perhaps most important unsolved problem in neuroscience is how the brain survives in a complex world by performing a rich repertoire of computation on a minimal energy budget. The brain is much better at adapting to the multiplicity of stimuli and outcomes than current generations of computers, artificial neural deep learning and reservoir model architectures. Yet, at first glance the brain appears to use a fixed anatomical architecture to perform the necessary huge variety of computations. But evolutions boldest trick is that in fact the brains effective connectivity is constantly being updated through neuromodulation to allow the rich repertoire of computation. Inspired by this, we created a whole-brain model using empirical neurotransmitter maps modulating the underlying local regional dynamics. This NEMO (neurotransmission modulated) whole-brain model is able to flexibly compute the full task repertoire and associated functional connectivity of the neuroimaging data from 971 healthy participants. For each individual we defined a measure of  brain computability as the fitting of the NEMO whole-brain model to all tasks performed by the individual. Importantly, brain computability correlates with both behavioural performance on individual tasks and with a general behavioural measure of intelligence. Overall, our proposed unifying NEMO framework offers a natural way to sculpt different brain dynamics in a fixed brain architecture to compute the rich repertoire of tasks required for surviving and thriving."
"Burst firing is an important property of neuronal activity, thought to enhance sensory encoding. While previous studies show significant differences in burst firing between in vivo and in vitro conditions, how burst firing contributes to neural coding in vivo and how it is modulated by underlying biophysical mechanisms when neurons are under active synaptic bombardments remains poorly understood. Here, we combined intracellular recordings and computational modeling to investigate how cellular and synaptic mechanisms can explain the in vivo firing activity of electrosensory lateral line lobe (ELL) pyramidal cells in Apteronotus leptorhynchus. We developed a biophysically detailed compartmental model incorporating voltage-gated currents, NMDA receptor-mediated Ca2+ influx, Ca2+-activated SK channels, Ca2+ handling, and stochastic synaptic inputs to reproduce in vivo firing activities of ELL pyramidal cells. Specifically, using bifurcation analysis, we identified dynamical transitions between quiescent, tonic, and bursting regimes, governed by interactions among SK conductance, NMDA receptor activation, and applied current. Model parameters were optimized against in vivo data, accurately reproducing action potential waveforms and temporal dynamics, including characteristic bimodal interspike interval distributions reflecting intra- and inter-burst intervals. We further developed a modified Hindmarsh-Rose model incorporating dual adaptation variables and stochastic noise. This simplified phenomenological model successfully captured burst firings comparable to those observed in the biophysical model and recorded data, while replicating diverse firing patterns observed across the population. Finally, parameter sensitivity analysis revealed slow adaptation dynamics and noise intensity as key determinants of spiking variability within cells. Overall, our modeling results demonstrate that in vivo bursting arises from synergistic interactions between intrinsic conductances (e.g., NMDA-SK coupling), Ca2+ mobilization, and synaptic stochasticity, offering a potential reconciliation for discrepancies with in vitro firing activity. The models provide mechanistic insights into how background synaptic activity modulates burst firing and validate simplified frameworks for studying population-level dynamics."
"Sampling strategies within the field of skeletal palaeoproteomics are often based on specimen availability. Knowledge of bone biology might assist in improving sample selection strategies and minimise unnecessary sampling of precious (hominin) material. We study ten bone sample locations across four bone elements, for a total of 10 adult, archaeological human skeletons. We compare bone proteome composition and modification for skeletal elements formed through endochondral and intramembranous ossification, as well as cortical-trabecular bone pairs of three skeletal locations. We observe minimal differences in bones formed through the two ossification processes, outside of the exclusive presence of cartilage-related proteins in endochondral bone samples. We observe higher protein concentrations, a larger number of protein groups and peptides, and lower rates of deamidation in cortical bone compared to trabecular bone proteomes, this indicates that cortical bone provides a better preservation environment compared to trabecular bone. Throughout our analysis, the petrous bone stands out, with the largest and most complex proteomes recovered for all studied individuals. Formed through endochondral ossification, the petrous bone undergoes minimal turnover during life. Our observations indicate that the petrous bone is the ideal source of ancient protein sequence information."
"Isochrony - as in the regular beat of a metronome - is cross-culturally ubiquitous in music. Is this ubiquity due to a widespread biological inclination for acoustic communication having isochronous structure? If so, it should be present in lesser-studied vocal music, in the absence of musical training, and in comparable non-human species vocalizations. We quantified isochrony in an untrained expression of musicality: improvised songs from non-musician adults and children. We also tested for isochrony in songs from zebra finches, a bird that learns complex songs. We analyzed improvised songs from children (n = 38, 3-10 years old) and adult non-musicians (n = 15, 24-82 years old), and songs from juvenile and adult zebra finches (n= 77, [~]50 and 120 days post-hatch, respectively). Isochrony was expressed in non-musicians improvised songs, and in childrens improvised songs to a comparable degree. In contrast, both juvenile and adult zebra finches produced songs with less isochrony than chance. And although zebra finches learn sequences and durations of their songs elements, we found no evidence for the learning of isochrony. These data show that spontaneous isochrony in learned vocalizations appears differently across these two species. We propose that species variation in chorusing behaviors may explain why."

C_LIO_LIHere we investigate the sequence conservation and functional variation of the conserved EDVID motif found in the 3-helix of the cell death inducing CC domain of plant NLRs. We analyse our findings in context of published protein structures and structure prediction.
C_LIO_LIWe find that the conserved EDVID motif can serve as a predictor of canonical CC-NLR function and oligomeric assembly.
C_LIO_LIWe also find that the EDVID motif is accompanied by preceding acidic residues in certain CC-NLRs with homology to the Arabidopsis CC-NLR RPP8. The appearance of this so-called preEDVID motif across the phylogeny of flowering plants and its contribution to the CC-NLR function underpins the structural diversity across NLRs with EDVID motif.
C_LIO_LIWe further show that CC-NLRs exist that have lost the EDVID motif sequence and function suggesting that this subgroup, previously referred to as CCG10-NLRs, functions in a different manner from the canonical mechanism.
C_LIO_LIWe find that acidic residues located to the 3-helix of the helper NLR NRG1.1 are linked to NRG1.1 cell death inducing activity.

"Preeclampsia affects approximately 1 in 10 pregnancies, leading to severe complications and long-term health risks for both mother and offspring. While the etiology remains unclear, preeclampsia has been linked to both autoimmunity and the timing of menarche. Through human single-cell and spatial analyses, coupled with in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo models, we demonstrate that VGLL3, a transcription co-regulator in the Hippo pathway, is upregulated in preeclamptic placentas. VGLL3 promotes immune activation, impairs trophoblast differentiation, and induces endothelial dysfunction, all of which contribute to pregnancy-related hypertension, fetal growth restriction, and offspring mortality. Our data reveal that VGLL3 acts upstream of preeclampsia-associated processes, including the production of sFLT1, a key biomarker of the disease. Notably, targeting VGLL3--either by genetic deletion in mouse placentas or through therapeutic inhibition in human placentas--protects against preeclampsia and alleviates disease pathology. These findings position VGLL3 as a promising novel therapeutic target for preeclampsia."
"In mitosis the duplicated genome is aligned and accurately segregated between daughter nuclei. CTCF is a chromatin looping protein in interphase with an unknown role in mitosis. We previously published data showing that CTCF constitutive knockdown causes mitotic failure, but the mechanism remains unknown. To determine the role of CTCF in mitosis, we used a CRISPR CTCF auxin inducible degron cell line for rapid degradation. CTCF degradation for 3 days resulted in increased failure of mitosis and decreased circularity in post-mitotic nuclei. Upon CTCF degradation CENP-E is still recruited to the kinetochore and there is a low incidence of polar chromosomes which occur upon CENP-E inhibition. Instead, immunofluorescence imaging of mitotic spindles reveals that CTCF degradation causes increased intercentromere distances and a wider and more disorganized metaphase plate, a disruption of key functions of the pericentromere. These results are similar to partial loss of cohesin, an established component of the pericentromere. Thus, we reveal that CTCF is a key maintenance factor of pericentromere function, successful mitosis, and post-mitotic nuclear shape."
"Understanding transcriptional regulatory networks (TRNs) in microglia is key to uncovering mechanisms driving central nervous system (CNS) disorders. Human iPSC-derived models offer a tractable system for studying microglia, yet variability between lines has limited reproducibility. Here, we use the standardized KOLF2.1J iTF line to rapidly generate microglia-like cells (iTF-Microglia) and profile TRNs under homeostatic and inflammatory conditions. iTF-Microglia closely resemble primary brain microglia at both transcriptomic and epigenomic levels. Integrative analyses reveal microglia-enriched candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) and dynamic enhancer remodeling upon differentiation and LPS+IFNG stimulation, involving key transcription factors (TFs) including NF-{kappa}B, IRF, and STAT families. TRNs active in iTF-Microglia are enriched for genetic variants linked to Alzheimers disease and other CNS disorders. These findings establish KOLF2.1J iTF-Microglia as a reproducible and genetically tractable platform for studying human microglial gene regulation and provide mechanistic insight into how TRN remodeling may contribute to CNS disease risk."
"Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Despite the remarkable efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors, only a subset of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients respond and many eventually progress, underscoring the need to develop novel combination therapies. The interaction between cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment (TME), a complex niche including cells of the innate and adaptive immune system, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), vascular cells, and extracellular matrix (ECM) plays a vital role in tumorigenesis and cancer progression. Using fate mapping, we previously identified a novel subpopulation of resident vascular stem cells derived from vascular smooth muscle cells, designated AdvSca1-SM (vascular Adventitial location, Stem cell antigen-1 expression, SMooth muscle origin) cells. AdvSca1-SM cells are the predominant cell type responding to vessel wall dysfunction and their selective differentiation to myofibroblasts promotes vascular fibrosis. SMC-to-AdvSca1-SM cell reprogramming is dependent on SMC induction of the transcription factor KLF4, and KLF4 is essential for maintenance of the stem cell phenotype. The function of AdvSca1-SM cells in LUAD tumorigenesis has not been explored. Using an orthotopic immunocompetent mouse model of LUAD, we demonstrate that AdvSca1-SM cells are a major component of lung tumors, significantly contributing to cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Compared to AdvSca1-SM cells, CAFs have altered ECM gene expression with a reduction of a stemness signature. AdvSca1-SM-specific genetic ablation of Klf4 altered their phenotype resulting in inhibition of communication between cancer cells and CAFs, decreases in innate immunosuppressive populations, and increased T cell infiltration into the tumor. Targeting this population may represent a novel strategy to improve the response to immunotherapy."
"Functional object use requires the integration of visuomotor representations processed in the dorsal visual pathway with representations of surface texture and material composition of objects, processed in the ventral visual pathway. Do regions in the ventral visual pathway project outputs to dorsal visual pathway action systems, or are the outputs of the dorsal visual pathway communicated to the ventral visual pathway to modulate processing? And what are the white matter pathways that mediate structural connectivity in support of functional object use? Here we show that the left inferior parietal cortex, a region within the dorsal visual pathway, exerts a direct effect on neural responses in ventral occipital-temporal cortex during visual processing of manipulable objects. We studied a series of consecutively enrolled participants in the pre-operative phase of their neurosurgical care (N = 109) with lesions principally distributed throughout the left hemisphere. Participants completed an object processing category localizer functional MRI experiment in which they viewed images of manipulable objects, animals, faces, and places. We then used Voxel-based Lesion-Activity Mapping (VLAM), a technique in which functional responses in a region-of-interest are used to predict variance in voxel-wise lesion incidence throughout the brain. In the VLAM analyses performed here, we found that lesions to the left anterior intraparietal sulcus and left supramarginal gyrus, two inferior parietal regions known to support object-directed grasping and manipulation, respectively, cause reduced neural responses for manipulable objects (compared to faces, places and animals) in the fusiform gyrus. Parietal lesions do not affect neural responses during visual processing of places in the same region of the fusiform gyrus, even though places elicit stronger responses in the fusiform gyrus than manipulable objects. Seventy-five of 109 participants took part in a common diffusion MRI protocol, permitting a connectome-wide analyses relating white matter fiber integrity to the strength of functional responses for manipulable objects in the left fusiform gyrus. This analysis demonstrated that the descending portion of the left arcuate fasciculus mediates parietal-to-temporal lobe connectivity for manipulable objects, supporting the integration of action representations with conceptual and perceptual attributes of objects. By combining voxel-based and connectome-wide lesion-symptom mapping methods with functional MRI, we have demonstrated that structural connectivity to dorsal visual pathway areas supporting skilled manual action shape category-specific neural responses for manipulable objects within the ventral visual pathway."
"Single-cell spatial transcriptomes have demonstrated molecular and cellular diversity in the brain1-8, but gene regulatory mechanisms underlying transcriptomic profiles and disease pathogenesis remain largely unknown in primates. Here we performed single-nucleus Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin followed by sequencing (snATAC-seq) for [~]1.6 million macaque cortical cells, and identified distinct chromatin accessibility profiles of cis-regulatory elements (CREs) for various cell types. By integrative analysis with large-scale spatial transcriptome data, we found that these CREs showed laminar and regional preferences, with their regional accessibility exhibiting striking dependence on the regions hierarchical level. Cross-species comparison of snATAC-seq data revealed human/macaque-enriched layer-4 glutamatergic neurons and LAMP5/LHX6-expressing GABAergic neurons as well as human/macaque-specific CREs for genes related to neurodevelopment and psychiatric diseases. Importantly, risk single-nucleotide polymorphisms for many brain disorders strongly associated with human/macaque-specific CREs in glutamatergic neuronal types and those for Alzhemers disease strongly associated with CREs exclusively in microglia. Our results provided the basis for understanding the spatial gene regulatory mechanisms underlying cellular diversity and disease pathogenesis in the primate cortex."
"The preservation of ancient DNA in archaeological remains enables identification of past disease agents. However, pathogen DNA is typically highly diluted by host and environmental DNA, limiting detection. Here, we present a proof-of-concept study using in-solution hybridization capture to improve detectability of a pre-defined set of 12 pathogens. We validate the method by detecting Yersinia pestis, the plague agent, in six individuals from 17th and 18th century French plague cemeteries with minimal sequencing. Expanding our probe set to target biomarkers of virtually any pathogen of interest offers a powerful tool for tracking the prevalence of infectious diseases in ancient populations."
"Sperm gigantism evolved multiple times independently among Caenorhabditis nematodes, raising the question of whether intracellular allocation strategies evolved in concert with cell size. Allocation to intracellular components might evolve from direct selection on specific subcellular constituents that affect cell size indirectly, or instead as a byproduct of selection on cell size per se. We used transmission electron microscopy of spermatozoa to quantify investment in pseudopods, mitochondria, and membranous organelles (MOs) from C. macrosperma and C. nouraguensis, related species divergent in sperm size. We demonstrate that C. macrosperma allocates more to mitochondria, in both total and relative terms, consistent with larger sperm cells having greater energetic demands associated with longevity, adhesion, and motility functions. Similar relative pseudopod sizes between species, however, is consistent with an optimal pseudopod:cell body ratio. MO size and distribution patterns within cells implicate C. macrosperma having lower relative investment in MO contributions to seminal fluid, thus excluding increased investment in MOs and pseudopod as drivers of sperm gigantism in C. macrosperma. We conclude that cell size per se likely represents the primary target of selection in the evolution of sperm gigantism, with mitochondrial traits likely evolving as a consequence of increased energetic demands of giant sperm cells."
"An analysis (Nelson, 2018) of Hypsibius exemplaris cytochrome P450 genes has revealed the existence of a gene (dubbed Cyp18k1) showing moderate sequence similarity with the ecdysteroid-inactivating arthropod Cyp18a group. Using a transgenic H. exemplaris Cyp18k1 construct, we have demonstrated that ubiquitous CYP18K1 expression results in lethal failure of abdominal histoblast proliferation in Drosophila melanogaster."
"Chlamydiae are obligate intracellular bacteria that inhibit mitochondrial apoptosis to maintain integrity of the host cell. We have previously reported that a chlamydial outer membrane {beta}-barrel protein, the porin OmpA, can during ectopic expression inhibit mitochondrial apoptosis through direct interaction with the BCL-2-family effectors BAX and BAK. We here show that OmpA from Chlamydia trachomatis (Ctr) uses membrane vesicles for its delivery to the outer mitochondrial membrane during Ctr infection. Using a number of imaging and fractionation techniques, we show that OmpA during infection reaches mitochondria and is inserted into mitochondrial membranes. Purified membrane vesicles (MV) from Ctr-infected cells contained OmpA. When added to uninfected cells, MV fused with mitochondrial membranes, causing the interaction of OmpA with BAK and the cytosolic retro-translocation of BAX. MV addition to uninfected cells protected the cells against apoptosis. We propose a structural model of this BAK inhibition by OmpA that reenacts the inhibition of BAK by the mitochondrial porin VDAC2. The results provide evidence that the porin from Chlamydia, as well as the structurally similar porin from the related Simkania, specifically exploits its relationship to mitochondrial porins to protect the infected cell against apoptosis and to enable intracellular growth of the bacteria in human cells."
"Integrins bind to extracellular matrix proteins and, upon clustering, form multimolecular integrin adhesion complexes (IACs) that connect to and regulate the cell cytoskeleton, influencing various aspects of normal and tumour cell behaviour. Alongside well-characterized nascent adhesions, focal adhesions (FAs), fibrillar adhesions (FBs) and hemidesmosomes, a new class of IACs, reticular adhesions (RAs), have been identified. RAs, initially described as flat clathrin lattices formed by integrin V{beta}5, lack association with actin and are devoid of FAs markers. The physiological role of RAs in normal and tumor cells is still incompletely understood and requires further investigation. Previously, we analysed IACs of two melanoma cell lines, MDA-MB-435S and RPMI-7951, grown under long term culture conditions, and demonstrated that both cell lines preferentially use integrin V{beta}5 for adhesion. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of RAs in these two melanoma cell lines that differ in their ability to form FBs. To determine RAs composition, we treated cells with actin polymerisation inhibitor cytochalasin D (CytoD) which disrupts FAs, allowing isolation of RAs, which were analysed by MS-based proteomics, Western blotting and immunofluorescence. Known RA-associated proteins, including the AP-2 adaptor complex, disabled homolog 2 (DAB2) and Numb were identified in both lines, along with talin2. Notably, we also detected the presence of KN motif and ankyrin repeat domains protein (KANK2) in RA isolates. Proximity ligation analysis following CytoD-induced actin disruption confirmed the proximity of KANK2 and talin2 in RAs. We then investigated the effect of talin2 or KANK2 knockdown on RAs composition. While both talin2 and KANK2 are located in RAs, neither is essential for RA formation. Talin2 knockdown led to a reduction in RA components abundance in both cell lines. In MDA-MB-435S cell line, KANK2 produced a similar effect, mirroring the functional interaction of talin2 and KANK2 in FAs. However, in RPMI-7951 cells, KANK2 knockdown had no significant effect on RA components abundance. This discrepancy likely reflects the preferential localization of KANK2 in FBs and underscores the differing roles of talin2 and KANK2 in V{beta}5-mediated FAs across the two cell lines. These findings underscore the complexity of adhesion signalling and highlight the importance of adhesion crosstalk in regulating cellular function."
"Neonatal morphine is commonly administered in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) to manage pain. However, its long-term effects on neurodevelopment of pain pathways, remain a significant concern. The midbrain is a core region that plays a central role in pain processing and opioid-mediated analgesia. Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing to study gene expression in 107,427 midbrain single cells from adolescent mice neonatally exposed to either saline, morphine, or morphine with the probiotic Bifidobacterium infantis (B. infantis). We found broad alterations in transcriptomics within neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglial cells. Analysis of differentially regulated genes revealed down regulation of HOX genes and upregulation of pathways related to neurotransmitter signaling and pain in adolescence that were neonatally treated with morphine. Interestingly, neonatal probiotic supplementation mitigated these morphine-induced alterations on the transcriptome. This study presents the first single-cell RNA sequencing dataset of the adolescent midbrain following neonatal morphine exposure and probiotic intervention. These findings offer new insights into the neurodevelopmental impact of early opioid exposure and highlight the therapeutic potential of microbiome-targeted interventions."
"Much of our understanding of how neural circuit activity relates to human behaviour as well as mental health stems from non-invasive assessments of the central nervous system. Further progress in key questions, however, requires a higher differentiation of circuit-level activity, which remains constrained by the sensitivity and resolution of existing instruments. Here we show that neural quantum sensing with optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) addresses this issue by significantly outperforming EEG and conventional MEG in both signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and signal coherence across trials. SNR for OPMs was increased by up to 205% compared to EEG and by up to 40% compared to conventional MEG. Likewise, the signal coherence across trials of OPMs was increased by up to 61% compared to EEG and by up to 23% compared to conventional MEG. Our data emphasize the important role of OPMs for non-invasive neuroimaging, paving the way for significant advances in basic research as well as translational applications."

"Scientific writing and publication are critical sites where early-career researchers must navigate between their personal identities and the presumed objectivity of scientific discourse. For non-white researchers, this process involves complex negotiations that remain understudied, particularly among those stereotyped as ""model minorities."" This qualitative study examines how Asian and Asian American early-career scientists navigate their racial and cultural identities within scientific writing and publication processes. Drawing on interviews with 23 participants who engaged with the Journal of Emerging Investigators, we identified two primary approaches to identity navigation: ""spurring,"" wherein racial and cultural backgrounds catalyze research questions and scientific inquiry, and ""siloing,"" wherein these identities are deliberately compartmentalized during formal scientific writing. Using an integrated theoretical framework combining cultural community wealth, narrative identity, and model minority discourse, we analyzed how participants strategically deployed cultural resources while navigating institutional expectations. Our findings reveal that while participants drew upon familial capital to inform research interests and occasionally acknowledged reflexivity, most also practiced disciplinary compartmentalization and adhered to perceived scientific norms of objectivity. This tension demonstrates how early-career scientists negotiate competing cultural scripts while developing professional identities. These findings have significant implications for science education, suggesting the need to help students recognize cultural backgrounds as valuable resources rather than sources of bias, address myths of pure objectivity, and provide models of successful identity integration in scientific work. By documenting these navigation strategies, we contribute to understanding both individual agency and institutional constraints in scientific practice, particularly for students from backgrounds historically underrepresented in STEM fields."
"Genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs) are powerful tools for monitoring neuronal activity, but their application, particularly for long-term recordings in vivo, is often limited by photobleaching under the required high illumination intensities. This constraint restricts the total duration of continuous or trial-based experiments, crucial for studying processes like synaptic plasticity or circuit dynamics during behavior. Here, we introduce ElectraON and ElectraOFF, a pair of green fluorescent eFRET-based GEVIs engineered by incorporating a photostability-enhanced derivative of the bright monomeric fluorescent protein mBaoJin with Ace opsin variants. Critically, Electras demonstrate over 6-fold improved photostability compared to state-of-the-art eFRET GEVIs, pAce, and Ace-mNeon2, under one-photon illumination, while characterized by bright green fluorescence, millisecond kinetics, and good membrane localization. This enhanced stability translates to a 3-to >10-fold extension in functional recording duration, maintaining reliable spike detection in both cultured neurons in vitro and sparsely labeled neurons in the awake mouse cortex in vivo. We demonstrated sustained in vivo recordings exceeding 30 minutes, with instances surpassing one hour. Furthermore, Electras show functionality under scanless two-photon excitation in cultured cells. These highly photostable indicators significantly extend the temporal window for voltage imaging, broadening the scope of accessible biological questions."
"Fibromyalgia (FM) involves widespread musculoskeletal pain and hypersensitivity, often accompanied by neurological, cognitive, and affective disturbances. Resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) studies have revealed abnormal brain activity in affected individuals, with anxiety and symptom duration potentially exacerbating these alterations. This study applied multivariate pattern analysis to differentiate resting-state EEG signals between FM patients and healthy controls across frequency bands associated with pain processing, while incorporating state and trait anxiety scores. It also examined differences between patients with short- and long-duration symptoms and identified the most relevant scalp regions contributing to the models. Fifty-one female participants (25 FM patients, 26 controls; aged 35-65) were included. Patients were classified into short-term (12) and long-term (13) groups. EEG was recorded and power spectral density values were extracted and normalized to be used to train machine learning classifiers. Anxiety scores were included in the patient-control analysis. Haufe transformed weights were computed to determine key scalp contributions. The models successfully distinguished patients from controls and between FM subgroups, with accuracies exceeding 0.70 across all frequency bands. Including anxiety scores substantially improved classification, with accuracies reaching 0.99. These findings highlight significant differences in resting-state EEG activity between patients and controls, and between FM subgroups, underscoring the relevance of emotional and neural factors. Frequency-specific alterations in pain-related scalp regions support the view of disrupted pain processing in FM. Resting-state EEG, combined with multivariate pattern analysis, may support the development of biomarkers to enhance diagnosis and guide treatment strategies in clinical settings."
"Microbial communities are shaped by complex forces, including interspecies interactions and the effects of mobile genetic elements such as plasmids. How these forces interact to affect community responses to environmental perturbations remains unclear, particularly considering the qualitatively different natures of competitive and plasmid transfer interactions. We investigated the role of bacterial and plasmid interaction networks in community responses to single and multiple environmental perturbations, using a model community of three bacteria and two plasmids grown in rich media over five 2-day transfers. Bacterial interactions were the primary driver of community response, to the extent that plasmids were not always retained in the community even when they carried relevant resistance genes. Overall, our results indicate that while bacterial and plasmid interactions both shape community responses to environmental perturbations, bacterial interactions may be the primary drivers of community dynamics."
"Data modeling tools face trade-offs between accuracy, computational efficiency, data efficiency, and model flexibility. Physics-inspired, rigorous likelihood-based approaches, while offering high accuracy and data efficiency, remain limited in practice due to high computational cost, particularly when applied to larger-scale problems. This general limitation is further compounded by reliance on traditionally single-threaded iterative sampling or optimization procedures, which are difficult to scale. Although prior efforts have attempted to parallelize expensive likelihood-based approaches by partitioning data or running multiple sampling replicas in parallel, such strategies fail for algorithms requiring efficient communication between processes. Here, we introduce a fundamentally different strategy: we exploit the parallelism inherent in both likelihood evaluation and posterior sampling, operating on a single shared dataset. Our framework supports frequent yet lightweight inter-thread and inter-processor communication, making it well-suited for modern parallel architectures. Using diffraction-limited single-particle fluorescence tracking as a case study, this approach achieves up to a 50-fold speedup on a single mid-range GPU compared to conventional single-threaded CPU implementations, demonstrating a scalable and efficient solution for high-performance likelihood-based inference."
"The olfactory system can detect an uncountable number of volatile molecules while retaining the ability to discriminate amongst very similar ones. We identified a unique mechanism employed by insect odorant receptors to discriminate amongst pheromones, chemical communication signals that orchestrate courtship and mating behavior. By coupling cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and functional mutagenesis, we find that males of the silkmoth Bombyx mori distinguish between two quasi-identical compounds -bombykol, an alcohol, and bombykal, an aldehyde- by establishing a reversible covalent bond between the pheromone receptor and bombykal. Bombykol, instead, binds to the same receptor through hydrogen bonds, with significantly lower potency. The unique ability of aldehydes to establish a reversible covalent bond allows moths to unequivocally distinguish between compounds that differ only in the presence of a single hydrogen atom. Further, as many important odorants are aldehydes, this work illuminates a new binding mode available to the olfactory system to achieve high selectivity for these compounds."
"Perception of external thermal stimuli is critical to animal survival, and although an animals skin is the largest contact surface for thermal inputs, contributions of skin cells to noxious temperature sensing have not been extensively explored. Here, we show that exposure to heat transiently sensitizes Drosophila larvae to subsequent noxious stimuli. This sensitization is induced by prior stimulation of epidermal cells but not nociceptors, suggesting that epidermal cells modulate nociceptor function in response to heat exposure. Indeed, we found that Drosophila epidermal cells are intrinsically thermosensitive, exhibiting robust heat-off responses following warming to noxious temperatures as well as responses to cooling below comfortable temperatures. Further, we found that epidermal heat-off calcium responses involve influx of extracellular calcium and require the store-operated calcium channel Orai and its activator Stim. Finally, epidermal heat-off responses and heat-evoked nociceptive sensitization exhibit similar temperature dependencies, and we found that Stim and Orai are required in epidermal cells for heat-evoked nociceptive sensitization. Hence, epidermal thermosensory responses provide a form of adaptive sensitization to facilitate noxious heat avoidance."
"Kidney disease carries significant morbidity, mortality, and financial cost. Preclinical work exploring more accurate methods for assessing renal function is key for monitoring disease progression and the efficacy of future therapies. Measuring kidney function by dynamic contrast enhanced imaging allows us to measure left and right kidney function separately. This provides an internal control where a unilateral injury model is used. Multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) can measure the renal clearance of administered near infrared absorbers and, via the application of mathematical models, allows for the calculation of glomerular filtration rate. ABZWCY-HP{beta}CD is a cyanine dye bound to 2-hydroxylpropyl-{beta}-cyclodextrin and has shown promise as a glomerular filtration marker. Here we combine MSOT, ABZWCY-HP{beta}CD, and a modified Patlak-Rutland model to measure the glomerular filtration rate of healthy mice and following ischaemic reperfusion injury."
"BackgroundThe entopeduncular nucleus (EP), corresponding to the human globus pallidus internal segment, is a basal ganglia output nucleus, and plays a critical role in motor control. However, the impact of EP damage on skilled motor function and the relationship between its damage in stroke, such as internal capsule hemorrhage (ICH), and motor dysfunction remains unclear. This study aimed to clarify whether EP damage causes motor dysfunction in two disease models.

MethodsEP-related motor dysfunction was investigated by inducing localized unilateral EP damage in Long-Evans rats using a stereotactic kainic acid (KA) injection. Motor function was assessed using a single-pellet reaching task pre-injection and on postoperative days 2, 7, 14, 21, and 28. Immunohistochemical staining for NeuN, somatostatin (SST), and parvalbumin was conducted to quantify damage and its correlation with motor outcomes. In addition, unilateral ICH was induced via stereotactic injection of collagenase type IV, which dissolves the vascular basement membrane, into the internal capsule (IC) of Long-Evans rats. Injury sites were classified into the IC, dorsomedial region from the IC, ventral lateral region from the IC, and EP, and their volumes were measured. Measured volumes were analyzed for correlations with motor function assessments.

ResultsKA-induced EP damage significantly reduced reaching success rates on postoperative day 2 compared to those in the control group (p<0.05). Immunohistochemical analysis showed that reaching success rates on day 28 positively correlated with the numbers of remaining NeuN-positive and SST-positive neurons (p<0.05). In the ICH experiment, all rats significantly reduced the success rate of the reaching task to 0% on day 2, and the success rate on day 28 correlated positively with the remaining EP volume, but not with total lesion volume.

ConclusionsEP damage was strongly associated with motor impairments, highlighting its critical role in motor control and recovery."
"BackgroundBispecific antibodies exploiting receptor-mediated transcytosis offer a promising strategy to overcome limited blood-brain barrier permeability in Alzheimers disease (AD) therapy and imaging. Lecanemab-Fab8D3 (Lec-Fab8D3), a bispecific anti-amyloid beta (A{beta}) antibody engineered for enhanced brain delivery, holds potential as a companion immunoPET imaging diagnostic with the novel lecanemab immunotherapy. This study aimed to compare three radionuclides--zirconium-89 (89Zr), copper-64 (64Cu), and iodine-124 (124I)--for PET imaging with Lec-Fab8D3 to study its in vivo brain distribution and evaluate its potential as an AD companion diagnostic.

MethodsLec-Fab8D3 was conjugated to DFO* or NODAGA for 89Zr and 64Cu radiolabeling, respectively, or directly radioiodinated with 124I. PET imaging was performed in the Tg-ArcSwe mouse model of A{beta} pathology and wild-type (WT) littermates at multiple time points post administration of the radiolabeled antibody, followed by ex vivo biodistribution, autoradiography, and A{beta} quantification to assess brain uptake, specificity, and distribution of the radiolabeled Lec-Fab8D3.

ResultsRadiolabeled Lec-Fab8D3 variants showed retained binding properties with high radiochemical purity and yields. PET imaging demonstrated cortical brain uptake of all three tradiotracers in Tg-ArcSwe mice, with [89Zr]Zr-DFO*-Lec-Fab8D3 and [124I]I-Lec-Fab8D3 showing the best discrimination between Tg-ArcSwe and WT mice at 48-72 h post-injection. The highest absolute brain retention, combined with a lower brain-to-cerebellum ratio, was observed in both Tg-ArcSwe and WT mice that received the radiometal-labeled (89Zr and 64Cu) antibody, likely due to the residualizing nature of radiometals. Ex vivo analyses confirmed PET findings, and immunostaining demonstrated co-localization of Lec-Fab8D3 with A{beta} deposits.

ConclusionsImmunoPET imaging with bispecific Lec-Fab8D3 enables specific detection of brain A{beta} pathology in an AD mouse model. 89Zr was superior to 64Cu due to a more compatible half-life, while 124I displayed higher regional contrast than both radiometals, despite lower overall brain signal. The combined findings from radiometal- and iodine-based immunoPET will enhance our understanding of intra-brain distribution of bispecific antibodies. Furthermore, this highlights the importance of the choice of radiolabeling strategy and how it will impact the outcome of immunoPET with bispecific A{beta} antibodies."
"Astrocyte-to-neuron reprogramming via depletion of PTBP1, a potent repressor of neuronal splicing, has been proposed as a therapeutic strategy, but its efficacy remains debated. While some reported successful conversion, others disputed this, citing a lack of neuronal gene expression as evidence of failed reprogramming. This interpretation was further challenged, attributed to incomplete PTBP1 inactivation, fueling ongoing controversy. Mechanistic understanding of the conversion, or the lack thereof, requires investigating, in conjunction with lineage tracing, the effect of Ptbp1 loss of function in mature astrocytes on RNA splicing, which has not yet been examined. Here, we genetically ablated PTBP1 in adult Aldh1l1-Cre/ERT2 Ai14 mice to determine whether lineage traced Ptbp1 knockout astrocytes exhibited RNA splicing alterations congruent with neuronal differentiation. We found no widespread induction of neurons, despite a minuscule fraction of knockout cells showing neuron-like transcriptomic signatures. Importantly, PTBP1 loss in mature astrocytes induced splicing alterations unlike neuronal splicing patterns. These findings suggest that targeting PTBP1 alone is ineffective to drive neuronal reprogramming and highlight the need for combining splicing and lineage analyses. Loss of astrocytic PTBP1 is insufficient to induce neuronal splicing, contrasting with its well-known role in other non-neuronal cells, and instead affects a distinct astrocytic splicing program."
"Pulmonary fibrosis has been called a fibroproliferative disease but the functional importance of proliferating fibroblasts to pulmonary fibrosis has not been systematically examined. In response to alveolar injury, resting alveolar fibroblasts differentiate into fibrotic fibroblasts that express high levels of collagens. However, what role, if any, proliferation plays in the accumulation of fibrotic fibroblasts remains unclear. Through EdU incorporation, genetic lineage tracing, and single cell RNA sequencing, we resolve the proliferation dynamics of lung fibroblasts during post-injury fibrogenesis. Our data show substantial DNA replication in progeny of alveolar fibroblasts in two models of pulmonary fibrosis. By genetically labeling individual cells, we observe clonal expansion of alveolar fibroblast descendants principally in regions of fibrotic remodeling. The transcriptome of proliferating fibroblasts closely resembles that of fibrotic fibroblasts, suggesting that fibroblasts can first differentiate into fibrotic fibroblasts and then proliferate. Genetic ablation of proliferating fibroblasts and selective inhibition of cytokinesis in alveolar fibroblast descendants significantly mitigates pulmonary fibrosis and rescues lung function. Furthermore, fibroblasts in precision-cut lung slices from human fibrotic lungs exhibit higher proliferation rates than those in non-diseased lungs. This work establishes fibroblast proliferation as a critical driver of pulmonary fibrosis and suggests that specifically targeting fibroblast proliferation could be a new therapeutic strategy for fibrotic diseases."
"In the natural world, genetic isolation between closely related species is often maintained by direct F1 hybrid sterility or hybrid breakdown in subsequent generations. This phenomenon is also observed in microorganisms within species of the Saccharomyces clade, including the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Members of Saccharomyces intermate and historical hybridization events have left genomic footprints, but these hybrids are themselves sterile and produce very few viable offspring. Previous work suggests a main cause of F1 hybrid sterility is the action of mismatch repair machinery. The sequence divergence between two parent Saccharomyces species--from [~]10% to [~]20%--is recognized by the cell as an aberrant attempt to recombine nonhomologous chromosomes during meiosis I, leading to massive nondisjunction and aneuploidy. Deletion of mismatch repair machinery improves fertility in hybrids of S. cerevisiae and its sister species S. paradoxus but leads to increased mutation accumulation during normal mitotic growth. To overcome this drawback, conditional alleles that specifically repress expression of mismatch repair machinery during meiosis have been applied in S. cerevisiae x S. paradoxus hybrids with success. Here, we describe the application of the meiotic null system to a different hybrid: S. cerevisiae x S. uvarum. The system does not increase hybrid fertility likely due to increased sequence divergence and chromosomal translocations, but mass spore recovery and flow cytometry enable the recovery of near-haploid offspring which inherit an assortment of parental chromosomes. These populations of mixed hybrid genomes can be leveraged in phenotypic studies to further understand the effects of hybrid genomes on organismal fitness."
"When exposed to noxious thermal or mechanical stimuli, Drosophila melanogaster larvae will aZempt to escape by performing a stereotypical nocifensive rolling behavior. Here, we report the identification of a mutation in Drosophila that specifically alters the thermal nocifensive escape behaviors of larvae. We provide genetic, molecular, and histological evidence that this mutation maps to the FucTA gene, which encodes an -1,3-fucosyltransferase. Our results suggest that fucosylation is important for the thermal nociception rolling behavior of Drosophila larvae."
"Recent advances in high throughput optical microscopy have achieved whole-organism scale imaging at diffraction-limited resolutions. Current microscopes, however, require making compromises between achieving the optimal resolution, imaging depth, multispectral capability, and data throughput due to limitations in optical design and data stream handling. We have created a parallel-line scanning confocal microscope (plSCM) which provides 1.1 Gigavoxels/second high speed imaging while achieving an optical resolution of [~]180 x 220 x 650 nm with 2 millimeters of imaging depth in 3 simultaneous spectral channels. To handle such a massive imaging data stream, we have engineered a scalable network-distributed image acquisition/processing framework (SNDiF), which allows continuous capture, real-time processing, and cluster storage of petabyte-scale single image datasets in days. Together, our parallelly distributed microscope and software system presents a general solution for large-scale high-throughput and high-resolution multicolor imaging which can operate for days at a time."
"Intratumor heterogeneity arises from ongoing somatic evolution complicating cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. Here we present TEATIME (estimating evolutionary events through single-timepoint sequencing), a novel computational framework that models tumors as mixtures of two competing cell populations: an ancestral clone with baseline fitness and a derived subclone with elevated fitness. Using cross-sectional bulk sequencing data, TEATIME estimates mutation rates, timing of subclone emergence, relative fitness, and number of generations of growth. To quantify intratumor fitness asymmetries, we introduce a novel metric--fitness diversity--which captures the imbalance between competing cell populations and serves as a measure of functional intratumor heterogeneity. Applying TEATIME to 33 tumor types from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we revealed divergent as well as convergent evolutionary patterns. Notably, we found that immune-hot microenvironments constraint subclonal expansion and limit fitness diversity. Moreover, we detected temporal dependencies in mutation acquisition, where early driver mutations in ancestral clones epistatically shape the fitness landscape, predisposing specific subclones to selective advantages. These findings underscore the importance of intratumor competition and tumor-microenvironment interactions in shaping evolutionary trajectories, driving intratumor heterogeneity. Lastly, we demonstrate that TEATIME-derived evolutionary parameters and fitness diversity offer novel prognostic insights across multiple cancer types."
"BackgroundAccurate prediction of phage-host interactions at the strain level is critical for understanding microbial ecology and for developing phage-based therapeutics. However, existing models are limited by the lack of experimentally validated negative interactions and inconsistencies in data construction strategies.

ResultsIn this study, we present a large-scale phage-host interaction dataset comprising 13,000 experimentally verified links between 125 Klebsiella pneumoniae((K. pneumoniae) phages and 104 K. pneumoniae strains. Using this unique resource, we systematically evaluate the impact of negative data construction methods, feature extraction strategies, and machine learning algorithms on predictive performance. We show that randomly generated negatives significantly inflate model accuracy, while models trained on experimental negatives yield more realistic and robust results. Furthermore, protein-derived features outperform DNA-based features across various data conditions. Notably, models using only tail protein sequences achieve performance comparable to those using full-genome sequences, offering a time-efficient alternative without compromising accuracy. Finally, interpretable machine learning reveals amino acid preferences in both phages and hosts that align with known infection mechanisms and suggest novel determinants such as anti-transcriptional proteins.

ConclusionsOur findings highlight best practices for constructing high-fidelity strain-level phage-host prediction models. The dataset and insights presented here provide a valuable benchmark for future studies and lay the foundation for more biologically grounded, interpretable modeling frameworks in viromics and microbiome research."
"Chromatin loading of the hexameric replicative helicase MCM2-7 complex requires coordinated interactions with the origin recognition complex (ORC), CDC6, and CDT1. MCM2-7 not bound to DNA forms a single hexamer (SH) with an open DNA entry gate. Two MCM2-7 SHs are loaded sequentially to form the double hexamer (DH) that encircles the DNA duplex. Activated MCM2-7 then unwinds DNA and initiates DNA replication. Our cryo-electron microscopy analyses show that a fraction of human MCM2-7 without DNA exists as DH. Unexpectedly, we find that the MCM3 winged helix domain (WHD) docks on MCM2 in both DNA-free DH and SH, creating a safety latch across the DNA entry gate to block DNA entry into the central channel. The safety latch can be opened by ORC-CDC6 binding. Disrupting this latch by designed or human disease-related mutations of MCM3 causes replication defects and DNA damage checkpoint activation. Our findings uncover a new regulated step in MCM2-7 loading with implications for human diseases."
"Cryo-focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (cryo-FIBSEM) has become essential for preparing electron-transparent lamellae from cryo-plunged and high-pressure frozen specimens. However, targeting specific cellular features within large, complex organs remains challenging. Here we present a series of technical improvements significantly enhancing the efficiency and accessibility of the Serial Lift-Out and SOLIST (Serialized On-grid Lift-In Sectioning for Tomography) procedures that are revolutionizing the field. We were able to extend the cryo-FIBSEM session from 24 hours to 5 days without interruptions. In addition, we describe a modified silver-plated EasyLiftTM needle that eliminates the need of the copper or gold block between the original tungsten needle and the sample. Moreover, we describe a strategy that significantly reduces curtaining effects. Finally, we report a precise routine to target a lamella with a precision of approximately 1 {micro}m in X,Y and Z. Together, these modifications considerably reduce contamination risk and preparation time, making cryo-lift-out techniques more accessible for routine structural biology applications on any type of tissue. Here, we demonstrate the power of our technique by targeting several specific wall structures that are of crucial importance for root function in plants and that were previously inaccessible to cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET). High-pressure freezing (HPF) of plant tissues presents unique challenges for cryo-electron microscopy sample preparation due to the overall sample size, the individual cells size, their rigid cell wall and finally, their large vacuoles, which contain large amounts of rather diluted water solutions compared to cytosol. The internal root structures targeted are the Casparian strip (CS), suberin lamellae (SL), as well as secondary wall of xylem vessels, requiring reaching a targeting precision of 5 m in a 3 mm long and 80-120 m thick root tip. Our technological improvements for the cryo-correlative light and electron microscopy (cryo-CLEM) workflow enabled successful, targeted cryo-ET in plant roots. We noticed that, despite ice formation in vacuoles and to some degree in the cytosol, the plasma membranes and cell walls are remarkably well preserved, providing stunning insights into the native, hydrated nano-structure of plant cell walls, previously only observable with contrasting agents and in a dehydrated state."
"Over the past decades, many critical molecular players have been uncovered to control distinct steps in olfactory circuit assembly in Drosophila. Among these, multi-member gene families of cell surface proteins are of interest because they can act as neuron-specific identification/recognition tags in combinations and contribute to circuit assembly in complex brains through their heterophilic or homophilic interactions. Recently, a multi-protein interactome has been described between the Beat and Side families of IgSF proteins. Here, we use the publicly available single-cell RNA-seq datasets and newly generated gene trap transgenic driver lines to probe the in vivo spatial expression pattern of the beat/side gene families in odorant receptor neurons (ORNs) and their synaptic target projection neurons (PNs).Our results revealed that each ORN and its synaptic target PN class expresses a class-specific combination of beat/side genes, hierarchically regulated by lineage-specific genetic programs. Though ORNs or PNs from closer lineages tend to possess more similar beat/side profiles, we also found many examples of divergence from this pattern among closely related ORNs and closely related PNs. To explore whether the class-specific combination of beats/sides defines ORN-PN matching specificity, we perturbed presynaptic beat-IIa and postsynaptic side-IV in two ORN-PN partners. However, disruption of Beat-IIa-Side-IV interaction did not produce any significant mistargeting in these two examined glomeruli. Though without affecting general glomerular targeting, knockdown of side in ORNs leads to the reduction of synaptic development. Interestingly, we found conserved expression patterns of beat/side orthologs across ORNs in ants and mosquitoes, indicating the shared regulatory strategies specifying the expression of these duplicated paralogs in insect evolution. Overall, this comprehensive analysis of expression patterns lays a foundation for in-depth functional investigations into how Beat/Side combinatorial expression contributes to olfactory circuit assembly."
"TDP-43 pathology is a defining feature of Limbic-Predominant Age-Related TDP-43 Encephalopathy neuropathologic change (LATE-NC) and is frequently comorbid with Alzheimers disease neuropathologic change (ADNC). However, the molecular consequences of co-occurring LATE-NC and ADNC pathology (TDP-43, {beta}-amyloid, and tau protein pathologies) remain unclear. Here, we conducted a comparative biochemical, molecular, and proteomic analysis of hippocampal tissue from 90 individuals spanning control, LATE-NC, ADNC, and ADNC+LATE-NC groups to assess the impact of cryptic exon (CE) inclusion, phosphorylated TDP-43 pathology (pTDP-43), and AD-related pathologies ({beta}-amyloid, and tau) on the proteome. ADNC+LATE-NC cases exhibited the highest burden of CE inclusion as quantified by measuring the levels of known TDP-43 regulated CEs within eight transcripts: STMN2, UNC13A, ELAVL3, KALRN, ARHGAP32, CAMK2B, PFKP, and SYT7. While CE levels correlated with pTDP-43 pathology, they were more strongly correlated with each other, suggesting that the molecular signature of CE inclusion may serve as a more sensitive measure of TDP-43 dysfunction than pTDP-43 pathology alone. Unbiased classification based on the relative abundance of these eight CEs stratified individual cases into low, intermediate, and high CE burden subtypes, largely independent of {beta}-amyloid and tau pathology. Proteome-wide correlation analysis revealed a bias toward reduced protein levels from genes harboring TDP-43-regulated CEs in cases with high cumulative CE burden. Notably, proteins significantly decreased under high CE burden included canonical STMN2, ELAVL3, and KALRN, as well as kinesin proteins that are genetically associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Co-expression network analysis identified both shared and distinct biological processes across CE subtypes and pathways associated with pTDP-43, tau, {beta}-amyloid pathologies, and CE accumulation in the hippocampus. Protein modules associated with TDP-43 loss of function were prioritized by integrating proteomic data from TDP-43-depleted human neurons with the hippocampal co-expression network. Specifically, we observed decreased endosomal vesicle, microtubule-binding, and synaptic modules, alongside an increase in RNA-binding modules. These results provide new insights into the proteomic impact of CE burden across the spectrum of LATE and AD pathological severity, highlighting the molecular consequences of TDP-43 dysfunction in neurodegenerative disease."
"The fastACI toolbox provides a compilation of tools for collecting and analyzing data from auditory reverse-correlation experiments. These experiments involve behavioral listening tasks including one or more target sounds presented with some random fluctuation, typically in the form of additive background noise. In turn, the paired stimulus-response data from each trial can be used to assess the relevant acoustic features that were effectively used by the listener while performing the task. The results are summarized as a matrix of perceptual weights termed auditory classification image. The framework provided by the toolbox is flexible and it has been so far used to probe different auditory mechanisms such as tone-in-noise detection, amplitude modulation detection, phoneme-in-noise categorization, and word segmentation. In this article, we present the structure of the toolbox, how it can be used to run existing experiments or design new ones, as well as the main options for analyzing the collected data. We then illustrate the capabilities of the toolbox through five case studies: a replication of a pioneering reverse correlation study from 1975, an example of reproduction of the analyses of one of our previous studies, a comparison of the results of three phoneme-categorization experiments, and a quantification of how noise type and estimation method affect the quality of the resulting auditory classification image."
"In the period preceding sleep, humans and other animals display a stereotyped repertoire of behaviors-including hygiene-related activities and preparing a place to sleep. Evidence suggests that this pre-sleep phase actively contributes to sleep initiation and quality. Nonetheless, individuals can sometimes fall asleep without preparation, even under undesirable circumstances. These abrupt transitions into sleep can have severe consequences, particularly in high-risk environments. Although progress has been made in identifying neuronal populations controlling sleep-wake states and mechanisms regulating cortical oscillations during sleep, little is known about the natural processes that govern the pre-sleep phase, under baseline conditions and following sleep loss. Here, we examine factors regulating pre-sleep behaviors using environmental and behavioral manipulations, video recordings, machine-learning-based tracking, and EEG-EMG analysis in freely-behaving mice. We focus on nest-building-a key pre-sleep behavior-and assess its modulation by time of day and sleep deprivation. We find that mice are highly motivated to build nests during the light phase but show reduced motivation during most of the dark phase. Sleep deprivation significantly suppresses pre-sleep nest-building and promotes the direct initiation of sleep. Varying amounts of sleep deprivation, from 2-6 hours, uniformly suppress nest-building. This suppression is not due to stress, as mice exposed to acute restraint stress engage robustly in nest-building. Our findings provide insight into processes regulating the transition from wakefulness to sleep. Understanding pre-sleep regulation has important implications for treating sleep-onset difficulties-prevalent in insomnia and predictive of cognitive decline-and for mitigating risks associated with uncontrolled sleep onset in high-stakes situations.

STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEPrior to sleep, animals-including humans-engage in stereotyped behaviors such as preparing a sleep space, thought to facilitate sleep initiation and quality. However, sleep can occur abruptly without preparation, posing serious risks, especially in high-stakes environments. Despite progress in understanding sleep-wake circuitry, the regulation of pre-sleep behaviors remains poorly understood. Here, we used multiple techniques in mice to examine nest-building, a key pre-sleep behavior. We found that mice are more motivated to build nests during the light phase, but this behavior is strongly suppressed by sleep deprivation-regardless of duration- while not affected by acute stress. These findings highlight pre-sleep behaviors as an active, regulated component of sleep onset, with implications for understanding and treating sleep initiation difficulties."
"Currently, the human myopia epidemic is estimated to affect nearly 3 billion persons, yet experimental refractive error research is still hampered by the lack of a plausible theoretical mechanism explaining how the eye detects defocus and grows to minimise error (emmetropization). Applied lens defocus, either positive or negative, to animals including human, induces rapid changes in both refraction and axial length. Such changes have been linked to the rate of transfer of fluid from the vitreous chamber across the Retinal Pigment Epithelium (RPE). However, the theoretical basis of sensing the sign of defocus still eludes, as does the physiological operationalisation of this defocus signal. We propose that the signal for the sign of defocus is contained within the pattern of temporal modulation of light on the retina during the myriad saccadic eye movements performed every minute. This pattern is generated by a combination of the ocular point spread function for the defocused eye, narrow cone photoreceptor acceptance of light and the modification of photoreceptor directionality by the retinal shear that accompanies saccadic eye movements. Thus, under conditions of defocus, performing a saccade across a simple visual grating produces an out of focus dynamic stimulus pattern on the retina which is sawtooth-like, the profile being dependent on the sign of defocus. Positive lens defocus induces a fast-OFF/slow-ON sawtooth-like luminance modulation transfer function, while negative lens defocus results in a fast-ON/slow-OFF temporal pattern. Such patterns produce relative incremental or decremental changes in the trans-epithelial electrical potential and consequent changes in fluid absorption across the RPE. Thus, rearing with positive lens defocus is associated with an increase in trans-epithelial potential, increasing trans-epithelial absorption and decreasing vitreous chamber size, while rearing with a negative lens decreases the trans-epithelial electrical potential and decreases RPE fluid absorption, increasing eyeball size. In both cases, retinal images become more in-focus, and the refractive error tends to zero. The resultant is emmetropization, modifying eyeball size in response to applied defocus in a stable negative feedback fashion."
"Neuronal in vitro cultures are pivotal for studying brain electrophysiological function and dysfunction. Neuronal activity and communication are regulated by extracellular ion concentrations. Therefore, cell culture medium ion concentrations should ideally mimic those of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) - considered as the milieu for brain cells in vivo.

In this study, we demonstrate that commonly used cell culture media, including Neurobasal (+/- A), Neurobasal Plus, and BrainPhys media, do not accurately replicate human CSF ion concentrations. Using human iPSC-derived neuronal networks on microelectrode arrays, we show that the abnormally high potassium concentrations present in all tested cell culture media induce acute epileptiform activity, similar to that elicited by the convulsive drug 4- aminopyridine.

These findings raise a critical question: How can human in vitro neuronal activity be defined as physiological and reliably distinguished from pathophysiological activity, if the routinely used ion concentrations in in vitro experiments are causing aberrant neuronal activity?

SummaryThe neuronal activity in neuronal in vitro culture relies on extracellular ion concentrations, which should mimic cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). This study shows that common cell culture media and widely used artificial CSF composition in neuroscience research fail to replicate CSF ion levels, causing non-physiological and rather pathological neuronal activity."
"Crossing the blood-brain barrier while minimizing liver transduction is a key challenge in developing safe adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors for treating brain disorders. In mice, the engineered capsid PHP.eB shows enhanced brain transduction, while the further engineered CAP-B10 is also de-targeted from astrocytes and liver. Here, we solve cryo-EM structures of CAP-B10 and its complex with AAV receptor (AAVR) domain PKD2, at 2.22 and 2.20 [A] resolutions, respectively. These structures reveal a structural motif that hinders AAVR binding, which we confirm by measuring affinities. We show that this motif is transferable to other capsids by solving cryo-EM structures of AAV9-X1 and AAV9-X1.1, without and with PKD2, at 3.09, 2.51, and 2.18 [A], respectively. Using this structural information, we designed and validated novel AAV variants with reduced liver and altered brain cell tropism in vivo. Overall, our findings demonstrate that rationally modulating AAVR affinity can alter liver targeting and cellular tropism."
"Quantitative morphological analysis is crucial for understanding cellular processes. While 3D Z-stack imaging offers high-resolution data, the complexity of 3D structures makes direct interpretation and manual annotation challenging and time-consuming, especially for large datasets. Maximum Intensity Projection (MIP) is a common strategy to create more interpretable 2D representations, but this inevitably leads to artificial overlaps between structures, significantly hindering accurate automated segmentation of individual instances by conventional methods or standard deep learning tools. To address this critical challenge in 2D projection analysis, we developed DeMemSeg, a deep learning pipeline based on Mask R-CNN, specifically designed to segment overlapping membrane structures, called prospore membranes (PSMs) during yeast sporulation. DeMemSeg was trained on a custom-annotated dataset, leveraging a systematic image processing workflow. Our optimized model accurately identifies and delineates individual, overlapping PSMs, achieving segmentation performance and derived morphological measurements that are statistically indistinguishable from expert manual annotation. Notably, DeMemSeg successfully generalized to segment PSMs from unseen data acquired from gip1{Delta} mutant cells, capturing the distinct morphological defects in PSMs. DeMemSeg thus provides a robust, automated solution for objective quantitative analysis of complex, overlapping membrane morphologies directly from widely used 2D MIP images, offering a practical tool and adaptable workflow to advance cell biology research."
"While specific transcription factors are known to regulate cell fate decisions, the degree to which they can stimulate formation of specific cell organelles is less clear. We used a multi-omics comparison of the transcriptomes of ciliated and non-ciliated embryonic cells to identify transcription factors upregulated in ciliated cells, and conditional genetics in mouse embryos and stem cells to demonstrate that SP5/8 regulate cilia formation and gene expression. In Sp5/8 mutant embryos primary and motile cilia are shorter than normal and reduced in number across cell types, contributing to situs inversus and hydrocephalus. Moreover, expression of SP8 is sufficient to induce primary cilia in unciliated cells. This work opens new avenues for studying cilia assembly using stem cell models and offers new insights into human ciliopathies."
"Estimating the size of wild populations is a critical priority for ecologists and conservation biologists, but tools to do so are often labor intensive and expensive. A promising set of newer approaches are based on genetic data, which can be cheaper to obtain and less invasive than information from more direct observation. One of these approaches is close-kin mark-recapture (CKMR), a type of method that uses genetic data to identify kin pairs and estimates population size from these pairs. Although CKMR methods are promising, a major limitation to using them more broadly is a lack of CKMR models that can deal with spatial heterogeneity both in population density and sample effort. We introduce a simulation-based approach to CKMR that uses spatially explicit individual-based simulation in concert with a deep convolutional neural network to estimate population sizes. Using extensive simulation, we show that our method, CKMRnn, is highly accurate, even in the face of spatial heterogeneity, and demonstrate that it can account for potential confounders such as unknown population histories. Finally, to demonstrate the accuracy of our method in an empirical system, we apply CKMRnn to data from a Ugandan elephant population, and show that point estimates from our method recapitulate those from traditional estimators but that the confidence interval on our estimator is reduced by approximately 30%."
"Heparin and dextran sulfate were used to influence wing development in the Luna Moth and the Polyphemus Moth. The experiments led to alterations not only of wing patterns, but also of wing shapes in both species, albeit in different ways. Dextran sulfate led to contractions of the wing pattern elements that were expanded by heparin in the Polyphemus Moth. Transformations of the dorsal wing pattern of the Luna Moth under the influence of heparin were dramatic and demonstrated the hidden potential for creating color patterns by contracting and expanding wing pattern elements. For the first time, polysaccharides have been shown to have an effect on wing shape: heparin caused significant expansion of the hindwing tails in the Luna Moth, while dextran sulfate caused a narrowing of the wings in the Polyphemus Moth. This study aims to provide insight into homologies in wing pattern elements, such as eyespots, across the Lepidoptera order, in general, and Saturniidae, in particular, and contributes to understanding phenotypic diversity and plasticity within the genera Actias and Antheraea."
"BackgroundTruncating variants in desmoplakin (DSPtv), are a leading cause of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM), often presenting with early fibrosis and arrhythmias disproportionate to systolic dysfunction. DSP is critical for cardiac mechanical integrity, linking desmosomes to the cytoskeleton to withstand contractile forces. While loss-of-function is implicated, direct evidence, both for DSP haploinsufficiency in human hearts and for the impact of mechanical stress on cardiomyocyte adhesion, has been limited, leaving the pathogenic mechanism unclear.

MethodsWe analyzed explanted human heart tissue from patients with DSPtv (N=3), titin truncating variants (TTNtv, N=5), and controls (N=5) using RNA-sequencing and mass spectrometry. We generated human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) harboring patient-derived or CRISPR-Cas9 engineered DSPtv to model a range of DSP expression levels. Using a 2D cardiac muscle bundle (CMB) platform enabling live visualization of cell junctions, we developed an assay to assess cell-cell adhesion upon heightened contractile stress in response to the contractile agonist endothelin-1. CRISPR-interference (CRISPRi) was used to confirm the role of DSP loss, and CRISPR-activation (CRISPRa) was tested for therapeutic rescue.

ResultsCompared to both control and TTNtv hearts, DSPtv human hearts exhibited reduced DSP at both the mRNA and protein level, as well as broadly disrupted desmosomal stoichiometry. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses implicated cell adhesion, extracellular matrix, and inflammatory pathways. iPSC-CM models recapitulated DSP haploinsufficiency and desmosomal disruption. DSPtv CMBs showed normal baseline contractile function. However, they displayed marked cell-cell adhesion failure with contractile stress (75% failure vs. 8% in controls, p<0.001). Adhesion failure was prevented by the myosin inhibitor, mavacamten. CRISPRi-mediated DSP knockdown replicated this susceptibility to adhesion failure.

Conversely, CRISPRa robustly increased DSP expression and rescued cell-cell adhesion failure in DSPtv CMBs (9% failure post-CRISPRa, p<0.001 vs. un-treated). Rescue occurred even when only the DSPII isoform was upregulated in a model with biallelic DSP transcript 1 loss of function.

ConclusionsDSP haploinsufficiency is the major cause of DSP cardiomyopathy with a primary consequence of conferring vulnerability to cardiomyocyte cell-cell adhesion failure under heightened contractile stress. Transcriptional activation of DSP reverses this defect in preclinical models, establishing proof-of-concept for a potential therapeutic strategy in DSP cardiomyopathy."
"Tumor heterogeneity and the suppressive microenvironment are key challenges that limit the effectiveness of cancer treatment. In this study, we systematically elucidated the molecular characteristics and mechanisms underlying the suppressive immune microenvironment via a combination of single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, and metabolomics for a series of human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and matched nontumor tissues. We found that COL17A1+ epithelial cells presented greater malignancy, characterized by triglyceride (TG) and phosphocholine (PC) accumulation. We also identified a tumor-specific POSTN+ fibroblast subgroup. We found a unique epithelial-fibroblast niche with low infiltration of effector immune cells and substantial enrichment of lipids, composed of POSTN+ fibroblasts and COL17A1+ epithelial cells, where their crosstalk contributed to tumor progression. We confirmed that the INHBA/TP63 axis plays a key role in mediating the regulation of COL17A1+ tumor cells by POSTN+ fibroblasts. Our findings provided new insights into the characteristics of the tumor microenvironment and the crosstalk between tumor and fibroblasts, offering valuable multiomics data resources for elucidating tumor progression mechanisms."
"It has been proven that tail-lifting mice can cause stress, anxiety and aversive behaviour, and this finding has made scientists develop less stressful techniques like cupping and tunnel-handling. All these techniques have a disadvantage in that they can only handle mice individually and not in groups. This study produces scientific evidence on the advantages of group handling of laboratory mice for the first time. Group handling using the novel device significantly reduced the time taken and number of attempts for cage changes, a major reason that prevented tunnel-handling from being adopted globally. Shifting mice in groups using a device named ""Mus-Bus"" resulted in significantly lower faecal corticosteroid levels, higher voluntary interaction time and the open field activity and time spent in the central arena were not altered when compared with tail lifting and tunnel handling in C57BL/6NCrl mice. Body weights were not significantly different when Mus-Bus was employed compared to the other groups. This work demonstrates that group-shifting is the next frontier for animal welfare, as this device can revolutionize the handling of laboratory mice to improve animal well-being."

"BackgroundDistractibility and attentiveness are cognitive states that are expressed through observable behavior. The effective use of behavior observed in videos to diagnose periods of distractibility and attentiveness is still not well understood. Video-based tools for classifying cognitive states from behavior have high potential to serve as versatile diagnostic indicators of maladaptive cognition.

New methodWe describe an analysis pipeline that classifies cognitive states using a 2-camera set-up for video-based estimation of attentiveness and screen engagement in nonhuman primates performing cognitive tasks. The procedure reconstructs 3D poses from 2D labeled DeepLabCut videos, reconstructs the head/yaw orientation relative to a task screen, and arm/hand/wrist engagements with task objects, to segment behavior into an attentiveness and engagement score.

ResultsPerformance of different cognitive tasks were robustly classified from video within a few frames, reaching >90% decoding accuracy with [&le;]3min time segments. The analysis procedure allows setting subject-specific thresholds for segmenting subject specific movements for a time-resolved scoring of attentiveness and screen engagement.

Comparison with existing methodsCurrent methods also extract poses and segment action units; however, they havent been combined into a framework that enables subject-adjusted thresholding for specific task contexts. This integration is needed for inferring cognitive state variables and differentiating performance across various tasks.

ConclusionThe proposed method integrates video segmentation, scoring of attentiveness and screen engagement, and classification of task performance at high temporal resolution. This integrated framework provides a tool for assessing attention functions from video."
"The diverse spectral and photochemical properties of fluorescent proteins enable a variety of imaging applications in cell biology, ranging from cellular and organelle labeling to super-resolution microscopy and multiplexed live cell imaging. Here, we report a set of novel far-red fluorescent proteins, named mfRFP, mfRFP-A, and mCardinal-A, which are characterized by similar fluorescence spectra with excitation/emission at [~]600/660 nm while exhibiting distinct photobleaching rates. Differences in photostability allowed us to perform per-pixel unmixing of the three far-red FPs imaged simultaneously by employing a recently introduced temporal domain multiplexing approach. We demonstrated the application of the temporal domain multiplexing approach with different combinations of far-red fluorescent proteins possessing nearly identical emission spectra by acquiring BrainBow-like images of cellular populations and distinguishing subcellular structures in mammalian cells using a single imaging channel without applying any hardware modifications to the conventional microscope. Unlike previous temporal domain multiplying approaches employing photophysical properties of fluorescent proteins, the current approach is a wide range of microscopy modalities, including 3D imaging with a spinning disk and point scanning confocal microscopy. The most photostable fluorescent protein in the set, mfRFP, was further benchmarked against spectrally similar FPs and applied for super-resolution imaging of structural proteins in mammalian cells and for neuroimaging of model organisms, including mice, zebrafish, and C. elegans."
"Compared to other nucleotides, the cytosines stand as the most expressive one for gene regulation in plants due to its status as methylation-based epigenetic switch. Methylation of some of these cytosines may have higher impact on the downstream genes, making them critical ones. To this date not much has been done to decipher the criticality of such cytosines. Understanding them may open door-ways for minimal interventions led modification and control of gene expression. This is one such pioneering step in decoding the critical  Cs where a large volume of bisulfite and RNA-seq data, including 232 WGBS and 260 corresponding RNA-seq datasets from A. thaliana and rice, have been utilized to decode criticality of cytosines in plants. Using a deep learning system, strong relationship was established between the methylation states of cytosines in contextual manner with respect to the downstream genes expression levels. Using the same system, all the 2kb upstream regions for Arabidopsis and rice genes have been annotated. The developed approach has been shown to be a universal one and may be used to annotate other plant genomes to identify critical cytosines. The developed resource and the deep-learning system to decode criticality have been made publicly available as CritiCal-C portal, which is poised to accelerate the field of plant epigenomics and regulatory studies."
"Antibiotic resistance poses a global health crisis. In order to develop new antibiotic agents, it is crucial to identify drug targets in multidrug-resistant bacteria. Criteria for such a target are an -helical, essential membrane protein, that is non-homologues with the human membrane proteome, and present across multiple bacterial species. Using a stepwise subtractive genomics approach, the membrane protein F0F1 ATP synthase subunit C was identified as a non-human analogues drug target that is present in 11 bacterial species."
"BackgroundDisease heterogeneity is a persistent challenge in medicine, complicating both research and treatment. Standard analytical pipelines often assume patient populations are homogeneous, overlooking variance patterns that may signal biologically distinct subgroups. Variance heterogeneity (VH)--including skewness, outliers, and multimodal distributions--offers a powerful but underused lens for detecting latent etiological structures relevant to prognosis and therapeutic response.

MethodsA major barrier to VH analysis is the fragmented landscape of available methods, many of which rely on normality assumptions that biological data frequently violate. In addition, existing tools often require programming expertise, and clear guidance on study design considerations--such as sample size and method selection--is lacking. To address these issues, we developed BifurcatoR, an open-source software platform that simplifies the detection, modeling, and interpretation of VH. BifurcatoR integrates simulation-based method evaluation, study design recommendations, and a user-friendly web interface to support VH analysis across a range of data distributions. We benchmarked VH methods through simulation and applied BifurcatoR to two clinical datasets: acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and obesity.

ResultsSimulation studies revealed that VH method performance is highly context-specific, varying with distribution shape, mean-variance coupling, and underlying subgroup structure. In AML, BifurcatoR identified two molecularly distinct subgroups with different treatment responses, including an EVI1-high group with significantly poorer prognosis (p < 0.005) among KMT2A-rearranged cases. In a separate study, VH analysis uncovered immunophenotypic subgroups in obesity based on gene-level discordance across monozygotic twin pairs, highlighting latent variation in adipose immune cell composition.

ConclusionsVH is not ""noise"", biological variation without clinical relevance. Instead, VH is a structured signal that can reveal latent and clinically meaningful subtypes. BifurcatoR offers a practical, accessible framework for incorporating VH into biomedical research, with implications for biomarker discovery, patient stratification, and precision medicine."
"Spatial transcriptomics provides a significant advance over studies of dissociated cells in that it reveals the environment in which cells reside, thus opening the way for a more complete description of their state and function. However, most current methods for embedding and discovery of cell states rely only on the cells own gene expression profile, thus raising the need for ways to account for the neighboring cells as well. Here, we introduce scVIVA, a deep generative model that leverages both cell-intrinsic and neighboring gene expression profiles to output stochastic embeddings of cell states as well as normalized gene expression profiles. We demonstrate that scVIVA produces informative fine-grained partitions of cells that reflect both their internal state and the surrounding tissue and that its generative model facilitates the testing of hypotheses of differential expression between tissue niches. We leverage these properties of scVIVA to uncover a spatially-restricted tumor-promoting endothelial population in breast cancer and niche-associated T cell states that are shared across multiple cancers. scVIVA is available as open source software within scvi-tools.org."
"While LC retention time prediction of peptides and their modifications has proven useful, widespread adoption and optimal performance are hindered by variations in experimental parameters. These variations can render retention time prediction models inaccurate and dramatically reduce the value of predictions for identification, validation, and DIA spectral library generation. To date, mitigation of these issues has been attempted through calibration or by training bespoke models for specific experimental setups, with only partial success. We here demonstrate that transfer learning can successfully overcome these limitations by leveraging pre-trained model parameters. Remarkably, this approach can even fit highly performant models to substantially different peptide modifications and LC conditions than those on which the model was originally trained. This impressive adaptability of transfer learning makes it a highly robust solution for accurate peptide retention time prediction across a very wide variety of imaginable proteomics workflows."
"Protein structure-based comparison provides a framework for uncovering deep evolutionary relationships that can escape conventional sequence-based approaches. Encoding three-dimensional protein structures using a simplified structure-aware alphabet, can lead to compact, comparable strings that retain key spatial relationships. Although this enables comparison, structure-aware alignments can experience misaligned regions, particularly when comparing proteins with substantial divergence in fold architecture. To address this, a web-based resource, Structome-AlignViewer, is introduced in this work for evaluating the quality of structure-aware alignments through both spatial mapping of alignment columns to protein structures and quantitative confidence scoring. Confidence is computed from pairwise structural substitutions between adjacent inputs and normalized within each alignment to highlight relatively well-supported columns. To provide broader context, thousands of alignments from established structural classification systems were analysed, allowing for an empirical comparative statistic to be derived to assess alignment quality. Option to exclude gap-rich regions enable users to refine alignments and focus on conserved structural cores. This approach provides an interpretable method for assessing structural alignment quality and supports more robust comparative and evolutionary analyses. Structome-AlignViewer is freely available at https://biosig.lab.uq.edu.au/structome_alignviewer/."
"Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the deadliest forms of cancer and presents a significant clinical challenge due to poor prognosis and limited treatment options. In this study, we developed a novel framework integrating genome-scale metabolic modeling (GSM) with machine learning to identify metabolic biomarkers and vulnerabilities in PDAC. We addressed the inherent class imbalance in cancer datasets by generating synthetic healthy samples using a Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP), implementing a three-step biological filtration process to ensure their validity. Our approach achieved 94.83% accuracy in distinguishing between healthy and cancerous metabolic states. Systems-level analysis revealed three key dysregulated pathways: heparan sulfate degradation, O-glycan metabolism, and heme degradation. We identified impaired lysosomal degradation of heparan sulfate proteoglycans as a potential contributor to PDAC pathogenesis, providing a mechanistic explanation for the previously observed association between lysosomal storage disorders and pancreatic cancer. Additionally, we found that nervonic acid transport (MAR00336) was the most discriminative reaction between healthy and cancerous states, with gene-level analysis highlighting FABPs, SLC27As, ACSLs, and ACSBGs as key molecular drivers of metabolic reprogramming in PDAC. Overall, our multi-level approach connected genetic drivers to functional metabolic consequences, revealing coordinated upregulation of fatty acid transport and activation processes. These findings enhance our understanding of PDAC metabolism and present potential therapeutic targets, demonstrating the value of integrated computational approaches in cancer research."
"For all drugs, effective target engagement requires sufficient intracellular concentrations of drug to be reached, but whether tumour heterogeneity impacts drug distribution and efficacy is poorly studied. PARP inhibitors have transformed treatment of high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC), but resistance remains a clinical hurdle in this highly heterogeneous tumour type. We developed a patient-derived explant multi-modal imaging pipeline, which demonstrated that cell-intrinsic PARP inhibitor accumulation is highly variable, both between patients and within tumours. Spatial transcriptomics revealed enrichment of apoptotic and lysosomal signatures in  high-drug regions. Rucaparib, an intrinsically fluorescent PARP inhibitor, accumulates heterogeneously at the single-cell level, with  rucaparib-high cells demonstrating increased drug response relative to  rucaparib low. Mechanistically, lysosomal sequestration creates a rucaparib reservoir that determines drug levels in the nucleus. Perturbation of lysosomal content altered intracellular levels of weak base PARP inhibitors rucaparib and niraparib, but not olaparib. Together these data suggest that lysosomes act as a reservoir for a subset of PARP inhibitor drugs to improve drug response."
"BackgroundAtrial fibrillation (AF) often progresses from paroxysmal to more stable forms. It is well-recognized that patients vary in their AF progression, but underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This work, performed in a sheep AF-model, aimed to identify atrial redox and energetic status differences between animals developing stable AF (AF-S) versus those resistant to AF-stabilization (AF-R).

MethodsAF was monitored with telemetry and maintained with bursts of atrial tachystimulation whenever sinus rhythm resumed. Electrophysiological remodeling was assessed via contact mapping. Structural remodeling was described by histology. Proteomic, metabolomic, enzymatic and bioenergetic remodeling were evaluated using frozen left atrial appendage (LAA) tissues and isolated LAA mitochondria. Healthy young rats were used to investigate if an induced metabolic challenge could stabilize AF episodes upon transesophageal atrial tachypacing challenge.

ResultsAF-S sheep developed stable AF (>24-hours self-sustained) after 13 days on average, whereas AF-R sheep failed to develop self-sustained AF despite 120 days of electrically-maintained AF. Contact mapping and histological analysis revealed similar electro-structural remodeling in both groups. Metabolic analysis showed significant differences in tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzymes activities and a 45% increase in AF-S LAA succinate content versus AF-R. AF-S mitochondria showed abnormal mitochondrial succinate oxidation, associated with a significant 20% decrease in ATP synthesis rate, 22% increase in ROS emission and mitochondrial inner membrane hyperpolarization. The ratios of ATP to ADP, NAD+ to NADH, and Complex I/II were disturbed in AF-S compared to AF-R. Calculated mitochondrial NAD+ to NADH ratios suggest a reduced state of in-vivo AF-R mitochondria compared to the oxidized state of AF-S. Exogenous succinate was metabolized when incubated with rat atrial cardiomyocytes and altered redox balance, while intravenous succinate stabilized atrial arrhythmias induced by tachypacing in vivo.

ConclusionsSheep resistant to AF-progression showed specific TCA cycle, energetic and redox adaptations compared to animals that developed self-sustained AF. In this animal model, mitochondrial TCA cycle remodeling and associated redox and energetic responses determined the resistance to AF domestication, with potential relevance to identify new mechanistic determinants of AF progression in humans."
"Chironomids are important laboratory model organisms used to assess toxicity in freshwater environments. Cell and tissue features are not commonly used as chironomid markers to detect toxicity, but they could be extremely helpful in identifying acute and chronic effects of pollutants. The nervous system is an excellent cellular candidate since it is reactive to toxic substances. However, a detailed description of the chironomid nervous system is required prior to considering it as a candidate for a cellular toxicity marker. The present study describes the central ganglia, nerves, axons, and the neuromuscular system of Chironomus vitellinus (Freeman, 1961) to facilitate its use as a model organism in environmental studies. We find that the structure of the C. vitellinus central nervous system is identical to that observed in other Chironomus larvae. We then focused our study on the first abdominal segment and labeled the 31 hemi-segmental muscles according to a nomenclature based on their position and orientation. We also characterized their innervation and assigned the nerves a nomenclature based on their terminals location in the muscle tissue. Finally, we investigated the neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) throughout this segment and defined four types of NMJs illustrating their great variability in size and shape. We selected a model NMJ, VEL 2, and quantified its mean bouton number and muscle size. Together with documenting a neurobiological system that could be informative to insects comparative biology, these results could help establish the Chironomus NMJ as an aquatic toxicity marker."
"The degree to which information from distinct sensory modalities can interact in the absence of conscious awareness remains controversial. According to the Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNWT), unconscious sensory information remains relatively confined to sensory cortex and should not be capable of interacting with other modalities until it is broadcast into the (conscious) global workspace comprising late (>300ms) frontal-parietal activation. The ventriloquist effect is a classical multisensory integration phenomenon that refers to the misperception of sound location towards concurrent visual stimulation, such as perceiving the voice of a ventriloquist actor as coming from the moving dummy. Here we used meta-contrast masking to render a brief flash stimulus non-conscious while participants performed a sound localization task. We found that, despite being at chance performance in discriminating the flash location, participants were nevertheless biased to localize sounds towards the unconscious flash locations. The effect was present in virtually all participants, was nearly as large as the effect on conscious trials, and was robust to controls for individual differences in task performance. Decoding analyses of concurrently recorded EEG signals showed that the non-conscious flash location information was present up until around 230ms but not after; confirming that the visual influence on sound perception likely occurred before conscious broadcast. Our findings suggest that subjective perception is not required for the integration of signals originating in distinct sensory modalities prompting new questions about the role of subjective perception in multisensory integration."
"The speed of voluntary movements varies systematically, with some individuals moving consistently faster than others across different actions. These variations, conceptualized as vigor, reflect a time-effort-accuracy tradeoff in motor planning. How do two mechanically coupled partners with different individual vigors collaborate, e.g. to move a table together? Here, we show that such dyads coordinate goal-directed movements with minimal interaction force, exhibiting a dyadic vigor with similar characteristics as individual vigor. The emerging dyadic motor plan is strongly influenced by the slower partner, whose vigor predicts dyadic vigor, with effects lasting beyond connected practice. Computational modeling reveals the critical role of the partners movement timings uncertainty and vigor in shaping coordination, allowing to predict dyadic movements from individual behavior across diverse conditions. These findings shed light on the mechanisms underlying successful human collaboration, and may be used in applications ranging from physical training and rehabilitation to collaborative robotics for manufacturing."
"The mouse retina is made-up of approximately 150 types of neurons each with unique characteristics and functions in interpreting visual information. Recent efforts to categorize cell types using molecular markers, morphology, and electrophysiological response properties have provided a wealth of information and a host of tools for studying specific cell types. AAV-based approaches have several advantages over transgenic mouse lines, including ease of application to many different animal models without extensive crossing and their amenability to intersectional approaches. Here, we provide an in-depth characterization of retinal ganglion cell types labeled by two AAV vectors drawn from a recent panel of constructs with synthetic promoters. Each promoter analyzed here was derived from a gene expressed in a cell type specific manner. Using a combination of morphology, molecular markers, and electrophysiological measurement of light responses, we found that each vector labeled distinct subsets of RGCs. However, both labeled more cell types than expected from the expression pattern of the promoters endogenous gene. We then characterized the projection patterns of these RGC types to the brain, finding that each AAV type labeled distinct axonal populations. These tools provide new access to a unique subset of cells and will be instrumental to future studies analyzing their functions and connectivity."
"Non-invasive measurements of exchange is paramount in different fields, ranging from material to biological sciences, and may even blur micro-structural or other characteristics of multi compartmental systems studied by MR methods. Despite the growing interest in diffusion-exchange studies of complex systems--where at least one exchanging component exhibits non-Gaussian diffusion--comparative studies remain scarce. Most existing investigations have applied different diffusion MR methods to different biological samples under varying experimental conditions, making direct comparisons difficult. Moreover, the lack of a gold standard for exchange rate measurements further complicates efforts to validate and interpret results. To address these challenges, we employed two diffusion NMR-based methods--the constant-gradient pulsed field gradient (CG-PFG) and the recently introduced filter-exchange NMR spectroscopy (FEXSY)--to investigate apparent water exchange in yeast cells and optic nerves, both before and after fixation. We first evaluated the effect of the q-values on the extracted indices and then evaluated the stability and reproducibility of the measurements. The CG-PFG and FEXSY experiments were collected on the same sample to allow for comparison of the results. The intracellular mean residence times (MRTs) ({tau}i) extracted from the log-linear fit of the CG-PFG NMR experiments were found to be 554{+/-} 6ms and 337 {+/-} 10ms for yeast cells before and after fixation, respectively. The respective{tau} i values extracted from the FEXSY experiments before and after fixation were found to be 368{+/-} 14ms and 146{+/-} 24ms, respectively. Despite the difference in absolute values of the MRTs, the same qualitative behavior is observed in the two methodologies, and both could be analyzed using the bi-compartmental Karger model. The same methodologies were then used to study exchange in the more complex porcine optic nerves. There, the bicompartmental Karger model analysis is shown to be inadequate. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations are used to narrow down on the most possible explanation, suggesting that optic nerves are multi-compartmental systems where not all spins are free to undergo exchange. Supporting theoretical calculation point to the existence of at least one additional non-exchanging restricted compartment. Thus, a tri-compartmental model is derived and used to analyze the data. The new model fits the data significantly better and results in dramatically different exchange rates when used on white matter (WM) data: CG-PFG experiments were found to be 730 {+/-} 40ms and 803 {+/-} 16ms for optic nerve before and after fixation, respectively. The respective{tau} i values extracted from the FEXSY experiments before and after fixation were found to be 530 {+/-} 125ms and 387 {+/-} 104ms, respectively. These values are considerably smaller than values that were previously reported. Finally, we use simulations to show that the quantitative discrepancy between the CG-PFG and FEXSY can be attributed, at least partially, to the difference in T2 values between the intra- and extracellular compartments. We thus encourage the pairing of exchange and spin-spin relaxation measurements in future works. We end with a discussion on the current state of the diffusion-exchange, and in an attempt to put a spotlight on essential corner stones that are still missing despite the great advance of recent years -- experimental standardization, method comparison and adequate modeling."
"Sensory neuronopathies (SNN) and small fiber neuropathies (SFN) are debilitating disorders often associated with neuropathic pain, yet their underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Autoantibodies against fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (-FGFR3) have been identified in a subset of patients, but their pathological significance has not been established. Here, we describe that -FGFR3-positive patients consistently report neuropathic pain and display a distinct clinical phenotype characterized by large-fiber involvement and non-length-dependent fiber loss, suggesting dorsal root ganglia (DRG) dysfunction. We demonstrate that -FGFR3 bind to sensory neurons within dorsal root ganglia (DRG). We validated both at the transcript and protein level that the target of autoantibodies, FGFR3, is expressed in human sensory neurons and that therefore -FGFR3 could find their target in primary afferents. DRG neurons exposed to -FGFR3 rapidly acquired a hyperexcitability phenotype. Injection of -FGFR3-positive patient serum in rats caused mechanical hypersensitivity, mirroring patient-reported pain symptoms. Mechanistically, -FGFR3 activated the Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signaling cascade, specifically extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38, which are known to enhance neuronal excitability. Epitope mapping revealed key extracellular epitopes on FGFR3. Blocking these epitopes prevented -FGFR3-induced sensory neuron hyperexcitability, thus showing that the autoantibody binding of the FGFR3 extracellular domain is a key factor affecting DRG neurons. Our work suggests that beyond their role as biomarkers, -FGFR3 actively contribute to pain hypersensitivity by acting on the DRG. This positions both -FGFR3 and FGFR3 signaling as a potential therapeutic targets for modulating sensory neuron excitability and treating autoimmune neuropathies."
"Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) based on motor imagery (MI) hold promise for restoring control in individuals with motor impairments. However, up to 30% of users remain unable to effectively use BCIs--a phenomenon termed ""BCI inefficiency."" This study addresses a major limitation in current BCI training protocols: the use of fixed-length training paradigms that ignore individual learning variability. We propose a novel approach that leverages neuronal avalanches--spatiotemporal cascades of brain activity--as biomarkers to characterize and predict user-specific learning mechanism. Using electroencephalography (EEG) data collected across four MI-BCI training sessions in 20 healthy participants, we extracted two features: avalanche length and activations. These features revealed significant training and task-condition effects, particularly in later sessions. Crucially, changes in these features across sessions ({Delta}avalanche length and {Delta}activations) correlated significantly with BCI performance and enabled prediction of future BCI success via longitudinal Support Vector Regression and Classification models. Predictive accuracy reached up to 91%, with notable improvements after spatial filtering based on selected regions of interest. These findings demonstrate the utility of neuronal avalanche dynamics as robust biomarkers for BCI training, supporting the development of personalized protocols aimed at mitigating BCI illiteracy."
"Single-cell techniques allow concurrent study of gene activity and T cell receptor (TCR) sequences, identifying connections between TCR structure and cell traits. Expanding on our CoNGA software, we present a ""metaCoNGA"" analysis of 6 million T cells from 91 diverse studies, mapping TCR sequence similarity across tissues and diseases. This approach exposes shared TCR features within specific T cell subsets, including those associated with infection, cancer, and autoimmunity. We introduce a method to identify T cell groups with similar gene expression and biased TCR amino acid composition, providing a systematic framework for classifying diverse unconventional T cells, including KIR+ CD8+ T cells, CD4+ regulatory T cells, and subsets of NKT and MAIT cells. A new TCR clustering approach identifies thousands of convergent TCR sequence clusters hypothesized to target shared antigens. These clusters show coherent gene expression, highlighting the role of antigen exposure in shaping T cell behavior. Finally, we provide a tool for users to merge new data with this resource and rapidly identify T cell features in their data sets. This resource empowers investigations into the complex relationship between TCR sequence and T cell function in human health."
"Itaconate is produced by inflammatory macrophages and promotes a negative feedback on inflammation. It is synthesized by aconitate decarboxylase 1 (ACOD1) from cis- aconitate, a metabolite of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Here, we studied the role of ACOD1 in the inflammatory response of microglia, the resident macrophage-like cells of the brain. Similar to macrophages, ACOD1 deficient microglia displayed a stronger inflammatory response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) compared to their wild type counterparts. The proinflammatory effects of ACOD1 deficiency were associated with reprogramed arginine metabolism entailing enhanced argininosuccinate synthesis at the expense of polyamine synthesis, in a manner that was dependent on ACLY. These findings provide new insights in the immunometabolic role of ACOD1 in inflammatory microglia."

"Black bass (Micropterus spp.) are the most important warmwater game fishes in the United States. They have high socioeconomic and recreational value and support an important aquaculture industry. Since 2008, fisheries managers have been reporting the observation of hyperpigmented melanistic lesions (HPMLs) on smallmouth bass (M. dolomieu) in different ecoregions of the United States. Similar HPMLs have been observed in largemouth bass (M. nigricans) since the 1980s. Here, we report a close association between novel adomaviruses and the hallmark blotchy clinical presentation of hyperpigmented lesions on the skin smallmouth and largemouth black bass and provide evidence that satisfies Rivers postulates. The two adomaviruses are structurally and phylogenetically similar but share only 68.0% identity at aligned nucleotide sites and each has been found in only one host species to date. The manifestation of this skin disease appears to be seasonal in both species, primarily affects adults and is of unknown health consequence. Although the significance of infection to fish health remains unclear, understanding the disease ecology of these can inform biosecurity and the interjurisdictional movement of individuals. Moreover, as hyperpigmentation in other fish species is often idiopathic, our findings reframe perspectives for future investigations into this clinical presentation in other species."

"Vertebrate mechanosensory hair cells (HCs) in the ear detect sound and gravitational forces. Additionally, fish have homologous lateral line HCs in the skin that detect water vibrations for orientation and predator avoidance. HCs in fish and other non-mammalian vertebrates regenerate to restore function after damage, but mammalian HCs lack this ability, causing deafness and vestibular defects. Experimental attempts at regeneration in mice result in incomplete differentiation of immature HCs. Despite differences in regeneration, the gene regulatory networks (GRNs) driving HC maturation are highly similar across vertebrates. Here, we show that the transcription factor prdm1a plays a key role in the HC fate GRN in the zebrafish lateral line. Mutating prdm1a respecifies lateral line HCs into ear HCs, altering morphology and transcriptome. Understanding how transcription factors control diverse HC fates in zebrafish is crucial for understanding the yet unsolved regeneration of diverse HCs in mammalian ears to restore hearing and balance."
"Embryo mounting is one of the technical challenges researchers encounter when undertaking an imaging project. Embryos need to be oriented in a reproducible manner such that the tissue of interest is accessible to a microscope objective for the entire imaging period. To overcome this challenge researchers can embed embryos in viscous media or create specialized dishes and casts to hold embryos in a desired orientation during imaging. Here we describe a method for using a cheap stereolithographic (SLA) 3D-printer to manufacture re-usable molds that create agarose wells in which embryos can be mounted for imaging. These agarose wells provide a reliable means for orienting multiple embryos for imaging. This method includes a design framework that can be easily customized for a variety of tissues, organisms and imaging challenges. Using this method we have created molds for imaging cardiac development in zebrafish for both upright and inverted microscopes. By utilizing materials and equipment that are accessible this method allows researchers to easily create molds specific to their mounting needs.

SUMMARYHere we describe a method that uses a cheap stereolithographic (SLA) 3D printer to create molds to facilitate the reproducible mounting of zebrafish embryos for imaging studies. Using this method, weve created molds for imaging cardiac morphogenesis in zebrafish embryos."
"Being an irreversible disorder regarding the human motor-system, Parkinsons Disease(PD) has been a threat to many neurological patients, especially due to its severity in pain and muscle control restriction. As PD has no significant cure or treatments to this day, early diagnosis, or detections of PD within potential patients is a crucial task to maximize the effect of mediations which are implemented to achieve temporal prohibition of motor failure progression. In recent research, alongside conventional diagnosis methods based on neurological examinations or MRI based brain imaging, use of deep learning based artificial intelligence models, such as CNN, are repeatedly reported to have significant progress in detecting PD in early stages with high performance. Based on current success, this research attempted to further enhance AI-driven PD diagnosis by developing a deep learning based causal representation learning framework that extracts only highly robust PD features from simple hand drawings. Specifically, convolutional VAE based reconstruction and information theory based weakly supervised learning were linked with causal representation learning methods to distinguish significant PD features from geometrical features within hand drawing images. Not only aiding conventional tests for PD diagnosis, but also giving reliable representations of PD features such as tremor and rigidity, developed framework was found to achieve high performance in both retrieving latent factors of PD in images and predicting PD diagnosis results."
"Improvements in drug delivery have been achieved using nanospheres to prolong drug efficacy, accelerate absorption, and target tissues with ongoing inflammation. Although nanospheres have numerous pharmacokinetic advantages their tissue-targeting ability is poor. In contrast, mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) accumulate in high numbers in inflammatory tissues via the interaction between CXC-chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) expressed on MSC and stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1) secreted during inflammation. Therefore, this study investigated coating gelatin nanospheres (GNS) with MSC membranes (MSC-GNS) by extrusion and ultrasonication methods to enhance their inflammatory tissue tropism. {zeta}-potential measurements, western blotting and single-particle analysis of MSC-GNS by flow cytometry demonstrated the GNS surface was successfully coated with MSC membranes. Dot blotting demonstrated the binding ability of CXCR4 for SDF-1 was retained by MSC-GNS but absent for MSC-membrane-free GNS. The blood clearance of MSC-GNS was examined by their intravenous injection into mice. Although MSC-GNS and GNS were retained during the early distribution phase, MSC-GNS had a higher retention than GNS during the later elimination phase. Finally, we investigated the tissue distribution of MSC-GNS by intravenous injection into a mouse model of liver fibrosis and their potential therapeutic effect on liver fibrosis. We found a higher accumulation of MSC-GNS in inflamed livers and higher blood retention compared with MSC-membrane-free GNS.

Furthermore, MSC-GNS loaded with an anti-fibrotic agent (LSKL, a 4-amino acid peptide that inhibits fibrosis progression) had an enhanced therapeutic effect on liver fibrosis than uncoated nanoparticles. Therefore, MSC-GNS might be a drug carrier with inflammatory tissue targeting and controlled drug release abilities.

"Nucleic acid aptamers targeting proteins are becoming increasingly important in biopharmaceuticals and molecular diagnostics. Traditionally, aptamers are discovered through labor-intensive screening of nucleic acid libraries using the SELEX method. However, de novo design approaches without experimental screening remain a significant challenge. Here, we employed deep reinforcement learning to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) agent capable of de novo aptamer design, termed AiDTA (AI-driven Docking-Then-Assembling). First, nucleic acid fragments were docked to the target protein to identify target-binding fragments. Then, AiDTA automatically assembled these fragments into aptamers using the Monte Carlo tree search algorithm and a policy-value neural network to guide the agent in generating aptamers with secondary structures similar to the original constituent fragments. Experimental validation demonstrated that the AiDTA-designed DNA aptamers targeting disease-related proteins exhibited high binding affinities in the nanomolar range, achieving the de novo design of protein-binding aptamers for the first time. Our study establishes a new approach to obtaining protein-binding aptamers for potential applications in biopharmaceuticals and diagnostics."
"Pesticide resistance in agricultural pests poses a significant challenge to sustainable crop protection. In this study, we assessed the current resistance status of two key pests, Tetranychus urticae and Bemisia tabaci, in major agricultural regions of Greece. A total of 25 field populations were collected between 2023 and 2025 and tested using single-dose toxicity bioassays and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) for known resistance-associated target-site mutations. The results revealed significant variability in susceptibility to multiple acaricides and insecticides, with several T. urticae populations displaying reduced sensitivity to abamectin, hexythiazox, and fenpyroximate. Resistance mutations such as I321T (GluCl3), I1017F (CHS1), F1538I (VGSC), and G126S (cytb) were detected at high frequencies in multiple populations, indicating multi-resistant phenotypes. In B. tabaci, widespread occurrence of F331W (ace1), L925I/T929V (VGSC), and A2083V (acc) mutations confirmed evolving resistance to organophosphates, pyrethroids, and ketoenols, respectively. Our findings underscore the ongoing evolution of resistance in these pests and highlight the need for integrated management strategies that include regular resistance monitoring and judicious pesticide use. This study provides data to guide evidence-based pest control and supports the implementation of sustainable Integrated Pest Management (IPM) practices in Greece."
"The domesticated species currently available in the market have been developed through the breeding of wild relatives. Breeding strategies using wild relatives with high genetic diversity are attracting attention as an important approach for ad-dressing climate change and ensuring sustainable food supply. However, studies examining gene expression variation in multiple wild and domesticated species are few. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the changes in gene expression associated with domestication. We performed a meta-analysis of public gene expression data of domesticated species of rice, tomato, and soybean and their presumed ancestral species. In wild relatives, the expression of genes involved in osmotic, drought, and wound stress tolerance was upregulated. In domesticated species, upregulated expression was observed in genes related to auxin and those involved in the efflux of heavy metals and harmful substances. These findings provide insights into how domestication influences changes in crop traits. Thus, our findings may contribute to rapid breeding and development of new varieties capable of growing in harsh natural environments. Hence, a new cultivation method called ""de novo domestication"" has been proposed, which combines the genetic diversity of currently unused wild relatives and wild relatives with genome editing technologies that enable rapid breeding."
"During cell-cell communication (CCC), pathways activated by different ligand-receptor pairs may have crosstalk with each other. While multiple methods have been developed to infer CCC networks and their downstream response using single-cell RNA-seq data (scRNA-seq), the potential crosstalk between pathways connecting CCC with its downstream targets has been ignored. Here we introduce a machine learning-based method SigXTalk to analyze the crosstalk using scRNA-seq data by quantifying signal fidelity and specificity, two critical quantities measuring the effect of crosstalk. Specifically, a hypergraph learning method is used to encode the higher-order relations among receptors, transcription factors and target genes within regulatory pathways. Benchmarking of SigXTalk using simulation data shows the effectiveness, robustness, and accuracy in identifying key shared molecules among crosstalk pathways and their roles in transferring shared CCC information. Analysis of disease data shows SigXTalks capability in identifying crucial signals, targets, regulatory networks, and CCC patterns that distinguish different disease conditions. Applications to the data with multiple time points reveals SigXTalks capability in tracking the evolution of crosstalk pathways over time. Together our studies provide a systematic analysis of CCC-induced regulatory networks from the perspective of crosstalk between pathways."
"Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is an important lipid signaling molecule that regulates a wide range of physiological and pathological processes. However, its dynamics during these processes are largely unknown due to the lack of tools to directly visualize PGE2 with high spatiotemporal resolution. Here, we developed and characterized a genetically encoded PGE2 sensor, which we call GRABPGE2-1.0 (PGE2-1.0), that has high specificity for PGE2, nanomolar affinity, rapid kinetics, and high spatial resolution when expressed both in vitro and in vivo. Using fiber-photometry recordings, we found that PGE2-1.0 can reliably monitor endogenous PGE2 dynamics in the preoptic area in the brain during acute inflammation. The wide-field in vivo imaging with PGE2-1.0 reveals spatial heterogeneity in cortex-wide PGE2 dynamics during acute inflammation and seizure. Thus, our PGE2-1.0 sensor can be used to detect endogenous PGE2 dynamics with high spatiotemporal resolution, providing a robust tool for studying PGE2 under specific physiological and pathological conditions."
"Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) are a group of neurogenetic conditions resulting from disruptions in the cellular glycosylation machinery. The majority of CDG patients have compound heterozygous pathogenic variants in the phosphomannomutase 2 (PMM2) gene. Individuals with PMM2-CDG exhibit multi-systemic symptoms, prominently featuring neurological deficits with nearly all patients exhibiting cerebellar hypoplasia and ataxia. To overcome embryonic lethality caused by whole body knock-out of Pmm2 and mimic patient-related compound heterozygous pathogenic variants, we paired a Pmm2 flox allele (Pmm2fl) with a catalytically inactive knock-in allele (Pmm2R137H), commonly present in PMM2-CDG patients. Mice with post-mitotic loss of PMM2 from neurons or astrocytes are indistinguishable from unaffected littermates, including in a broad battery of neurological assessments. In contrast, removal of PMM2 from embryonic neural precursor cells leads to cerebellar hypoplasia, ataxia, seizures, and early lethality. Comprehensive multi-omics profiling, including metabolomics, glycomics, single-cell transcriptomics, proteomics, and glycoproteomics, reveal widespread molecular disturbances throughout the brain, with the cerebellum showing the most pronounced disruption. These findings highlight the heightened dependency of the developing cerebellum on intact N-glycosylation, aligning with clinical observations in PMM2-CDG patients. Importantly, glycoproteomic alterations identified in our mouse model are corroborated in PMM2-CDG patient post-mortem cerebellar tissue, underscoring the translational relevance of our findings and implicating impaired synaptic transmission as a key pathogenic mechanism."
"Exposure to stress can cause long-lasting enhancement of fear and other defensive responses that extend beyond the cues or contexts associated with the original traumatic event. These nonassociative consequences of stress, referred to as fear sensitization, are thought to underlie some symptoms of trauma-related disorders. Fear sensitization has been predominately studied using the Stress-Enhanced Fear Learning (SEFL) paradigm, which models the stress-induced amplification of fear learning. Less is known about the mechanisms through which unlearned fear responses are sensitized by stress. Here, we investigated the neural mechanisms for sensitization of unlearned fear responses using a paradigm we termed Stress-Enhanced Fear Responding (SEFR). In this model, mice exposed to a single session of footshock stress exhibit enhanced freezing to a novel tone stimulus. To investigate brain regions that might mediate SEFR, we first used c-Fos mapping to identify neural activity changes associated with stress-induced enhancement of unlearned fear. Our c-Fos screen identified the posterior paraventricular thalamus (pPVT) as a region that was persistently hyperactive after footshock stress and whose activity correlated with behavioral expression of SEFR. Using fiber photometry, we observed that SEFR, but not SEFL, was associated with increased activity in the pPVT. Next, we found that chemogenetic inhibition of the pPVT blocked both the induction of SEFR during stress and its later expression, while artificial stimulation of pPVT in stress-naive mice was sufficient to recapitulate SEFR. Interestingly, pPVT inhibition or stimulation did not affect acquisition or expression of SEFL.

In conclusion, our results indicate that sensitization of fear learning (SEFL) and sensitization of unlearned fear (SEFR) have distinct neural mechanisms. Our results identify pPVT hyperactivity as a mechanism for stress-induced sensitization of unlearned fear and highlight pPVT as a potential target for treating arousal and reactivity symptoms of trauma- and stressor-related disorders."
"Resting-state (RS) fMRI studies of Alzheimers diseases (AD) impact on brain function commonly use functional connectivity (FC), ignoring short-timescale network dynamics, captured by co-activation patterns (CAPs), shown to accurately classify transgenic rodents from the wild-type (WT). We acquired high temporal resolution RS-fMRI data in the TgF344-AD rat model at pre-plaque and plaque stages and delineated brain functional alterations using FC and CAPs. We also assessed plaque-stage blood amyloid levels and memory performance in the same animals and investigated the statistical relationship between pathological, RS-functional, and behavioral phenotypes. TgF344-AD (TG) rats had elevated blood amyloid levels, committed more working and reference memory errors and showed reduced hippocampal FC with the lateral cortical and default-mode-like network (DMLN) compared to WT at the plaque stage. They showed DMLN and hippocampal hyper- and hypo-activation at pre- and plaque stages respectively in multiple CAPs. While blood amyloid levels were explained better by plaque-stage, than pre-plaque stage, FC values and CAP activations, it was the pre-plaque stage, more than the plaque stage, CAP activations that accurately explained memory impairments. Our findings not only identify early signatures of AD in brain functional dynamics in this translational rat model but demonstrate their relevance for prognosis of memory deficits."
"Brain-computer interface (BCI) control enables direct communication between the brain and external devices. However, the accuracy of BCI control based on intentions inferred from unstable neural signals remains limited, even with data-driven approaches to tailor neural decoders. Here we propose a knowledge-driven framework for inferring human intentions, leveraging large language models (LLMs) that incorporate prior knowledge about human behavior and neural activity. We developed a neural decoder that integrates neural and oculomotor signals with contextual information using an LLM agent. Its feasibility was tested in a real-world BCI task involving interaction with a computer application. The LLM-based decoder achieved an average accuracy of 79% among participants whose neural signals were responsive (11 out of 20) in inferring the intention to select arbitrary posts in a social networking service. Ablation analyses revealed that the integration of contextual information, multimodal signals, and empirical knowledge is critical for decoding accuracy. This study demonstrates the feasibility of a neural decoding framework using an LLM, paving the way for improved performance in BCI-driven external device operation for individuals with disabilities.

"Pupillometry provides a non-invasive window into the mind and brain, particularly as a psychophysiological readout of autonomic and cognitive processes like arousal, attention, stress, and emotional states. Pupillometry research lacks a robust, standardized framework for data preprocessing, whereas in functional magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography, researchers have converged on tools such as fMRIPrep, EEGLAB and MNE-Python; these tools are considered the gold standard in the field. Many established pupillometry preprocessing packages and workflows fall short of serving the goal of enhancing reproducibility, especially since most existing solutions lack designs based on Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability (FAIR) principles. To promote FAIR and open science practices for pupillometry research, we developed eyeris, a complete pupillometry preprocessing suite designed to be intuitive, modular, performant, and extensible (https://github.com/shawntz/eyeris). Out-of-the-box, eyeris provides a recommended preprocessing workflow and considers signal processing best practices for tonic and phasic pupillometry. Moreover, eyeris further enables open and reproducible science workflows, as well as quality control workflows by following a well-established file management schema and generating interactive output reports for both record keeping/sharing and quality assurance of preprocessed pupil data prior to formal analysis. Taken together, eyeris provides a robust allin-one transparent and adaptive solution for high-fidelity pupillometry preprocessing with the aim of further improving reproducibility in pupillometry research."
"Alcohol use disorder (AUD) has severe adverse health and economic impacts totaling over $240 billion annually. Despite this, FDA approved treatments for AUD are limited. For this reason, further understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms in AUD is required for new treatments. An aspect of AUD involves deficits in behavioral flexibility that is similarly seen in animal models with depletion of dorsal striatal cholinergic interneurons (CINs). We found that acute EtOH (40 mM) inhibits the firing rate of dorsal striatal CINs, which are the primary source of acetylcholine (ACh) in the dorsal striatum. Additionally, we found through slice photometry recordings using an intensity-based ACh sensing fluorescent reporter (iAChSnFR) that acute EtOH (40 mM) inhibits dorsal striatal ACh release. In accord, in vivo fiber photometry with iAChSnFR also showed inhibition of ACh release following acute EtOH (2 g/kg ip). To induce EtOH dependence in mice, we used the chronic intermittent EtOH (CIE) vapor exposure model. Following CIE, we found that CIE-treated mice had a significant depression of ACh release compared to control mice in the dorsomedial but not dorsolateral striatum. Then, we performed stereological cell counts of CINs in CIE and control mice to examine the cause of this ACh deficit and found that CIE mice had a significant decrease in CINs in the dorsomedial but not dorsolateral striatum. In conclusion, our data show that EtOH inhibits dorsal striatal cholinergic signaling in a subregion specific manner that may contribute to AUD related behaviors."
"Dengue virus, and other viral pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 and Zika, utilize specialized glycoproteins to facilitate the fusion of its lipid membrane with that of the host cell, a critical step for viral entry and infection. This membrane fusion process is significantly influenced by factors such as host cell membrane lipid composition, membrane architecture, and cell surface receptors. However, the specific mechanisms by which dengue virus membrane fusion is modulated by the cell membrane lipids are not fully elucidated. We investigate the role of oxidised cholesterol metabolite, 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC) in inhibiting dengue virus infection using virus fusion and viral infection assays. We demonstrate that 25-HC significantly impedes the membrane fusion capability of the dengue virus, thereby inhibiting viral entry and infection in cell cultures. Apart from inhibiting membrane fusion, pre-exposure to 25-HC upregulates CH25H which inhibits virus growth. Indeed, CH25H gene is upregulated along with other ISGs in various cell types as a defence response to dengue virus infection. These insights into the modulation of dengue virus membrane fusion by lipid cofactors in the host cell membrane present a promising avenue for the development of strategies aimed at inhibiting viral membrane fusion, thereby potentially curtailing the spread of the infection. For example, we show that other inhibitors that target mechanisms distinct from 25-HC action on membrane fusion display strong positive synergy in virus inhibition with 25-HC."
"Non-crop plants surrounding large plantings of agricultural crops can provide numerous ecological services to adjacent agricultural plants but have rarely been considered as a source of microorganisms during the early stages of their growth. In this study we test whether agricultural plants in close proximity to surrounding woodland habitat fragments develop a denser microbiome than plants farther away, and whether the composition of the crop microbiomes more closely resembles the composition of the surrounding vegetation when in close proximity. During the early stages of development, we sampled epiphytic bacteria from corn and soybean leaves over 4 and 3 weekly sampling timepoints, respectively, using a spatially explicit design, and on the final timepoint for both host species we additionally sampled a younger cohort of leaves. To contextualize the source strength of the surrounding vegetation we also sampled the soil at each sampling location. Both crop species exhibited a microbiome density gradient and a decay of microbiome similarity to surrounding vegetation over a distance of 100 m from the field edges at many timepoints. Phyllosphere microbiome similarity to the soil also tended to increase into the field interior. The strength of host plant microbiome filtering also depended on the proximity to the surrounding vegetation, with intermediate to most distant locations exhibiting the highest values of host filtering, reflecting an apparent decrease in immigrant inoculum. The bacterial communities of younger leaves tended to more closely resemble those of the older surrounding conspecific leaves than either the soil or surrounding woodland vegetation, reflecting the growing dominance of inoculum from within developing crop canopies as plants grew. Overall, our study sheds light on the important role that dispersal of bacteria from nearby leaves can play in phyllosphere microbiome assembly and highlights the diminishing role that soil plays in assembly of phyllosphere microbiomes as plant sources are closer or more abundant."
"Ouantitative genetics methods can be particularly powerful in model organisms and non-human populations, and we now have strain collections such as recombinant inbred lines, etc. that can be phenotyped. Natural diversity is also valuable in non-model systems that do not yet have reverse genetic tools. However, purchasing and phenotyping large collections can be cost-prohibitive. Strain or sample acquisition costs may also vary dramatically for different strains or isolates. Thus, investigators need efficient strategies to optimize experimental power for a given limited budget. In this study, we evaluate several approaches to optimally select subsets of the total cohort to best maintain power when performing genome-wide association studies. Some approaches focus solely on costs, others on genetic diversity, and some on both simultaneously.

Through simulation studies across different minor allele frequencies and SNP effect sizes, we demonstrate that selecting for cost is most beneficial at low-to-moderate budget thresholds, while selecting for diversity is optimal in scenarios involving rare (MAF 5-10%) variants or higher total costs, or when accounting for additional costs per strain studied. We also evaluate these approaches on data from the Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel (HMDP), and find that an approach that considers both cost and diversity is superior at recovering significant loci and maintaining statistical power under real-world conditions. This approach picks the strains that, for a given budget, minimize the total genetic distance to the strains that were not selected. This approach, which we term ""ThriftyMD"" (for ""Thrifty Minimum Distance""), extends previous distance-based methods to pick a representative panel by explicitly adding a cost constraint.

Overall, our results highlight the trade-offs between cost, diversity, and power in GWAS cohort design, and present the ThriftyMD algorithm as a versatile and robust approach for optimizing study design in resource-limited settings."
"Emerging biochemical data require effective pathway visualization. However, traditional metabolic maps were based on manual layouts, falling behind new scientific discoveries. Automated visualization of metabolic pathways has been investigated heavily, but resulted in few consensuses. We report here a new approach based on circularized van Krevelen diagram. This method is based on chemical principles, providing the consistency critical for community exchanges and collaborations. Example applications include metabolomics data interpretation and a new set of metabolic maps."
"Understanding gene expression dynamics requires resolving newly synthesized RNAs from pre-existing pools at single-cell resolution. Here, we present scNT-seq2, a highly sensitive and scalable method for time-resolved single-cell RNA sequencing. By systematically optimizing the second-strand cDNA synthesis (2nd SS) step, we substantially improved read alignment rates, reduced background mutations, and enhanced library complexity compared to the original scNT-seq 1. Benchmarking in 4sU-labeled K562 cells demonstrated that scNT-seq2 accurately quantifies newly synthesized transcripts and preserves the gene level RNA turnover. The enhanced sensitivity enables robust detection of dynamic, cell-cycle state specific genes, such as S-phase regulators. Together, scNT-seq2 provides an efficient and versatile tool for dissecting transcriptional dynamics across diverse biological systems at single-cell resolution."
"Over-activation of the complement system is strongly associated with geographic atrophy (GA), a late-stage form of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and major cause of blindness. Here we report the development of a candidate GA treatment that is a potent complement modifier (mini-CR1) that addresses consequences of complement over-activation including membrane attack complex (MAC) formation. Mini-CR1 acts a potent cofactor for factor I driven proteolysis of C3b leading to iC3b and then C3dg formation; iC3b itself remains a potent opsonin. As well as inhibiting the alternative complement pathway, mini-CR1 acts as a cofactor for C4b degradation thereby inhibiting the classical pathway. Mini-CR1 prevents MAC formation in activated human serum with an IC50 of 125 nM. Mini-CR1 was shown to cross human Bruchs membrane ex vivo, implying the ability to cross into the choroidal space. Transduction of RPE cell lines with rAAV2-mini-CR1 (CTx001) resulted in dose-dependent transcription, and both basolateral and apical secretion of mini-CR1 by monolayers of human iPSC derived RPE cells. Mini-CR1 transduction of ARPE19 cells resulted in increased consumption of C3b and iC3b1 in activated culture media and decreased MAC formation on the cell surfaces. Subretinal injection of CTx001 in rats resulted in dose-dependent mini-CR1 production as demonstrated by solid-phase immunoassay. MAC formation following laser induced CNV in a rat model was reduced by 75% in CTx001-treated animals relative to null vector (p<0.01). This first generation of CTx001 represents a potent single administration complement modifier capable of effectively addressing pathologic complement amplification in the retina/choroid."
"IntroductionNeuropathic pain is a debilitating condition highly prevalent worldwide. One of the main factors related to its development is poor nutrition and micronutrient deficiency in the diet. Essential metals, especially divalent ions as zinc, play crucial roles in the neurobiology of the nervous system, including pain signaling and transmission mechanisms, and metabolism control. The present study aimed to understand the impact of zinc in neuropathic pain, evaluating whether restriction and direct repletion of a dietary zinc could change nociceptive behavior and metabolic parameters in adult mice.

MethodsAdult male Swiss mice received a zinc-restricted diet for eight weeks. The repletion group received the restricted diet for four weeks followed by normal zinc diet for another four weeks. Mechanical and heat thermal pain sensitivity were assessed using the von Frey filaments and Hargreaves tests, respectively.

ResultsZinc restriction resulted in decreased body weight gain and led to an increased mechanical and thermal sensitivity to heat. Dietary zinc repletion reversed the thermal allodynia and increased weight gain, abdominal adipose tissue, and liver weight compared to a normal zinc diet. No changes were observed concerning food and water intake, glycemic profile, pancreatic morphology and plasma amylin,

ConclusionsThe reduction in the bioavailability of dietary zinc promotes metabolic and nociceptive changes in adult mice, inducing allodynia characteristic of neuropathic pain."
"A significant proportion of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) cases exhibit a substantial copy number expansion of the hexanucleotide GGGGCC/GGCCCC sequence in the C9ORF72 gene. The GGGGCC sequence forms a non-canonical DNA structure called a G-quadruplex (G4) which has been associated with the disease states and with nucleic acid condensate formation, but there remains poor understanding of why the hexanucleotide repeat expansion occurs. An important clue may lie in the thermodynamic properties of various G4 configurations. Here, we use temperature-swept CD spectroscopy to observe configurational homogenization of an initially heterogeneous population of G4s over a small range of temperatures, demonstrating phase transition-like behavior. We further show that this reaction is irreversible, suggesting that the metastable non-parallel G4s are trapped over long timescales by a transition state barrier; upon heating, the relative height of the free energy barrier is lowered, and a thermally activated metastable-to-stable transition to parallel G4s rapidly occurs. We provide an analytical theory based on a two-state thermodynamic model which offers mechanistic insight into the experimental evidence. These findings suggest that kinetic regulation of non-canonical DNA structures may play a role in cellular homeostasis or disease pathogenesis."
"The caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD) mediates protein-protein interactions in apoptotic and inflammatory signaling pathways. In humans, more than 30 proteins contain a CARD, several of which have been reported to polymerize into helical filaments. Here we found that the CARD from the apoptotic protease caspase-9 (C9CARD) self assembles into filaments in vitro at physiological pH and salt concentrations. The C9CARD more readily polymerizes under low-salt or mildly acidic conditions, suggesting a significant role for electrostatic interactions in mediating filament formation. Using NMR spectroscopy, we determined the pKa of the lone histidine residue, H38, which supports a role for histidine protonation in enhancing filament formation. Indeed, mutation of H38 to introduce a positive (H38R) or negative (H38D) charge, or to remove the pH-dependence of the side chain at this site altogether (H38N), dramatically alters the filament propensity of the domain. Using cryo-election microscopy, we determined 3.4- and 3.2-[A] structures of the wild-type and H38R C9CARD filaments, respectively, which provide new insights into the molecular basis of C9CARD polymerization and its pH dependence via H38."
"Pharmaceuticals are increasingly recognized as contaminants of concern in aquatic environments. Sitagliptin, an antidiabetic drug that carries a trifluoromethyl group, which is a precursor of the persistent trifluoroacetic acid, is excreted largely unmetabolized and inefficiently removed in wastewater treatment plants, leading to its widespread detection in surface waters. The hyporheic zone -- a region between surface water and groundwater -- serves as a natural bioreactor with high microbial activity and diverse redox conditions, offering the potential for sitagliptin attenuation. This study explored the biotransformation of sitagliptin in hyporheic sediments under varying redox conditions through batch experiments and field observations. Furthermore, we showed that batch experiments can complement field observations to capture both mechanistic insights and their environmental relevance. Batch experiments revealed amide hydrolysis and N-acetylation of sitagliptin under anoxic conditions, with subsequent deamination and oxidation of transformation products under oxic conditions. Metagenome-resolved metaproteomics suggested Pseudomonas asiatica as a key player in the oxic transformation. Field analysis of pore water samples identified up to 6.47 {micro}g L-{superscript 1} sitagliptin and ten transformation products with concentrations of up to 4.82 {micro}g L-{superscript 1}. Amide hydrolysis products were the most abundant transformation products and preferentially formed under anoxic conditions. All investigated transformation products exhibited lower cytotoxicity and oxidative stress response than sitagliptin in in vitro bioassays, highlighting the detoxification potential of the hyporheic zone. By identifying conditions that promote sitagliptin transformation and characterizing its transformation products toxicologically, our work provides parameters for enhanced sitagliptin removal in aquatic environments and improved risk assessment of fluorinated trace organic contaminants.

"Subtle changes in protein sequence can equate to large changes in function, such as enabling pathogens to evade the immune system, hindering antibody recognition of antigens, or conferring antibiotic resistance. Even single amino acid substitutions may alter ligand binding affinity, enzymatic activity, and protein stability. Yet, due to limitations in time and resources, proteins closely related in sequence to those already characterized often remain unexamined. AlphaFold has emerged as a promising tool for protein structure prediction, though its utility in modeling single amino acid substitutions remains uncertain. In this study, we assessed AlphaFold 3s accuracy in modeling natural variants of the Helicobacter pylori catalase KatA by comparing its predictions to a novel high-resolution crystal structure of KatA from strain SS1. This variant contains key substitutions at residues 234, 237, 255, and 421 relative to the well-characterized strain 26695. AlphaFold 3 models accurately reproduced the global structure and local conformations of most variant residues, with high fidelity in conservative substitutions but variable accuracy in more flexible or interface-exposed sites. We further explored how user inputs, such as incorrect oligomeric states or sequence modifications, influence prediction quality. While AlphaFold 3 consistently produced high-quality models, deviations at variant sites occurred when incorrect oligomeric states were specified. Our findings highlight both the strengths and limitations of AlphaFold 3 in modeling natural protein variants and underscore the importance of accurate user input for reliable structural predictions.

ImportanceExperimental structure determination is rarely performed for natural protein variants possessing only minor amino acid differences from published structures, even though small substitutions can significantly impact structure and function. Here, we present a case study showing that AlphaFold 3 can accurately model the structures of natural protein variants. However, providing an incorrect oligomeric state can reduce model accuracy--an error that non-expert users may easily make."
"The successful establishment of infection relies on an ability to sense and adapt to the host signaling state. One key mechanism of virus-host sensing is host-mediated post-translational modifications of viral proteins. While viral protein phosphorylation by host kinases is known to modulate viral functions, the global prevalence of kinase motifs across diverse viruses, and the signaling pathways they reflect, remains to be systematically explored. Here, we annotated human kinase motifs in 1,505 viral proteomes and uncovered enriched motifs in viral proteins that diverged from patterns observed in human proteins. Integration of our findings with 21,606 viral protein structures and deep mass spectrometry phosphoproteomics of infected human cells revealed that surface-accessible residues were preferentially phosphorylated and exhibited greater kinase specificity compared to buried sites. Virus-enriched motifs mapped predominantly to stress, inflammation, and cell cycle pathways--key signaling hubs dysregulated during infection that are central to the virus-host arms race--most strikingly for Flaviviridae, Togaviridae, Herpesviridae, and Retroviridae families. Temporal phosphoproteomic profiling of host kinase activity during alphavirus infection revealed dynamic patterns of stress kinase activation and viral protein phosphorylation, and the inhibition of MAP kinases reduced viral replication and phosphorylation at viral motifs with specificity for ERK and JNK kinases. Our findings suggest that viruses have evolved as biosensors of the host signaling state to optimize their life cycles, revealing new antiviral opportunities aimed at disrupting virus decision-making by manipulating host signaling cues."
"Mycoplasma cynos and Mycoplasma felis are important respiratory pathogens in dogs and cats. Due to the challenges of culturing these fastidious bacteria, little is known about their antimicrobial susceptibility or mechanisms of pathogenicity. Treatment is typically empirical, as in vitro antimicrobial activity has not been evaluated, and therapeutic efficacy remains unclear. This study aimed to assess in vitro susceptibility and identify genetic markers of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and virulence in M. cynos and M. felis clinical isolates. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for doxycycline, tetracycline, minocycline, enrofloxacin, marbofloxacin, and azithromycin were determined using a broth microdilution assay developed for this study. Hybrid genomes were generated using Oxford Nanopore and Illumina sequencing. AMR-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the gyrA gene correlated with high MICs to enrofloxacin and marbofloxacin in both species. Mutations in 23S rRNA were associated with reduced susceptibility to azithromycin. In M. felis, novel variants in gyrA and the 50S ribosomal protein L4 were linked to decreased susceptibility to fluoroquinolones and azithromycin, respectively. The data also suggest potential intrinsic resistance to azithromycin in M. felis. All isolates required low MICs of tetracyclines, and resistance mutations were not identified in the 16S rRNA gene, supporting tetracyclines as effective first-line treatment options. Virulence genes, particularly those associated with adhesion and immune evasion, were detected in both M. cynos and M. felis. This study presents the first comprehensive genomic and phenotypic analysis of AMR and virulence in M. cynos and M. felis, providing new insights into their pathogenicity and informing evidence-based therapeutic strategies."
"Cannabis use is prevalent among individuals living with HIV in the United States, but the impact of cannabis exposure on the reservoir of latently infected cells that persists during antiretroviral therapy (ART) remains unclear. To address this gap, we analyzed the effect of {Delta}-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) on primary CD4 T cells that were latently infected with HIV. We found that THC had no detectable effect on baseline or latency reversing agent (LRA) stimulated HIV expression, or on expression of an activation marker (CD38). However, using an integrated multiomic single-cell analysis of genome-wide chromatin accessibility and gene expression, we observed altered expression of several hundred genes in HIV infected CD4 T cells after THC exposure, including transcriptional downregulation of genes involved in protein translation and antiviral pathways, indicating that THC suppresses innate immune activation in infected cells. Additionally, chromatin accessibility analysis demonstrated upregulated chromatin binding activity for the transcriptional regulator CTCF, and reduced activity for members of the ETS transcription factor family in infected cells after THC exposure. These findings provide insights into the mechanisms by which cannabis use could influence the persistence of HIV within cellular reservoirs and the molecular phenotype of latently infected cells. Further elucidation of the underlying mechanisms involved in THC-mediated changes to HIV infected cells, will lead to an improved understanding of the impact of cannabis use on the HIV reservoir.

ImportanceCannabis use is common among individuals living with HIV, but the long-term effects of cannabis use on the HIV reservoir are not yet studied completely. We employed advanced single-cell technologies to reveal how cannabis components, specifically THC, influence HIV-infected immune cells and their pattern of gene expression. We found that, while THC doesnt reactivate virus in latently infected cells, it alters the molecular characteristics of these infected immune cells. These findings are important because they underscore how cannabis could regulate persistent infection in people living with HIV. Understanding these cellular changes in response to THC could be helpful for successful treatment for people living with HIV."
"Several studies have described human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived ureteric epithelium, which in the embryo arises from the nephric duct and forms the collecting ducts of the kidney. However, hPSC-derived distal nephron epithelium can also adopt a ureteric phenotype, despite this not occurring during embryogenesis. In this study, RETtdTomato and GATA3mCherry reporter lines were used to further investigate this plasticity. Induction of anterior intermediate mesoderm resulted in the spontaneous formation of an epithelial plexus with a nephric duct-like identity. Subsequent addition of RSPO1 induced patterning of distalized nephrons, including distal convoluted tubule and thick ascending limb of loop of Henle but lacking proximal segments or glomeruli. This epithelium showed a capacity to adopt ureteric epithelial or nephric duct-like states in ex vivo co-culture in response to external cues. The same epithelium seeded as single cells in Matrigel formed epithelial spheroids and adopted a RET+ ureteric tip identity. This in vitro continuum between nephric duct, ureteric epithelium and distal nephron illustrates the role of the microenvironment in cellular identity.

"Information about the environment can, in some cases, be transmitted to an organisms offspring by epigenetic inheritance. Here, we describe a novel form of epigenetics in C. elegans where information is transmitted between generations not by alterations in DNA, chromatin, or RNA, but by changes in the composition of lipids. Specifically, we delineate an environment-to-neuron-to-intestine-to-oocyte signalling axis that alters progeny thermotolerance by remodelling lipid provisioning to oocytes when animals detect social pheromones. Intergenerational information transmission via  lipid memories may represent an underappreciated form of epigenetics."
"Sexual reproduction is a central tenet of the eukaryotic life cycle, essential for the long-term survival of a species. Sex promotes genetic diversity and facilitates natural selection, and in eukaryotes such as unicellular fungi, sexual reproduction leads to hyphal growth and spore production, enabling escape from harsh environments and long-distance dispersal. The human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus species complex (encompassing C. neoformans, C. deneoformans, and the C. gattii sub-complexes) exhibit diversity in sexual reproduction, including -a mating, pseudosexual reproduction, as well as unisexual reproduction initiated from a single isolate or between isolates of the same mating type. A central conundrum is that while most Cryptococcus natural populations exhibit significant  mating type bias, genetic and genomic analyses show recombination occurs in nature. The discovery of unisexual reproduction in C. deneoformans provided insight; however, thus far unisexual reproduction has never been observed in the predominant global pathogenic species C. neoformans. Here, we provide evidence that mutating the RIC8 gene, which encodes a conserved guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) involved in activation of G proteins, enables unisexual reproduction in C. neoformans. Additionally, we show that genetic variation in the natural population promotes unisexual reproduction, and unisexual reproduction in C. neoformans shares similarities with that in C. deneoformans and involves canonical meiotic recombination. Finally, our data suggest that Ric8 interacts with Gpa1 and Gpa2 during -a mating, but the localization of these G proteins is not influenced by Ric8 during unisexual reproduction. This suggests differential regulation of the G proteins, likely involving the Ric8 protein, could underly switch between different modes of sexual reproduction in Cryptococcus. Our study further highlights that the highly conserved Ric8 GEF can act as an important regulator of cellular development in response to environmental stimuli and modulates sexual reproduction in nature. We hypothesize that unisexual reproduction occurs much more frequently in nature than currently appreciated, and possibly in other fungal species as well."
"Salmonella outbreaks have repeatedly been associated with muskmelons. This fruit poses a food safety risk due to its growth on the soil surface and because it is eaten raw. To identify genes under selection in S. enterica growing in this food matrix, barcoded transposon mutant libraries in three serovars of Salmonella, Typhimurium, Enteritidis, and Newport, were screened for survival and growth on muskmelon. The role of selected genes was subsequently verified in competition assays. Genes whose disruption caused a fitness effect in all three serovars were enriched for functions related to RNA degradation and ribosome biogenesis. The polyribonucleotide nucleotidyltransferase gene, pnp, and the D-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase gene, serA, conferred an advantage when growing in muskmelon but not in a nutrition-rich control environment. This study provides a rare insight into genome-wide adaptation mechanisms of multiple Salmonella serovars to growth on food matrices, exemplified by muskmelons."
"Many commercial desalting products exist for pre-MS peptide cleanup, although few exist that can handle the high protein input ([&ge;] 4 mg) required for phosphotyrosine enrichment. For these desalting products, the technical aptitude required for effective and organized desalting is often a barrier to entry for new users. Here, we evaluate four commercially available desalting techniques with varying degrees of automation, operational organization, and chemistries to determine the most cost-effective, user-friendly, and sensitive technique for protein profiling and phosphotyrosine (pY) enrichment. We find that TECAN Narrow Bore Extraction (NBE) products are the most cost effective per sample and least difficult to use, whereas ProtiFis S-Trap are the most expensive per sample and Pierce C18 spin columns have the worst operational organization. ProtiFi S-Trap vastly outperforms other desalting methods for peptide sequencing and protein profiling applications, uniquely identifying 25,654 unique peptide sequences and 375 unique proteins. Consistently, ProtiFi S-Trap samples show the deepest pY sequencing after Src SH2 superbinder enrichment, leading to the highest identification of significantly changing, biologically relevant pY sites in a Jurkat T cell signalling model. Our data show that ProtiFi S-Trap columns provide high peptide recovery, thus increasing meaningful pY site identification.

"Background and AimThe Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Domain (EGFR-TKD) plays a key role in regulating cell growth and is closely linked to cancer progression. In this study, we set out to produce, purify, and crystallize recombinant EGFR-TKD in order to create a solid foundation for future drug screening and structure-based research.

Materials and MethodsWe used pET28a(+) plasmid and expressed EGFR-TKD in Escherichia coli. At first, most of the protein ended up in inclusion bodies, but with the help of sarcosyl, we were able to solubilize it effectively. To improve the amount and quality of the protein, we optimized several expression conditions, including temperature, inducer concentration, and induction time. The purification process included size-exclusion chromatography and a reverse affinity step to remove the SUMO tag, resulting in protein suitable for crystallization

ResultsFollowing successful optimization, soluble EGFR-TKD was obtained, and initial crystals were successfully grown under defined conditions. These crystals represent a promising starting point for drug screening applications, providing a structural platform that can be further refined to support the discovery and development of novel EGFR inhibitors.

ConclusionThis study presents an effective strategy for the production, purification, and initial crystallization of recombinant EGFR-TKD. The established workflow lays a solid foundation for future drug screening efforts and structural investigations targeting EGFR."
"Methanogenic archaea contribute 1-2 Gt of methane annually, impacting both global carbon cycling and climate. Central to their energy metabolism is a membrane-bound, sodium-translocating methyltransferase complex: the N-tetrahydromethanopterin:CoM-S-methyltransferase (Mtr complex), which catalyzes the methyl transfer between two methanogen specific cofactors. This exergonic methyl transfer step is coupled with a vectorial sodium ion transport from the cytoplasm to the cell exterior and is the only energy conserving step in hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. Here, we present a 2.1 [A] single-particle cryo-EM structure of the full Mtr complex from Methanosarcina mazei. Our structural model encompasses the entire complex, reveals the arrangement of archaeal phospholipids, the architecture of the sodium ion binding site, and the structure and interactions of all catalytic subunits. Most strikingly, we discover and characterize MtrI, a previously unannotated small open reading frame (small ORF), encoded protein (<100 aa) conserved across the order of Methanosarcinales. MtrI binds to the cytoplasmic domain of MtrA in response to oxygen exposure, suggesting a role in oxygen stress response and protection. By binding on top of the sodium channel and anchoring to the cobamide cofactor in MtrAs cytoplasmic domain, MtrI might prevent sodium leakage and inhibit MtrA-CoM turnover. These findings offer new insights into methanogen energy conservation and uncover a potential adaptive response to oxygen exposure, expanding our understanding of methanogen survival strategies under oxidative stress."
"Tau aggregates are the defining feature of multiple neurodegenerative diseases and contribute to the pathology of disease. However, the molecules affecting tau aggregation in cells are unclear. We previously determined that polyserine-rich domain containing proteins enrich in tau aggregates, assemble into puncta that can serve as sites of tau aggregation, and exacerbate tau aggregation in cells and mice. Herein, we show that polyserine domains are sufficient to define assemblies as sites of tau aggregation, in part, through localization of tau seeds. Purified polyserine self-assembles and directly interacts with monomeric and fibrillar tau. Moreover, polyserine-tau assemblies recruit RNA, leading to faster rates of tau fibrillization in vitro. Using polyserine variants, we found that enrichment in tau aggregates and stimulation of tau aggregation are separable functions of polyserine domains, with polyserine self-assembly stimulating tau aggregation. Together, our results show that polyserine self-assembles and directly interacts with tau to form preferred sites of tau aggregation."
"The human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 tyrosine kinase domain (HER2-TKD) plays a central role in signal transduction and is a significant therapeutic target in cancer. This study aimed to produce soluble recombinant HER2-TKD in Escherichia coli to enable structural studies for drug screening applications. The HER2-TKD gene was cloned into the pET28a(+) expression vector and expressed in E. coli. Initial expression led to the formation of inclusion bodies; thus, sarcosyl was used to solubilize the aggregated protein. Several induction durations were tested to optimize soluble expression. SDS-PAGE analysis was used to monitor expression and solubilization efficiency. The recombinant protein was purified using size-exclusion chromatography and reverse affinity chromatography to remove the SUMO tag. Crystallization trials were initiated using commercial screens to obtain diffraction-quality crystals. Soluble HER2-TKD was successfully obtained after optimization of induction and solubilization conditions. Crystallization efforts are ongoing to improve crystal quality for future structural analysis. These results provide a foundation for structure-based drug discovery studies targeting HER2."
"Mammalian H1 linker histones comprise a group of 11 non-allelic variants which have key roles in modulating chromatin. H1 variant specific genomic distribution contributes to fine tuning regulation of gene expression and chromatin architecture. Contradictory reports on the presence and role of H1 histones at centromeres led us to further investigate whether H1s impact centromeric chromatin. In this study, we focused on H1.5 and by in vitro assays we showed that H1.5 directly interacts with centromeric-protein A (CENP-A) mononucleosomes. Notably, our in vitro findings revealed that H1 variants H1.0 and H1.2 can also bind CENP-A nucleosomes, although with differing affinities and signatures, asserting centromeric localization may not be unique to H1.5. In human cells, H1.5 localized to the centromere and chromatin immuno-precipitation revealed an interaction between H1.5 with CENP-A nucleosomes. Knocking down of H1.5 resulted in the loss of centromeric -satellite transcription, reduction in loading of new CENP-A, and the accumulation of mitotic defects. These data point to an unreported role for histone H1 in the regulation of mitotic integrity in human cells.

When H1.5 is bound to the CENP-A nucleosomes at the centromere, the centromeric chromatin allows RNAPII based transcription to generate -satellite transcripts, which in turn allows for de novo CENP-A loading. The absence of H1.5 blocks this transcription, leading to an accumulation of mitotic defects.

"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2 has led to the emergence of numerous variants with enhanced transmissibility and immune evasion. Despite widespread vaccination, infections persist, and the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 reprograms host metabolism remain incompletely understood. Here, we investigated whether virus-induced lipid remodeling is conserved across variants and whether changes in lipid abundance correlate with alterations in lipid biosynthetic enzymes. Using global untargeted lipidomics and quantitative proteomics, we analyzed A549-ACE2 cells infected with the Delta (B.1.617.2) or Omicron (B.1.1.529) variants and compared them to cells infected with the ancestral WA1 strain. In parallel, we conducted quantitative proteomics to assess virus-induced changes in the host proteome. Our results reveal that SARS-CoV-2 drives a remarkably consistent pattern of metabolic rewiring at both the lipidomic and proteomic levels across all three variants. We mapped changes in the expression of host metabolic enzymes and compared these to corresponding shifts in lipid abundance. This integrative analysis identified key host proteins involved in virus-mediated lipid remodeling, including fatty acid synthase (FASN), lysosomal acid lipase (LIPA), and ORM1-like protein 2 (ORMDL2). Together, these findings highlight conserved metabolic dependencies of SARS-CoV-2 variants and underscore host lipid metabolism as a potential target for broad-spectrum antiviral strategies."
"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a monogenic neurodegenerative disorder caused by decreased levels of Survival of Motor Neuron (SMN) protein. If left untreated, SMA patients have a poor prognosis, marked by the degeneration of motor neurons, progressive muscle weakness and atrophy. The approval of SMN-restoring therapies that improve symptoms and lifespan in patients with SMA has created emerging, non-neuronal phenotypes and an urgent need for deepening our understanding of disease pathogenesis.

Leveraging the knowledge that SMN loss drives alterations in translation, we used multiple tissues from a mouse model of SMA to uncover early translational alterations in key mRNAs and proteins, which act as contributors to pathogenesis and hallmarks of the disease. Among hundreds of differentially translated mRNAs, Col1a1 emerged as a translation-specific manifestation of early defects in the mouse model. These findings were confirmed in fibroblasts derived from patients with varying levels of disease severity. Notably, treatment with SMN-restoring therapies rescued COL1A1 protein levels, particularly in fibroblasts from patients with the most severe forms of the disease.

Overall, our study identifies COL1A1 as an indicator of disease severity in SMA, which captures early molecular alterations and respond to SMN-modifying therapies."
"Clinical studies have suggested that restoring a sufficient mass of functional {beta} cells can provide an effective treatment option for diabetes, however, it remains unclear whether this can be achieved through pharmacological stimulation of endogenous {beta}-cell proliferation. We demonstrate here that ectopic expression of a constitutively active form of Kras (KrasG12D) exclusively in pancreatic endocrine cells suppresses {beta}-cell proliferation, resulting in a dramatic reduction in {beta}-cell numbers and islet size. Conversely, we demonstrate that the potent and selective SOS1-RAS interaction inhibitor BI-3406 promotes unprecedented levels of {beta}-cell proliferation in primary human islets, both in culture and following transplantation in immunocompromised diabetic mice. Importantly, using murine models of streptozotocin-induced diabetes, we show that BI-3406 treatment restores {beta}-cell mass, leading to a gradual normalization of blood glucose and insulin levels, as well as to sustainable improvement in glucose tolerance. Our data provide the first pre-clinical evidence of an orally bioavailable KRAS inhibitor that can directly induce {beta}-cell regeneration."
"Genomes assume a complex 3D architecture in the interphase cell nucleus. Yet, the molecular mechanisms that determine global genome architecture are only poorly understood. To identify mechanisms of higher order genome organization, we performed high-throughput imaging-based CRISPR knockout screens targeting 1064 genes encoding nuclear proteins in human cell lines. We assessed changes in the distribution of centromeres at single cell resolution as surrogate markers for global genome organization. The screens revealed multiple major regulators of spatial distribution of centromeres including components of the nucleolus, kinetochore, cohesins, condensins, and the nuclear pore complex. Alterations in centromere distribution required progression through the cell cycle and acute depletion of mitotic factors with distinct functions altered centromere distribution in the subsequent interphase. These results identify molecular determinants of spatial centromere organization, and they show that orderly progression through mitosis shapes interphase genome architecture."
"Decoding the complexities of signaling pathways is fundamental for deciphering the mechanisms underlying tissue development, homeostasis, and disease pathogenesis. Proximity labeling tools have been instrumental in identifying upstream or downstream effectors of specific proteins within signaling pathways. However, currently, there are no tools available to directly label and capture intermediary proteins that bridge two non-interacting proteins. Here, we developed STUPPIT (Split-TurboID and PUP-IT based Protein Identification Tool), a novel method combining split-TurboID and PUP-IT to biotinylate intermediary proteins of two non-interacting proteins through a two-step enzymatic reaction. Two approaches of STUPPIT were validated using three well-characterized protein triad, including YAP1/AMOT/{beta}-actin, YAP1/LATS1/MOB1A, and {beta}-catenin/-catenin/{beta}-actin. Combining STUPPIT and proteomics, we identified novel intermediary proteins including RNF20, ERC1, USP7 and TRIM33, which interact both with {beta}-catenin and SMAD4, key components of the Wnt and BMP signaling pathways. In conclusion, STUPPIT represents a powerful tool for labeling and capturing intermediary proteins between non-interacting partners, offering new insights into protein-protein interactions and advancing signal transduction research."
"The Greatwall kinase inhibits PP2A-B55 phosphatase activity during mitosis to stabilise critical Cdk1-driven mitotic phosphorylation. Although Greatwall represents a potential oncogene and prospective therapeutic target, our understanding of cellular and molecular consequences of chemical Greatwall inactivation remains limited. To address this, we introduce C-604, a highly selective Greatwall inhibitor, and characterise both immediate and long-term cellular responses to the chemical attenuation of Greatwall activity. We demonstrate that Greatwall inhibition causes systemic destabilisation of the mitotic phosphoproteome, premature mitotic exit and pleiotropic cellular pathologies. Importantly, we demonstrate that the cellular and molecular abnormalities linked to reduced Greatwall activity are specifically dependent on the B55 isoform rather than other B55 variants, underscoring PP2A-B55 phosphatases as key mediators of cytotoxic effects of Greatwall-targeting agents in human cells. Additionally, we show that sensitivity to Greatwall inhibition varies in different cell line models and that dependency on Greatwall activity reflects the balance between Greatwall and B55 expression levels. Our findings highlight Greatwall dependency as a cell-specific vulnerability and propose the B55-to-Greatwall expression ratio as a predictive biomarker of cellular responses to Greatwall-targeted therapeutics."
"Protamines play a crucial role in nuclear condensation during spermiogenesis, a process that involves significant chromatin remodeling and the replacement of histones. While much research has focused on the function of protamines in sperm development and fertility, their effects in non-sperm cells remain largely unexplored. In this study, we investigated the impact of overexpressing murine and human protamine 1 and 2 (PRM1 and PRM2) on nuclear architecture, histone eviction, DNA methylation, and transcription in HEK293T cells and mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). Overexpression of protamines resulted in nuclear condensation; particularly PRM1 showed notable enrichment in nucleoli, and cells exhibited cell cycle abnormalities. Immunofluorescence staining indicated a significant reduction in specific histone modifications (H3K9me3, H3K4me1, and H3K27Ac) in response to protamine expression, especially in MSCs. Interestingly, despite these changes in nuclear organization, the methylome remained largely stable. However, expression of protamines significantly diminished transcription, particularly of the ribosomal genes, upon PRM1 expression. Our studies indicate that PRM1 and PRM2 condense distinct genomic regions in somatic cells, resulting in widespread silencing of gene expression."
"For a long time, forgetting has been taken as the dissipation of the neural memory traces (engrams). However, recent engram research in mice suggests that the engrams of forgotten memories do persist. This raises the question of whether engrams underlying human episodic memories also persist despite forgetting? And do forgotten memories influence human behavior implicitly? To address this question, 40 men and women learned 96 face-object pairs. Using high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging at 7 Tesla we mapped the fate of the 96 memories at the systems level from learning to a 30-minute and onward to a 24-hour memory test. Upon each retrieval attempt, participants indicated whether they remembered or forgot the memory. Univariate and multivariate analyses of the functional brain data revealed that the engrams of forgotten memories remain implemented in the episodic memory network and continue to influence the accuracy of guessing responses at test. Overnight, the engrams of forgotten memories became implemented more deeply within bilateral hippocampus, while consciously accessible memories were neocorticalized overnight. The engrams of both consciously accessible and inaccessible (forgotten) memories were shifted from the 30-minute to the 24-hour retrieval within the right hippocampus and anterior cingulate gyrus such that pattern dissimilarities supported the correct retrieval responses at 24 hours. This is evidence that forgotten human episodic memories remain implemented in the episodic memory network and continue to influence human behavior implicitly."

"The human brain can effortlessly extract a familiar faces age, gender, and identity despite dramatic changes in appearance, such as head orientation, lighting, or expression. Yet, the spatiotemporal dynamics underlying this ability, and how they depend on task demands, remain unclear. Here, we used multivariate decoding of magnetoencephalography (MEG) responses and source localization to characterize the emergence of invariant face representations. Human participants viewed natural images of highly familiar celebrities that systematically varied in viewpoint, gender, and age, while performing a one-back task on the identity or the image. Time-resolved decoding revealed that identity information emerged rapidly and became increasingly invariant to viewpoint over time. We observed a temporal hierarchy: view-specific identity information appeared at 64 ms, followed by mirror-invariant representations at 75 ms and fully view-invariant identity at 89 ms. Identity-invariant age and gender information emerged around the same time as view-invariant identity. Task demands modulated only late-stage identity and gender representations, suggesting that early face processing is predominantly feedforward. Source localization at peak decoding times showed consistent involvement of the occipital face area (OFA) and fusiform face area (FFA), with stronger identity and age signals than gender. Our findings reveal the spatiotemporal dynamics by which the brain extracts view-invariant identity from familiar faces, suggest that age and gender are processed in parallel, and show that task demands modulate later processing stages. Together, these results offer new constraints on computational models of face perception."
"Brain regions devoted to instinctual behaviors, including the vertebrate hypothalamus and arthropod cerebrum, contain bespoke neural circuits dedicated to perceptual and internal regulation of many behavioral states. These circuits are usually complex in structure and contain an extensive diversity of cell types. The regulatory mechanisms that pattern circuits for instinctual behaviors have been challenging to elucidate. Here, we developed methods in Drosophila to transcriptionally profile identified neuronal stem cell lineages in the cerebrum. We applied this method to lineages that generate sex-differentiated neurons with known circuit roles. We identified 91 transcription factors that, in combinations of 6-8, delineate cerebral hemilineages - classes of postmitotic neurons born from the same stem cell and sharing Notch status. Hemilineages comprise the major anatomic classes in the cerebrum and these transcription factors are required to generate their gross features. We further identified 33 transcription factors characteristic of neuronal birth order within lineages; these subtly differentiate neuronal subtypes to provide common computational modules to circuits regulating different behaviors. Our findings suggest that hemilineage and birth order transcription factors operate in a hierarchical system to build, diversify, and sexually differentiate lineally-related neurons that compose complex instinctual circuits."
"The ability to think creatively is fundamental to human cognition, shaping how we interact with the world and navigate complex problems. Creativity depends on the interaction of multiple large-scale brain networks, but how these networks represent creative thought and distinguish it from other cognitive states remains unclear. Here, we use invasive intracranial recordings in the human brain to explore the network-level representations underlying creative thinking. Our results demonstrate that cortical networks in the human brain differentially encode distinct cognitive states: we found unique brain states underlying creative thinking vs. arithmetic calculations, particularly in the default mode network. Further, in the dorsal attention network, we uncovered nonlinear, high-dimensional representations of moment-by-moment fluctuations in creative performance. These representations define a neural creativity axis shared between network-level and single-neuron computations. Our findings reveal widespread neural representations of cognitive state and suggest distinct roles of specific cortical networks in controlling creativity, with the default mode network gating access to creative states and the dorsal attention network regulating the quality of creative output."
"The Allen Human Brain Atlas has been a tremendously impactful resource in neuroimaging. The usefulness of this resource in neuroimaging arises from spatial coordinates of dissected tissue samples being provided in relation to a Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI)-space standard brain template, thereby allowing for the integration of gene expression and spatially standardized neuroimaging data. In fact, two previous sets of spatial coordinates exist, and surprisingly, the accuracy of these coordinates in placing dissected tissue samples in correct anatomical locations within MNI space have not been examined. Here, we show that there are significant inaccuracies in the two previous sets of coordinates, and provide a refined set of coordinates as a resource to the neuroscience community. We show (through analyses of metanalytic data and a re-analysis of real study data) that using previous inaccurate coordinates can result in dramatically different genes being identified, which could compromise further downstream analyses."
"Many animals form behavioral collectives, and optimal interaction patterns often differ across social contexts. Sensory scenes generated by many interacting conspecifics are complex. Thus, maintaining socially-calibrated interaction patterns necessitates that individuals distill key features from conspecific scenes to guide continued adjustments to social fluctuations. Tungara frogs produce mating calls in choruses varying in size, and interaction patterns differ across social environments; rivals alternate their calls in smaller choruses, but increasingly overlap one anothers calls in a stereotyped fashion as choruses increase in size. We used automated playback to investigate the cues guiding this socially-mediated shift in response modes. We played conspecific stimulus calls to males at various delays relative to their own calls, preceded by various acoustic motifs mimicking conspecific interaction patterns observed across varied chorusing environments. Males almost never overlapped isolated stimulus calls at any delays. However, their probabilities of overlapping stimulus calls increased markedly when stimulus calls were preceded by motifs exhibiting intense conspecific stimulation patterns characteristic of larger choruses, especially when these stimulus calls were also presented at later delays. Thus, a multifaceted cue to social context primes varied interaction patterns on a call-by-call basis: that, in larger choruses, males experience intense conspecific stimulation during their inter-call periods, and that this stimulation extends throughout the latter reaches of their call cycles. Our results highlight that inactive phases within behavioral rhythms provide critical assessment windows for fine-tuning upcoming responses, and that behavioral rhythms act as crucial temporal filters for mapping conspecific stimulation patterns to behavioral outputs."
"Recent achievements in implantable brain-computer interfaces (iBCIs) have demonstrated the potential to decode cognitive and motor behaviors with intracranial brain recordings; however, individual physiological and electrode implantation heterogeneities have constrained current approaches to neural decoding within single individuals, rendering interindividual neural decoding elusive. Here, we present Multi-individual Brain Region-Aggregated Network (MIBRAIN), a neural decoding framework that constructs a whole functional brain network model by integrating intracranial neurophysiological recordings across multiple individuals. MIBRAIN leverages self-supervised learning to derive generalized neural prototypes and supports group-level analysis of brain-region interactions and inter-subject neural synchrony. To validate our framework, we recorded stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) signals from a cohort of individuals performing Mandarin syllable articulation. Both real-time online and offline decoding experiments demonstrated significant improvements in both audible and silent articulation decoding, enhanced decoding accuracy with increased multi-subject data integration, and effective generalization to unseen subjects. Furthermore, neural predictions for regions without direct electrode coverage were validated against authentic neural data. Overall, this framework paves the way for robust neural decoding across individuals and offers insights for practical clinical applications."

"Zebrafish larval tail regeneration can be broadly broken down into three phases: wound repair, initiation of regeneration and redevelopment of the tail. We and others have shown that activation of the Hedgehog and TGF-beta signalling pathways is required to initiate tail regeneration. In this study we initially focus on these two pathways to better understand their role regeneration. We have found that Hedgehog signalling acts upstream of the TGF-beta pathway by activating transcription of the TGF-beta ligand tgfb1a. We have identified differentially expressed genes that are regulated after tail excision as well as those that are dependent upon TGF-beta signalling. From this analysis we found that Keratin genes fall into categories of co-expression: one set that is upregulated by TGF-beta signalling after injury (krtup) and a second set that is downregulated (krtdown). To see whether these two sets show co-expression more broadly, we analysed single cell RNA sequencing data and found that krts fall into the same categories during zebrafish development. We have mapped the expression of a representative member of krtup (krt97) and krtdown (krt5) sets during development and regeneration and show that krt97 is found in epithelia that is moving and krt5 is expressed in epithelia that is stationary. Based upon our results we propose that the krtup set allows for collective epithelial migration while the krtdown set inhibits mobility. These results reveal one mechanism by which TGF-beta may initiate regeneration and could help to explain how changes in cytoskeletal composition influence cell movement during development and repair."

"Microbial growth is intimately dependent on the resources that cells find in their environment. While resource consumption in simple systems is well understood in theory, connecting mathematical models with empirical observations in more complex environments remains difficult. To address this, we measure bacterial growth across various concentrations of a complex growth medium and analyse the data with the assumption that populations consume resources at a constant rate. This approach highlights cumulative population gain as a key observable, revealing otherwise hidden resource dynamics.

We show that using cumulative population gain allows machine learning algorithms to predict growth rates more accurately than instantaneous population size, supporting the constant-rate resource consumption model. However, black-box machine learning says very little explicitly about the actual growth laws. To overcome this, we apply symbolic regression in a biologically informed way to reveal that additive and multiplicative models based on a Monod dynamics provide the best balance between data fit, model parsimony, and biological relevance.

Our study demonstrates how combining theoretical knowledge with symbolic regression can advance the understanding of microbial growth, bridging the gap between mathematical modelling and empirical research in microbial ecology."
"The carbon (C) balance of plants is the sum of all source and sink processes. However, due to methodological limitations, most studies focus predominantly on measurements of leaf-level assimilation and respiration, with less attention given to these processes in heterotrophic organs or the whole-plant level. As a result, knowledge of the whole-plant net C balance is scarce, limiting our understanding of the dynamics between C source and sink activities. Therefore, we developed an easily reproducible chamber system for continuous measurements of whole-plant net CO2 fluxes. We present the obtained dynamics of net CO2 fluxes of several C3 and CAM species, including germinating Quercus robur, over several days, as well as the whole-plant net CO2 flux temperature response of Q. robur seedlings, identifying the temperature thresholds at which they shift from a net CO2 sink to source. We show distinct diel patterns of net CO2 fluxes in C3 plants, likely driven by a dynamic diurnal up- and downregulation of sink activities in woody C3 plants. These patterns appear temperature-driven, suggesting a dynamic response of plants sink and source activity to environmental drivers. Our results highlight the importance of whole-plant C balance measurements for understanding plant responses to environmental conditions."
"Gene expression is essential for biological functions but also incurs a fitness cost, measured by the relative reduction in growth rate. However, the limiting factors generating the fitness cost remain elusive due to the complexity of cell growth. In this work, we disentangle the fitness cost into components generated by different limiting resources based on a resource competition model. We derive analytical formulas connecting the fitness cost to the copy numbers of the ribosome, RNA polymerase, and transcription factor. Comparing our model predictions with experimental data of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we demonstrate that the competition for ribosomes dominates the translation cost and the competition for transcription factors dominates the transcription cost. The model also systematically connects the fitness cost to genetic and environmental properties, making predictions quantitatively consistent with various experimental observations. Our work builds a systematic framework for gene expression cost, guiding synthetic biology to optimize genetic design."
"A hallmark of intelligent behavior is the ability to flexibly respond to external sensory inputs based on dynamically changing rules. A central question is how neurons in the brain implement computations underlying intelligent behaviors. The neocortical pyramidal neurons use their elaborated dendritic arbors to segregate a plethora of inputs and dynamically integrate them--a process known as dendritic computation--which may play important roles in rule-dependent sensory processing. However, evidence directly linking dendritic computation with intelligent cognitive behaviors has been absent. Here we combine two-photon imaging and a rule-switching flexible categorization task in mice to show that a projectome-defined extratelencephalic (ET) cortical layer 5 (L5) neurons in the auditory cortex integrate dendritic rule information and somatic sensory input to enable rule-dependent flexible categorization. The apical dendrite and soma within the same ET neurons exhibit distinct compartmental representations for sensory and rule information, with the soma predominantly encoding sensory information and the dendrites representing inferred task rule. Simultaneous optogenetic dendritic inhibition and two-photon imaging revealed that dendritic rule coding is essential for somatic output of flexible categorization. Our findings indicate that nonlinear dendritic integration of rule and sensory information constitutes a neuronal computational mechanism underlying rule-switching flexible decision-making."

"When learning to find the most beneficial course of action, the prefrontal cortex guides decisions by comparing estimates of the relative value of the options available. Basic neuroscience studies in animals support the view that the thalamus can regulate the activity within and across the prefrontal cortex. However, it is unknown if it can modify value-based decision making in humans. Understanding this is clinically important because disorders of value-based decision making underpin common motivational syndromes of apathy and impulsivity. Neuromodulation of the thalamus is routinely performed for motor symptoms and therefore could be a viable future target for these neuropsychiatric complications of neurodegenerative disease. Here, a group of patients (n=37) undergoing MR guided focused ultrasound for essential tremor, were tested using the restless bandit, a reward reinforcement learning task, immediately before and after thalamotomy. Performance was compared to a group of age- and gender-matched healthy controls (n = 32).

Thalamotomy significantly impaired the proportion of switch choices during the task (P<0.001) without affecting overall performance. Importantly, this reduction in choice flexibility could not be attributed to diminished attention, as thalamotomy did not affect response time, accuracy, or lateralisation. A reinforcement learning model fitted to the patients choices replicated the effect of thalamotomy when the model increased exploitation of the bandits learnt value estimate. This shift in the explore-exploit trade-off, manifesting as reduced choice flexibility, co-varied with the extent of post-operative oedema extension into mediodorsal nucleus (R= 0.64, p<0.001), but no other, including the Ventral intermediate nucleus, targeted clinically during MRgFUS thalamotomy for tremor control. Furthermore, using a normative functional connectome, resting-state fMRI connectivity between the volume of oedema encroaching the mediodorsal nucleus and the prefrontal cortex, predicted individual patients change in bandit performance. Lastly, we used probabilistic tractography to confirm a thalamo-cortical circuit between the lateral portion of mediodorsal nucleus and the frontal polar cortex, which regulates decision flexibility and accounts for the thalamotomy induced behavioural effect observed in the restless bandit task.

These findings confirm a causal role of the thalamus and specifically the mediodorsal nucleus, in regulating the extent to which value estimates are used to guide decisions and learning from reward. Neuromodulation of this target would be worthy of further investigation in patients with diminished motivation characteristic of apathy in conditions including Parkinsons disease."
"Alzheimers disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative condition linked to chronic neuroinflammation. This study investigates the cytokine gene expression profile in cortical tissue samples from elderly individuals with and without AD to identify potential biomarkers and enhance our understanding of disease pathogenesis. Utilizing high-depth RNA sequencing data, we identified a set of cytokines whose expression significantly associated with different aspects of the AD phenotype, including measures of neurofibrillary tangles, amyloid-{beta} deposition, and a person-specific rate of cognitive decline. Single-nucleus transcriptomics data facilitated the identification of specific cell types, such as microglia and oligodendrocytes, that significantly contribute to the inflammatory response in AD. Additionally, we observed a strong correlation between the expression of certain cytokines and genetic risk for the disease. Our findings indicate that cytokine-mediated neuroinflammation plays a vital role in AD progression and that modulating the immune response may offer a promising strategy for developing new therapies."
"Genome regulatory elements are fundamental to cellular identity and cell type specific gene expression. Understanding how the underlying genetic code is differentially utilised by different cell types is central to understanding human health and disease. To better understand how DNA encodes genome regulatory elements such as promoters, enhancers, and boundary elements, we leverage the Enformer gene expression and epigenetic prediction model. We used transfer learning with high quality single cell ATAC datasets to develop REnformer, a model to predict chromatin accessibility. By introducing a bench-mark for comparing performances against Enformer model, REnformer significantly outperformed Enformer in terms of higher prediction outcomes and lower error rates in all extensive analyses shown; introducing these benchmarks allowed us, and possible future works, to fairly compare such models. We further tested REnformer by predicting the effects of a well characterised -thalassemia variant and found that the prediction aligned with the observed change in genome regulatory element, previously validated. We conclude that REnformer is and can be a state-of-the-art tool to predict cell type specific regulatory elements, and interrogate the effect of genome variation in health and disease."
"As the prevalence of age-related diseases rises, understanding and modulating the aging process is becoming a priority. Transcriptomic aging clocks (TACs) hold great promise for this endeavor, yet most are hampered by platform or tissue specificity and limited accessibility. Here, we introduce Pasta, a robust and broadly applicable TAC based on a novel age-shift learning strategy. Pasta accurately predicts relative age from bulk, single-cell, and microarray data, capturing senescent and stem-like cellular states through signatures enriched in p53 and DNA damage response pathways. Its predictions correlate with tumor grade and patient survival, underscoring clinical relevance. Applied to the CMAP L1000 dataset, Pasta identified known and novel age-modulatory compounds and genetic perturbations, and highlighted mitochondrial translation and mRNA splicing as key determinants of the cellular propensity for aging and rejuvenation, respectively. Supporting Pastas predictive power, we validated pralatrexate as a potent senescence inducer and piperlongumine as a rejuvenating agent. Strikingly, chemotherapy drugs were highly enriched among pro-aging hits. Taken together, Pasta represents a powerful and generalizable tool for aging research and therapeutic discovery, distributed as an easy-to-use R package on GitHub."
"The extracellular matrix (ECM) provides essential structural and biochemical support to tissues, yet its spatial organization is often underrepresented in computational analyses of spatial proteomics. We present Cell-ECM Graphs, a computational framework that integrates ECM and cellular components into a unified graph structure, enabling joint modelling of cell-cell, ECM- ECM, and cell-ECM interactions. Using both simulated and real data, we evaluate performance across interaction profiling, node classification, spatial clustering, and explainable graph neural networks. Incorporating ECM enhances node classification and reveals biologically meaningful spatial patterns, including disrupted immune-ECM connectivity in allergen-exposed lungs. Cell-ECM Graphs offer a novel approach to analysing ECM architecture and its role in shaping the tissue microenvironment in health and disease."
"Plant nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich-repeat (NLR) immune receptors recognize pathogen effectors and activate immunity. The NLR RPS2 recognizes AvrRpt2, a Pseudomonas effector that promotes virulence by proteolytically cleaving a membrane-tethered host protein, RIN4. RIN4 cleavage by AvrRpt2 generates fragments that activate RPS2. A model for RPS2 activation by RIN4 destruction is consistent with the ectopic activity of RPS2 in plants lacking RIN4 but does not explain the link between AvrRpt2s virulence activity and RPS2 activation. We found that non-membrane-tethered RIN4 derivatives are potent cytosolic activators of RPS2. Activation of RPS2 by these RIN4 derivatives, like AvrRpt2-induced activation, and unlike ectopic activation in the absence of RIN4, requires the defense signaling protein NDR1. Cleavage products of RIN4 produced by AvrRpt2 play contrasting roles in the activation of RPS2, with the membrane-tethered C-terminal fragment suppressing RPS2 and the non-membrane-tethered internal fragment, dependent on compatibility with the C-terminal fragment, overcoming its suppression of RPS2.

"Leptospira interrogans is the major causative agent of leptospirosis. Humans, canines and livestock animals are susceptible to Leptospira species and can develop fulminant disease. Rodents serve as reservoir hosts in which the bacteria colonize the renal tubules and are excreted in the urine. The host immune response to Leptospira spp. remains poorly defined. We show that L. interrogans induces a robust type I interferon (IFN) response in human and murine macrophages that is dependent on the cytosolic dsDNA sensor Cyclic GMP-AMP Synthase (cGAS) and the Stimulator of IFN Genes (STING) signaling pathway. Further, we show that mice deficient in the IFN/{beta} receptor subunit 1 (IFNAR1) or STING had higher bacterial burdens and increased renal colonization following infection in vivo suggesting that cGAS-STING-driven type I IFN is required for the host defense against L. interrogans. These findings demonstrate the significance of cGAS-STING-dependent type I IFN signaling in mammalian innate immune responses to L. interrogans.

Author SummaryLeptospirosis is a globally distributed zoonotic disease caused by spirochetes belonging to the genus Leptospira. While humans, livestock, and dogs can develop severe or even fatal illness upon infection, rodents typically serve as asymptomatic reservoir hosts. A defining feature of the leptospiral life cycle is the ability of the pathogen to colonize the kidney in these reservoir host species, leading to prolonged urinary shedding and environmental dissemination. Despite the significant global burden of leptospirosis, the innate immune pathways that detect this pathogen and prevent renal colonization remain poorly understood. In this study we demonstrate that L. interrogans induces a robust type I IFN cytokine response from macrophages. The induction of this type I IFN response is dependent on sensing cytosolic DNA by the cGAS-STING pathway. Using in vivo mouse models of L. interrogans infection we further show that activation of this pathway is required to control bacterial burdens and reduce long-term kidney colonization. This study is the first to demonstrate a critical role for cGAS-STING and type I IFN in controlling L. interrogans infection."
"The E2F family of transcription factors are key regulators of the cell cycle in all metazoans. While they are primarily known for their role in cell cycle progression, E2Fs also play broader roles in cellular physiology, including the maintenance of exocrine tissue homeostasis. However, the underlying mechanisms that render exocrine cells particularly sensitive to E2F deregulation remain poorly understood. The Drosophila larval salivary gland (SG), like its mammalian counterpart, is an exocrine tissue that produces large quantities of ""glue proteins"" in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Here, we show that E2F activity is important for the exocrine function of the Drosophila SG. The loss of de2f1b, an alternatively spliced isoform of Drosophila E2F1, leads to elevated DNA damage and accumulation of cytoplasmic DNA (cytoDNA) in the SGs. Surprisingly, we found that IRE1, a key sensor of the unfolded protein response, is required not only for ER homeostasis but also for preventing cytoDNA accumulation in the SG. Importantly, we found evidence demonstrating that IRE1 activity is attenuated in de2f1b-deficient SGs, contributing to both ER dysfunction and cytoDNA accumulation. Together, these findings reveal an unanticipated link between ER homeostasis and cytoDNA processing and offer mechanistic insight into why exocrine tissues are particularly vulnerable to E2F deregulation.

Author SummaryWe discovered an unexpected consequence of E2F deregulation in ER homeostasis. The loss of de2f1b in the Drosophila salivary gland impedes physiological activation of an ER-resident protein, IRE1, a central component of the unfolded protein response. We show that IRE1 is required not only for ER homeostasis but also for preventing DNA accumulation in the cytoplasm, a phenotype observed in de2f1b deficient salivary glands. Our study reveals a previously uncharacterized role of IRE1-dependent ER function and offers new perspectives on why exocrine tissues are particularly vulnerable to the loss of E2Fs."
"BackgroundThe Baltic Sea receives petroleum hydrocarbons from various point sources. The degradation of these contaminants in the environment is typically facilitated by a variety of microorganisms that possess a range of genes and metabolic functions related to the degradation of various hydrocarbon substrates. However, our understanding of natural attenuation and the microbial capacity to degrade these contaminants within the Baltic Sea ecosystem remains limited. In this study, we compiled metagenomes from the benthic and pelagic ecosystems across the Baltic Sea to identify microorganisms and characterize their genes and metabolic functions involved in the degradation of hydrocarbon compounds.

ResultsKnown hydrocarbon-degrading phyla, i.e., Pseudomonadota, Myxococcota A, Actinomycetota, and Desulfobacterota, were identified within the Baltic Sea metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). Notably, 80% of the MAGs exhibited multiple hydrocarbon degradation gene annotations (>10 reads per kilobase million). Aerobic degradation was the predominant pathway for hydrocarbon degradation across environmental samples. Hydrocarbon degradation gene abundances varied among samples and Baltic Sea subbasins, with long-chain alkanes and dibenzothiophene compounds being the preferred substrates. Species richness and diversity of both benthic and pelagic microorganisms positively correlated with hydrocarbon degradation gene diversity, with the pelagic ecosystem exhibiting significantly higher richness and diversity compared to the benthic ecosystem. Additionally, the composition of the hydrocarbon degradation genes across the Baltic Sea subbasins was influenced by oil spill history, with areas that experienced higher spill volumes showing lower microbial diversity, suggesting potential enrichment of specific hydrocarbon degraders. Among the environmental factors assessed, depth played a significant role in shaping the composition of genes involved in hydrocarbon degradation within the Baltic Sea.

ConclusionsUsing metagenomics, we profiled the native microorganisms associated with hydrocarbon degradation in the Baltic Sea. This knowledge will aid in understanding the natural capacities of microbial communities, potentially linked to the natural attenuation of hydrocarbon pollutants in the area. Insights into microbial degradation potential can enhance predictions of petroleum pollutant persistence and accumulation, support mitigation strategies for marine pollution, and reveal the ecological resilience of native microbial communities in marine ecosystems.

"BackgroundVector-borne diseases, being major public health concerns, are either slated for elimination or projected for control in Nepal. One of the major challenges in controlling these VBDs is to halt their emergence and expansion in diverse geo-ecological and climatic regions. In this study, we collected vectors of major VBDs to understand their distribution, diversity, and association with ecological variances.

Methodology/Principal findingsA descriptive cross-sectional survey was conducted to collect the vectors in five districts situated at altitudes of up to 98 - 1,274 meters in Koshi Province, Eastern Nepal, representing three distinct geo-ecological and climatic regions: mountain, hills and lowlands during May and June 2023. Adult vectors were captured using CDC miniature light traps, BG sentinel traps, and manual aspirators. Association of vectors abundance in function of the geo-ecological and climatic variables was assessed in two vector species (Culex quinquefasciatus and Phlebotomus argentipes). We found the malaria vector Anopheles annularis, the lymphatic filariasis vector Cu. quinquefasciatus and visceral leishmaniasis vector Ph. argentipes from all three geo-ecological regions. The other vectors of the malaria parasite, An. pseudowillmori and An. willmori, and Japanese encephalitis vector Cu. tritaeniorhynchus were recorded from hilly districts only. Mean temperature and rainfall had positive effect on Cu. quinquefasciatus density and deleterious on Ph. argentipes. Culex quinquefasciatus and Ph. argentipes were captured in high abundance per household in hills (IRR = 1.23 and IRR = 13.00, respectively) and mountain (IRR = 1.96 and IRR = 4.00, respectively) as compared to lowland.

ConclusionTwo major vectors, Cu. quinquefasciatus and Ph. argentipes were indiscriminately present in all geo-ecological regions. Climatic variables favour vectors survival, distribution and growth in diverse altitudes, including areas previously impervious to the vectors and VBDs. Our findings alert the VBD control program and suggest regular monitoring, strengthening the existing surveillance system and evidence-based planning and implementation of vector control interventions in wider geo-ecological regions to prevent the disease transmission.

Authors SummaryThe Government of Nepal is committed to eliminate and control major vector-borne diseases: malaria, visceral leishmaniasis, lymphatic filariasis, Japanese encephalitis and dengue as a public health problem by 2030. These diseases, once endemic to lowlands with tropical and subtropical climates only, have been spread to a wide geography, including hills and mountains. These high-altitude areas were considered unsuitable for the existence of vectors and transmission of pathogens. Considering the impact of climate change on founding a favorable environment for the establishment of viable populations of vectors for pathogens transmission and thus threatening all the efforts of VBDs control and elimination, we conducted a cross-sectional survey to explore the diversity of vectors in varied geo-ecological regions. We collected vectors from five districts situated at different altitudes and having fairly diverse geography. Major vectors of responsible of transmission of pathogens causing VL and LF were abundantly present in all geo-ecological regions, while vectors of malarial parasites and dengue virus were sparsely present in fewer areas. This study also examined the feasibility of the integrated vector survey in favour of maximising the available resources for entomological investigations. Further, this study provides updated information on the diversity of the vectors in the areas having cases of VBDs and suggests authorities for regular monitoring, strengthening the existing surveillance system and evidence-based planning and implementation of vector control interventions to prevent the disease transmission in wider geo-ecological regions."
"Objects typically appear within rich visual scenes. Some models of visual system function propose that scene information is extracted from low-spatial frequency components and rapidly propagates through the visual processing hierarchy. This contextual information may help bias perceptual inferences toward objects that are likely to appear within a scene, enacted via top-down feedback carrying predictions. We tested this hypothesised influence of low spatial frequency information through newly learnt predictive object-scene associations. We recorded electroencephalographic (EEG) data from 40 participants who viewed high-spatial frequency objects embedded in either low- or high-spatial frequency scenes. Object-scene pairings were probabilistically manipulated such that certain objects more frequently appeared in certain scenes. We trained classifiers on EEG data from object-only trials and tested them on object plus scene trials. We did not observe differences in classification accuracy across expected and unexpected objects for both low- and high-spatial frequency scenes, nor any interaction between spatial frequency and expectation. However, we observed expectation effects on event-related potentials. These effects arose at similar latencies for both low- and high-spatial frequency scenes. Together, we report evidence that expectations induced by object-scene pairings influence visually evoked responses but do not modulate object representations."
"Phenotypic plasticity is often seen as an alternative adaptive strategy to genetic polymorphism, especially in response to rapid environmental changes. Indeed, a link between plasticity and heterozygosity, i.e. the basic measure of polymorphism, has previously been dismissed. Here, we investigate the thermal plasticity of abdominal pigmentation in eight Drosophila species, four belonging to the melanogaster species group and four to the montium group. Despite a conserved developmental pathway for melanin synthesis, the genetic architecture of its variation has significantly evolved, being polygenic in most species (like D. melanogaster) and Mendelian or invariable in others. By investigating the thermal plasticity of this trait in species with distinct architectures, we show the degree of plasticity to strongly associate with heterozygosity. Plasticity was resurrected in hybrids between species with no plastic responses but with contrasting melanism, and was higher in heterozygotes in species with simple Mendelian polymorphism. In plastic cases, pigmentation dominance is reversed depending on the developmental temperature. We propose simple genetic models with empirical molecular support to explain this link between phenotypic plasticity and genetic polymorphism. The relationship between these two phenomena, and the impact of each on the evolution of the other, may be more relevant than it is currently appreciated."
"Environmental enrichment has long been recognized as a non-pharmacological intervention to mitigate mental health issues, yet its efficacy, and heterogeneity of treatment effects across experimental contexts remain underexplored. Heterogeneity of treatment effects, which reflects variability in individual responses to interventions, is a critical factor in determining the generalizability and personalization needs of treatments. Here, we conducted a registered meta-analysis of 62 studies and 1,112 comparisons in rodent models to evaluate the impact of environmental enrichment on depressive and anxiety-like behaviours. We found that environmental enrichment reduced these behaviours of animal models by 16% on average and decreased inter-individual variability by 12%, indicating not only effectiveness but also low heterogeneity of treatment effects, which suggests consistent effects across individuals. Environmental enrichment further nullified the adverse effects of stressors, demonstrating a significant antagonistic interaction. These effects were robust across multiple sensitivity analyses, including model-based predictions, post-stratification, multi-model inference, publication bias correction, and critical appraisal of study quality. Moderator analyses highlighted the importance of exposure timing and the inclusion of social enrichment components. Taken together, our pre-clinical evidence on rodent models supports environmental enrichment as a low-cost, scalable, and biologically grounded intervention with translational relevance for developing equitable and accessible treatments for depression and anxiety. Given the importance of innovation and personalization in mental health care, the low heterogeneity of treatment effects of environmental enrichment positions it as a promising avenue for non-pharmacological therapeutic strategies that can be broadly applied without extensive tailoring."

"Background and ObjectivesCancer evolves via interconnected mechanisms, including changes in extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA), genetic instability, and interactions with the tumor microenvironment (TME). These mechanisms allow for some clones to evolve metastatic traits, evade the immune system, and resist chemotherapy. However, how cancer cells evolve in vivo remains poorly understood. This study investigates the in vivo changes in gene expression of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells implanted in BALB/c mice.

MethodologyWe analyzed RNA-seq data from 4T1 TNBC cells and tumors at different growth stages (1-, 3-, and 6-week) to identify differentially expressed genes, protein-protein interactions, and ecDNA alterations. We also assessed how ecDNA and genomic instability proteins interact with anti-TNBC drugs

ResultsOur results reveal early transcriptional shifts within one week of tumor implantation, showing rapid acclimation. Changes in gene expression continued over time, with significant molecular reprogramming observed at six weeks under in vivo environmental pressures, including ecDNA alterations and immune evasion. The shift from the earlier generation (1 week) to the later generation (6 weeks) suggests cumulative alterations in key oncogenic pathways related to tumor progression. Additionally, we found that mutations in ecDNA and genomic instability proteins influence drug binding affinity, suggesting that adaptive changes may impact chemotherapy response.

Conclusions and ImplicationsThis study provides new insights into how TNBC tumors may evolve over time and novel ecDNA-related mechanisms of possible tumor adaptation, highlighting potential biomarkers for tumor aggression and immune evasion, which could help develop more effective therapeutic strategies against TNBC."
"The present study was conducted on Buchi sheep at Government livestock farm, Jugaitpeer, district Bahawalpur. The objectives of this study were to investigates the genetic potential, birth and adult body weights, growth and turnover rates, and seasonal reproductive performance, the effect of Dalmazin (PGF2) on synchronization, the effect of GnRH and hCG treatment given on the mating day on pregnancy rate, and embryonic mortality after plasma hormone concentrations and embryo development to improve litter size. Male lambs exhibited significantly higher (P<0.05) birth (3.40 {+/-} 0.16 kg) and adult weights (61.67 {+/-} 0.95 kg) compared to females (3.00 {+/-} 0.00 kg and 39.67 {+/-} 0.41 kg, respectively), along with faster growth and higher turnover rates. Seasonal variations showed superior pregnancy rates in spring (62.83%) but higher reproductive efficiency and lower mortality in autumn. In a second experiment, 30 ewes divided into hCG, GnRH, and control groups. hCG and GnRH groups were mated to ram at synchronized estrus by two injections of 2ml PGF2 analogue (Dalmazin) given at 11 days apart. The control group received only saline. The blood samples were collected from jugular venipuncture (3ml) with a disposable syringe from day 2 to 16 after treatment. Plasma progesterone concentrations detected by ELISA were higher (P<0.05) in sheep as compared with saline treated controls and improved reproductive outcomes. The hCG group showed the best performance with a litter size of 1.28%, no embryonic mortality, and increased twinning and fecundity rates. The GnRH group also demonstrated enhanced reproductive efficiency with a litter size of 1.25% and no embryonic loss. The control group had the lowest reproductive outcomes, including a higher embryonic mortality rate. Overall, hCG proved more effective than GnRH in enhancing progesterone levels, fecundity, and prolificacy in Buchi sheep."
"Regulation of gene silencing in large regions of chromosomes is crucial for development and disease progression, and there has been an increasing interest in using it for new therapeutics. One example of massive gene silencing is X chromosome inactivation (XCI), a process essential for dosage compensation of X-linked genes. During XCI, most genes in the X chromosome are inactivated following the transcription of XIST, an X-linked long noncoding RNA. Recent experiments with transgenes showed that the spread of gene silencing can be induced by XIST transcription in cis, but the spread is restricted in space. The mechanism of controlling the spread remains unclear. In this work, we develop a continuum reaction-diffusion model that elucidates chromosomal inactivation through a bistable system governed by a regulatory network for XIST-mediated gene silencing. We find that the spread of XIST can be tuned by known negative feedback loops regulating its synthesis and degradation, and that the spread of gene silencing is controlled by a wave-pinning mechanism in which both global regulation of silencing complex and local variations of histone modifications can play crucial roles. In addition, we integrate the discrete three-dimensional arrangement of the X chromosome and autosomes into this continuous model. We use a 3D chromosome structure inferred from experimental data and our modeling framework to show the spatiotemporal regulation for spread of gene silencing. Our method enables the investigation for the inactivation dynamics of large regions of chromosomes with varying degrees of the spread of gene silencing. Our model provides mechanistic insights that quantitatively relate gene regulatory networks to tunability and stability of chromosomal inactivation.

Author SummaryPrecise control of gene expression is a fundamental process in biology and turning off large parts of chromosomes is both common in many species and important for development and diseases. A well-known example of chromosomal scale gene silencing is X chromosome inactivation (XCI), which helps balancing gene activity between sexes. XCI is governed by the production of an RNA called XIST, leading to most genes on one X chromosome being turned off. Experiments have shown that XIST can trigger nearby genes to turn off in natural and engineered contexts, but this effect only spreads to specific regions. The exact mechanism for this limit is not very well understood. In this study, the authors created a mathematical model to explain how XIST spreads and controls gene activity. They found that feedback systems involving XIST regulations and chromatin modifications synergize and determine how far the inactivation spreads, through a process similar to a wave that gets ""pinned"" in place. They also included the 3D shape of chromosomes in their model to better understand how gene silencing happens over time and space. This model helps to quantitatively describe chromosome inactivation with gene regulatory networks."
"Ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs) are essential enzymes involved in DNA synthesis and repair, catalyzing the conversion of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides (dNTPs). While all living cells possess at least one RNR encoded in their genome, certain organisms, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, encode multiple RNR classes. This multiplicity provides a competitive advantage, allowing these organisms to adapt and colonize different environments. Despite their importance, the mechanisms coordinating the expression of different RNRs in microorganisms with multiple RNR classes remain poorly understood. The transcriptional regulator NrdR has been implicated in controlling the expression of all three RNR classes in P. aeruginosa by binding to conserved NrdR boxes within the promoter regions of the RNR genes.

To gain insights into the regulation of the different RNR genes, it is first necessary to understand how nrdR itself is transcriptionally regulated. In this study, we employed a bioinformatics approach to identify potential transcription factors (TF) involved in nrdR regulation. We combined this with promoter-probe vectors nrdR promoter fusions to investigate nrdR transcriptional regulation and identify TFs that modulate its expression in vitro. Our analysis identified four potential TF that could regulate nrdR, and we experimentally confirmed that FleQ is responsible for regulating nrdR expression under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Furthermore, we explored nrdR regulation under biofilm-forming conditions and in the Galleria mellonella infection model to gain insights into how nrdR might be regulated in vivo.

ImportanceThis study reveals a nuanced regulatory mechanism by which the transcription factor FleQ, modulated by intracellular c-di-GMP levels, governs the expression of the essential gene nrdR in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. By demonstrating that FleQ acts as an activator under planktonic and infection conditions and as a repressor during biofilm formation, the findings reveal a dual regulatory role that aligns with the bacteriums transition between acute and chronic infection states. This dynamic control of nrdR, a key repressor of ribonucleotide reductases, links environmental sensing to nucleotide metabolism, offering new insights into how P. aeruginosa adapts to diverse and hostile environments. These results not only deepen our understanding of bacterial gene regulation but also highlight potential targets for disrupting biofilm-associated persistence in clinical settings."
"The rise of antibiotic resistance among pathogenic bacteria necessitates innovative therapeutic strategies. A promising technique is the use of collateral sensitivity where resistance to one antibiotic increases susceptibility to another. In this study, we explored the clinical relevance of collateral sensitivity through experimental evolution and genetic engineering in six critical bacterial pathogens using 23 distinct antibiotics. Our in-depth analysis of Escherichia coli showed that clinically relevant resistance mutations did not confer collateral sensitivity to the tested antibiotics. We were able to identify at least three new classes of ciprofloxacin-resistance mutations that cause collateral sensitivity to multiple antibiotics. However, these mutations incur significant fitness costs and are absent in ciprofloxacin-resistant clinical isolates. Our further analysis showed that the development of collateral effects differed significantly between the tested species. Most species showed development of collateral sensitivity to gentamicin during ciprofloxacin-resistance evolution but Acinetobacter baumanii developed collateral resistance instead. Overall, Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed the most consistent development of collateral sensitivity among the tested species, highlighting it as a promising candidate for the use of collateral-sensitivity-based treatment strategies. Our findings provide insights into the potential of collateral sensitivity as a therapeutic strategy and contribute to the development of more effective antibiotic treatment regimens."
"Biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), comprising sets of functionally related genes responsible for synthesizing complex natural products, are a rich source of bioactive compounds with pharmaceutical potential. Here, we present a transformer-based framework that models functional domains as linguistic units to capture and predict their positional relationships within genomes. Using a RoBERTa architecture, we trained models on four progressively broader datasets: bacterial BGCs, Actinomycetes genomes, bacterial genomes, and bacterial plus fungal genomes. Evaluation using 2,492 experimentally-validated BGCs from the MIBiG database showed that more than 60% of true domains were ranked first and over 80% within the top 10 candidates. Our models also achieved classification accuracies exceeding 70% for major compound classes including polyketides (PKs) and terpenes. To explore model-guided BGC design, we compared predictions from the BGC-trained and genome-trained models using the BGC for the bacterial diterpenoid cyclooctatin as a case study. The genome-trained model uniquely predicted several domains absent from both the original BGC and the prediction by the BGC-trained model. Heterologous expression of one of those predicted domains in Streptomyces albus, together with the biosynthetic genes for cyclooctatin, yielded an unknown cyclooctatin derivative. This framework not only provides a novel BGC prediction method using machine learning but also facilitates rational design of artificial BGCs. Future integration of transcriptomic, protein structural, and phylogenetic data will enhance the models predictive and generative capabilities, supporting accelerated discovery and engineering of natural products.

Author SummaryBGCs encode diverse natural products, including antibiotics and anticancer agents. Identifying and designing BGCs in microbial genomes is crucial for discovering new bioactive compounds. In this study, we developed a transformer-based deep learning model that treats protein domains as language-like tokens and learns how they are arranged in genomes. By training on both known BGCs and whole genomes, the model successfully predicts biologically plausible combinations of domains, including those absent in known BGCs. We experimentally validated one such prediction by expressing a newly identified gene alongside known cyclooctatin biosynthetic genes, confirming the production of an unknown cyclooctatin derivative. Our results demonstrate how language models can uncover hidden biosynthetic potential and offer a promising new AI tool for natural product discovery and synthetic biology."
"The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has emerged as a popular model system to investigate cell biology and host-pathogen interactions. Presently, C. elegans is studied as a natural host of intracellular pathogens such as microsporidia and Orsay virus along with extracellular bacterial and fungal pathogens. The use of C. elegans as a model in host-pathogen research is limited by the number of naturally occurring pathogens to the organism. Through a sampling project to identify new pathogens of C. elegans, we identified the fungus Mucor hiemalis as a pathogen of Caenorhabditis species. We observed the fungus in the intestinal lumen of wild-caught Caenorhabditis briggsae, and co-culturing the wild-caught species with infection reporter C. elegans confirmed infection by M. hiemalis. This study characterizes the fungal infection by M. hiemalis in Caenorhabditis nematodes. Fluorescence microscopy with fungal staining revealed the life cycle of M. hiemalis within multiple Caenorhabditis species at varying growth stages. We observed the killing of nematodes by M. hiemalis via intestinal perforation and assessed its host range through a series of lifespan assays. We investigated the food preference of C. elegans and determined that nematodes show a preference towards food that contains M. hiemalis spores. Lastly, we evaluated common C. elegans transcriptional immune responses and found that M. hiemalis does not induce genes associated with the intracellular pathogen response or other responses seen with previously studied bacterial and fungal pathogens. Characterization of this fungal infection in Caenorhabditis nematodes will provide new insights into the biology of pathogenic fungi and host immune responses."

"BackgroundTrypanosoma cruzi causes Chagas disease, a poorly understood and clinically heterogeneous disease. Recent work has demonstrated that parasites adapted to laboratory conditions are genomically variable, but little is known of the extent of genomic diversity from clinically isolated specimens.

MethodsIn this retrospective observational genomic study, we isolated 15 T. cruzi specimens from three clinical studies of Chagas disease, representing different clinical contexts. We sequenced the genome of each strain and used single nucleotide variant (SNV) based analyses to estimate parasite genetic lineage, genomic population structure, regions of copy number plasticity, and to identify gene conversion events. In addition, we generated and annotated whole genome assemblies of each isolate. From these assemblies, we compared the repertoires of genes encoding for highly virulent and variable proteins that have been implicated in disease pathogenesis.

FindingsWe identified parasites from two genetic lineages in this collection of clinical isolates. Our analysis revealed evidence of genomic instability. Diversity-generating copy number variation was statistically enriched in regions encoding the virulence-associated multigene families, while diversity-eliminating gene conversion events were enriched in regions depleted of multigene family members. We also discovered a set of multigene family members that is present in all of the clinically isolated parasite genomes and absent from all of the lab adapted strains, regardless of parasite lineage. Multigene family repertoires were more conserved among field isolated specimens of the same genetic lineage than among culture adapted strains of the same genetic type.

InterpretationThis study provides whole genome sequencing data for TcV parasites isolated from naturally infected human patients with Chagas disease for the first time. Our analysis of these genomes revealed substantial genomic instability, suggesting the parasite undergoes genomic change in response to the pressures imposed by the host environment. Moreover, we observed a set of virulence-associated genes that are present exclusively within clinical isolates and absent from lab-adapted strains, indicating a potential role for these genes in parasite survival in natural hosts. These findings highlight the limitations of genetic studies focused exclusively on lab-adapted parasite strains and provide insight into the genomic features of T. cruzi that are likely to be important for clinical infection."
"During mitosis and meiosis kinetochores mediate interactions between chromosomes and spindle microtubules. Kinetochores are multi-megadalton protein complexes essential for chromosome segregation in all eukaryotes, however recent structural, functional, and evolutionary studies have revealed divergent mechanisms of kinetochore assembly. In this study, we use cryo-EM to understand the structural mechanisms by which the budding yeast microtubule-binding outer kinetochore KMN complex assembles, and how its interactions with the centromere-binding inner kinetochore are regulated. The ten-subunit KMN complex comprises three subcomplexes: Knl1c, Mis12cMtw1c and Ndc80c. We show that -helical motifs in the C-termini of the Mis12cMtw1c subunits Dsn1, Mis12Mtw1 and Pmf1Nnf1 bind Knl1c and Ndc80c. At the opposite end of the Mis12cMtw1c stalk, an N-terminal auto-inhibitory segment of Dsn1 (Dsn1AI) folds into two -helices that engage its head 1 domain, thereby occluding binding sites for the inner kinetochore subunits CENP-CMif2 and CENP-UAme1, reducing their affinity for Mis12cMtw1. Our structure reveals how Aurora BIpl1 phosphorylation of Dsn1AI would release this auto-inhibition to substantially strengthen pre-existing connections between the inner and outer kinetochore.

summaryKinetochore-localised KMN complexes mediate chromosome segregation by attaching chromosomes to spindle microtubules. Cryo-EM, biochemical and genetic experiments reveal conserved underlying mechanisms of complex assembly, auto-inhibition and phospho-regulation that ensure precise control of KMN assembly onto centromeres to enable genome division."
"Perilipin 4 (PLIN4) belongs to the family of perilipins - proteins that localize to lipid droplets (LDs). PLIN4 contains a giant ({approx} 1000 aa) amphipathic helix, which folds on the LD surface and can substitute for phospholipids, thereby regulating LD surface tension. This region of PLIN4 is arranged in tandem repeats of 33 aa. Genetic expansion of this region is associated with skeletal muscle dysfunction in patients suffering from a late-onset vacuolar myopathy (MRUPAV). We demonstrate that purified fragments of the PLIN4 repetitive region form amyloid fibrils as characterized by cryo-EM and atomic force microscopy. The MRUPAV mutation drastically increases the kinetics of fibril formation and induces aggregation in budding yeast. The propensity to aggregate depends on the number of identical repeats and their sequence, and is strongly attenuated by the presence of lipid droplets, suggesting putative intervention strategies and an explanation for the observed tissue bias of the disease."
"Bioelectronics have transformed our capacity to monitor and treat diseases; however, a lack of micrometer-scale, energy efficient communication options limit these devices from forming integrated networks that enable full-body, sensor driven, physiological control. Inspired by our nervous systems ability to transmit information via ionic conduction, we engineered a Smart Wireless Artificial Nervous System (SWANS) that utilizes the bodys own tissue to transmit signals between wearables and implantables. When SWANS emits signals, it generates voltage gradients throughout the body that selectively turn on implanted transistor switches when exceeding their gate threshold voltages. SWANS implantable communication components maintain syringe-injectable footprints and >15x greater power efficiencies than Bluetooth and Near Field Communication. In vivo studies in rats demonstrate SWANS ability to wirelessly regulate dual hind leg motor control by connecting electronic-skin sensors to implantable neural interfaces via ionic signaling as well as coordinate bioelectronics throughout the epidermal, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, and gastrointestinal spaces."

"Modern biology increasingly relies on complex, high dimensional datasets such as single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). However, the richness of such data means that conventional analyses may only scratch its surface. Extracting meaningful insights from these datasets often requires advanced computational methods and domain expertise. Current AI agents for biology are primarily focused on executing user-specified commands and are therefore limited by the users creativity and familiarity with which kinds of analyses are useful. Furthermore, these agents do not account for prior analyses already attempted by researchers, reducing their ability to build upon existing work. To address these limitations, we introduce CellVoyager, an AI agent that autonomously explores scRNA-seq datasets in novel directions conditioned on prior user-ran analyses. Built on large language models, CellVoyager ingests both the dataset and a record of prior analyses to generate and test new hypotheses within a Jupyter notebook environment. We evaluate CellVoyager on CellBench, a new benchmark based on 50 published scRNA-seq studies encompassing 483 analyses. Given only the background sections of these papers, CellVoyager outperformed GPT-4o and o3-mini by up to 20% in predicting which analyses the authors eventually conducted. We then carried out three in-depth case studies where CellVoyager is given previously published papers with their scRNA-seq datasets and conducts analyses to generate new findings. The original authors of each study evaluated these findings and consistently rated them as creative and sound; 80% of the agents hypotheses were deemed scientifically interesting. For example, in one case study, the agent found that CD8+ T cells in COVID-19 infection are more primed for pyroptosis, which was not explored by the original researchers. CellVoyager also reanalyzed a brain aging dataset to discover a previously unreported association between increased transcriptional noise and aging in the subventricular zone of the brain. These results demonstrate that CellVoyager can act both autonomously and collaboratively to accelerate hypothesis generation and computational biology. It also highlights the potential of agents like CellVoyager to unlock new biological insights by reanalyzing the vast existing biological data at scale."
"Malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) compromise innate immunity, yet the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. The immune dysregulation caused by the parasite may lead to bacterial superinfections and increase mortality. We reveal that Pf exploits extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by infected red blood cells (iRBC-EVs) to deliver host-derived miR451a to human neutrophils, impairing their antimicrobial defences. Neutrophil phagocytosis of iRBC-EVs suppresses reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and compromised microbicidal activity against Salmonella typhimurium. Microfluidic assays show that miR451a transfer significantly disrupts neutrophil chemotaxis and swarming upon microbial challenge. Transcriptomic profiling indicates that EVs and miR451a reprogram neutrophil gene expression, notably upregulating ferroptosis-related genes, suggesting a role in further impairing immune responses. We have uncovered a novel mechanism of iRBC-EVs-induced neutrophil immune suppression and provide insights into increased susceptibility to bacterial superinfections in malaria. These findings have implications for therapeutic strategies aimed at mitigating bacterial superinfections and sepsis in malaria-endemic regions."
"Many mammalian viruses encounter bacteria and bacterial molecules over the course of infection. Previous work has shown that the microbial ecology of the gut plays an integral role in poliovirus and coxsackievirus infection, where bacterial glycans can facilitate virus-receptor interactions, enhance viral replication, and stabilize viral particles. However, how airway bacteria alter respiratory viral infection is less understood. Therefore, we investigated whether a panel of airway bacteria affect rhinovirus stability. We found that Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic airway pathogen, protects human rhinovirus 14 from acid or heat inactivation. Further investigation revealed that P. aeruginosa rhamnolipids, glycolipids with surfactant properties, are necessary and sufficient for stabilization of rhinovirus virions. Taken together, this work demonstrates that specific molecules produced by an opportunistic airway pathogen can influence a respiratory virus.

ImportanceBacteria can enhance viral stability and infection for enteric members of the Picornaviridae such as poliovirus and coxsackievirus; however, whether bacteria influence respiratory picornaviruses is unknown. In this study, we examined impacts of airway bacteria on rhinovirus, a major etiological agent of the common cold. We found that P. aeruginosa protects human rhinovirus 14 from both acid and heat inactivation through rhamnolipids. Overall, this work demonstrates bacterial effects on respiratory virus through specific bacterial molecules."
"The gut microbiome of eusocial corbiculate bees, which include honeybees, bumblebees, and stingless bees, consists of anciently associated, host-specific bacteria that are vital for bee health. Two symbionts, Snodgrassella and Gilliamella, are ubiquitous in honeybees and bumblebees. However, their presence varies in the stingless bee clade (Meliponini), a group with pantropical distribution. They are absent or rare in the diverse genus Melipona, indicating a shift in microbiota composition in this lineage. To identify the main members of the Melipona microbiota, we combined newly collected and published data from field-collected individuals of several species. Additionally, we identified the localization of the dominant microbiota members within the gut regions of Melipona quadrifasciata anthidioides. The dominant microbiota of Melipona species includes members of the genera Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Apilactobacillus, Floricoccus, and Bombella. Among these, Apilactobacillus and Bombella dominate in the crop, whereas Apilactobacillus and other members of the Lactobacillaceae dominate the ventriculus. The ileum lacks Snodgrassella or Gilliamella but contains a putative new symbiont close to Floricoccus, as well as strains of Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillaceae (including Apilactobacillus), and Bombella. The rectum is dominated by Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus. In summary, the Melipona microbiota is compositionally distinct but shows spatial organization paralleling that of other eusocial corbiculate bees."
"Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a ubiquitous pathogen that establishes life-long, latent infection in hematopoietic cells. Immune-competent individuals are usually asymptomatic for disease. However, immune dysregulation in latently-infected individuals can result in viral reactivation, often causing further complications. Viral gene transcription during latency is restricted, although the CMV-encoded G-protein coupled receptor homologs, US28 and UL78, are expressed. We and others find US28 is critical for establishing and maintaining viral latency, in part, through regulating host cell signaling. How US28 switches from pro-latent to pro-lytic during reactivation, however, is unknown, though our findings herein reveal a role for UL78. Myeloid cells infected with a UL78 ORF deletion mutant maintain viral latency yet fail to efficiently reactivate. However, the UL78 G protein-coupling domain is not required for reactivation, suggesting UL78-mediated signaling is not critical for reactivation. Prior work revealed UL78 and US28 interact, resulting in altered US28-mediated signaling. Additionally, we showed US28 attenuates ERK phosphorylation during latency, while ERK is phosphorylated upon reactivation; however, the mechanism underlying this switch is unknown. Thus, we hypothesized the UL78:US28 interaction is important for altering US28-mediating signaling upon viral reactivation. We find US28 and UL78 interact during lytic infection of fibroblasts and colocalize in myeloid cells upon their differentiation. Further, reactivation in myeloid cells latently-infected with wild-type virus results in upregulated ERK phosphorylation, while parallel cultures infected with the UL78-deficient virus fail to do so. Our data reveal the first function for UL78 in myeloid cells, where it influences cellular signaling to switch from pro-latent to pro-lytic.

ImportanceCytomegalovirus (CMV) is a ubiquitous human herpesvirus, infecting the majority of the population worldwide. As with all herpesviruses, once an individual is infected with CMV, the virus remains in a persons blood cells for their life in a silenced state called latency, and this infection, for the most part, remains asymptomatic. When an infected individuals immune system fails to function properly, however, CMV can become active (termed viral reactivation), which allows the virus to replicate and cause downstream disease. Our understanding of the cellular and viral factors that dictate this switch from silenced to activated remains incomplete. Here, we show a viral protein, UL78, is required for this switch. We find UL78 helps to reshape cellular signaling, changing the cell environment from one that favors latency to one that instead supports reactivation. This highlights a new avenue for therapeutic intervention to prevent CMV reactivation and downstream disease."
"The ribosomes peptidyl transferase center (PTC) catalyzes peptide bond formation during protein synthesis and is targeted by many antibiotic classes. Remarkably, macrolides that bind in the peptide exit tunnel some [~]10[A] away from the PTC also remotely inhibit PTC and cause translational arrest depending on the synthesized polypeptide sequence. The Arg/Lys-X-Arg/Lys (also known as +X+) motif is particularly susceptible to this inhibition, as peptidyl-tRNA carrying nascent peptide with penultimate arginine or lysine residue fails to react with aminoacyl-tRNA carrying the same amino acids in the presence of macrolides. While structural studies of macrolide-bound ribosomes have shed light on the context-specific nature of this inhibition, the precise roles of the drug, ribosome, and tRNA in modulating PTC activity remain unclear. In this study, we present a detailed structural analysis of ribosome-nascent chain complexes (RNCs) that represent either arrested or non-arrested states, containing various combinations of peptidyl- and aminoacyl-tRNAs, with or without macrolides. Our findings reveal a dynamic interaction between the ribosome-bound drug, the nascent peptide, and the incoming amino acid, which collectively modulates PTC function. This lays the foundation for designing antibiotics that can overcome drug resistance by preventing the induction of inducible erm genes in pathogens."
"Recent years have seen a rise in applications of deep learning to problems in the molecular sciences. Among them, the diffusion model DiffDock stands out as a method for docking small molecules into protein binding sites. But DiffDock struggles to compete with conventional docking methods, especially for targets outside its training set. We develop a hybrid model called DiffDock-Glide which addresses some shortcomings of deep learning docking methods: it uses a modified generative process to generate samples within a binding pocket and the confidence model is replaced with Glides post-docking minimization pipeline. We evaluate DiffDock-Glide on the Posebusters dataset and show improved sampling of near-native poses, especially for sequences without homologues in the training set. We also evaluate DiffDock-Glides performance in virtual screening compounds from the DUD-E dataset against receptor structures generated by AlphaFold2 and report enrichment values that broadly surpass those from traditional Glide."
"Determining key contacts between RNA-protein interactions is essential for understanding the molecular mechanisms of numerous biological processes, including transcription, splicing, and translation. However, progress in this area has been impeded by the scarcity of RNA-protein complex structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and the challenges posed by traditional structural determination techniques. Recent computational advancements, including deep learning methods like AlphaFold 3 and RoseTTAFoldNA, have improved contact prediction but are still limited by the availability of homologous sequences and templates. Here, we introduce RPcontact, a novel computational method designed to predict RNA-protein contacts using large language models tailored for RNA (ERNIE-RNA) and proteins (ESM-2). Despite being trained entirely on ribosomal RNA-protein (rRNA-protein) complexes, RPcontact demonstrates robust and generalized performance in predicting contacts for both dimeric and multimeric non-rRNA-protein complexes. The performance of RPcontact on contact predictions significantly improves over the binary contacts inferred from RNA-protein complex structures predicted by AlphaFold 3 and RoseTTAFoldNA, highlighting its potential in RNA-protein complex structure and function prediction."
"Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of cell death, plays a key role in various diseases, but its impact on immune cells, particularly macrophages, remains unclear. This study explores how macrophage activation influences susceptibility to ferroptosis, focusing on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and other inflammatory signals. We found that LPS priming enhanced resistance to ferroptosis in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), as shown by reduced morphological changes, lower LDH release, and diminished cell death in real-time assays. Similar effects were observed with Zymosan A and TNF-. Importantly, LPS-induced ferroptosis resistance was independent of stress response pathways like Nrf2 signaling. Instead, lipid droplet accumulation, driven by LPS, was central to this resistance. PDE10A inhibition reversed LPS-induced ferroptosis and reduced lipid droplet formation. LPS did not confer similar resistance in non-macrophage cell types, underscoring the macrophage-specific nature of this response. These findings highlight potential therapeutic targets for inflammatory diseases."
"1Despite advances in transcriptomics, understanding of genome regulation remains limited by the complex interactions within living cells. To address this, we performed cell-free transcriptomics by developing a platform using an active learning workflow to explore over 1,000,000 buffer conditions. This enabled us to identify a buffer that increased mRNA yield by 20-fold, enabling cell-free transcriptomics. By employing increasingly complex conditions, our approach untangles the regulatory layers controlling genome expression."
"Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is an obligate human pathogen that depends on its ability to spread from host-to-host to survive as a species. Yet, knowledge of transmission-specific traits remains lacking. Here, we report the discovery of a specific adaptive response to desiccation, a stress intrinsically linked to the generation of the aerosol droplets within which Mtb transmits. We show that desiccation inflicts oxidative damage and activates Mtbs DNA repair responses but that this repair is imperfect and results in mutations. We further show that activation of these DNA repair responses is accompanied by increased expression of the transcription-coupled repair factor, mfd, but that this expression serves to buffer the fitness cost of specific resistance-conferring mutations in rpoB, the target of the frontline drug rifampin, rather than to facilitate transcription-coupled DNA repair. Silencing mfd during aerosolization impairs survival of strains harboring the rifampin resistance allele S450L. This function is further supported by whole genome sequence data from over 50,000 clinically circulating strains. These studies indicate that Mtb has evolved transmission-specific stress responses that have enabled it to leverage desiccation-induced DNA damage as a potential source of genetic diversification and drug resistance."
"ARC syndrome (arthrogryposis-renal dysfunction-cholestasis) is a rare autosomal recessive multisystem disorder affecting the kidneys. The disease is caused by mutations in either VPS33B or VIPAS39. ARC syndrome is currently incurable, with patients rarely surviving beyond their first year of life. The renal component of this disorder is characterised by proximal tubular dysfunction. Here, a proximal tubular cell line, RPTEC-TERT1, was CRISPR-edited to knock out (KO) VPS33B expression. Characterisation of VPS33B-KO cells was performed using brightfield imaging, immunostaining, RNA sequencing, and cell detachment assays. The VPS33B-KO RPTEC-TERT1 cells demonstrated a  peeling phenotype and altered cell adhesion. This, along with altered transcription of genes associated with cell adhesion, suggests that VPS33B KO results in cell-matrix attachment defects. These findings provide the first insights into the cause of proximal tubular dysfunction in ARC syndrome."
"Gills are essential for fish respiration and have a highly specialized cellular architecture enabling efficient gas exchange. Surprisingly, the developmental processes underlying gill formation in zebrafish remain poorly understood. Here, we present for the first time a comprehensive analysis of the morphogenesis of gill arteries, filaments and lamellae during lifelong development.

Our results provide important insights into the temporal and spatial pattern of gill angiogenesis, revealing fundamental differences in the formation of lateral versus medial filaments along the dorso-ventral axis. These early asymmetries correlate with, and likely underlie, the structural asymmetries observed in adult gills, which we quantitatively characterize. This indicates that a region-specific developmental programme establishes a blueprint for gill architecture maintained throughout life.

We further show that lamellae develop through a complex interplay between endothelial and cranial neural crest-derived pillar cells. Notably, lamellar size, which strongly influences respiratory efficiency, depends on the position of the filament in the arch. Together, our work identifies key cellular and temporal mechanisms driving gill development and provides a framework to investigate broader principles of branching morphogenesis and angiogenesis in vertebrates."
"The field of budding yeast research has long been empowered by the vast array of genetic tools and community resources available. Rescue by mating is one useful tool that entails mating of meiotic spores directly post-germination. This minimal cell division mating process facilitates mating based screens studying the effects of otherwise haploid lethal gene deletions. In this study, we describe the successful application of rescue by mating across two different Saccharomyces species: S. cerevisiae and S. uvarum. This novel inter-species tool enables studies on the evolution of essential genes within the broader Saccharomyces genus."
"BackgroundQuantitative genetic analysis of image- or video-derived phenotypes is increasingly being performed for a wide range of traits. Pig body weight values estimated by a conventional approach or a computer vision system can be considered as two different measurements of the same trait, but with different sources of phenotyping error. Previous studies have shown that trait measurement error, defined as the difference between manually collected phenotypes and image-derived phenotypes, can be influenced by genetics, suggesting that the error is systematic rather than random and is more likely to lead to misleading quantitative genetic analysis results. Therefore, we investigated the effect of trait measurement error on genetic analysis of pig body weight (BW).

ResultsCalibrated scale-based and image-based BW showed high coefficients of determination and goodness of fit. Genomic heritability estimates for scale-based and image-based BW were mostly identical across growth periods. Genomic heritability estimates for trait measurement error were consistently negligible, regardless of the choice of computer vision algorithm. In addition, genome-wide association analysis revealed no overlap between the top markers identified for scale-based BW and those associated with trait measurement error. Overall, the deep learning-based regressions outperformed the adaptive thresholding segmentation methods.

ConclusionsThis study showed that manually measured scale-based and image-based BW phenotypes yielded the same quantitative genetic results. We found no evidence that BW trait measurement error could be influenced, at least in part, by genetic factors. This suggests that trait measurement error in pig BW does not contain systematic errors that could bias downstream genetic analysis."
"L-Tryptophan (Trp) is an essential amino acid, catabolised through the kynurenine pathway, which is mediated by the enzymes indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1), IDO2, or Trp-2,3-deoxygenase (TDO). Therapeutic targeting of Trp metabolism could be relevant to several pathologies. In cancer, IDO1 acts as an immune checkpoint suppressing effector T cell function. Yet, direct inhibition of IDO1 has had limited success in clinical trials. Therefore, alternative approaches to Trp metabolism therapeutic targeting are needed. We screened a library of 597 natural products (NPs) or NP derivatives for their effect on kynurenine production in triple negative breast cancer cells. This revealed 24 candidate inhibitors of kynurenine production. Amongst them, artemether, a member of the artemisinin family of anti-malarial drugs, suppressed kynurenine production, likely via an endoperoxide bridge-dependent mechanism. The Euphorbia factor L9 (EFL9) inhibited kynurenine production likely via a C7-benzoylation-dependent mechanism. Neither artemether nor EFL9 affected JAK/STAT signaling or IDO1 levels. Targeted metabolomics analyses demonstrated that artemether suppressed kynurenine production through heme sequestration, a mechanism that would affect all members of the IDO/TDO family of metalloenzymes. EFL9 affected purine and amino acid metabolism and the cellular redox balance. Comparisons to the effects of ouabain, a NP regulator of IDO1 levels, and Linrodostat, a clinically used small molecule IDO1 inhibitor, revealed distinct metabolic profiles, with ouabain and EFL9 showing the largest overlap. Importantly, the kynurenine-suppressing activity of artemether and EFL9 is not cancer cell-specific. Overall, our findings set the foundation for the use of derivatives of artemether or EFL9 as novel Trp metabolism-targeting therapeutics."
"Sex differences in behaviours arise from variations in female and male nervous systems, yet the cellular and molecular bases of these differences remain poorly defined. Here, we take an unbiased, single-cell transcriptomic approach to uncover how sex shapes the adult Drosophila melanogaster brain. We show that sex differences do not result from large-scale transcriptional reprogramming but through fine-tuning of otherwise shared developmental templates via the sex-differentiating transcription factors Doublesex and Fruitless. We reveal, with unprecedented resolution, the extraordinary genetic diversity within these sexually dimorphic cell types and find birth order represents a novel axis of sexual differentiation. Neuronal identity in the adult reflects spatiotemporal patterning and sex-specific survival, with female-biased neurons arising early and male-biased neurons arising late. This pattern reframes dimorphic neurons as ""paralogous"" rather than ""orthologous"", suggesting sex leverages distinct developmental windows to build behavioural circuits and highlights a role for exaptation in diversifying the brain."
"The distinction between animate and inanimate things is a main organizing principle of information in perception and cognition. Yet, animacy, as a visual property, has so far eluded operationalization. Which visual features are necessary and sufficient to see animacy? At which level of the visual hierarchy does the animate-inanimate distinction emerge? Here, we show that the animate-inanimate distinction is preserved even among images of objects that are made unrecognizable and only retain low- and mid-level visual features of their natural version. In particular, in three experiments, healthy human adults saw rapid sequences of images (6 Hz) where every five exemplars of a category (i.e., animate), an exemplar of another category (i.e., inanimate) was shown (1.2 Hz). Using frequency-tagging electroencephalography (ftEEG), we found significant neural responses at 1.2 Hz, indicating rapid and automatic detection of the periodic categorical change. Moreover, such effect was found -although increasingly weaker- for  impoverished stimulus-sets that retained only certain (high-, mid-or low-level) features of the original colorful images (i.e., grayscale, texform and phase-scrambled images), and even if the images were unrecognizable. Similar effects were found with two Deep Neural networks (DNNs) presented with the same stimulus-sets. In sum, reliable categorization effects for dramatically impoverished and unrecognizable images, in humans EEG and DNN data, demonstrate that animacy representation emerges early in the visual hierarchy and is remarkably resilient to the loss of visual information."
"Microglia critically shape neuronal circuit development and function, yet their region-specific properties and roles in distinct circuits of the human brain remain poorly understood. In this study, we generated region-specific brain organoids (cortical, striatal, and midbrain), each integrated with human microglia, to fill this critical gap. Single-cell RNA sequencing uncovered six distinct microglial subtypes exhibiting unique regional signatures, including a subtype highly enriched for the GABAB receptor gene within striatal organoids. To investigate the contributions of microglia to neural circuitry, we created microglia-incorporated midbrain-striatal assembloids, modeling a core circuit node for many neuropsychiatric disorders including autism. Using chemogenetics to activate this midbrain-striatal circuit, we observed increased calcium signaling in microglia involving GABAB receptors. Leveraging this model, we examined microglial responses within neural circuits harboring an SCN2A nonsense (C959X) mutation associated with profound autism. Remarkably, microglia displayed heightened calcium responses to SCN2A mutation-mediated neuronal hyperactivity, and engaged in excessive synaptic pruning. These pathological effects were reversed by pharmacological inhibition of microglial GABAB receptors. Collectively, our findings establish an advanced platform to dissect human neuroimmune interactions in sub-cortical regions, highlighting the important role of microglia in shaping critical circuitry related to neuropsychiatric disorders.

"Development of the mammalian lung requires formation of a definitive lung bud from the foregut endoderm, branching morphogenesis, specification of a proximal to distal axis, and differentiation of extensive specialized airway and alveolar epithelial lineages. These steps require coordinated temporal and regional gene expression to define the lung epithelium in preparation for the first breath at birth. While the transcriptional and signaling regulators required for lung development are increasingly well known, the key epigenetic complexes that interact with lineage transcription factors for cell-specific control of gene expression remain to be defined. Here, we identify a key role for the canonical BAF complex, an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex, during lung epithelial development. Loss of canonical BAF activity throughout the foregut endoderm leads to complete failure of lung formation, and selective deletion of a single key subunit, ARID1A, leads to failure of proximal-distal axis specification, with dilated airway-like structures lined by ectopic basal cells found throughout the distal lung, and failure of specification of alveolar type 1 (AT1) cells in the distal saccular epithelium. In place of AT1 cells, we identified a highly proliferative epithelial cell state defined by joint activation of YAP and WNT signaling and loss of BMP signaling response, leading to increased proliferation and failure of appropriate epithelial differentiation. These changes resulted in secondary failure of mesenchymal and endothelial specification, leading to broad loss of patterning of the distal lung further disrupting peripheral lung morphogenesis. Using embryonic lung organoids, we demonstrate that exogenous BMP4 signaling is sufficient to rescue AT1 and AT2 cell differentiation in ARID1A-null epithelium, while WNT and YAP signaling require functional BAF complex. Together, these data demonstrate a requirement for the BAF complex for lung formation, proximal-distal patterning, and cell fate acquisition, and reveal surprising differential specificity between signaling pathways during lung development.

"Neuromesodermal competent progenitors (NMCs) are located in the caudal epiblast near the node and primitive streak and give rise to spinal cord and somitic mesoderm during trunk and tail elongation. Their self-renewal depends on an autoregulatory loop involving Wnt3a and Fgf signaling, and the Tbxt and Cdx transcription factors, but the mechanisms underlying loop formation and the establishment of the niche are poorly understood. Here, we identify the zinc-finger transcription factors Sp5 and Sp8 (Sp5/8) as essential regulators of NMC maintenance. Sp5/8 expression is controlled by Wnt, Fgf and retinoic acid signaling, and they cooperate with Tbxt, Tcf7 and Cdx2 to sustain a robust autoregulatory network that promotes high Wnt/Fgf and low retinoic acid activity in the niche. These factors bind a novel enhancer essential for Wnt3a expression and feedback-loop integrity. Mechanistically, Sp5/8 regulate the dynamic exchange of activating and repressive Tcf complexes at Wnt-responsive enhancers. Our findings define a transcriptional module centered on Sp5/8 that stabilizes niche signaling and transcriptional circuitry essential for NMC fate decisions and trunk development."
"The mechanisms driving the spatial organisation of early human societies in Africa are typically addressed through climate variables 1-3. However, genetic and archaeological studies have also suggested diseases as a major source of selection in the Pleistocene. Here, we explore whether P. falciparum-induced malaria, a major world disease, drove habitat choice in human societies between 74 and 5 thousand years ago (kya). Using species distribution models of three main mosquito complexes with palaeoclimatic reconstructions and combining the results with epidemiological information, we estimated an index of malaria transmission risk in sub-Saharan Africa through time. We then correlated it with an independent reconstruction of the human niche over the same time period and region. Our results show that humans strongly avoided or were unsuccessful in potential malaria hotspots. The effects of these choices shaped human demography for the last 74 kya, and likely much earlier, by fragmenting human societies over time and contributing to the formation of modern population structure. Our results highlight the importance of considering disease distributions when modelling estimates of past human demography, demonstrating that factors beyond climate underlay patterns of human habitat choice, exchange, and dispersal.

Sentence summaryMalaria shaped human habitat choice, exchange, and dispersal since the late Pleistocene in sub-Saharan Africa."
"The evolution of the nervous system has been shrouded in controversy since the onset of the genomics era. A large part of this controversy stems from the lack of phylogenetic consensus for the main branches of the animal tree, where often animals with nervous systems do not form a monophyletic group. However, this question can be informed from other non-phylogenetic perspectives, such as comparative genomics. Here we ask how similar are genes differentially expressed in neurons across a representative set of eight animals with a nervous system, and tally the presence or absence of their homologs in 10 animals and two choanoflagellates. We show that proteins from 39 families are differentially expressed in all neurons, regardless of the phylogenetic placement of their lineage, and that the majority of these gene families are present in the (unicellular) closest relatives of animals, choanoflagellates. We found that the members of these 39 gene families are enriched in domains for ion transport and juxtacrine signalling, and that there is one gene family of zinc-dependent extracellular matrix-remodelling proteins which is only found in animals bearing a nervous system. Our results show that common genetic toolkits are in place for the function of nervous systems. We identify a large number of potential new genomic markers linked to the nervous system and hope they can complement ongoing research efforts to better understand this quintessentially animal system."
"The accumulation of abnormal tau protein selectively affects distinct brain regions and specific populations of neurons and glial cells in tau-related dementias, such as Alzheimers disease (AD), Picks disease (PiD), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Although the three disorders share the feature of tau protein pathology, the regulatory circuitry of non-coding genetic variants underlying risk-associated cell states remains to be elucidated. Using paired single-nucleus profiling of chromatin accessibility and gene expression across AD, PiD, and PSP, we define cell-type-specific cis-regulatory elements (CREs) across six cell types and fifty subclasses. Comparing disease-dynamic CREs across three disorders, we find that glia overrepresent disorder-specific gene regulation related to dynamic cellular response to stress. We show that human genetic variants affecting microglial gene regulation converge into distinct and co-regulated modules affecting specific cellular functions. Moreover, polygenic risk modifiers are maximally co-accessible in disorder-specific glial states, modifying distinct pathways such as sphingomyelin regulation in PiD. Our study informs glial regulators linked to polygenic modifiers of primary tauopathy, introducing modifiable pathways governing resilience for therapeutic consideration."
"CHD8 mutations cause autism spectrum disorder, cognitive deficits, and macrocephaly. Chd8+/- mouse models exhibit macrocephaly and transcriptional pathology, with inconsistent findings regarding neurogenesis, neuron function, and behavior. Via stereology and single nuclei transcriptomics (snRNA-seq), we found increased Chd8+/-cortical volume was not explained by increase in neuron number. Differential expression (DE) was present across cortical cell types, with excitatory neurons exhibiting high DE burden and shared and subclass-specific DE signatures. Bulk RNA-seq DE of constitutive Chd8+/- and conditional Camk2a-Cre Chd8+/- mice identified shared transcriptional pathology. DE in synaptosomal versus nuclear mRNA identified overlapping DEGs, but also significant differences and exaggerated synaptosomal changes. Building on DE findings implicating glutamatergic neurons, we found Chd8+/- mice exhibited altered excitatory neuron spine density and dynamics, decreased GCaMP activity correlation, and sleep perturbation. Thus, Chd8 haploinsufficiency causes lasting excitatory neuron dysfunction, perturbs RNA regulation beyond transcription, and impacts neuronal properties, cortical microcircuits, and behavior."
"Tibetan adaptation to high-altitude hypoxia remains a classic example of Darwinian selection in humans. To identify adaptive traits that might have evolved in Tibetans in response to long-term exposure to hypoxia, we previously established a library of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), derived from Tibetan and Han Chinese individuals, as a robust model system for the exploration of condition-specific molecular and cellular responses. We used this system to characterize and compare the transcriptome of iPSC-derived endothelial cells and found that angiogenesis, energy metabolism and immune pathways differ between the cell lines from these two populations. Here, we harness the same experimental system to characterize and compare the transcriptome of iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes in Tibetan and Han Chinese in hypoxia. We find that several pathways, such as the hypoxia, myogenesis and glycolysis pathways, are significantly enriched for differentially expressed genes across populations. These pathways are candidate targets of natural selection due to exposure to the high-altitude hypoxic environment and point to adaptive cardiac traits such as sustained cardiac function in hypoxia. A better understanding of these adaptations may offer insights into novel therapeutic strategies for hypoxia-related cardiovascular conditions, such as pulmonary hypertension and ischemic heart disease."

"Centromeres are specialized chromosome regions essential for sister chromatid cohesion and spindle attachment during mitosis. Many centromeres comprise highly variable, megabase-scale satellite DNA arrays, yet the mutation spectrum driving this variability remains poorly understood. Using replicated genome assemblies of six Arabidopsis mutation accumulation lines, we identified centromeric mutations consisting almost exclusively of point mutations and structure-preserving, in-frame indels spanning a few kilobases. Centromeric point mutations occurred at a ninefold higher rate (6.1x10-8/bp/gen) than in chromosome arms, frequently introduced by non-allelic gene conversions from closely linked repeat units. Forward-in-time simulations based on the observed mutation spectrum recapitulated the emergence of megabase-scale higher-order repeat (HOR) structures, including long-range sequence similarities, without requiring large-scale rearrangements, closely mirroring centromeric divergence among natural genomes. Our results show that centromere evolution is driven by a unique mutational spectrum, providing a quantitative framework to understand how small-scale mutations shape and maintain the large-scale architecture of centromeric DNA."
"PANoptosis, as a new type of programmed cell death, is characterized by pyroptosis, apoptosis and necroptosis, and is a key mechanism causing a variety of inflammatory diseases. Despite the growing number of studies indicating the crucial role of PANoptosis in sepsis, there has been no bibliometric analysis of the research hotspots and trends in this field. Therefore, this study aims to explore the history, research hotspots and emerging trends of PANoptosis in sepsis related research in the past 20 years from the perspective of structure and temporal dynamics. The articles related to PANoptosis in sepsis were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database from 2000 to 2024. CiteSpace and HistCite were used to analyse the historical features, the evolution of active topics, and emerging trends about PANoptosis in sepsis. 6165 original articles and reviews on PANoptosis in sepsis were included in the bibliometric analysis. In the last 20 years, the number of published documents is increasing year by year and reaches a peak in 2022. At the same time, many activation themes have emerged at different times, as evidenced by a total of 96 categories, 865 keywords and 629 reference bursts. Keyword clustering anchored eight emerging research subfields, namely 0# oxidative stress, 1#pyroptosis, 2#sepsis-associated encephalopathy, 3#acute kidney injury, 4#immunosuppression, 5#necroptosis, 7#lung injury and 8#extracellular vesicles. The keyword alluvial map shows that the most persistent research concepts in this field are phosphatase. And the emerging keywords are toll_like_receptors, regulatory T cells, recognition, etc. In a timeline visualization based on the time span of the citations, we find five relevant emerging topics, namely 1# immunosuppression, 2# sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy, 3# pyroptosis, 4# acute kidney injury, and 13# COVID-19. Our study provides a comprehensive bibliometric analysis and summary about the current status and trends on PANoptosis in sepsis, which will aid researchers in conducting further scientific research in this field."
"MotivationPhylogenetic trees describe the evolutionary history among biological species based on their genomic data. Maximum Likelihood (ML) based phylogenetic inference tools search for the tree and evolutionary model that best explain the observed genomic data. Given the independence of likelihood score calculations between different genomic sites, parallel computation is commonly deployed. This is followed by a parallel summation over the per-site scores to obtain the overall likelihood score of the tree. However, basic arithmetic operations on IEEE 754 floating-point numbers, such as addition and multiplication, inherently introduce rounding errors. Consequently, the order by which floating-point operations are executed affects the exact resulting likelihood value since these operations are not associative. Moreover, parallel reduction algorithms in numerical codes re-associate operations as a function of the core count and cluster network topology, inducing different round-off errors. These low-level deviations can cause heuristic searches to diverge and induce high-level result discrepancies (e.g., yield topologically distinct phylogenies). This effect has also been observed in multiple scientific fields, beyond phylogenetics.

ResultsWe observe that varying the degree of parallelism results in diverging phylogenetic tree searches (high level results) for over 31% out of 10 130 empirical datasets. More importantly, 8% of these diverging datasets yield trees that are statistically significantly worse than the best known ML tree for the dataset (AU-test, p < 0.05). To alleviate this, we develop a variant of the widely used phylogenetic inference tool RAxML-NG, which does yield bit-reproducible results under varying core-counts, with a slowdown of only 0 to 12.7% (median 0.8%) on up to 768 cores. We further introduce the ReproRed reduction algorithm, which yields bit-identical results under varying core-counts, by maintaining a fixed operation order that is independent of the communication pattern. ReproRed is thus applicable to all associative reduction operations - in contrast to competitors, which are confined to summation. Our ReproRed reduction algorithm only exchanges the theoretical minimum number of messages, overlaps communication with computation, and utilizes fast base-cases for local reductions. ReproRed is able to all-reduce (via a subsequent broadcast) 4.1 x 106 operands across 48 to 768 cores in 19.7 to 48.61 {micro}s, thereby exhibiting a slowdown of 13 to 93% over a non-reproducible all-reduce algorithm. ReproRed outperforms the state-of-the-art reproducible all-reduction algorithm ReproBLAS (offers summation only) beyond 10 000 elements per core. In summary, we re-assess non-reproducibility in parallel phylogenetic inference, present the first bit-reproducible parallel phylogenetic inference tool, as well as introduce a general algorithm and open-source code for conducting reproducible associative parallel reduction operations.

"Feline intestinal lymphoma is the most common gastrointestinal neoplasm in cats and presents variable biological behavior and treatment responses. Despite its clinical importance, reliable prognostic biomarkers for this neoplasm are still lacking. This study aimed to investigate the immunohistochemical expression of Ki-67, BAX, caspase-3, and VEGF-A in feline intestinal lymphoma and evaluate their potential associations with overall survival and response to chemotherapy. Thirty cases of feline intestinal lymphoma were retrospectively analyzed. Clinical data, histopathological classification (lymphocytic vs. lymphoblastic), and immunophenotyping (B-vs. T-cell origin) were assessed. Immunohistochemistry was performed to evaluate the expression levels of Ki-67, BAX, caspase-3, and VEGF-A, which were classified as high or low. Associations between biomarker expression, lymphoma subtype, treatment status, and overall survival were analyzed via Kaplan-Meier curves and statistical comparisons. Most cases were of T-cell origin (22/30), with 17 classified as lymphocytic and 13 as lymphoblastic lymphoma. Chemotherapy significantly increased overall survival (p = 0.0008). Low expression of BAX (p = 0.0032), high expression of Ki-67 (p = 0.0184), and low expression of caspase-3 (p = 0.0222) were associated with reduced survival. VEGF-A expression was not significantly associated with survival (p = 0.0556), although a trend toward worse prognosis in high-expression cases was observed. When biomarker expression was analyzed in conjunction with chemotherapy status, the prognostic value of each marker was enhanced, with all the markers showing significant associations with survival (p < 0.0001). BAX, caspase-3, and Ki-67 expression levels are associated with prognosis in feline intestinal lymphoma, particularly when considered alongside treatment status. These markers may assist in predicting survival outcomes and tailoring therapeutic strategies in affected cats."
"BackgroundCannabis is one of the most widely used psychoactive substances in the world and is increasingly investigated as a treatment for neuropsychiatric conditions. Cannabis contains delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is thought to underlie its main psychoactive effects, and cannabidiol (CBD), which has been proposed to modulate the effects of THC on the brain. Both have activity at CB1 receptors, whilst THC also binds to CB2 receptors. However, it is unclear how THCs effects on brain function are related to cannabinoid receptors, or how CBD co-administration affects this. We aimed to investigate the effects of vaporised THC and the moderating effects of CBD on CB1 and CB2 receptor- enriched functional connectivity.

MethodsForty-eight participants (24 adolescents and 24 adults) who used cannabis 0.5-3 days/week (mean=1.5 days/week) participated in a randomised, crossover, placebo- controlled, double-blind experiment where they inhaled vaporised cannabis containing either THC-only (8mg/75kg person), THC+CBD (8 mg THC + 24 mg CBD/75 kg person) or no psychoactive compounds (placebo). Resting-state functional MRI data were collected approximately 50 minutes post-administration. Receptor distribution maps were derived from positron emission tomography (PET) imaging for CB1 receptors and the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA) for CB2 receptors. Receptor-Enriched Analysis of Connectivity by Targets (REACT) analytical methodology was used to investigate changes in functional connectivity related to specific receptor targets.

ResultsInhalation of both THC-only and THC+CBD cannabis induced significant decreases in CB1 and CB2 receptor-enriched functional connectivity compared to placebo. The THC+CBD condition showed more extensive reductions than THC-only cannabis for both CB1- and CB2- enriched functional connectivity, affecting regions including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, cingulate cortex, insula, hippocampus, amygdala, and putamen. Higher THC plasma levels were associated with greater decreases in functional connectivity in the THC+CBD condition. Exploratory analyses identified significant positive and negative relationships between subjective drug effects and receptor-enriched functional connectivity in a region- dependent manner.

ConclusionsCannabis with and without CBD decreased resting-state functional connectivity in networks associated with CB1 and CB2 receptor distribution. Co-administration of CBD with THC appears to enhance these effects. The REACT analytical methodology identified changes in CB1- and CB2-enriched functional connectivity are related to THC and CBD plasma levels as well as subjective drug effects across a range of regions."
"Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) of H5 and H7 subtypes has emerged as one of the most important zoonotic pathogens in the 21st century with significant economic consequences. The recent outbreak of H5N1 avian influenza (AI) in dairy cattle highlighted the importance of early detection in managing and mitigating HPAIV outbreaks. A successful high-speed diagnostic response requires rapid site and specimen access, minimal time for test protocols, and prompt communication of the diagnostic results to government officials. A new diagnostic paradigm that consists of miniaturized extractor and qPCR instruments (EZextractor and EZcycler MiniQ), designed for mobile, on-site testing has been compared with a platform of benchtop instruments (QIAGEN RNeasy and QuantStudio 5) for detecting inactivated H5 avian influenza virus (AIV) spiked in raw milk samples. Two sets of experiments were performed: 1) 15 raw milk samples, obtained from 15 different farms, diluted with phosphate-buffered saline and spiked with the virus to reach approximately 10 copies/mcL virus concentration, and 2) raw milk samples from two farms, each spiked with the inactivated AIV H5 followed by 5 series of dilution to reach AIV concentrations of 1000, 100, 10, 1 and 0.1 copies/mcL. Results show that despite the inhibitors in raw milk, AIV in all samples can be detected by both platforms. The MT platform showed higher sensitivity than the benchtop platform: the Ct values from the MT were ~2 units lower than the benchtop Ct values. Our findings demonstrate the robustness of the MT platform for diagnosing AIV H5 in raw milk samples and support its use as an on-site diagnostic for rapid surveillance and response."

"Transcripts derived from centromere repeats play a critical role in the localization and activity of kinetochore components during mitosis such that disruption of RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription compromises the fidelity of chromosome segregation. Here, we show that the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (RB), a critical regulator of the G1/S cell cycle transition, additionally plays an important role in the regulation of centromere transcription during mitosis. We find that cells lacking RB experience increased RNA Polymerase II activity at mitotic centromeres and a corresponding increase in nascent RNA transcripts derived from centromere sequences. Together with high levels of centromere transcription and corresponding R-loop formation, RB-deficient cells exhibit centromere DNA breaks and local activation of ATR that correspond with increased centromere localization of Aurora B, destabilization of kinetochore-microtubule attachments, and an increase in anaphase defects. Importantly, reduction of DNA damage, ATR activity, and mitotic defects following inhibition of RNA Pol II, or targeted repression of centromere transcription through centromere tethering of Suv420H2, support that mitotic defects in RB-deficient cells are linked to centromere transcription."
"The gut microbiota produces numerous metabolites that influence the epithelial barrier function. Bacterial catabolism of amino acids produces a wide variety of metabolites whose effects on the intestinal epithelium remain to be fully identified. In this study, we investigated the effects of amino acid derived metabolites (isovalerate, isobutyrate, 2-methylbutyrate, 5-aminovalerate, cadaverine, putrescine, and tryptamine) in cell monolayers derived from porcine ileum organoids. Our results show that the leucine-derived branched-chain fatty acid (BCFA) isovalerate improved the epithelial barrier function, as assessed by transepithelial electrical resistance measurement and permeability assay. Isovalerate upregulated the expression of genes involved in innate immunity, markers of absorptive cells and enteroendocrine cells while reducing the expression of the stem cells and mucus related genes. Most of the effects of isovalerate on epithelial cells were also observed with the bacterial metabolite butyrate, an inhibitor of the epigenetic enzymes histone deacetylases (HDAC). Furthermore, the structurally unrelated HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A improved epithelial barrier function and upregulated SLPI gene expression, as observed with isovalerate and butyrate. Isovalerate also upregulated the gene expression of antioxidant enzymes and this effect was not observed with butyrate. Interestingly, the other two BCFAs isobutyrate and 2-methylbutyrate did not replicate the effects of isovalerate, suggesting that the carbon chain structure of isovalerate mediates its effect. In contrast, we found that all three BCFAs were able to cross the epithelial cell monolayer derived from porcine ileum organoids from the apical to the basal side. Overall, our in vitro results suggest that targeting the bacterial production of isovalerate may be useful to promote gut health. In this perspective, we performed an in silico analysis that identified species belonging to dominant gut microbiota genera such as Prevotella, Blautia, Christensenella, Clostridium, and Ruminococcus, as potential producers of BCFAs through the PorA enzymatic pathway."
"Liver progenitor cells (LPCs) are the smallest cholangiocytes that perform hepatocyte functions to rescue the lives of patients suffering from acute liver failure (ALF) caused by massive hepatic necrosis (MHN). To date, it remains largely unknown how LPCs remain quiescent and become activated following MHN. This study elucidates the essential role of TGF-{beta} in regulating LPC quiescence and activation. Spatial transcriptomics analysis of liver tissues from four MHN-ALF patients revealed that LPCs receive multiple active signals from surrounding macrophages and hepatic stellate cells, including TGF-{beta}, HGF, and EGF. Physiologically, TGF-{beta} inhibits LPC proliferation by impeding G1-S phase transition. Ectopic Smad7 expression remarkably increased LPC proliferation in 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine-fed mice. Intriguingly, extensive LPC proliferation was observed in ALF patients despite robust TGF-{beta}-p-SMAD2 signaling in activated LPCs. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence revealed significantly elevated expression of p-MET, p-STAT3, p-EGFR, and p-ERK in LPCs, indicating active HGF and EGF signaling. In vitro, either HGF or EGF promoted LPC proliferation despite the presence of TGF-{beta}. Beyond acting as mitogens, HGF and EGF regulate master hepatocyte genes (e.g., HNF4) and cholangiocyte genes (e.g., SOX9) in LPCs. Notably, HGF-dependent HNF4 required TGF-{beta}-activated SMADs. Collectively, TGF-{beta} serves as a critical signaling determinant of LPC fate and function."
"Tissue-intrinsic surveillance systems play an important role in maintaining tissue health by detecting and eliminating aberrant cells. One such system,  interface surveillance, is activated by differences in cell fate programs between neighboring cells. Activation of interface surveillance drives separation and elimination of aberrant cells by recruitment of actin regulators and Myosin II to neighboring cell contacts, as well as activation of JNK signaling and apoptosis in cells at this interface. Here, we uncover the role of long Toll receptors (Toll-2, Toll-6, Toll-7, Toll-8) as key mediators of interface surveillance in Drosophila wing imaginal discs. Using genetic mosaics combined with spatial mapping of Toll receptor expression patterns, we demonstrate that differences in long Toll receptor expression levels between neighboring cells trigger all hallmark responses of interface surveillance. This response is position-dependent and relies on the comparison of expression levels established by cell-fate-specifying programs. Specifically, we show that the expression of long Toll receptors is regulated by multiple fate-patterning pathways, giving rise to a combinatorial cell surface code that is deregulated in developmentally aberrant or oncogenic cells. Remarkably, Toll receptor-mediated surveillance operates independently of canonical NF-{kappa}B signaling, and rather mirrors a distinct role of long Toll receptors in modulating cell-cell affinity via actomyosin dynamics during early embryogenesis. Our findings identify long Toll receptors as integrators of developmental patterning and tissue homeostasis mechanisms and provide insights into how tissues detect and respond to potentially oncogenic mutations that misregulate cell fate specification pathways."
"Cell and extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions are essential for maintaining tissue function and homeostasis. Changes in the biochemical or mechanical properties of the ECM can lead to diseases such as fibrosis or cancer. In a 3D microenvironment, cell-matrix interaction is vital to how cells sense and respond to biochemical and biophysical cues. This study examines the reciprocal interactions between fibroblasts and collagen in 3D hydrogels. We quantitatively measured changes in collagen branch number and junctions in 3D hydrogels using confocal reflectance microscopy and existing analysis protocols. This reveals the impact small changes in collagen concertation (1.0 vs 1.5 mg/ml) over time (15 minutes to 4 hours) have on 3D gels. Embedded in 3D hydrogels, wild-type mouse fibroblasts differentially affect collagen organisation in their immediate proximity with changing concentration and time. This regulation is interestingly lost in Caveolin-1 null fibroblasts with altered stiffness, mechanosensing and cytoskeletal regulation. Inhibition of the Rho-ROCK pathway (known to be changed in Caveolin-1 null fibroblasts) drives cellular protrusions and concentration-dependent 3D collagen organisation in wildtype fibroblasts, but surprisingly not in Caveolin-1 null fibroblasts. This depends on dynamin-dependent endocytosis, which, when inhibited, disrupts ROCK-dependent protrusions and alters collagen organisation in 3D collagen. Together, these observations quantitatively demonstrate how cells respond at the cell-matrix interphase to subtle changes in collagen concentration and organisation in 3D hydrogels, regulated by the presence of Caveolin-1.

Statement of SignificanceThis study highlights the critical role of Caveolin-1 in cell-mediated regulation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in a 3D microenvironment. Using confocal reflectance microscopy, we demonstrate that subtle changes in collagen concentration significantly influence collagen organisation over time. While wild-type fibroblasts exhibit dynamic, concentration-dependent regulation of the cell-matrix interphase, Caveolin-1 null fibroblasts lose this regulation. Furthermore, Rho-ROCK pathway inhibition promotes protrusions and collagen reorganisation in wild-type cells but not Caveolin-1 null fibroblasts. Dynamin-dependent endocytosis also emerges as a key modulator of this process. These findings provide quantitative insights into how mechanosensing and cytoskeletal regulation, dependent on endocytosis can control the cell-matrix interphase, with possible implications for understanding disease-associated matrix changes."

"Deep Learning methods such as Deep Representation Learning (DRL) and, specifically, the Variational Autoencoder (VAE), have been widely used to handle the high dimensionality of available datasets. Hence, these methods have been applied to study cancer through omics data. Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and its complex and dynamic nature makes it especially difficult to study. However, the temporal dimension of cancer progression is a target that has not been tackled. In this systematic literature review, we explore the use of DRL, particularly the VAE, in cancer studies with omics data in a temporal context. Our research reveals that the most common uses of the VAE in cancer studies are related to subtyping, diagnosis, and prognosis. Meanwhile, cancers temporal aspect is often overlooked, namely, because of the lack of longitudinal data. We propose that applying the VAE as a generative model to study cancer in time, for example, focusing on cancer staging, will lead to meaningful advancements in our understanding of cancer."
"Inter-receptor interactions play a key role in receptor signaling, which is the first step in cell signaling in response to external stimuli. In the case of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor 2 (VEGFR2), dimerization is necessary for activation. VEGFR2 undergoes reversible interactions also in the absence of ligand. For a quantitative understanding of transmembrane signal transduction, it is necessary to quantify the interaction kinetics of VEGFR2 on the cell surface. Live-cell single-molecule imaging (SMI) has the powerful ability to capture receptor interaction events in their native cellular environment with high spatiotemporal resolution. However, it reveals these interactions for only the labeled subset, which is a small fraction of the full population of receptors. We have previously shown that mathematical modeling, combined with SMI data, offers a route to compensate for this lost information and infer the population-level receptor interaction kinetics from SMI data. Here, we applied this approach to VEGFR2, both wildtype full length VEGFR2 (FLR2) and a truncated mutant consisting of its extracellular and transmembrane domains (ECTM), which has been shown to exhibit reduced homotypic interactions in the absence of ligand. We developed a stochastic mathematical model mimicking VEGFR2 diffusion and interactions and determined the unknown model parameters through a combination of direct experimental measurements and stochastic model calibration. We found that a model of dimerization was sufficient to describe VEGFR2 interactions in the absence of ligand. While ECTM was primarily monomeric, FLR2 exhibited a substantial fraction of dimers. Our inference revealed that the difference between FLR2 and ECTM was primarily in the dimer association rate constant, which was about an order of magnitude lower for ECTM than for FLR2. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the interaction kinetics of VEGFR2 have been calculated in live cells.

Author summaryInteractions between receptors on the cell surface play a large role in the initiation and modulation of cell signaling. For example, the receptor VEGFR2 in vascular endothelial cells must dimerize as a first step toward signaling. However, many interactions, including VEGFR2 dimerization, also take place in the absence of ligand stimulation. Therefore, elucidating when and where receptor interactions take place, and what their kinetics are, is critical for understanding receptor and cell signaling, especially on a quantitative level. Determining interaction kinetics is particularly challenging, given that membrane proteins do not express well in vitro, and are thus not amenable to traditional biophysical methods that quantify molecular interactions. In addition, the membrane and cellular environment is much more complex than an in vitro setting. To address these challenges, we combine single-molecule imaging, stochastic mathematical modeling, and rigorous model calibration to derive the dimerization kinetics of VEGFR2 (both full-length and a truncation mutant with reduced dimerization) on the surface of live cells. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the interaction kinetics of VEGFR2 have been calculated in live cells. Our approach is generalizable to many other cell surface proteins, opening an avenue for quantifying molecular interaction kinetics in situ."
"In this study, we reveal that macrophage-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) can trigger the rapid formation of Salmonella aggresomes, which substantially contribute to the increased frequency of persisters induced by phagocytosis. Salmonella containing aggresomes exhibited a dormant phenotype characterized by reduced adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels and decreased metabolic activity. Furthermore, these dormant bacteria showed upregulated expression of Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI-1)-encoded type III secretion system (T3SS)-related genes, followed by later expression of SPI-2 T3SS-related genes when macrophages ROS production declined. Our results demonstrate that Salmonella containing aggresomes can enter a dormant state to escape antibiotic attack, while crucially maintaining the ability to resuscitate when the stress environment is improved. Research on bacterial aggresomes could potentially provide therapeutic strategies to combat bacterial antibiotic persistence.

"Muscle-invasive bladder cancer is a diverse disease where subtyping is ambiguous. Gene expression profiling followed by unsupervised machine learning (ML) has broadened our understanding of tumour biology, but has failed to provide high-confidence clinically-actionable subgroups. To focus on tissue-specific urothelial biology, we generated co-expression networks from histologically normal bladder, including multiple differentiation states and prioritising transcription factors (TFs). This strategy revealed an emergent set of 98 TFs which we used to stratify The Cancer Genome Atlas bladder cancer cohort, revealing a subdivision of basal tumours characterised by the detoxification and glutaminolysis activity of NRF2, rendering them resistant to standard bladder cancer interventions. These 20 tumours (4.9%) expressed squamous markers, were highly aggressive (15% 2-year survival), and had signatures of active PI3K, MTOR and retinoic acid signalling. Intriguingly, only half of the subgroup had activating mutations in the NRF2/KEAP1 pathway, whilst half of putative driver NFE2L2 mutations were excluded. This highlighted the importance of expression-based classification, particularly as re-analysis of NFE2L2-mutated lung cancer trial data showed only mutations consistent with our classification strategy responded to NRF2 inhibition. Our approach provides the first direct evidence that unsupervised ML can be biologically-informative in identifying clinically-actionable subgroups."
"Microbially induced corrosion (MIC) costs trillions of dollars yearly by damaging metal infrastructure. MIC occurs when microorganisms oxidize solid elemental metals using redox-active metabolites such as phenazines, which create soluble metal ions. Phenazine-mediated corrosion has been well studied for iron. Whether such pathways can solubilize the economically critical metal cobalt through thermodynamically favourable reactions remains unknown. We hypothesized that Co(0) corrosion by the model bacterium Pseudomonas chlororaphis subspecies aureofaciens depends on phenazine availability. To test this hypothesis, we compared the corrosion of Co(0) wires and phenazine production over one-week incubations with either wild-type cells or a deletion mutant devoid of the phz operon incapable of phenazine biosynthesis. All experiments with live cells were compared to abiotic controls with spent medium, phenazine standards, and sterile medium. Soluble Co(2+) concentrations measured with ICP-MS showed that live cells were essential to cobalt corrosion. The wild-type and {Delta}phz mutant corroded 30-40% of the wire mass [equivalent to [~] 2,500 {micro}M soluble Co(2+)], which was at least 3-fold higher than mass losses for abiotic controls. Both strains decreased wire diameters and produced considerable pitting compared to abiotic controls imaged with SEM-EDX. Cobalt corrosion could be slowed through Co(2+) toxicity and cobalt oxide precipitation. These findings counter studies with iron and biosynthetic gene cluster analyses suggest that corrosion occurred through alternative mechanisms that rely on metal-binding ligand production. This work expands the repertoire of metals solubilized by MIC and shows that MIC can be used for critical metal recovery at the lab scale.

ImportanceMicrobially induced corrosion costs trillions of dollars yearly by damaging iron-bearing infrastructure but whether it affects the critical metal cobalt is unexplored. This is important to address to better understand the processes that control the environmental fate cobalt and leverage biological corrosion towards metal reclamation. This study uses the model Pseudomonas chlororaphis subspecies aureofaciens to test if the production of widely produced redox active phenazines metabolites can corrode elemental cobalt. We repeatedly observed cells corrode cobalt even in the absence of phenazines. We showed that cobalt toxicity and precipitation of cobalt oxides limited corrosion through mechanisms that will be characterized in future work. This study underscores the need to consider corrosion mechanisms beyond those reported for iron. Confirming these mechanisms will be critical to optimizing sustainable recovery strategies that rely on microbially induced corrosion to recover cobalt from electronic waste, which is a global pollution issue."
"N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is one of the most prevalent post-transcriptional modifications of eukaryotic RNA molecules. This post-transcriptional modification is essential in biological contexts ranging from metabolism to cellular differentiation and neuronal function. While the role of m6A RNA regulation in the soma of planarian flatworms has been previously studied, the presence and biological relevance of this regulatory pathway in the germline of these or other lophotrochozoans remains unknown. Here, we characterize m6A RNA regulation factors in the planarian Schmidtea mediterranea and analyze their function in development of the germline. Enriched expression of orthologs of m6A methyltransferase complex components, namely Smed-METTL3, Smed-METTL14, and WTAP, was detected in ovaries and testes of S. mediterranea. Perturbation of these factors by RNA-interference (RNAi) disrupted intermediate steps in oogenesis and spermatogenesis, but the presence of germline stem cells was not affected. Expression of m6A ""reader"" homologs was also detected in the planarian gonads. Sperm development defects were observed upon Smed-YTHDF2-3 RNAi, and combined knockdown of Smed-YTHDF2-3, Smed-YTHDF2-2, or Smed-YTHDF1-2 with that of writers led to increased frequency of germline development defects. These results indicate that regulation of RNA bym6A methylation supports male and female germline development in planarian flatworms."
"AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) plays a key role in restoring cellular metabolic homeostasis after energy stress. Importantly, AMPK acts as a hub of metabolic signaling, integrating multiple inputs and acting on numerous downstream targets to activate catabolic processes and inhibit anabolic ones. Despite the importance of AMPK signaling, unlike other well-studied pathways, such as MAPK/ERK or NF-{kappa}B, only a handful of mechanistic models of AMPK signaling have been developed. Epistemic uncertainty in the biochemical mechanism of AMPK activity, combined with the complexity of the AMPK pathway, makes model development particularly challenging. Here, we leveraged uncertainty quantification methods and recently developed AMPK biosensors to construct a new, data-informed model of AMPK signaling. Specifically, we applied Bayesian parameter estimation and model selection to ensure that model predictions and assumptions are well-constrained to measurements of AMPK activity using recently developed AMPK biosensors. As an application of the new model, we predicted AMPK activity in response to exercise-like stimuli. We found that AMPK acts as a time- and exercise-dependent integrator of its input. Our results highlight how uncertainty quantification can facilitate model development and address epistemic uncertainty in a complex signaling pathway, such as AMPK. This work shows the potential for future applications of uncertainty quantification in systems biology to drive new biological insights by incorporating state-of-the-art experimental data at all stages of model development."
"Gene expression shapes the nervous system at every biological level, from molecular and cellular processes defining neuronal identity and function to systems-level wiring and circuit dynamics underlying behaviour. Here, we generate the first high-resolution, single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the adult Drosophila melanogaster central brain by integrating multiple datasets, achieving an unprecedented tenfold coverage of every neuron in this complex tissue. We show that a neurons genetic identity overwhelmingly reflects its developmental origin, preserving a genetic address based on both lineage and birth order. We reveal foundational rules linking neurogenesis to transcriptional identity and provide a framework for systematically defining neuronal types. This atlas provides a powerful resource for mapping the cellular substrates of behaviour by integrating annotations of hemilineage, cell types/subtypes and molecular signatures of underlying physiological properties. It lays the groundwork for a long-sought bridge between developmental processes and the functional circuits that give rise to behaviour."
"Darwinian evolution of immunoglobulin genes within germinal centers (GC) underlies the progressive increase in antibody affinity following antigen exposure. Whereas the mechanics of how competition between GC B cells drives increased affinity are well established, the dynamical evolutionary features of this process remain poorly characterized. We devised an experimental evolution model in which we ""replay"" over one hundred instances of a clonally homogenous GC reaction and follow the selective process by assigning affinities to all cells using deep mutational scanning. Our data reveal how GCs achieve predictable evolutionary outcomes through the cumulative effects of many rounds of imperfect selection, acting on a landscape shaped heavily by somatic hypermutation (SHM) targeting biases. Using time-calibrated models, we show that apparent features of GC evolution such as permissiveness to low-affinity lineages and early plateauing of affinity are best explained by survivorship biases that distort our view of how affinity progresses over time."
"Beta-lactam antibiotics are widely used to treat bacterial infections, but their efficacy is compromised by resistance mechanisms such as the production of beta-lactamases. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the chromosomally encoded beta-lactamase AmpC is the primary mediator of beta-lactam resistance. ampC expression is regulated by the transcription factor AmpR, which responds to intracellular peptidoglycan (PG) fragments. Under normal conditions, AmpR binds the PG precursor (UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide, UDP-M5) and represses ampC expression. However, during beta-lactam treatment or in PG recycling-deficient mutants such as ampD mutants, PG degradation products (anhydromuropeptides, AMP) accumulate and activate AmpR, resulting in elevated ampC expression and beta-lactam resistance.

We hypothesized that shifting the balance of PG precursors could modulate AmpR activity and suppress beta-lactamase expression, even in derepressed strains. Undecaprenyl phosphate (UndP) is a lipid carrier essential for translocating PG precursors across the bacterial inner membrane. Recent work has identified members of the DedA superfamily as UndP flippases responsible for recycling this lipid carrier. Disruption of UndP recycling leads to cytoplasmic accumulation of UDP-M5, the known AmpR repressor. Here, we show that deletion of dedA4, which encodes a predicted UndP flippase in P. aeruginosa, causes UDP-M5 accumulation and significantly reduces AmpC production and beta-lactam resistance in an ampD mutant. These findings highlight the influence of PG precursor dynamics on beta-lactamase regulation and identify DedA4 as a promising therapeutic target. Inhibiting UndP recycling offers a novel strategy to counteract beta-lactam resistance in P. aeruginosa and potentially other AmpC-producing pathogens.

IMPORTANCEBeta-lactam resistance remains a major clinical challenge, often driven by the overexpression of chromosomally encoded beta-lactamases such as AmpC in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Strategies to limit ampC activation are urgently needed to preserve the efficacy of these frontline antibiotics. Our study identifies DedA4, a membrane protein involved in undecaprenyl phosphate (UndP) recycling, as a potential target for such intervention. Inactivation of DedA4 disrupts UndP transport, leading to the accumulation of soluble, membrane-unbound PG precursors which act as corepressors of AmpC expression. This disruption in the balance between cell wall synthesis and turnover restores susceptibility to {beta}-lactams, even in strains harboring clinically significant resistance mutations such as those in ampD or dacB. Targeting UndP flippases like DedA4 could therefore represent a novel adjuvant strategy to combat AmpC-mediated beta-lactam resistance."
"Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is an inherited retinal disorder characterized by the progressive loss of photoreceptors that currently lacks effective treatment. Here, we investigated the impact of the pathogenic PRPF8-Y2334N variant on neural retina cells in hiPSC-derived retinal organoids. Expression of this variant resulted in photoreceptor defects, including thinning of the outer segment layer. At the molecular level, we observed relatively minor changes in mRNA expression in multiple retinal cells, indicating that neural retina cells are impacted independently of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). We found splicing alterations in genes associated with neural and retinal diseases, including those involved in intraflagellar transport, suggesting that these genes may represent common targets of splicing factor mutations. We further detected the misexpression of several circular RNAs (circRNAs), which could serve as early biomarkers of splicing defects caused by RP mutations. Together, we present a model of RP that recapitulates photoreceptor degeneration and demonstrates that these defects are independent of RPE erosion."
"BACKGROUNDDysregulated myometrial contractility contributes to obstetric complications. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is an important inflammatory regulator in the myometrium and decidua, yet its metabolic dynamics during pregnancy are poorly characterized. This study aimed to profile the expression of S1P metabolic enzymes and receptors, and quantify sphingolipid metabolism in human gestational tissues across pregnancy.

METHODSMyometrium, decidua parietalis, and chorioamnion were collected from women undergoing cesarean sections at term ([&ge;]37 weeks gestation) without labor (TNL), at term with labor (TL), and preterm (<37 weeks gestation) without labor (PTNL). Messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of S1P metabolic enzymes and receptors was assessed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, while sphingolipids were quantified using targeted liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.

RESULTSS1P metabolic enzymes and receptors were differentially expressed across gestational tissues. At TNL, SPHK1 expression was significantly higher in the decidua parietalis than in the chorioamnion and myometrium. The myometrium exhibited the highest mRNA expression of S1P receptors (S1PR1-4) compared to the decidua and chorioamnion. At term, S1P was more abundant in the myometrium than in the decidua parietalis and chorioamnion. Both SPHK1 and S1P were significantly increased in TL compared to TNL myometrium. S1P levels were higher in the myometrium at TNL compared to PTNL, while no significant differences were observed in the decidua and chorioamnion. Overall, sphingolipid metabolism was highest in the decidua and myometrium and lowest in the chorioamnion at term.

CONCLUSIONThese findings reveal tissue-specific regulation of S1P metabolism and signaling in human gestational tissues, suggesting a therapeutic role of S1P in modulating myometrial contractility."
"Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), glycerol-3-phosphate (Gro3P) and reduced/oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH/NAD+) are key metabolites of the Gro3P shuttle system that forms a redox circuit, allowing transfer of reducing equivalents between cytosol and mitochondria. Targeted activation of Gro3P biosynthesis was recently identified as a promising strategy to alleviate reductive stress by promoting NAD+ recycling, including in cells with an impaired mitochondrial complex I. However, because Gro3P constitutes the backbone of triglycerides under some circumstances, its accumulation can lead to excessive fat deposition. Here, we present the development of a novel genetically encoded tool based on a di-domain glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase from algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (CrGPDH), which is a bifunctional enzyme that can recycle NAD+ while converting DHAP to Gro3P. In addition, this enzyme possesses an N-terminal domain which cleaves Gro3P into glycerol and inorganic phosphate (Pi) (in humans and other organisms, this reaction is catalyzed by a separate glycerol-3-phosphate phosphatase, a reaction also known as ""glycerol shunt""). When expressed in mammalian cells, CrGPDH diminished Gro3P levels and boosted the TCA cycle and fatty acid {beta}-oxidation in mitochondria. CrGPDH expression alone supported proliferation of HeLa cells under conditions of either inhibited activity of the mitochondrial electron transport chain or hypoxia. Moreover, human kidney cancer cells, which exhibit abnormal lipid accumulation, had decreased triglycerides levels when expressing CrGPDH. Our findings suggest that the coordinated boosting of both Gro3P biosynthesis and glycerol shunt may be a viable strategy to alleviate consequences of redox imbalance and associated impaired lipogenesis in a wide repertoire of conditions, ranging from primary mitochondrial diseases to obesity, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD)."
"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides 3D spatial information on tissue, yet it lacks at the molecular level. In contrast, histology provides cellular and molecular information, but it lacks the 3D spatial context and direct in vivo translation. Coregistering the two is key for the 3D-embedding of histological details, validating pathological MRI findings, and finding quantitative imaging biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases. However, coregistration is challenging due to non-linear distortions of the tissue from histological processing and sectioning leading to microscopic and macroscopic nonlinear 3D deformations between specimen MRI and stained histology sections. To address this, we developed a novel pipeline, named Brewsters Blockface Quantification (BBQ), integrating robust optical approaches with innovative 2D and 3D registration algorithms to achieve precise volumetric alignment of specimen MRI data with histological images. On a variety of brain tissue specimens from distinct anatomical regions and across multiple species, our methodology generated blockface volumes with minimal distortion and artifacts. Using these blockface volumes as an intermediary, we achieve a precise alignment between MRI and histology slides, yielding registration results with an overlapping Dice score of [~]90% for whole tissue alignment between MRI and blockface volumes, and >95% for 2D MRI-histology registration. This correlative MRI-histology pipeline with robust 2D and 3D coregistration methods promises to enhance our understanding of neurodegenerative diseases and aid the development of MRI-based disease biomarkers."
"Drug metabolism liabilities are a major bottleneck in drug development, necessitating accurate metabolite prediction tools. While AI-driven methods have advanced, challenges remain in achieving high-precision, robustness, broad reaction coverage and seamless integration into the drug development workflow. To address this, we first constructed the most comprehensive human-specific drug metabolism database to date, encompassing 11,665 human metabolic reactions and 2,497 high-quality rules. Leveraging this resource, we developed ConMeter (Contrastive learning and feature interaction based Metabolic Reaction prediction), a novel model integrating chemical feature interaction and contrastive learning. ConMeter demonstrates significant improvements, achieving [~]80% accuracy in identifying at least one metabolite within the top 5 predictions and showing an average 25% relative enhancement in ranking true positives compared to state-of-the-art methods. The comprehensive database also expands the range of predictable metabolic reactions. To demonstrate the utility of ConMeter, we integrated it into a metabolite prediction-guided drug design strategy aimed at addressing the low oral bioavailability of a metabolically vulnerable RSK4 lead compound -- a pervasive issue among known RSK inhibitors. This strategy successfully yielded R636, a novel RSK4 inhibitor exhibiting remarkably improved bioavailability (a 63-fold increase, reaching 63% absolute bioavailability) while maintaining its potent activity. Notably, R636 showed favorable safety profile and significant anti-tumor efficacy against esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) in vitro and in two distinct patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse models. This work introduces ConMeter as a powerful and practical tool for high-accuracy metabolite prediction, demonstrating its potential to accelerate lead optimization, exemplified by the discovery of R636 as a promising orally bioavailable candidate for ESCC."
"Achieving high-resolution spatial tissue proteomes requires careful balancing and integration of optimized sample processing, chromatography, and MS acquisition. Here, we present an advanced cellenONE protocol for loss-reduced tissue processing and compare all Evosep ONE Whisper Zoom gradients (20, 40, 80, and 120 samples per day), along with three common DIA acquisition schemes on a timsUltra AIP mass spectrometer. We found that tissue type was as important as gradient length and sample amount in determining proteome coverage. Moreover, the benefit of increased tissue sampling was gradient- and dynamic range-dependent. Analyzing mouse liver, a high dynamic range tissue, over tenfold more tissue sampling led to only ~30% gain in protein identification for short gradients (120 SPD and 80 SPD). However, even the lowest tested tissue amount (0.04 nL, 40,000 {micro}m3) yielded 3,200 reproducibly quantified proteins for the 120 SPD method. Longer gradients (40 SPD and 20 SPD) instead significantly benefited from more tissue sampling, quantifying over 7,500 proteins from 0.5 nL of tonsil T-cell niches. Finally, we applied our workflow to a rare squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, uncovering disease-associated pathways and region-specific protein level changes. Our study demonstrates that more than 100 high-quality spatial tissue proteomes can be prepared and acquired daily, laying a strong foundation for cohort-size spatial tissue proteomics in translational research."
"While the function of bird song has been well studied in male songbirds, the function of female song is less well understood. This is partly due to a historical view of females occupying a passive role compared with males, which led to ignoring female song even in some well-studied species. We report one such case in yellow warblers (Setophaga petechia), as no other study investigated female song in 35 years after the first documentation of solo female songs. We interrogate the seasonal patterns and functions of female song in Galapagos yellow warblers (Setophaga petechia aureola), in which females perform solo song and produce duets with their male social partners. We carried out simulated territory intrusions by broadcasting male, female, or duet songs during breeding and non-breeding seasons, and conducted a territory retention survey for over a year. We measured the association between aggressive response and singing behaviour, sex-specific patterns of response, and territory retention across years. Females sang mostly during the non-breeding season and predominantly in male-led duets. Although females were strongly aggressive towards female song playback, they gave the weakest singing response towards them. There was no association between female aggressive behaviour and song output in response to a simulated intruder. Moreover, the probability of territory retention across years was not explained by song output or aggression in response to intruders, though evidence for this was weak due to the small sample size. We suggest that female song in this year-round resident island system does not function for territory defense or intrasexual competition, but may have other functions.

HighlightsO_LIGalapagos Yellow Warbler females produce solo songs and duets with their male partners.
C_LIO_LIFemale song and aggression were mainly restricted to the non-breeding season.
C_LIO_LIWhile females were equally aggressive to all intruders, they had the lowest song rate in response to females.

"Cancer remains one of the most critical global health challenges, with early detection being essential for effective treatment and improved survival rates. However, conventional diagnostic tools often fail to detect cancer at early stages due to limitations such as low sensitivity, high cost, and dependence on large tumour presence. Commercial dyes used for imaging are frequently hindered by poor water solubility, toxicity, instability, and high expense. In recent years, CDs have emerged as promising fluorescent probes due to their nanoscale size, tenable surface properties, strong fluorescence, and excellent biocompatibility. make them applicable to various biological applications such as bioimaging, drug delivery, and tissue engineering. In this study, CDs were synthesized using citric acid and ascorbic acid as carbon sources via a reflux method at 130 {degrees}C for 12 hours in a water-ethanol medium. The resulting CDs exhibited high water solubility, strong photostability, and low toxicity. Notably, they effectively distinguished cancerous cells from normal cells. And showing higher uptake in cancer cells due to increased membrane permeability and metabolic activity. Higher uptake means more accumulation within cells that leads to an increment in fluorescence intensity, based on the fluorescent intensity distinguishing the cancer cells and normal cells. These findings highlight the potential of CDs as cost-effective, biocompatible imaging agents for cancer diagnosis and cellular studies."
"Infectious diseases remain a formidable threat to global public health, with their escalating morbidity and mortality rates compounded by recurrent epidemics and the alarming rise of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). These challenges have intensified the urgent demand for innovative therapeutic strategies that can accelerate drug development cycles and overcome traditional research bottlenecks. To address these critical needs, we present IDKG (Infectious Disease Knowledge Graph), a specialized large-scale biomedical knowledge network designed to bridge data fragmentation through multimodal data integration. The IDKG constructs comprehensive associations from 345 infectious diseases and 708 pathogens across heterogeneous biomedical sources systematically. The graph architecture comprises nearly 50,000 nodes (8 types, including Pathogen, Protein, etc.) and over 1.2 million edges (11 types, including treats, contains, etc.), establishing an interconnected framework that enables systematic interrogation of cross-disciplinary knowledge. The integrative approach effectively dismantles conventional data silos while preserving biological contextuality. We validated the IDKGs potential by applying graph neural network-based approaches for drug repurposing prediction in human metapneumovirus (hMPV) infection, a common acute respiratory infection for which effective specific antiviral drugs are currently absent. The successfully identification of established antiviral agents, such as ribavirin and emetine, by our M1 model demonstrated its predictive accuracy and biological relevance. IDKG unifies multimodal biomedical data into a network to accelerate drug discovery and bolster outbreak response.

"Language comprehension involves continuous prediction of upcoming words, with syntactic structure and semantic meaning intertwined in the human brain. To date, few studies have used combined magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroen-cephalography (EEG) measurements to investigate how syntactic processing, predictive coding, and semantic grounding interact in real time. Here we present the first combined MEG-EEG investigation of syntactic processing and semantic grounding under naturalistic conditions. Twenty-nine healthy participants listened to a German audio book while their neural responses were recorded. Event-related fields and event-related potentials for four word classes - nouns, verbs, adjectives, and proper nouns - showed highly reproducible, characteristic spatio-temporal signatures, including significant pre-onset activity for nouns, suggesting enhanced predictability of this word class. Source-space analyses revealed pronounced activation in the pre- and post-central gyri for nouns, suggesting a deeper semantic grounding of nouns in e.g. sensory experiences than verbs. To further investigate predictive mechanisms, we analyzed the hidden representations of the large language model Llama. By comparing the transformer-based representations to neural responses, we explored the relationship between computational language models and human brain activity, offering new insights into syntactic and semantic prediction. These findings highlight the power of simultaneous MEG-EEG recordings in unraveling the predictive, syntactic, and semantic mechanisms that underlie the comprehension of natural language."
"Emerging evidence indicates the cerebellum contributes to cognitive functions including social reward processing, yet its specific role relative to established reward regions like the ventral striatum remains undefined. We hypothesized the cerebellum would respond equivalently to both positive and negative social rewards. This prediction is grounded in classical findings that the cerebellum operates via supervised learning mechanisms that rely on error signals rather than traditional reward-based reinforcement. Using fMRI, we examined adolescents and young adults during a social prediction task where participants forecasted others opinions of them and received accuracy feedback. Findings reveal that both the ventral striatum and a subregion of the posterior cerebellum (Crus I and II) were sensitive to social rewards. However, unlike the ventral striatum, the cerebellum exhibited a more uniform response to feedback, treating correct predictions about being liked and disliked in a similar manner. No age-related differences were observed. These findings suggest the cerebellum processes social rewards distinctly from the ventral striatum, likely reflecting its computational emphasis on prediction errors rather than reward valence. This functional distinction advances our understanding of cerebellar contributions to social cognition and learning mechanisms."
"BackgroundAlzheimers disease (AD) is increasingly recognized as a multifactorial disorder with vascular contributions, including a pro-coagulant state marked by fibrin deposition in the brain. Fibrin accumulation may exacerbate cerebral hypoperfusion, leading to neurodegeneration. Identifying patients with this pathology could enable targeted anticoagulant therapy. However, current imaging tools lack the specificity and sensitivity to detect fibrin in the brain. This study aimed to develop and evaluate brain-penetrating peptide- and antibody-based PET radioligands targeting fibrin to enable individualized treatment strategies in AD.

ResultsA fibrin-binding peptide (FBP) was conjugated to the antibody fragment scFv8D3, which targets the transferrin receptor (TfR), to facilitate transcytosis across the blood-brain barrier. FBP-scFv8D3 bound TfR and with modest affinity to fibrin, though with limited selectivity over fibrinogen. In vivo studies in Tg-ArcSwe mice, that exhibit fibrin along with brain amyloid-{beta} pathology, and wild-type mice showed that [125I]FBP-scFv8D3 retained brain-penetrating properties but did not demonstrate significant fibrin-specific retention. In contrast, the monoclonal antibody 1101 and its bispecific, brain penetrant variant 1101-scFv8D3 exhibited high fibrin selectivity and TfR binding. Both antibodies showed a trend towards higher brain retention in Tg-ArcSwe mice and [125I]1101-scFv8D3 showed a higher brain-to-blood ratio compared to [124I]1101. PET imaging with [124I]1101 and [124I]1101-scFv8D3 revealed low brain uptake but ex vivo autoradiography suggested specific cortical retention in Tg-ArcSwe mice.

ConclusionThis study demonstrates the feasibility of using bispecific antibody-based PET radioligands to target fibrin in the AD brain. While the FBP-scFv8D3 conjugate showed limited specificity, the bispecific antibody 1101-scFv8D3 exhibited promising brain penetration and fibrin selectivity. These findings support further development of antibody-based imaging tools toward the goal to stratify AD patients who may benefit from anticoagulant therapy."
"This study investigates the effectiveness of Deep Neural Network (DNN)-generated virtual humans in enhancing audiovisual speech perception in noisy environments, with a focus on using neural measures to quantify these effects. Lip movements are essential for speech comprehension, especially when auditory cues are degraded by noise. Traditional recording methods produce high-quality audiovisual materials but are resource intensive. This research explores the use of DNN avatars as a promising alternative, utilizing a commercially available tool to create realistic virtual humans. The study included both simple sentences and a short story to improve ecological validity.

Eleven young, normal-hearing participants proficient in Flemish-Dutch listened to semantically meaningful sentences and a short story with various speaker types: a female FACS avatar, male and female DNN avatars, and a video of a human male speaker. The study included behavioral measures which consisted of an adaptive recall procedure and an adaptive rate procedure and electrophysiological measures consisting of neural tracking.

Findings in the adaptive recall procedure showed consistent audiovisual benefits, with the human speaker offering the greatest benefit (-4.75 dB SNR), followed by the DNN avatar (-4.00 dB SNR) and the FACS avatar (-1.55 dB SNR). Additionally in the adaptive rate procedure, the DNN avatar improved speech intelligibility, with average SRTs enhancing from -7.17 dB SNR (audio-only) to -9.02 dB SNR (audiovisual). The results from the neural tracking procedure indicated that most participants experienced audiovisual benefits, particularly in the -9 dB SNR range, revealing that audiovisual cues provided by DNN avatars can enhance speech perception, validating these avatars as effective tools for studying audiovisual effects when using both behavioral measures and electrophysiological measures."
"Candida albicans is a commensal fungus which populates most healthy individuals microbiota but can turn opportunistic in immunocompromised individuals and cause severe disease linked with high rates of mortality. With limited therapeutic options and increasing resistance to antifungals, novel treatment strategies for C. albicans infections is paramount. The exact immune response to C. albicans infections can be influenced by the surrounding microenvironment, for example, metabolic stresses or co-infection; although, knowledge on whether responses are enhanced or inhibited is lacking. Macrophages are a key immune cell in defence against C. albicans infection through phagocytic uptake and cytokine production that alerts other immune defence mechanisms. Here, we utilise a discovery screen approach using Data Independent Acquisition (DIA) based total proteomics to describe murine bone marrow derived macrophage (BMDM) response to C. albicans infection as well as in response to co-infection with gram-negative bacterial outer membrane component lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or live gram-negative bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We found C. albicans induced a surprisingly muted immune response in BMDMs as compared to LPS or P. aeruginosa. Moreover, upon co-infection with LPS or P. aeruginosa, C. albicans suppressed the BMDM proteome landscape and selectively suppressed BMDM secreted IL-6 and IL-12p40 cytokine responses to P. aeruginosa. Thus, C. albicans has significant suppressive capabilities in the host innate immune responses that could impact clinical outcomes during infection.

Author SummaryHuman fungal pathogens are of increasing concern for global health due to infections in hospitalised patients, limited treatment options and increased resistance to antifungal treatments. The host inflammatory response to invasive infections like Candida albicans are important for trying to contain the pathogen. Pathogen evasion of this immune response poses a critical threat and can increase host morbidity and mortality. Macrophages are an important innate immune cell which recognises and responds to C. albicans infection in vivo. Here, we found that in vitro macrophage signalling, secreted cytokines and the total proteomic responses to C. albicans infection was much more subtle than the macrophage responses to live bacterial infection or the bacterial outer membrane component, lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Co-infection of C. albicans and bacteria suppressed selective macrophage protein expression including important inflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and IL-12p40. Thus, we describe an impressive suppressive response by C. albicans which poses a potential mechanism of enhanced immune evasion."
"DCAF17 (DDB1-and CUL4-associated factor 17) plays a vital role in spermatogenesis, influencing post-meiotic sperm development. Its dysfunction leads to male infertility, as demonstrated in our previous study on Dcaf17 knockout mice, which revealed impaired sperm morphogenesis, increased numbers of dysmorphic and immotile sperm, and complete male infertility. Mutations in the human Dcaf17 gene have been implicated as causative factors for Woodhouse-Sakati Syndrome (WSS), a disorder characterized by hypogonadism and infertility, highlighting the genes essential role in male reproductive function. Despite these observations, the molecular mechanisms underlying DCAF17 function remain poorly defined. Here, we employed the GC1 spermatogonia cell line to investigate the role of DCAF17 in germ cell viability and homeostasis. Lentiviral shRNA-mediated knockdown of Dcaf17 significantly decreased cell viability and increased cell death. Functional studies demonstrated a notable decline in mitochondrial membrane potential and mass, coinciding with increased oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) protein expression. Unexpectedly, both mitochondrial and cytosolic reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were reduced following Dcaf17 silencing. Further investigation uncovered profound lysosomal damage, evidenced by accumulation of SQSTM1/p62 and loss of acidity. Transcriptional and translational profiling indicated downregulation of key iron transport and antioxidant genes (xCT, transferrin), while levels of transferrin receptor were elevated. Silencing of Dcaf17 triggered ferroptosis, as evidenced by elevated Fe{superscript 2}, reduced glutathione (GSH) and increased lipid peroxidation (MDA). In parallel, inflammatory and necroptotic pathways were activated, as indicated by upregulation of MLKL, NLRP3, cleaved IL-1{beta}, and phosphorylated JNK1/2, along with increased LDH release and reduced Bcl-xL and Bcl-2. These molecular signatures were recapitulated in lymphoblastoid cell lines from WSS patients with a pathogenic Dcaf17 mutation, which exhibited mitochondrial and lysosomal dysfunction, disrupted iron homeostasis, and oxidative stress. Similar alterations were observed in testis tissue and sperm from Dcaf17 knockout mice, including increased Fe{superscript 2} and MDA levels, reduced GSH, and impaired mitochondrial function in sperm. Collectively, our findings establish DCAF17 as a key regulator of mitochondrial integrity, lysosomal function, iron metabolism, and regulated cell death pathways in spermatogonia. This study provides the first mechanistic insight into how Dcaf17 deficiency contributes to male infertility."
"BackgroundThe progressive skeletal muscle degeneration observed in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) patients requires multiple cycles of satellite cells (SCs) activation to promote tissue regeneration. Dystrophic SCs present intrinsic defects, and the disrupting fibrotic niche hinders appropriate muscle recovery. Traditional 2D culture systems face challenges in modeling the DMD muscle niche and SCs behavior. Our aim was to validate a 3D culture of skeletal muscle spheroids (iSMS) for DMD modeling, as compared to the traditional 2D culture, while investigating the pathophysiological mechanisms of dystrophin deficiency in vitro.

MethodsTo compare iSMS with traditional 2D myogenic differentiation, we differentiated PAX7 reporter wild-type (WT), dystrophic (DMD) isogenic induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and patients iPSCs, characterized myogenic markers levels and assessed differences in proliferation and differentiation using RT-qPCR, immunofluorescence, and flow cytometry.

ResultsOur data showed that although both 2D and iSMS culture systems generated myogenic progenitors positive for MYOD, MYOG, MYF5, and MYH3, iSMS improved PAX7 expression in vitro. Moreover, we identified a differential regulation of canonical Notch signaling genes between iSMS and 2D, which may influence the comparison between WT and DMD. We also characterized the differentiation of myogenic progenitors derived from 2D and iSMS towards elongated myofibers, providing a valuable comparison with muscle fibers differentiated from human primary myoblasts. Additionally, DMD iSMS derived progenitors proliferated at reduced levels compared with WT iSMS, a characteristic not observed in progenitors derived from 2D cultures. Finally, we performed iSMS and 2D myogenic differentiation of iPSC lines from three patients with DMD, thus validating the iSMS protocol for DMD modeling.

ConclusionOur results highlight the important advantages of using the iSMS differentiation platform over 2D for disease modeling. Exploring these 3D systems may help to gain a deeper understanding of SCs behavior to advance in novel treatments for DMD, which might be applicable to other forms of muscular disorders."
"Biodiversity patterns and species communities emerge from the interactions between organisms and their environment and from processes spanning across different spatial and temporal scales. Understanding the dynamics of these interactions remains difficult as it requires mapping how microevolutionary processes scale up to macroevolutionary outcomes. Here, we use an individual-based simulation framework to model how populations respond to environmental fluctuations in a spatially explicit context. Our approach tracks evolutionary processes over thousands of generations to quantify the emerging macroevolutionary patterns under varying degrees of environmental instability modeled as shifting environmental gradients. We found that increased instability across time and space leads to elevated rates of species-level extinctions leading to homogenization of species communities, while promoting high rates of phenotypic evolution. Emerging extinction patterns indicate a selective process where species with low migration ability, narrow environmental tolerance, and limited evolvability are disproportionally affected by phases of rapid environmental change. Understanding the impact of environmental variation on organisms and species evolution remains challenging but can be explored through simulations to generate expectations and testable hypotheses about evolutionary processes across different scales."
"Advances in sequencing technologies have enhanced the understanding of gene regulation in cells. In particular, Perturb-seq has enabled high-resolution profiling of the transcriptomic response to genetic perturbations at the single-cell level. This understanding has implications in functional genomics and potentially for identifying therapeutic targets. Various computational models have been developed to predict perturbational effects. While deep learning models excel at interpolating observed perturbational data, they tend to overfit and may not generalize well to unseen perturbations. In contrast, mechanistic models, such as linear causal models based on gene regulatory networks, hold greater potential for extrapolation, as they encapsulate regulatory information that can predict responses to unseen perturbations. However, their application has been limited to small studies due to overly simplistic assumptions, making them less effective in handling noisy, large-scale single-cell data. We propose a hybrid approach that combines a mechanistic causal model with variational deep learning, termed Single Cell Causal Variational Autoencoder (SCCVAE). The mechanistic model employs a learned regulatory network to represent perturbational changes as shift interventions that propagate through the learned network. SCCVAE integrates this mechanistic causal model into a variational autoencoder, generating rich, comprehensive transcriptomic responses. Our results indicate that SCCVAE exhibits superior performance over current state-of-the-art baselines for extrapolating to predict unseen perturbational responses. Additionally, for the observed perturbations, the latent space learned by SCCVAE allows for the identification of functional perturbation modules and simulation of single-gene knockdown experiments of varying penetrance, presenting a robust tool for interpreting and interpolating perturbational responses at the single-cell level.

Author summaryUnderstanding how genes interact and respond to perturbations is crucial for uncovering the mechanisms of cells and identifying potential ways to treat diseases. Recent advances in sequencing technologies now allow us to measure how individual cells react when specific genes are altered. However, making sense of this complex data requires advanced computational tools. In our work, we address the challenge of predicting how cells respond to potentially new untested genetic perturbations. We noticed that while deep learning models perform well on data measured before, they struggle with making predictions on new cases. On the other hand, models based on biological understanding can, in theory, make better predictions, but they often rely on overly simple assumptions that do not hold with real-world data. We developed a new method that combines the strengths of both approaches. Our model, called SCCVAE, uses knowledge of gene networks together with deep learning to better predict how cells will respond to gene changes. It can simulate new experiments and help identify groups of genes that work together. This tool could be valuable for researchers studying perturbational changes, as well as gene functions and diseases."
"Arginase converts arginine (Arg) to ornithine (Orn), regulating their availability for the metabolic pathways that utilize these amino acids. The roles of arginase isoenzymes, Arg1 and Arg2, vary by cell type, tissue, and physiological state. In the brain, Arg2 is the predominant isoenzyme, particularly enriched in the striatum, where it localizes to a striatum-specific neuronal population - medium spiny neurons (MSNs). While the precise role of Arg2 in MSNs remains unclear, its loss alters the striatal metabolomic profile, highlighting its metabolic significance.

Here, to investigate the basis of these complex metabolic changes, we examined Arg metabolism in Arg2 knockout (Arg2-/-) mice. Targeted analysis of Arg-related metabolites and selected proteins regulating Arg metabolic pathways revealed that Arg2 loss significantly increased Arg levels but did not affect Orn, likely due to compensatory synthesis of Orn from Arg (via arginine:glycine amidinotransferase) and/or proline (via ornithine aminotransferase). Additionally, markers of nitric oxide (NO) production remained unchanged, suggesting that striatal Arg2 is not involved in the regulation of this pathway, a role commonly attributed to arginase. Most notably, Arg2 loss disrupted polyamine homeostasis, shifting the balance toward higher polyamines at the expense of lower ones and altering the expression of polyamine-regulating proteins. These findings highlight Arg2 crucial role in striatal metabolism and its potential relevance to striatum-related disorders. Given that striatal Arg2 impairment has been reported in Huntingtons disease, a neurodegenerative disorder specifically affecting MSNs, understanding its function may provide insights into the pathology."
"INTRODUCTIONTREM2 is a microglial marker important in Alzheimers disease (AD) pathogenesis, but current methods to detect microglial TREM2 expression in vivo are limited. Circulating microglia-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) show promise as potential biomarkers for AD and may offer insight into TREM2 activity.

METHODSTMEM119+/TREM2+ EVs were assessed using nanoscale flow cytometry in plasma from wildtype and APP/PS1 rats aged to 3-, 9-, and 15-months-old. Molecular and histological assays were used to assess microglia markers in rat brain tissue and a radial arm water maze task was employed to evaluate spatial working and reference memory.

RESULTSCirculating TMEM119+/TREM2+ EVs were increased in 15-month APP/PS1 rats and associated with severity of cognitive impairment. TREM2 brain expression varied by anatomical region, age, transgene, and assay.

DISCUSSIONCollectively, this study provides the first assessment of TMEM119+/TREM2+ EVs as a biomarker of brain microglial expression and cognition in an AD rat model."
"In the healthy brain, microglia maintain homeostasis by continuously surveying neuronal health through highly dynamic processes that form purinergic junctions with neuronal somas. These mechanisms are finely tuned for the rapid detection of acute injuries. However, during the transition to a chronically reactive state in neurodegenerative diseases, microglial ramification decreases even as the need for neuronal monitoring escalates. How reactive microglia adapt their surveillance strategies under these conditions remains poorly understood. Using time-lapse imaging of acute brain slices from prion-infected mice, we identified a previously unrecognized mode of neuronal surveillance employed by reactive microglia. Unlike homeostatic microglia, which exhibit low somatic mobility and high process motility, enabling broad, simultaneous monitoring, reactive microglia display high somatic mobility. These cells actively migrate through the brain parenchyma, pausing to form direct and extensive body-to-body contacts with individual neurons. Contact durations ranged from minutes to several hours, often involving partial or full somatic envelopment, with transitions between these states being both frequent and reversible. Notably, reactive microglia exhibited sustained intracellular calcium bursts correlated with their increased mobility. Pharmacological inhibition of the P2Y6 receptor partially reduced microglial migration without disrupting their ability to form neuronal contacts. Furthermore, this highly mobile behavior persisted in acutely isolated reactive microglia in vitro, even in the absence of external stimuli, indicating that dynamic mobility is an intrinsic feature of the reactive phenotype. These findings reveal a fundamental shift in microglial surveillance architecture during chronic neurodegeneration - transforming from static, multi-neuron monitoring to dynamic, neuron-by-neuron engagement. This work uncovers a novel, adaptive strategy of microglial behavior with critical implications for understanding microglia-neuron interaction under chronic neurodegeneration."

"Pediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability early in life in infants, and its neurodevelopmental consequences cannot currently be effectively treated. Since TBI is associated with neuroinflammation, modulation of the post-injury neuroinflammatory response is a promising strategy. Oxytocin is thought to have anti-inflammatory properties and appears to play a role in clinical interventions that improve brain development in neonates. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear, as does its applicability to acute brain injury. Here we investigate the effects of chemogenetic modulation of endogenous oxytocin on acute neuroinflammation and on long-term brain development after TBI in postnatal day 7 (P7) male mice. We show that oxytocin release attenuates the acute neuroinflammatory response to TBI 24 hours after injury, by reducing the expression of immune- and inflammation-related genes in astrocytes and promoting gene pathways for brain repair and development in microglia. In the long term, oxytocin exposure ameliorates subcortical and cortical white matter damage after TBI, prevents hyperactivity and loss of social behavior, and restores TBI-induced alterations in resting-state functional connectivity of the isocortex. These findings enhance our understanding of the modulation of neuroinflammation and its long-term effects and support intervention related to endogenous oxytocin release as a promising neuroprotective strategy in pediatric TBI."
"Correlative inhibition mechanisms allow plants to regulate the number of organs they produce, but act as a developmental limitation on crop yields. Previously, trade-offs have been observed in wheat and barley between the size of individual compound inflorescences (spikes) and the total number of spikes produced by each plant. We aimed to test the hypothesis that these trade-offs represent an uncharacterized form of correlative inhibition in grass reproductive architecture. We show that  high spikelet lines with spikes containing enhanced numbers of spikelets have reduced tillering and retarded development of later-initiated spikes. Moreover, we show that this effect is driven by the presence of developing, but not mature, spikelets in early-initiated spikes, thus representing a form of correlative inhibition. We show that cytokinin treatment delays the development of spike meristems and formation of spikelets, and as such, can promote the development of additional spikes in high spikelet lines, by providing a longer window for tillering to occur. Our results thus identify cytokinin as a potential target for breeding crops with enhanced yield. Furthermore, our results provide a developmental basis for previously observed yield trade-offs in cereal crops, and illustrate the importance of understanding developmental timing when attempting to breed higher-yielding crops."

"A molecular understanding of lung organogenesis requires delineation of the timing and regulation of the cellular transitions that ultimately form and support a surface capable of gas exchange. While the advent of single-cell transcriptomics has allowed for the discovery and identification of transcriptionally distinct cell populations present during lung development, the spatiotemporal dynamics of these transcriptional shifts remain undefined. With imaging-based spatial transcriptomics, we analyzed the gene expression patterns in 17 human infant lungs at varying stages of development and injury, creating a spatial transcriptomic atlas of [~]1.2 million cells. We applied computational clustering approaches to identify shared molecular patterns among this cohort, informing how tissue architecture and molecular spatial relationships are coordinated during development and disrupted in disease. Recognizing that all preterm birth represents an injury to the developing lung, we created a simplified classification scheme that relies upon the routinely collected objective measures of gestational age and life span. Within this framework, we have identified cell type patterns across gestational age and life span variables that would likely be overlooked when using the conventional ""disease vs. control"" binary comparison. Together, these data represent an open resource for the lung research community, supporting discovery-based inquiry and identification of targetable molecular mechanisms in both normal and arrested human lung development."
"Interactions with neighbouring plants have profound effects on plant growth, especially in crop-weed interactions, which can cause major crop-losses in agricultural systems. Black-grass (Alopecurus myosuroides) is the most problematic weed for UK agriculture, causing dramatic yield losses in winter wheat, but the basis of its competitive advantage is not clear. We aimed to fundamentally reappraise the nature of wheat - black-grass competition. Here, we show that black-grass is slow to establish, and requires long periods to demonstrate any competitive advantage over wheat. We show that black-grass grows significantly faster under winter conditions than wheat, and has much more vigorous root growth, collectively suggesting that prolonged root growth over winter is key to black-grasss competitive advantage over wheat. We tested the competitiveness of a range of wheat and barley germplasm against black-grass in three distinct environmental set-ups, and show that competitiveness under controlled conditions reflects competitiveness under field conditions. In controlled conditions, we identified significant variation in crop varietal competitiveness against black-grass, in both ability to suppress black-grass growth, and to continue to grow in the presence of black-grass (tolerance). We further identified that this competition is not a zero-sum game, with loss in crop biomass not necessarily equal to gain in black-grass biomass. Finally, we found that the black-grass suppression, but not tolerance, is correlated with crop root growth, supporting our root growth hypothesis for black-grass competition. Overall, our results suggest that breeding for increased root growth and/or winter growth rate can create more competitive wheat cultivars for grassweed suppression."
"Galectin-3 (Gal-3), a member of the {beta}-galactoside-binding protein family, is critically involved in inflammation, extracellular matrix remodelling, and cartilage degeneration in osteoarthritis (OA). This study aims to elucidate the regulation of the human galectin-3 gene (LGALS3) promoter in SW1353 cells and its control by SOX transcription factors, known to be dysregulated during OA pathogenesis. We sought to identify key sequence elements in the LGALS3 promoter responsible for its transcriptional activity and the transcription factors (TFs) responsible for its regulation. Using luciferase reporter assays, we examined deletion variants of the 5 region (-2638 bp to +52 bp) and assessed their activation potential. We also identified potential transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) through in silico analyses and confirmed SOX9 binding in the -93/+49 region by chromatin immunoprecipitation using HaloCHIPTM. Functional assays revealed that the proximal promoter region (-97 to +52 bp) is critical for reporter gene expression in SW1353 cells. This study demonstrates that the presence of SOX2 and SOX9 leads to a dose-dependent decrease in LGALS3 promoter activity in SW1353 cells.

We show that SOX9 can bind the promoter, highlighting the importance of SOX TF interactions in regulating LGALS3 expression and their potential role in chondrocytes."
"The cuttlefish Sepia officinalis is a precious model in behavioural and neurobiology studies. It is currently facing combined environmental changes related to the anthropogenic global change. However, genomic resources available to support investigations tackling this issue are still scarce. Therefore, we present two annotated de novo transcriptome assemblies from recently hatched (whole body) and one-month-old (head) Sepia officinalis juveniles. Both assemblies rely on an important read depth validated by a pseudo-rarefaction analysis, and gathered several individuals from various metal and pCO2 exposure conditions. After redundancy reduction, assemblies from newly hatched and one-month-old individuals comprised 244,772 and 397,569 transcripts with 39,804 and 49,402 putative ORFs, respectively, and an average annotation rate of 60%. Assemblies were compared to each other, revealing age-specific transcriptomic landscapes. These two assemblies constitute highly valuable genomic resources facilitating the investigation of transcriptomic endpoints in environmental studies considering coleoid cephalopods."

"Life history traits are all essential traits linked to development, survival and reproduction, directly influencing individual fitness. Limited environmental or physiological resources force organisms to balance competing demands, leading to fundamental trade-offs, particularly between survival and reproduction. Male aggression often enhances reproductive success by improving resource acquisition and mate competition. However, the broader impact of high levels of aggression on individual overall fitness and life-history trade-offs remains poorly understood. To address this, we used the Drosophila melanogaster Bully line, derived from wild-type flies (Canton-S line) through artificial selection for high levels of male aggression, and assess whether increased aggressiveness influences male life-history traits. Our results reveal that increased male aggressiveness shifts the balance of a major life-history trade-off, favoring survival over reproductive success. Bully males exhibited lower mating success, shorter mating duration and less effective chemical mate-guarding. However, this was traded-off with increased lifespan, enabling more reproductive opportunities. We also uncover potential mechanistic underpinnings of the reproductive deficits. Bully males showed differences in their cuticular hydrocarbon (CHCs) profiles and transferred lower levels of cVA to females, a mate-guarding pheromone, thereby weakening their post-mating strategy. Overall, our findings demonstrate that selection for male aggression profoundly influence a key life-history trade-off highlighting aggression as an evolutionary force shaping adaptation of life-history traits and providing a foundation for future genetic and mechanistic studies."
"Deep learning has the potential to be a powerful tool for automating allele calling in forensic DNA analysis. Studies to date have relied on bespoke model architecture and painstaking manual annotations to train models, which makes it challenging for other researchers to work with these techniques.

In this study, we explore the possibility of training a wellperforming model using data gathered as part of casework, and employing a widely adopted architecture: the U-Net. In this approach, annotations are created from alleles called during casework. The model, dubbed  DNANet, then classifies each scan point in the electropherogram (EPG) as part of an allele or non-allele, building on the task of segmentation in computer vision. We evaluate performance on unseen case data and on independent mixture research data, taking analyst annotations as ground-truth. We further compare DNANets performance with analyst performance on the research data, taking actual donor alleles as ground-truth.

DNANet reached an F1 score of 0.971 on analyst annotated alleles on case data not seen during training, and 0.982 on the research data. On actual donor alleles, DNANet reached an F1 score of 0.962, equal to the F1 score computed from analyst annotations.

Our results show that DNANets performance is comparable to human annotations following standard procedures. This illustrates the potential for obtaining good results with standard data and architecture. Future work may focus on what aspects of data, annotations or model architecture are key in shaping performance. We make our code, model weights and research data publicly available to aid the community. Lastly, we call for an effort to establish a standardized benchmark to aid in quantitative comparisons between allele calling systems."
"1. Understanding the physiological mechanisms underpinning plasticity in life-history traits can help us predict individual responses to environmental variability and understand how diverse life-history strategies evolve to be shaped by ecological processes.

2. The hormone insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) is a key player in the insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS) pathway. This nutrient-sensing pathway responds to diverse environmental cues including food availability and has been shown to modulate the association between resource acquisition and allocation of resources to life-history traits like growth, reproduction and survival in the laboratory.

3. We measured IGF-1 concentrations in blood samples from approximately four-month-old wild Soay sheep lambs (n=669), collected over nine summers. We tested whether IGF-1 was positively correlated with proxies of resource availability, and whether IGF-1 was associated with morphological traits measured concurrently and predicted subsequent fitness-related traits.

4. Plasma IGF-1 concentrations were higher in males compared to females, and positively correlated with measures of resource availability in both sexes. IGF-1 was lower in years of high population density when per capita food availability was reduced; in twin lambs who have fewer available resources compared to singletons; and in lambs born to young and old mothers, who have poor maternal provisioning compared to mothers of intermediate age.

5. Higher IGF-1 levels in summer were predictive of higher body mass, faster post-natal somatic growth and increased skeletal size, measured at the same time. These associations were independent of our proxies of resource availability.

6. Lambs with higher summer IGF-1 were more likely to survive their first winter and reproduce the following spring. The association between IGF-1 and reproduction was independent of our resource availability proxies, whereas the association with first-winter survival was not. The association between summer IGF-1 and reproduction was mediated by positive associations with summer body mass.

7. Our study reveals population-level phenotypic plasticity in circulating IGF-1, also finding IGF-1 to predict early life-history traits in a wild mammal population."
"Microglial tiling--the phenomenon of consistent cell-to-cell distances and non-overlapping processes--is regarded as a qualitative indicator of homeostasis, but mechanisms of microglial tiling are unknown. We used cell-surface proximity labeling and mass spectrometry to profile the microglial cell-surface proteome in an in vitro model of homeostatic glial physiology and used single-cell RNA sequencing and public databases to identify candidate cell-surface proteins that might modulate tiling. We designed an image-based functional assay which measures six morphological/spatial readouts to screen these proteins for modulation of tiling. CD72, a coreceptor to the B cell receptor that is expressed by microglia, disrupted tiling; we validated its effects in vitro and in situ in organotypic hippocampal brain slices. Phosphoproteomic studies revealed that CD72 modulates pathways associated with cell adhesion, repulsive receptors, microglial activation, and cytoskeletal organization. These results lay the groundwork for further investigation of the functional roles of tiling in homeostasis and disease."
"Motoneurons adapt to both resistance and endurance training in reduced animal preparations, with adaptations seemingly more apparent in higher threshold neurons, but similar evidence in humans is lacking. Here, we compared the identified motor unit (MU) discharge patterns from decomposed electromyography signals acquired during triangular dorsiflexion contractions up to 70% of maximal voluntary force (MVF) between resistance-trained, endurance-trained, and untrained individuals (n=23 in each group). We then estimated intrinsic motoneuron properties and garnered insight about the proportion of excitatory, inhibitory, and neuromodulatory inputs contributing to motor commands across contraction intensities in each group. Participants also performed a task where a triangular contraction was superimposed onto a sustained one designed to challenge inhibitory control of dendritic persistent inward currents (PICs). Both trained groups demonstrated greater MU discharge rates with greater ascending discharge rate modulation during higher contraction forces ([&ge;]50% MVF), which were accompanied by more linear MU discharge patterns and greater post-acceleration attenuation slopes of the ascending discharge rates. No differences in discharge rate hysteresis or the discharge rate characteristics during the sombrero tasks between groups, suggesting no differences in neuromodulatory input. Conversely, resistance-compared to endurance-trained individuals exhibited greater acceleration slopes during lower contractions forces ([&le;]50% MVF), indicating the possibility of enhanced initial activation of PICs. Collectively, the greater and more linear MU discharge patterns in the trained groups either suggests a more reciprocal (i.e., push-pull) excitation-inhibition coupling during higher contraction forces or enhanced excitatory synaptic input to the motor pool, which might underpin greater force production of trained individuals."
"Cytokine signaling is critical to the function of natural immune cells and engineered immune cell therapies such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. It remains unclear how the limited set of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) and other proteins activated by these cytokine receptors can encode the observed diversity of immune cell phenotypes. To understand how signaling downstream of cytokines control immune cell phenotype, we sought to map the structure of Janus kinase (JAK)/STAT signaling domains to cell signaling and resulting CAR T cell function. We recombined 14 signaling motifs to construct a library of [~]30,000 constitutively active synthetic cytokine receptors (SCRs) with intracellular domains composed of novel signaling motif combinations that activate different signaling cascades. We experimentally tested [~]450 SCRs which generated a range of CAR T cell memory, cytotoxicity, and proliferation. SCRs with pSTAT1 and 3 signaling generated effector memory CAR T cells, while SCRs with strong pSTAT5 generated effector CAR T cells with potent anti-tumor activity. To map the structure-signaling-phenotype landscape we trained models to predict signaling and CAR T cell phenotype that result from varied motif combinations. From neural network predictions we identified features, including strong STAT5 and Shc signaling, that promote unsafe autonomous CAR T cell proliferation. Models also revealed a trade-off between memory and cytotoxicity, with a Pareto front encoded by a continuous change in signaling. These results demonstrate that recombination of a limited set of signaling motifs creates a continuous spectrum of signaling that encodes a corresponding spectrum of cell phenotype. This work synthetically expands the combinatorial space of JAK/STAT signaling and provides a foundation for rational design of CAR T cells with improved cytotoxicity, memory, and safety profiles.

"Understanding the molecular basis of regulated nitrogen (N2) fixation is essential for engineering N2-fixing bacteria that fulfill the demand of crop plants for fixed nitrogen, reducing our reliance on synthetic nitrogen fertilizers. In Azotobacter vinelandii and many other members of Proteobacteria, the two-component system NifL-NifA controls the expression of nif genes that encode the nitrogen fixation machinery. The NifL-NifA system evolved the ability to integrate several environmental cues, such as oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon availability. The nitrogen fixation machinery is thereby only activated under strictly favorable conditions, enabling diazotrophs to thrive in competitive environments. Whilst genetic and biochemical studies have enlightened our understanding of how NifL represses NifA, the molecular basis of NifA sequestration by NifL depends on structural information on their interaction. Here, we present mechanistic insights into how nitrogen fixation is regulated by combining biochemical and genetic approaches with a low-resolution cryo-EM map of the oxidized NifL-NifA complex. Our findings define the interaction surface between NifL and NifA and reveal how this interaction can be manipulated to generate bacterial strains with increased nitrogen fixation rates able to secrete surplus nitrogen outside the cell, a crucial step in engineering improved nitrogen delivery to crop plants."
"Through their ability to hydrolyze carbapenems, Ambler class D beta-lactamases endanger patients by limiting the clinical efficacy of beta-lactam antimicrobials. Further, plasmid-mediated transmission can increase mobility of carbapenemase genes between bacteria and facilitate their spread between patients. In the United States and elsewhere, the plasmid-mediated Ambler class D carbapenemase genes blaOXA-23-like, blaOXA-24/40-like, and blaOXA-58-like are commonly associated with Acinetobacter species and have rarely been reported outside of this genus. However, multiple recent international reports indicate detection of Enterobacterales isolates carrying Acinetobacter-associated class D carbapenemase genes. This evaluation aimed to provide insight into whether Enterobacterales harboring these class D genes may be circulating undetected in the United States, thereby signaling a need for adapting testing strategies to prioritize the detection of these potentially emerging public health threats. We analyzed whole-genome sequencing data generated through multiple Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) activities, including testing conducted across the Antimicrobial Resistance Laboratory Network, to determine whether any Enterobacterales isolates sequenced from 2017-2022 harbored Acinetobacter-associated class D carbapenemase genes. Among [~]10,000 predominantly carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales isolates, we identified only a single Enterobacterales isolate harboring an Acinetobacter-associated class D gene - a Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate harboring a blaOXA-23-like gene. Our findings suggest that blaOXA-23-like, blaOXA-24/40-like, and blaOXA-58-like genes are rare among Enterobacterales isolates sequenced through CDC public health activities in the United States and do not warrant changes to current testing priorities at this time."
"RNA structure plays a central role in post-transcriptional gene regulation, modulating RNA stability, translation, and interactions with RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). However, capturing RNA conformations at scale remains challenging. Here, we introduce DMS-TRAM-seq (Dimethyl Sulfate-Transcriptome-wide RNA Accessibility Mapping by sequencing), which probes RNA structure across nearly the entire transcriptome. Using DMS-TRAM-seq, we generated secondary structure predictions for over 9,000 human transcripts, including hundreds of non-coding RNAs, and identified more than 700 previously unannotated, high-confidence structured elements. Importantly, the enhanced coverage provided by DMS-TRAM-seq enabled comparative analyses, revealing RNAs that undergo structural rearrangements in response to cellular perturbations. Integration with RBP motifs and ribosome profiling uncovered altered RNA-RBP interactions during oxidative stress and showed that translation inhibition broadly drives RNAs toward their thermodynamically favored conformations. DMS-TRAM-seq enables interrogation of the RNA structurome and its plasticity at an unprecedented scale, opening new directions for elucidating the structural basis of RNA regulation."
"In individuals on effective antiretroviral therapy, integrated HIV proviruses persist within CD4 T cells, forming a viral reservoir that rebounds if treatment is stopped. Identifying and targeting these rare, infected cells is critical for advancing therapies, but methods to study reservoir cells are limited and their unique properties remain largely unknown. We applied DAb-seq, a high-throughput method that combines single-cell DNA and surface protein sequencing, to profile over five hundred and twenty thousand CD4 T cells from the blood of six individuals on ART. Infected cells were unequally distributed in T cell subsets, and differential protein expression between infected and uninfected cells revealed significant heterogeneity across cell subsets. Attempts to identify surface markers that differentiate infected from uninfected cells found antigens that mirrored the enrichment of HIV in central memory subsets. However, while central memory T cells harbored the majority of HIV, cells with intact provirus were enriched relative to their defective counterparts in Naive and Regulatory T cell subsets, suggesting that they differentially maintain intact proviruses. In summary, we developed DAb-seq as an open-source platform for linking the proviral landscape to diverse cellular phenotypes, revealing heterogeneity in surface protein expression and provirus maintenance across infected subsets."
"We present a strategy that deploys structural bioinformatics, molecular simulation, and single-molecule FRET microscopy for observing the ligand-dependent conformational dynamics of integral membrane proteins in situ. We focus on representative members of the small monotopic phosphoglycosyl transferase (SmPGT) superfamily, which catalyze transfer of a phosphosugar from a soluble nucleotide-sugar donor to a membrane-embedded polyprenol phosphate acceptor in the initiating step of glycoconjugate biosynthesis in prokaryotes. Substrate-specific structural features were identified across the superfamily and correlated with ligand-dependent conformational dynamics in all-atom simulations. To experimentally validate the role of this motion in ligand binding, we developed a platform to monitor intra-molecular protein dynamics in a native-like lipid environment. The presented approach incorporates selective cysteine protein labeling and non-canonical amino acid mutagenesis with bicyclononyne-tetrazine click chemistry to assemble dual-labeled variants of PglC, the initiating enzyme of the N-linked protein glycosylation pathway from Campylobacter jejuni. The modified proteins are then solubilized into styrene maleic acid liponanoparticles (SMALPs) to maintain an in situ membrane environment. The conformational changes of PglC upon inhibitor binding are diagnostic of inhibitor potency. The single-molecule FRET-SMALP strategy can be adapted to investigate protein dynamics across the superfamily of SmPGTs with different substrate selectivity where structure prediction and molecular dynamics support significant conformational changes upon ligand binding.

Broader ImpactMembrane protein structure-function relationships are critical for understanding fundamental biological processes and for the development of small-molecule drug treatments. Bacterial glycoconjugate biosynthesis pathways are a promising target for strain-specific antibiotics and exemplify the challenges of characterizing biomolecular systems that depend on highly specific protein, lipid, and carbohydrate chemistries. We integrate molecular simulation, structural bioinformatics, and single-molecule FRET to elucidate details of small-molecule binding to the PGT superfamily."
"Quorum sensing-based genetic circuits are gaining traction in synthetic biology as they link population-level behaviour to individual cell responses. However, tuning these circuits remains challenging due to complex dynamics, particularly during the  Learn phase of the Design-Build-Test-Learn (DBTL) cycle. To accelerate this process, we developed a mathematical model to predict how varying expression levels of the transcription factor and synthase affect the response of the EsaI/EsaR quorum sensing system. A strain library was constructed, and experimental data were used to optimize the model. The final model could successfully differentiate between the effects of these expression levels on the response of the bidirectional promoter. It allowed visualization of all potential system outcomes and emphasized the transcription factors critical role in tuning the circuit. This model offers a valuable tool for fine-tuning EsaI/EsaR-based systems for synthetic biology applications. Moreover, given the homology within the LuxR-family quorum sensing systems, this modelling approach may serve as a foundation for model-based tuning of other quorum sensing systems."
"Acinetobacter baumannii poses a substantial global health threat, causing severe multi-drug-resistant infections in hospitalized patients. Circulating clinical isolates present remarkable diversity, with a proportion capable of establishing a transient intracellular niche suitable for persistence, multiplication, and spread. Yet, it remains unknown which bacterial factors mediate the formation and maintenance of this niche, especially within non-phagocytic cells, nor what host responses are elicited. This work demonstrates that the invasive A. baumannii ABC141 strain does not secrete ammonia in endothelial cells as previously shown for other A. baumannii strains multiplying within macrophages but resides in an acidic vacuole devoid of active lysosomal degradative enzymes. This compartment mediates bacterial egress and infection of neighboring cells, promoting dissemination. Using a Dual-RNAseq approach, we mapped the host and bacterial gene expression during the replicative stage of the infection. An atypical hypoxia cell response was observed without significant induction of the HIF1 pathway, with no metabolic shift or disturbance of mitochondria. Surprisingly, ABC141 efficiently grew in hypoxic conditions in culture and within host cells. In addition, we found a bacterial signature reflective of an adaptation to a nutrient-deprived environment. Our work also highlights a differential role for ABC141 secretion systems, with the T1SS assisting intracellular multiplication and the T2SS required for host cell invasion, implicating for the first time the T2SS in the intracellular lifecycle of invasive ABC141 in endothelial cells.

Author summaryAcinetobacter baumannii is a major burden for healthcare facilities worldwide, causing severe infections in hospitalized and intensive care patients that are challenging to treat because of extremely high levels of resistance to most antimicrobials. Traditionally seen as extracellular, recent studies have highlighted that a proportion of clinical isolates currently circulating in clinics can invade and multiply inside epithelial and endothelial cells. Yet, how these strains establish an intracellular protected niche remains unknown. Here, we undertook a detailed characterization of the intracellular compartment enclosing multiplying bacteria, the induced host response, and the bacterial genes that contribute to the adaptation to this intracellular environment. We found that the A. baumannii ABC141 clinical strain is well equipped to resist acidic, low oxygen, and low nutrient environments. Furthermore, we discovered it uses its type II secretion system to invade human endothelial cells, the first step of this intracellular lifecycle. This study opens new avenues of research to help develop new antimicrobial strategies to combat this bacteria when shielded within intracellular compartments in the host."
"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a bacterial pathogen that relies on expression of a wide range of virulence factors. Hemolysins are a diverse collection of cytolytic toxins that promote virulence by being excreted and lysing host blood cells. We previously reported on novel anti-virulence compounds that modulate hemolysis in vitro, including a brominated carbazole (compound 8) and the active ingredient in Claritin (loratadine). We analyzed expression and activity of MRSA hemolysins in two hospital-acquired strains. Even with the same staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) type, the strains displayed unique responses to loratadine where both repression and elevation of hemolysis occurred. We hypothesized that modulation of hemolysis by these putative Stk1 inhibitors would extend to community-acquired strains of MRSA. Furthermore, we wanted to determine if Stk1 was the only hemolysis regulatory protein being engaged by these compounds. To test this, we examined compound 8 and loratadines effects on two different USA300 strains, in addition to deletion mutants for a range of hemolysis regulatory genes. We observed strain-specific regulation of hemolysis by Stk1. Loratadine continued to downregulate both alpha and beta hemolytic activity in USA300 JE2 in both Stk1-dependent and independent pathways. Finally, we report that this anti-virulence compound effectively disrupts hemolysis by modulating global regulators at the mRNA level including the agr and vraRS systems that likely contribute to reduced hemolysin levels. Both hla and hld mRNA reductions extended to a human cell line model of MRSA infection. Together, these results expand our knowledge of loratadines function as a virulence modulator.

ImportanceMethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a human pathogen of concern worldwide. It can cause infections of the skin, soft tissue, blood, and lungs, among others, in both community and hospital settings. This work evaluates loratadine, the active ingredient in Claritin, as an anti-virulence compound. We show that loratadine is effective at lowering expression of hemolysin genes in MRSA and, concomitantly, lessening host blood cell hemolysis due to staphylococcal hemolysin proteins. This effect occurs in the presence and absence of loratadine proposed target, a serine-threonine kinase called Stk1. In a model of human infection, every hemolysin gene expression is also downregulated by loratadine. This FDA-approved antihistamine has many properties that warrant repurposing as an anti-virulence therapy."
"Gut microbiota plays a crucial role in the outcome of cholera. In this context, Paracoccus aminovorans, a gut commensal, has been evidenced to positively influence the pathogenesis of cholera bacterium. In the present study, we examined the impact of various non-antibiotic strategies on the growth of Paracoccus aminovorans. We observed the growth of Paracoccus aminovarans was severely restricted in the presence of L-ascorbic acid as well as in co-culture growth assays with another gut commensal, Weissella confusa."
"Acinetobacter baumannii is an opportunistic pathogen that employs two main strategies to evade antibiotic treatment: developing antibiotic resistant through the DNA damage response (DDR), and forming biofilms, which are protective bacterial multicellular communities. Previously, we demonstrated that RecA, a key regulator of the DDR, connects the DDR and biofilm formation, with RecA levels inversely correlated with biofilm formation. In this study, we identify another DDR regulator, EppR-- a recently characterized TetR-family transcriptional repressor-- as also playing a role in biofilm formation. We show that an eppR-deficient strain is unable to form biofilms due to reduced expression of genes encoding adhesive pili. This occurs because EppR influences intracellular RecA levels. Our findings provide further insight into RecA regulation and the link between the DDR and biofilms."
"Clinical responses of colorectal cancer (CRC) treatments vary considerably due to the heterogeneity of tumor micro-environment (TME), where intratumoral microbiota may reshape the unique inflammation imprints. However, its complex mechanistic underpinnings remain incompletely elucidated. Herein we sought to delineate the critical role of intratumoral microbiota in potentiating combination therapeutics against CRC. By comparing germ-free (GF) and specific pathogen-free (SPF) mouse models of 33 potential CRC treatments, we screened out the combination regimen of Capecitabine-Nivolumab significantly augmented by intratumoral microbiota in tumor regression and survival prolongation. The enrichment of Bacteroides fragilis induced by Capecitabine-Nivolumab was concomitant with elevated microbial sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), which further upregulated tumoral PD-L1 expression by enhancing histone deacetylation at the CD274 locus. Activation of microbial sphingosine kinase 2 (SphK2) ultimately led to an expansion of effector memory CD8+ T cells and reduction of exhausted T cell subsets within TME. To conclude, these findings advance our understanding of the intricate interplay among intratumoral microbiota, sphingolipid metabolites and immunochemotherapeutics. It highlights microbial sphingolipids as potential predictive biomarkers for strategies of targeting intratumoral microbiota in CRC management."
"Elasmobranchs, comprising sharks and rays, are among the most threatened species globally. The first elasmobranchs were added to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) in 2002. Since then, the number of species listed has increased to 151, highlighting the urgent conservation challenges faced by these species. In Sri Lanka, where over 100 species have been recorded, the demand for elasmobranch products drives significant export and import activities, complicating conservation efforts. Accurate species identification is crucial for fisheries monitoring, trade regulation, and conservation management. However, relying solely on morphological characteristics is challenging, especially since key identifying features are unavailable in certain derivatives like meat and oil in market samples. This study aims to develop a robust DNA reference library for elasmobranch species in Sri Lanka and to showcase the application of Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) as a reliable tool for fisheries monitoring and conservation. Using DNA barcoding and ONT sequencing, we analysed 49 elasmobranch species, focusing on the Cytochrome Oxidase I (COI) and 12S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) genes to develop a DNA reference library. The creation of reliable barcode reference libraries is essential for effective species identification in biomonitoring because it facilitates the assessment of population trends and the effectiveness of fishing and trade regulations. We conducted a phylogenetic analysis to assess the robustness of reference sequences in species discrimination. All DNA reference sequences are publicly accessible through GenBank. This study enhances the capacity to monitor and regulate the elasmobranch trade in Sri Lanka and beyond."
"The rapid growth of genomic and metagenomic data has underscored the pressing need for advanced computational tools capable of deciphering complex biological sequences. In this study, we introduce Generanno, a compact yet powerful genomic foundation model specifically optimized for metagenomic annotation. Trained on an extensive dataset comprising 715 billion base pairs (bp) of prokaryotic DNA, Generanno employs a transformer encoder architecture with 500 million parameters, enabling bidirectional attention over sequences up to 8192 nucleotides at single-nucleotide resolution. This design addresses key limitations of existing methods, including the inability of traditional Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to handle fragmented DNA sequences, as well as the suboptimal tokenization schemes of current genomic foundation models that compromise fine-grained analysis. To evaluate the model performance, we curated the Prokaryotic Gener Tasks--a biologically meaningful benchmark encompassing gene fitness prediction, antibiotic resistance prediction, gene classification, and taxonomic classification. Across these tasks, Generanno consistently outperforms its counterparts, establishing itself as a leading genomic foundation model in the prokaryotic domain. For metagenomic annotation, Generanno achieves superior accuracy compared to traditional HMMbased methods (e.g., GLIMMER3, GeneMarkS2, Prodigal) and recent LLM-based approaches (e.g., GeneLM), while demonstrating exceptional generalization ability on archaeal genomes. Notably, Generanno pioneers the prediction of pseudogenes based solely on sequence data, leveraging its contextual understanding to differentiate non-functional sequences from active coding regions. Overall, Generanno represents a significant advancement in genomic foundation modeling, bridging the gap between large-scale sequence analysis and fine-grained biological insights. By providing a versatile tool for metagenomic annotation and broader genomic exploration, this work lays the groundwork for future research in functional genomics and related fields. Implementation details and supplementary resources are available at https://github.com/GenerTeam/GENERanno."
"YghA from E. coli has been reported to be involved in conferring tolerance against furan aldehyde inhibitors which are commonly generated in thermo-acidic pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass. In this study we report the biophysical characterization of YghA from E. coli as a function of variation in pH. Fluorescence intensity of YghA increased by 2.5-fold in acidic pH as compared to circumneutral pH. In presence of the hydrophilic 8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonic acid (ANS) dye, a 68 - 79.4-fold increase in fluorescence intensity at acidic pH was observed as compared to circumneutral pH, while at basic pH the increase was only 1 to 2-fold. Secondary structure analysis by circular dichroism signal at 222 and 208 nm suggests that the secondary structure of YghA is primarily composed of alpha-helix at pH 7 and the secondary structure is abruptly lost at pH 3 and lower. In agreement with these observations, MD simulations predicted greater structural variations at low pH when compared to neutral or high pH. Interface energy calculations using computational docking protocols suggested that YghA forms relatively more stable complex with NADH. The in silico pulling assay results also show that NADH is more preferred compared to NADPH. Molecular dynamics simulations also indicate that YghA is structurally unstable at acidic pH with significant variations in the root mean square deviation values of the tetramer backbone. Residues GLU 84 at pH 7 together with PRO 24 and LEU 236 at pH 1 were identified as flexible residues and are promising target for future mutagenesis studies targeted towards improving structural stability of YghA."
"While chemotherapy and pulmonary metastasectomy are leading clinical treatments for lung metastases, their effectiveness is limited by high recurrence rates and systemic side effects. Preclinical treatments have shown the promise of inhalation-based RNA therapy as a viable approach that can circumvent first pass metabolism and reduce systemic exposure. Here, we develop an inhalable perfluorocarbon nanocapsule for the targeted delivery of RNA interference therapeutics to lung metastases. Administering the aerosolized nanocapsules results in uptake by lung epithelial and tumor cells, extended retention times over 48 h, minimal inflammatory response, negligible clearance by pulmonary immune cells, and minimal accumulation in other organs. Compared to standard chemotherapy, our treatment not only drastically reduces metastatic tumor burden, but also demonstrates enhanced anti-tumor immunity in the tumor microenvironment resulting in nearly doubled lifespans after just three doses over two weeks. Finally, molecular dynamics simulations to study agglomeration tendency indicate that excipients such as stearate and vitamin E bind strongly with the nanocapsule and can potentially inhibit agglomeration, thereby enhancing the shelf-life of these formulations. In summary, this study demonstrates the promise of inhalable perfluorocarbon-based delivery systems as a non-invasive, biocompatible, and effective lung tumor-targeting platform that can overcome the challenges of current treatments."
"Interactions between viral glycoproteins and cellular receptors determine virus tropism and represent promising targets for vaccines. Eph receptor tyrosine kinases are conserved receptors for the human oncogenic gammaherpesviruses, Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and mediate entry into target cells by interaction with the viral gH/gL glycoprotein complex. To evaluate the use of murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68), a natural pathogen of rodents, as an in vivo model system for early events in gammaherpesvirus infection, we characterized the interaction of the MHV68 gH/gL complex with Eph receptors. We demonstrate a direct interaction of MHV68 gH/gL with EphA4 and EphB3, that is conserved between human and murine receptors. Pre-incubation of MHV68 inocula with soluble decoy receptors decreased infection of permissive fibroblasts. Ectopic expression of EphA4 and EphB3 enabled MHV68 to infect otherwise non-permissive human B cells, demonstrating EphA4 and EphB3 receptor function. Targeted mutations informed by protein structure predictions demonstrate that the MHV68 gH/gL-Eph interaction is determined by domain I (D-I) and follows structural motifs previously described in the KSHV gH/gL-EphA2 complex. The importance of gH D-I is further highlighted by the analysis of gH-targeting neutralizing antibodies. Antibody adsorption via the full gH ectodomain or gH D-I led to comparable reductions in neutralization capacity of serum from WT infected mice, indicating the Eph-binding domain is a major target for gH/gL-directed neutralizing antibodies. Our study characterizes Eph receptors as novel interaction partners and entry receptors for MHV68. Conservation of entry mechanisms provides the basis for future in vivo analyses of the contribution of Eph receptors to cell-type dependent MHV68 infection, as well as targeted strategies to prevent transmission and diseases associated with chronic infection.

Author SummaryVirus-specific intervention and prevention is needed to fight cancers and morbidity caused by the oncoviruses Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) and Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV). The targeted design of such strategies requires a detailed knowledge of early events in the viral life cycle and the contribution of cellular receptors to infection and spread in vivo. Here, we characterize the role of Eph receptors in murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68) infection, a well-established mouse model for gammaherpesvirus (GHV) pathogenesis and preclinical therapeutic evaluations. As described for human GHVs, the interaction of Eph receptors with the gH/gL complex is mediated by a conserved motif consistent of the N-terminal domain of glycoprotein gH co-folded with gL and contributes to variable levels to infection of different target cells. We demonstrate that antibodies directed against the N-terminal domain of the gH/gL glycoprotein complex are generated upon MHV68 infection in mice and neutralize MHV68 infection in cell culture. Our data enables the analysis of the contribution of Eph receptor engagement to GHV infection in vivo and provides a promising target for subunit vaccination approaches."
"Humans effortlessly distinguish speech from music, but the neural basis of this categorization remains debated. Here, we combined intracranial recordings in humans with behavioral categorization of speech or music taken from a naturalistic movie soundtrack to test whether the encoding of spectrotemporal modulation (STM) acoustic features is sufficient to categorize the two classes. We show that primarily temporal and primarily spectral modulation patterns characterize speech and music, respectively, and that non-primary auditory regions robustly track these acoustic features over time. Critically, cortical representations of STMs predicted perceptual judgments gathered in an independent sample. Finally, speech-and music-related STM representations showed stronger tracking of category-specific acoustical features in the left versus right non-primary auditory regions, respectively. These findings support a domain-general framework for auditory categorization, such that perceptual categories emerge from efficient neural coding of low-level acoustical cues, highlighting the computational relevance of STMs in shaping auditory representations that support behavior."

One such program is the Interferon-Responsive Microglia state (IRM), which has been identified in developmental windows, aging, and disease. While the functional importance of this state is becoming increasingly clear, our understanding of the regulatory networks that govern IRM induction remain incomplete. To systematically identify genetic regulators of the IRM state, we conducted a genome-wide CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screen in human iPSC-derived microglia (iPS-Microglia) using IFIT1 as a representative IRM marker. We identified 772 genes that modulate IRM, including canonical type I interferon signaling genes (IFNAR2, TYK2, STAT1/2, USP18) and novel regulators. We uncovered a non-canonical role for the CCR4-NOT complex subunit CNOT10 in IRM activation, independent of its traditional function. This work provides a comprehensive resource for dissecting IRM biology and highlights both established and novel targets for modulating microglial interferon signaling in health and disease."
"Multimodal data collected by international and national biobanking efforts have distinct scales and model orders and provide unique and complementary insights into disease mechanisms. We propose a novel, flexible and efficient data fusion approach--aNy-way independent component analysis (aNy-way ICA). aNy-way ICA fuses N-way multimodal or multidomain data by optimizing the entire loading correlation structure of linked components via Gaussian independent vector analysis (IVA-G) and simultaneously optimizing independence via separate ICAs. This allows for distinct model orders for different modalities/domains and multiple linked sources detection across any number of modalities or domains without requiring orthogonality constraints on sources. Simulation results demonstrate that aNy-way ICA identifies the designed sources and loadings, as well as the true covariance patterns, with improved accuracy compared to other approaches, especially under noisy conditions. Applying aNy-way ICA to fuse 4D multi-domain fMRI data in schizophrenia, we identified a cortico-thalamo-cerebellar circuit, highlighting the functional linkages among higher order thalamic nuclei, the visual cortex, default mode network, and the posterior lobe of cerebellum. Their function links were replicated in two independent datasets. The connection among higher order thalamic nuclei, the visual cortex, and default mode network discriminates schizophrenia from controls and this aberrant connection is related to multiple cognitive deficits in both discovery and replication datasets, indicating the identified cortico-thalamo-cerebellar circuit may underlie ""cognitive dysmetria"" in schizophrenia."
"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are increasingly recognized as mediators of central nervous system (CNS) function and pathologies, including multiple sclerosis (MS). While plasma-derived EVs have been explored as biomarkers in MS, little is known about EVs in CNS tissue. Here, we characterize EVs from postmortem white matter (WM) of MS and control brains. EVs were separated by differential centrifugation followed by size exclusion chromatography and characterized using nanoflow cytometry, single-particle reflectance imaging sensing (SP-IRIS), and transmission electron microscopy. EV size, yield, and morphology did not differ significantly between MS and control samples. Proteomic analyses revealed downregulation of synaptic and mitochondrial proteins and upregulation of complement and inflammatory proteins and pathways in MS WM EVs. This suggests that EVs reflect ongoing synaptic pathology, metabolic dysfunction, and CNS-compartmentalized inflammation and that they may actively contribute to these pathological processes. Deconvolution analyses suggests a shift in EV cellular origin, with an increased astrocytic and decreased neuronal EV contributions in MS. Several proteomic changes we observed in CNS-derived EVs have also been reported in circulating EVs of people with MS, establishing this CNS tissue EV study as a valuable resource for identifying biomarker candidates for brain-derived plasma EV studies.

"Memories for events (i.e., episodic memories) change qualitatively with time. Systems consolidation theories posit that organizational changes accompany qualitative shifts in memory resolution, but differ as to the locus of this reorganization. Whereas some theories favor inter-regional changes in organization (e.g., hippocampus[-&gt;]cortex; multiple trace theory), others favor intra-regional reorganization (e.g., within-hippocampus; trace transformation theory). Using an engram tagging and manipulation approach in mice, here we provide evidence that intra-regional changes in organization underlie shifts in memory resolution. We establish that contextual fear memories lose resolution as a function of time, with mice exhibiting conditioned freezing in both the training apparatus (context A) and a second apparatus (context B) at more remote delays (freezingA {equiv} freezingB at remote delay). By tagging either hippocampal (dentate gyrus) or cortical (prelimbic cortex) neuronal ensembles in context A, and then pairing their optogenetic activation with shock (in context C), we monitored the resolution of these artificially-generated memories at recent versus remote post-conditioning delays by testing mice in contexts A and B. Hippocampal engrams for a fear conditioning event were initially high-resolution (recent delay: freezingA >> freezingB) but lost resolution with time (remote delay: freezingA {equiv} freezingB). In contrast, cortical engrams were initially low-resolution and remained low-resolution over time (recent and remote delay: freezingA {equiv} freezingB). Transformation of hippocampal engrams was dependent on adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Eliminating hippocampal neurogenesis arrested hippocampal engrams in a recent-like, high-resolution state where mice continued to exhibit discriminative freezing at remote delays.

"Neuroestrogens are synthesized in the brain and regulate social behavior and cognition. In the song sparrow (Melospiza melodia), 17{beta}-estradiol (17{beta}-E2) promotes aggression, even during the non-breeding season, when circulating 17{beta}-E2 levels are low. Measuring estrogens is challenging due to their low concentrations and the limited sensitivity of many existing assays. Moreover, estrogens other than 17{beta}-E2 are often overlooked. Here, we developed a method for simultaneous measurement of eleven estrogens that is highly specific, sensitive, accurate, and precise. We used liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with derivatization of estrogens by 1,2-dimethylimidazole-5-sulfonyl-chloride (DMIS) to enhance sensitivity. We included four 13C-labeled internal standards, which corrected for matrix effects when measuring catecholestrogens and methoxyestrogens. This method greatly improves upon our prior protocol, which could measure only four estrogens and included only one deuterated internal standard. Then, the new method was applied to samples from male song sparrows exposed to either a simulated territorial intrusion (STI) or a control condition during the breeding season or non-breeding season. Only estrone and 17{beta}-E2 were present in blood and brain, while the other nine estrogens in the panel were non-detectable. As expected, there was large regional variation in neuroestrogen levels and very low estrogen levels in blood. There was large seasonal variation, and estrogen levels were lower in the non-breeding season. Despite robust aggressive responses to the STI, estrogen levels did not differ between STI and control subjects in either season. In sum, our novel method enables ultrasensitive measurement of eleven estrogens and will be useful for studies of songbirds and other animals."
"Across cortex, a substantial component of observed neuronal activity can be explained by movement. Voluntary movements elicit cortical activity that contain elements related to both motor planning and sensory activity. However, automatic movements that do not require conscious processing, for example grooming or drinking, are to a large extent controlled by subcortical systems such as the brainstem. While the cortex may not be required to generate these automatic behaviors, it is unclear whether cortical activity represents the movements associated with them. In this work, we use a simple procedure to stimulate stereotyped grooming behaviors in the head-fixed mouse while measuring neuronal function across the dorsal cortex. We find specific cortical representations of grooming both at a mesoscale network-level and single-cell resolution. Mesoscale cortical activation was most prominent at the onset of grooming episodes, and declined to baseline levels despite continuous engagement in the behavior. Further stratification of grooming component movements revealed that more directed and unilateral grooming movements had greater cortical associated responses than more stereotyped bilateral movements. These findings help to frame the impact of forms of automatic movements on large scale cortical ensembles and suggest they engage specific and transient cellular and regional cortical ensembles."
"Different situations may require radically different information updating speeds (i.e., learning rates). Some demand fast learning rates, while others benefit from using slower ones. To adjust learning rates, people could rely on either global, meta-learned differences between environments, or faster but transient adaptations to locally experienced prediction errors. Here, we introduce a new paradigm that allows researchers to measure and empirically disentangle both forms of adaptations. Participants performed short blocks of trials of a continuous estimation task - fishing for crabs - on six different islands that required different optimal (initial) learning rates.

Across two experiments, participants showed fast adaptations in learning rate within a block. Critically, participants also learned global environment-specific learning rates over the time course of the experiment, as evidenced by computational modelling and by the learning rates calculated on the very first trial when revisiting an environment (i.e., unconfounded by transient adaptations).

Using representational similarity analyses of fMRI data, we found that differences in voxel pattern responses in the central orbitofrontal cortex correlated with differences in these global environment-specific learning rates. Our findings show that humans adapt learning rates at both slow and fast time scales, and that the central orbitofrontal cortex may support meta-learning by representing environment-specific task-relevant features such as learning rates."
"We have learned much about the brain regions that support reading by measuring neuronal responses to single words, but we know little about how the brain processes multiple words simultaneously. This fMRI study fills that gap by varying the number of English words presented while holding the amount of visual stimulation constant. We adapted the ""simultaneous suppression"" paradigm, which has demonstrated that the response to multiple stimuli presented simultaneously is typically smaller than the sum of responses to the same stimuli presented sequentially. On each trial, participants viewed rapid sequences of three frames. Each frame contained two character strings, most of which were pseudo-letters with visual features matched to familiar letters. The experimental conditions differed in the number of English words in the sequence: zero words; one word; two words sequentially; or two words simultaneously. Behaviorally, participants performed worse at detecting two words presented simultaneously than sequentially. In the brain, the BOLD response increased linearly with the number of words presented in several reading-related regions of the left hemisphere: the inferior frontal sulcus, the intraparietal sulcus, the superior temporal sulcus, and text-selective occipito-temporal regions. But the mean response magnitudes did not differ between sequential and simultaneous presentation of two words. Nonetheless, the sensitivity of ventral temporal text-selective regions to two words lexical frequencies was attenuated by simultaneous presentation. This suggests that words were processed less deeply when they competed simultaneously. Our new paradigm, therefore, reveals processing capacity limits in the reading circuitry."
"In CA1 pyramidal neurons (CA1-PYRs), plateau potentials control synaptic plasticity and the emergence of place cell identity. Here, we show that dendritic inhibition terminates plateaus in an all-or-none manner. Plateaus were initially resistant to inhibition but became increasingly susceptible to termination as they progressed. Between two distinct subtypes of dendrite-targeting interneurons, OLMNdnf generated slower postsynaptic currents that terminated plateaus more effectively than OLM2. Voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCs) were necessary for plateaus, which were prolonged by blocking small-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels (SK). A single-compartment model with these two conductances recapitulated core experimental findings and provided a mechanistic explanation for terminations. Plateaus arose from VGCCs maintained in the active state by sustained Ca2+ influx, a positive feedback loop that was quasi-balanced by ISK. Inhibition terminated plateaus by driving the membrane potential below a dynamic threshold to deactivate VGCCs and end the positive feedback loop. Lastly, two-photon Ca2+ imaging showed that plateaus evoke large dendritic Ca2+ transients that were graded by terminations. Overall, our results demonstrate how the feedback inhibitory circuit interacts with intrinsic cellular mechanisms to regulate plateau potentials and shape dendritic Ca2+ signals in CA1-PYRs."
"The formation of sensory cue-reward associations is essential for survival, but in the modern calorie-rich and advertising-intensive environment, such associations may become maladaptive - leading to negative health consequences such as obesity or diabetes. Recent research has demonstrated the importance of hypothalamic melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH)-expressing neurons in driving hedonically-motivated feeding and in forming these associations. The MCH system interacts with mesolimbic dopamine (DA) transmission, offering a potential mechanism for the effects of MCH neurons on hedonic feeding and associative conditioning. However, this interaction has not been fully characterized in vivo with modern approaches that offer high temporal and spatial resolution. We characterized MCH-DA interactions during feeding and food- motivated Pavlovian conditioning using in vivo fiber photometry in the lateral hypothalamus/zona incerta (LH/ZI) and nucleus accumbens (NAc). We found that MCH neuron activity and DA release in the medial-shell of the NAc (mNAcSh) were co-activated during consumption and in response to reward-predicting cues. During consumption, DA release preceded MCH activity, while responses to reward-predicting cues emerged in MCH neurons earlier than in the DA system. Lastly, gain and loss-of function of the MCH system bidirectionally modulates DA release in the mNAcSh. These results indicate that physiological co-activation of the MCH and DA systems occurs during food-motivated learning, and demonstrate a capacity for bidirectional modulation of DA release in the mNAcSh by the MCH system."
"Agricultural soils are an important source of nitrous oxide (N2O), which has greenhouse and ozone-depleting effects. Bradyrhizobium ottawaense SG09 is a nitrogen-fixing rhizobium with high N2O-reducing activity. Rhizobia form symbiotic nodules in leguminous plants. The initial physical attachment of bacteria to plant roots is a critical step in the establishment of symbiotic interactions. In this study, we performed microscopic analysis using DsRed-expressing B. ottawaense SG09. We revealed that B. ottawaense SG09 attached to both the root surface and root hairs via single cellular poles. This polar attachment was observed not only to the symbiotic host soybean, but also to non-leguminous plants, such as Arabidopsis, rice, corn, and wheat. We identified and analyzed the unipolar polysaccharide (upp) gene cluster, which is proposed to be involved in polar attachment of rhizobia, in the genome of B. ottawaense SG09. We established an Arabidopsis-based interaction assay and demonstrated that uppC and uppE play a critical role in attachment to both the root surface and root hairs."
"How cells translate growth factor (GF) signals into context-specific phenotypes remains a fundamental question in cell biology. The classical view holds that cells translate a constant concentration of a GF with specific chemical identity to a steady state activation of the underlying signaling pathway, resulting in a defined phenotypic response. However, recent findings suggest that even a single GF, when presented in a pulsatile manner, drives differential phenotypic responses depending on the frequency of stimulation. To reconcile these views, we introduce a novel conceptual framework of ""signaling homeorhesis"". Unlike homeostasis, homeorhesis describes the stable evolution of signaling trajectories over time. Defining this concept quantitatively using a dynamical systems framework, we use mathematical models of the Epidermal Factor Growth Receptor (EGFR) and the Tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA) networks, as well as available experimental temporal protein activity recordings in PC-12 cells to demonstrate that cells classify GF signals to unique signaling trajectories that encode for distinct cell phenotypes, irrespective of the GF identity. We thereby propose that the cellular phenotype is determined in real-time, as the cell actively interprets the growth factor signals from its environment."
"In eukaryotes, cell division requires coordination between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Entry into cell division is driven by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), which need a cyclin binding partner for their activity. In Schizosaccharomyces pombe (fission yeast), the B-type cyclin Cdc13 is essential and sufficient for cell cycle progression and is strongly enriched in the nucleus. Here, we show that a fraction of Cdc13 is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm just prior to mitosis. This export could be critical to propagate CDK activity throughout the cell. Mutating three Cdc13 nuclear localization signals (NLSs) led to precocious enrichment of Cdc13 in the cytoplasm but did not accelerate mitotic entry, indicating that the export is not sufficient to trigger entry into mitosis. The export coincides with spindle pole body integration into the nuclear envelope and may be required to coordinate nuclear and cytoplasmic signaling required for this integration. The onset and stop of Cdc13 nuclear export are remarkably abrupt, underscoring that S. pombe mitotic entry consists of several switch-like transitions over the course of minutes. Our findings add another instance to the various cyclin nuclear transport events known to occur at critical cell cycle transitions throughout eukaryotes."
"To segregate chromosomes at cell division, the spindle must maintain its structure under force. How it does so remains poorly understood. To address this question, we use microneedle manipulation to apply local force to spindle microtubule bundles, kinetochore-fibers (k-fibers), inside mammalian cells. We show that local load directly fractures k-fibers, and that newly created plus-ends often have arrested dynamics, resisting depolymerization. Force alone, without fracture, is sufficient for spindle microtubule stabilization, as revealed by laser ablating k-fibers under local needle force. Doublecortin, which binds a compacted microtubule lattice, is lost around the force application site, suggesting local force-induced structural remodeling. In turn, EB1, which recognizes GTP-tubulin, is locally enriched at stabilization sites, both before and after force-induced fracture. Together, our findings support a model where force-induced damage leads to local spindle microtubule lattice remodeling and stabilization, which we propose reinforces the spindle where it experiences critical loads."
"Deep learning sequence to function models can predict the molecular effects of genetic variants, but their predictions are limited to the cell types and assays they are trained on. Here we describe DNACipher, a deep learning model that predicts the effects of genetic variants across diverse biological contexts--including those not directly measured. DNACipher takes 196 kb of genome sequences as input and imputes variant effects across 38,582 cell type-assay combinations. DNACipher generates predictions for >7 times as many contexts as Enformer, which allows for better detection of variant effects at expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). We also introduce DNACipher Deep Variant Impact Mapping (DVIM), a method to identify variants with molecular effects at genome-wide association study (GWAS) loci. Application of DVIM to type 1 diabetes (T1D) reduced the mean fine-mapping credible set size from 24 to 1.4 variants per signal. DVIM variants had significantly higher fine-mapping posterior probabilities, and their predicted effects were supported by single-nucleus ATAC-seq and luciferase assays. DVIM also detected 6547 rare variants with molecular effects at 96% of GWAS T1D loci, and these were enriched for associations with immune traits. In summary, DNACipher DVIM prioritises common and rare variants at GWAS loci by predicting molecular effects across a broad range of contexts."
"Zebrafish are an important model system in behavioral neuroscience due to their rapid development and suite of distinct, innate behaviors. Quantifying many of these larval behaviors requires detailed tracking of eye and tail kinematics, which in turn demands imaging at high spatial and temporal resolution, ideally using semi or fully automated tracking methods for throughput efficiency. However, creating and validating accurate tracking models is time-consuming and labor intensive, with many research groups duplicating efforts on similar images. With the goal of developing a useful community resource, we trained pose estimation models using a diverse array of video parameters and a 15-keypoint pose model. We deliver an annotated dataset of free-swimming and head-embedded behavioral videos of larval zebrafish, along with four pose estimation networks from DeepLabCut and SLEAP (two variants of each). We also evaluated model performance across varying imaging conditions to guide users in optimizing their imaging setups. This resource will allow other researchers to skip the tedious and laborious training steps for setting up behavioral analyses, guide model selection for specific research needs, and provide ground truth data for benchmarking new tracking methods.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTLarval zebrafish are an emerging model in systems neuroscience, offering unique advantages for linking brain activity to behavior. However, detailed behavioral tracking, essential for such studies, requires time- and labor-intensive annotation and model training. To eliminate this bottleneck, here we provide a high-quality, annotated dataset of zebrafish behaviors for both free-swimming and head-embedded preparations alongside four pre-trained pose estimation models using DeepLabCut and SLEAP. We benchmark models performance across diverse imaging conditions to guide optimal setup choices. This community resource will allow researchers to bypass the most time-consuming stages of data annotation and training, enabling immediate behavioral analysis. By removing this key hurdle, this work will accelerate project initiation, support reproducibility, and provide a foundation for future tracking method development."
"Skeletal muscle-derived extracellular vesicles (SkM-EVs) have recently been recognized as novel endocrine factors capable of facilitating inter-organ communication between skeletal muscle and distant organs. These vesicles transport various molecular cargoes, including microRNAs (miRNAs), which are essential regulators of post-transcriptional gene expression. In this study, we characterized the miRNA composition of SkM-EVs using small RNA sequencing and elucidated their putative biological roles via comprehensive bioinformatics analyses. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses of the predicted miRNA targets revealed that SkM-EV miRNAs are involved in several key pathways, including the FoxO signaling pathway, the insulin signaling pathway, and cancer-related pathways. Our findings suggest that SkM-EV miRNAs may simultaneously promote muscle differentiation and exert protective effects against diabetes and cancer development. These findings provide new insights into the systemic regulatory roles of SkM-EVs and highlight their therapeutic potential for muscular, metabolic, and oncological disorders."
"The increasing availability of wearable forehead EEG devices, such as the Hypnodyne ZMax, open-source DCM, CGX PatchEEG, and many others, has significantly expanded opportunities for convenient, at-home sleep monitoring. However, most publicly available sleep classifiers are trained on scalp EEG from traditional polysomnography (PSG) data, and thus generalize poorly to forehead EEG due to differences in electrode placement, referencing montages, and higher susceptibility to artifacts from user movements and electrode displacement. Conventional classifiers typically do not explicitly account for these artifacts, resulting in inaccurate and misleading sleep stage scoring. To address this gap, we developed a suite of artifact-aware sleep stage classifiers trained specifically using forehead EEG data, leveraging two comprehensive datasets--Wearanize+ and Donders2022--that contain concurrent forehead EEG and clinical PSG recordings. We further introduce two classifier variants: one optimized for real-time applications that operates directly on raw EEG amplitudes, and another optimized for offline analysis utilizing normalized EEG signals. Validation results indicate robust and reliable classification performance across standard sleep stages (Wake, N1, N2, N3, REM), along with effective identification of artifact epochs. Importantly, the developed classifiers generalize well to forehead EEG devices beyond the original training platform. These validated classifiers are freely available to the sleep research community through the open-source ezscore-f package, providing versatile and practical tools for forehead EEG-based sleep stage analysis."
"Many host-associated bacteria influence the differentiation of their eukaryotic host cells. The association between Wolbachia pipientis and Drosophila melanogaster offers a model for understanding how host-microbe gene expression co-evolves. Using Wolbachia-infected Drosophila cell lines, we show that the wMel strain alters host cell states, inducing novel gene expression programs that diverge from known cell types. Transcriptomic co-expression network analysis identified gene expression modules specific to each cell type and infection state, and revealed that wMel tailors its gene expression to host context. In macrophage-like host cells, wMel expresses pathogenic effectors, whereas in neuron-like cells, wMel upregulates metabolic genes. Micro-C chromatin contact data revealed that many of these infection-induced changes are epigenetically encoded, with wMel infection conferring reduced chromatin contacts and widespread transcriptional derepression in D. melanogaster. These findings show that the nature of Wolbachia symbiosis--mutualistic or pathogenic--emerges from host cell environments and suggest new paths for engineering host-specific microbial phenotypes.

In BriefWolbachia pipientis reprograms Drosophila cell identity by reshaping host gene expression and chromatin in a cell type-specific manner. Infected cells adopt novel states tailored to wMel strain gene expression, enabling either mutualism or pathogenesis. These findings advance Wolbachia engineering for targeted host cell interactions and symbiont-driven phenotypes.

"Accurate membrane protein biogenesis is essential for cellular function, yet many proteins contain suboptimal targeting or insertion signals. Influenza A virus (IAV) faces similar constraints during infection but may have evolved strategies to enhance the biogenesis of its own membrane proteins. One such protein, the viroporin M2, contains functionally essential hydrophilic residues within its transmembrane domain, which should hinder efficient membrane insertion. We hypothesize that IAV has adapted to overcome these sequence-based limitations and ensure robust M2 biogenesis. Using a biotin pulse-labelling system in intact cells, we uncover the dynamics of M2 targeting and ER insertion. Attenuating the insertion rate by ablating a key insertion factor, the ER membrane protein complex (EMC), leads to M2 accumulating in the cytosol, but remaining partially insertion competent. We find that cytosolic stability of non-inserted M2 is crucial for efficient biogenesis under these conditions and identify amphipathic helix- mediated membrane association as the molecular mechanism that counteracts proteasomal degradation. We propose membrane association as a novel buffering mechanism that regulates membrane protein biogenesis by stabilizing pre-insertion intermediates.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTMembrane proteins failing to insert into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) may be rapidly degraded to avoid protein aggregation in the cytosol. Our findings challenge this prevailing view. We show that the influenza A viroporin M2, despite possessing unfavourable features for membrane insertion, can increase biogenesis efficiency by associating with the membrane prior to insertion. Membrane association buffers the protein against quality control pathways and promotes successful biogenesis--even in the absence of a key insertion factor. These results reveal an alternative fate for non-inserted membrane proteins and uncover a viral strategy that redefines how cells manage unstable insertion intermediates."

"The biogenesis of thousands of highly diverse membrane proteins in humans is facilitated by an array of ER-resident membrane protein translocases. While some membrane proteins have a strict requirement for a specific insertion machinery, membrane proteins with short translocated domains may be able to access multiple pathways. Here, we quantify the functional importance of redundancy in membrane protein translocation during influenza A virus (IAV) infection by examining the biogenesis of the viroporin M2. Given the wide host and cellular tropism of IAV, the virus likely evolved mechanisms to leverage host translocation pathways efficiently. We demonstrate that although M2 utilizes the ER membrane protein complex (EMC), driven by signals encoded in its transmembrane and C-terminal domains, M2 maintains an approximately 50% membrane insertion rate in the absence of the EMC. This influences viral cell-to-cell transmission across different IAV strains, with a greater impact on those expressing lower levels of M2. We identify alternative translocation of M2 via Oxa1-family translocons independent of canonical targeting chaperones. These findings reveal how the exploitation of multiple redundant pathways can ensure robust IAV infection.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTIAV must rapidly replicate in diverse mammalian hosts, which requires efficient integration of viral proteins into host cell membranes. This study uncovers how the viral proton channel M2 utilizes multiple redundant protein insertion pathways, accessing EMC and alternative Oxa1-family translocases. Revealing these redundant strategies clarifies how cells triage membrane proteins, offering insights into both viral adaptation and host cell robustness."

"The Drosophila ejaculatory duct (ED) is a secretory tissue of the male somatic reproductive system responsible for producing components of the seminal fluid which support fertility, serve antimicrobial functions and influence the physiological changes in the female after mating. The ED is a simple organ made up of secretory epithelial cells that are encased by extracellular matrix and a layer of innervated contractile muscle. These secretory cells are post-mitotic and lack known stem cells or progenitors in the adult, but they are not fully quiescent. They undergo a variant cell cycle called endoreplication immediately post-eclosion to increase organ size and protein synthesis capacity. Polyploid and post-mitotic tissues often face unique challenges in response to cell loss due to their inability to proliferate. Here, we show that the adult ED is capable of significant recovery after cell loss due to a combination of increased nuclear and cellular hypertrophy that partially restores tissue mass and organ function. The early cell cycle plasticity of this adult tissue is critical for this recovery, as older tissues that have few or no endocycles exhibit reduced capacity for recovery after cell loss. Together, our findings establish the Drosophila ED as a model to study post-mitotic polyploid tissue repair and highlight a combination of endocycles and hypertrophy as a key mechanism for functional regeneration in the absence of mitosis."
"Caenorhabditis elegans utilize light receptors to modify foraging and locomotion in response to phototoxic blue and UV light. Our study investigated physiological and behavioral changes in C. elegans during and after exposure to high-intensity light-emitting diode (LED) light. Our findings corroborate previously reported blue-light-induced oxidative stress, mitochondrial damage, and avoidance behavior. Novel to our work is the identification of a protective role for lysosome-related organelles (LROs), the observation of a unique ""shelter-seeking behavior"" potentially mediated by light gradient sensing, and the seemingly dispensable role of canonical light receptors in this specific behavioral response."
"In physiology and in disease, cells often migrate through narrow spaces, such as leukocytes undergoing diapedesis or cancer cells during dissemination. Cultured cells under physical confinement have been shown to experience mechanical stress due to deformation of the nucleus. Nuclear deformation can lead to loss of nuclear integrity and DNA damage, and it has been proposed to underlie cancer initiation and progression. In vivo, the consequences of physical confinement on physiological, developmental cell migration remain so far unexplored. Here, we use the zebrafish neural crest as an in vivo model to address how multipotent embryonic cells respond to physical confinement during developmental migration. By measuring the extracellular space from head to tail along the embryonic body axis, we found that the level of tissue scale confinement increases along the antero-posterior axis. We found that neural crest experience dramatic nuclear deformation during their migrating between adjacent tissues, which quantitatively scales with tissue confinement. By using complementary genetic and mechanical strategies to ablate the surrounding tissue, we observe a rescue of nuclear deformation in vivo. Surprisingly, we found that while deformation of the NC nucleus causes stretching of the nuclear envelope, it does not cause DNA damage even upon extreme deformations. Instead, cells adapt, by decreasing both their DNA damage and LaminB2 levels upon entering confined spaces. In summary, we establish the neural crest as a physiological framework uncovering a dynamic adaptation to tissue confinement in vivo."
"During development mechanochemical cues in the cell microenvironment are translated into signalling to drive cell fate decisions. As cells differentiate collectively, it raises the question of how tissue-level properties affect instructive cues of decision-making. Here, we show that a tissue rigidity phase transition guides patterning by tuning the length-scales and time-scales of morphogen signalling. By combining rigidity percolation theory, reaction-diffusion modelling, quantitative imaging, optogenetics and single-cell transcriptomics in zebrafish, we uncover dynamical global tissue rigidity patterns that actively shape the Nodal morphogen gradient by restricting ligand dispersal and accelerating its signalling activity. In this self-generated mechanism, Nodal, besides driving meso-endoderm fate specification, increases cell-cell adhesion strength via regulating planar cell polarity genes. Once adhesion strength reaches a critical point, it triggers a rigidity transition which collapses tissue porosity. The abrupt tissue reorganisation negatively feeds back on Nodal signalling impacting both its length-scales, by limiting Nodal diffusivity, and its time-scales, by speeding up the expression of its antagonist Lefty, thereby ensuring timely signal termination and robust patterning. Overall, we reveal how emergent properties set the spatiotemporal dynamics of morphogen gradients, uncovering macroscopic mechanisms of pattern formation."
"Capsella bursa-pastoris is a recent allotetraploid and a promising model for studying early consequences of polyploidy. One of the intriguing questions in polyploid research is how new functions arise from initially identical or nearly identical homoeologous genes. Functional genetics tools, including genetic editing, can help to understand this process, but they have not been developed for C. bursa-pastoris yet. We present here the results of our study aimed at filling this gap. In particular, we compared the efficiency of floral dip transformation in six accessions of C. bursa-pastoris representing distant populations. The Asian clade accession PGL0025 had the highest efficiency of transformation ([~]1.1%). Comparison of Agrobacterium tumefaciens strains EHA105 and GV3101 (pMP90) showed that the latter is more effective. Also, we created a genome-wide gRNA database for all pairs of homoeologs of the PGL0001 accession of C. bursa-pastoris and integrated it into publicly available genome browser: https://t2e.online/igv_capsella_bursa-pastoris/. We assessed the possibility of differential editing for two pairs of homoeologous genes with high sequence similarity (>90%) both in vitro and in silico. Despite the test results that indicated off-target activity, we have succeeded in obtaining lines of plants with homozygous frameshift mutations in each of the homoeologs separately in vivo. We expect that these findings and resources will promote the use of C. bursa-pastoris as a model in functional genetics experiments, in particular, the studies of the fate of duplicated gene after polyploidization event."
"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a leading cause of cardiac failure among individuals under 35. Many genetic mutations that cause HCM enhance ventricular systolic function, suggesting that these HCM mutations are hypercontractile. Among the most common causes of HCM are mutations in the gene MYH7, which encodes for {beta}-cardiac myosin, the principal human ventricular myosin. Previous work has demonstrated that, for purified myosins, some MYH7 mutations are gain-of-function while others cause reduced function, so how they lead to enhanced contractility is not clear. Here, we have characterized the mechanics and kinetics of the severe HCM-causing mutation M493I. Motility assays demonstrate a 70% reduction of actin filament gliding velocities on M493I-coated surfaces relative to WT. This mutation slows ADP release from actomyosin{middle dot}ADP 5-fold without affecting phosphate release or ATP binding. Yet it enhances steady-state ATPase Vmax 2-fold. Through single-molecule mechanical studies, we find that M493I myosin has a normal working stroke of 5 nm but a significantly prolonged actin attachment duration. Under isometric feedback, M493I myosins produce high, sustained force, with an actin detachment rate that is less sensitive to force than that of WT myosin. We also report direct measurement of the equilibrium state of the super-relaxed to disordered relaxed (SRX-DRX) regulatory transition and show its disruption in M493I, with a concomitant enhancement to actin attachment kinetics. Together, these data demonstrate that enhanced myosin binding from inhibition of myosins off state, combined with slow ADP release and enhanced force production, underlie the enhanced function and etiology of this HCM mutation.

Significance StatementHypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a leading genetic cause of sudden cardiac death in young individuals. Although often described as a hypercontractile disease, the molecular basis for this remains unclear, especially for mutations with inhibitory effects in various in vitro assays. We show that the severe HCM mutation M493I in {beta}-cardiac myosin slows ADP release yet enhances force output and actin attachment through multiple mechanisms, including disrupted autoinhibition via the super-relaxed state. Our findings unify seemingly contradictory biophysical changes into a coherent mechanistic model and support the hypothesis that increased myosin head availability, rather than enhanced individual kinetics alone, underlies HCM hypercontractility."
"The receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase BIK1 and its close homolog PBL1 have been widely recognized as central components of plant immunity. However, most genetic studies of BIK1 and PBL1 functions were carried out with single T-DNA insertional mutant alleles. Some phenotypes observed in these mutants, e.g. autoimmunity, have been difficult to reconcile with the proposed role of BIK1 and PBL1 in pattern-triggered immunity. In this study, we generated multiple new alleles of bik1 and pbl1 by CRISPR-Cas9-based gene editing and systematically analyzed these mutants alongside existing T-DNA insertional lines. These analyses reinforced the central role of BIK1 and PBL1 in pattern-triggered immunity mediated by both receptor kinases and receptor-like proteins. At the same time, however, we revealed several pleiotropic phenotypes associated with T-DNA insertions that are not necessarily linked to loss of BIK1 or PBL1 function. Further analyses of newly generated bik1 pbl1 double mutants uncovered an even greater contribution of these kinases to immune signaling and disease resistance than previously appreciated. These findings clarify longstanding ambiguities surrounding BIK1 and PBL1 functions."
"Myrothamnus flabellifolia is a dioecious resurrection plant endemic to southern Africa that has become an important model for desiccation tolerance. Here, we present a chromosome-level, haplotype-resolved reference genome for M. flabellifolia alongside transcriptomic profiling across a natural dehydration-rehydration cycle. The 1.28 Gb genome exhibits unusually consistent chromatin architecture with putative holocentric chromosome organization across highly divergent haplotypes. We identified an XY sexual system with a small sex-determining region on chromosome 8. Transcriptomic changes during dehydration varied with the severity of water loss and pointed to early suppression of growth, progressive activation of protective mechanisms, and reversible changes in transcript abundance upon rehydration. Co-expression networks and targeted gene family analyses revealed dynamic regulation of LEA and ELIP genes, with evidence of transcriptome ""priming"" in hydrated plants, with transcript abundance shifting toward highly disordered proteins during desiccation. Enrichment of ABA and light-responsive cis-regulatory elements in key genes support the existence of conserved stress response pathways. M. flabellifolias rich profile of phenolics and antioxidant genes highlight the overlap between desiccation tolerance and medicinal potential. Together, this study provides foundational resources for understanding the genomic architecture and reproductive biology of M. flabellifolia while offering new insights into the mechanisms of desiccation tolerance."

"Beneficial endophytes help plants thrive in challenging environments by altering their hosts metabolism, but how these cellular scale metabolic changes propagate to the systems biology scale is unknown. In this work, we employed a high-resolution chemical imaging approach to map metabolic changes at the root zone and cell type levels and found that a 9-strain consortium of beneficial endophytes differentially altered the metabolome of droughted root tissues according to cell types and locations along the root system architecture. Using machine learning (ML) models, we identified root metabolites and exudates that have predictive power over treatment class and could therefore be used as systems biology indicators of drought and endophyte inoculation status. We calculated the correlation between each endophyte and metabolite and found that this relationship shifts under drought conditions, indicating the dynamic role endophytes play in a plants microbiome and metabolism in response to environmental changes."
"BackgroundPrevious studies have shown an association between interindividual variations in the frequency of alpha-band EEG oscillations such as estimates of peak alpha frequency (PAF) and pain sensitivity. Whether differences in PAF also influence the susceptibility to develop central sensitization (CS) is unknown.

ObjectiveThis study aimed to determine if the PAF of vision- and sensorimotor-related alpha-band activity is associated with the magnitude and extent of secondary mechanical hyperalgesia induced by high-frequency stimulation (HFS) of the skin, a surrogate marker of CS.

MethodsThe EEG was recorded in 32 healthy participants at rest during eyes open and eyes closed conditions, and during bilateral finger movements. Two methods were used to isolate vision- and sensorimotor-related alpha-band activity based on sensitivity to eye closure and movement: one based on an independent component analysis, the other on spectral subtraction. PAF was assessed using a center-of-gravity approach or the Fitting Oscillations and One-Over-F (FOOOF) method, accounting for the aperiodic EEG component. HFS was applied to the right forearm, and pinprick sensitivity was assessed at both forearms, before and 40 minutes after HFS.

ResultsNeither sensorimotor-nor vision-related PAF were significantly correlated with the magnitude or extent of HFS-induced secondary hyperalgesia. Interestingly, at the non-sensitized forearm, participants with a higher vision-related PAF exhibited greater habituation to pinprick stimuli, suggesting that variations in PAF may relate to variations in sensory habituation.

ConclusionInterindividual variations of PAF were not significantly associated with the susceptibility to develop HFS-induced secondary hyperalgesia.

New and NoteworthyUsing several methods to estimate vision- and sensorimotor-related peak alpha frequency (PAF) in the EEG frequency spectrum, we found no significant association between interindividual variations in PAF and the susceptibility to develop secondary hyperalgesia following high-frequency stimulation (HFS) of the skin in healthy participants."

"Remote monitoring technologies are increasingly utilized in animal research for their capacity to enhance data collection efficiency. However, they present challenges, and as such researchers have resorted to utilizing deep learning to automatically classify acquired data therefore expediting the review process. While this practice is common in field studies it has been less adopted in zoo monitoring. In this paper we deploy the YOLOv10x model to monitor four species at Knowsley Safari in the UK: African lions (Panthera leo), Southern white rhino (Ceratotherium simum simum), Grevys zebra (Equus grevyi) and Olive baboons (Papio anubis). Camera trap images were processed and classified using the Conservation AI desktop application. The raw images were saved to facilitate the comparative analysis of the models predictions against the findings of human observed images. Processing time for both methods was compared using a subset of 3015 images with Conservation AI, reducing the time required to classify the images by 82% compared to a human analyst. Confusion matrix results showed high accuracy rates for all four species (>0.90). Analysis of count data showed significant differences in three species, where the human observer recorded more observations of each than Conservation AI (lion, rhino, baboon p<0.005). However, no significant difference was seen in zebra (p>0.05). A strong positive correlation in count data between both methodologies was seen in all species; baboon (rho=0.955, p<0.005), lion (rho = 0.969, p<0.005), rhino (rho=0.887, p<0.005) and zebra (rho=0.843, p<0.005). This study highlights the potential for these technologies as a monitoring system in zoos."
"Membranes are commonly used for the separation and purification of a variety of biological species. In this study, we developed a nanopocket membrane that can capture nanoparticles and extracellular vesicles in tangential flow filtration by pulling the species of interest into a nanopocket, while tangential flow washes away particles too large to be captured. We developed the pores using a four-step lithography process. By optimizing photolithography parameters, particularly exposure dose, we achieved well-defined pore shapes with the desired wall tilt, forming nanopocket geometries. We validated membrane performance using bead mixtures of varying diameters (50 nm -10 {micro}m), demonstrating its ability to pass small particles, capture mid-sized particles, and exclude larger ones. Surface modification with poly(l-lysine)- grafted poly(ethylene glycol) enhanced this performance by reducing pore size and improving particle release. Additionally, we demonstrated selective capture and release of liposomes as well as EVs in the presence of fluorescently labeled BSA (f-BSA) protein. During this process, EVs were retained and later released, while f-BSA passed through, confirming selective capture and reduced protein contamination. These PEGylated nanopocket membranes constitute a low-pressure platform for gentle, size-selective isolation of nanoscale bioparticles, laying the groundwork for improved extracellular-vesicle analytics and point-of-care diagnostic applications."
"BackgroundThe emergence of single-cell (SC) and spatial transcriptomics (ST) has revolutionized our understanding of gene expression dynamics in complex tissues. However, it also presents challenges for data analysis and visualization, particularly due to the complexity of ST data and the diversity of analysis platforms. The SCNT (Single-Cell, Single-Nucleus, and Spatial Transcriptomics Analysis and Visualization Tools) package was developed to address these challenges by providing an efficient and user-friendly tool for processing, analyzing, and visualizing SC and ST data.

ResultsSCNT is an R-based package that integrates widely used tools such as Seurat and ggplot2, enabling seamless conversion between Seurat and H5ad formats. The package supports high-resolution spatial visualization, including customizable gene expression and clustering plots. SCNT also simplifies key data analysis steps, such as quality control, dimensionality reduction, and doublet detection, significantly enhancing workflow efficiency. We tested SCNT on publicly available PBMC dataset, Visum and Visium HD human kidney tissue data, demonstrating its effectiveness.

ConclusionsSCNT offers a valuable tool for researchers exploring SC and ST data. Its simplicity, flexibility, and powerful visualization capabilities provide a streamlined workflow for both novice and advanced users. Future developments will focus on expanding support for additional ST platforms and enhancing mult-omics data integration."
"Therapeutic target discovery remains a critical yet intuition-driven bottleneck in drug develo ment, typically relying on disease biologists to laboriously integrate diverse biomedical data into testable hypotheses for experimental validation. Here, we present OriGene, a self-evolving multiagent system that functions as a virtual disease biologist, systematically identifying original and mechanistically grounded therapeutic targets at scale. OriGene coordinates specialized agents that reason over diverse modalities, including genetic data, protein networks, pharmacological profiles, clinical records, and literature evidence, to generate and prioritize target discovery hypotheses. Through a self-evolving framework, OriGene continuously integrates human and experimental feedback to iteratively refine its core thinking templates, tool composition, and analytical protocols, thereby enhancing both accuracy and adaptability over time. To comprehensively evaluate its performance, we established TRQA, a benchmark comprising over 1,900 expert-level question-answer pairs spanning a wide range of diseases and target classes. OriGene consistently outperforms human experts, leading research agents, and state-of-the-art large language models in accuracy, recall, and robustness, particularly under conditions of data sparsity or noise. Critically, OriGene nominated previously underexplored therapeutic targets for liver (GPR160) and colorectal cancer (ARG2), which demonstrated significant anti-tumor activity in patient-derived organoid and tumor fragment models mirroring human clinical exposures. These findings demonstrate OriGenes potential as a scalable and adaptive platform for AI-driven discovery of mechanistically grounded therapeutic targets, offering a new paradigm to accelerate drug development."
"Vicia sativa (common vetch, n=6) is an annual leguminous plant with high drought tolerance and high grain protein content. Historically and still today, vetches are important for nitrogen fixation to maintain cereal yields and feeding grazing livestock. In this study, we re-sequenced the genomes of 279 common vetch accessions from a wide geographic range covering western Eurasia and North Africa to construct a comprehensive nucleotide variation map. Population structure analyses indicate that the Middle Eastern region was the centre of origin of common vetch, which then entered Europe in two distinct waves. One wave propagated by humans through Turkey into the Carpathian Basin before spreading throughout Europe via ""Danubian"" and ""Mediterranean"" routes. Demographic inferences revealed a significant bottleneck for all common vetch groups initiated during the Last Glacial Maximum, followed by an expansion that coincides with the onset of the warm Holocene epoch and the Neolithic Revolution. Interestingly, we identified selective sweeps for the flowering time regulators VsSOC1 and VsFTb2 in northern latitude populations suggesting that both genes are important regulators of latitudinal adaptation. Overall, we provide valuable genomic resources for conservation and breeding programs to optimize food production in the face of population growth and reduced agricultural resources."
"Terrestrial remote sensing approaches, such as acoustic monitoring, deliver finely resolved and reliable biodiversity data. However, the scalability of surveys is often limited by the effort, time and cost needed to deploy, maintain and retrieve sensors. Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, or drones) are emerging as a promising tool for fully autonomous data collection, but there is considerable scope for their further use in ecology. In this study, we explored whether a novel approach to UAV-based acoustic monitoring could detect biodiversity patterns across a varied tropical landscape in Costa Rica. We simulated surveys of UAVs employing intermittent locomotion-based sampling strategies on an existing dataset of 26,411 hours of audio recorded from 341 static sites, with automated detections of 19 bird species (n = 1,819) and spider monkey (n = 2,977) vocalisations. We varied the number of samplers deployed in a single survey (sampling intensity) and whether the samplers move between sites randomly, in a pre-determined route to minimise travel time, or by adaptively responding to real-time detections (sampling strategy) and measured the impact on downstream ecological analyses. We found that observed avian species richness and spider monkey occupancy was not impacted by sampling strategy, but that sampling intensity had a strong influence on downstream metrics. Whilst our simulated UAV surveys were effective in capturing broad biodiversity trends, such as spider monkey occupancy and avian habitat associations, they were less suited for exhaustive species inventories, with rare species often missed at low sampling intensities. As autonomous UAV systems and acoustic AI analyses become more reliable and accessible, our study shows that combining these technologies could deliver valuable biodiversity data at scale."

"Recent advances in remote sensing, data availability, and cloud-based computing have led to a rapid expansion of publicly accessible datasets characterizing forest cover and land use. These datasets are widely used in ecological research, natural resource management, and policymaking. However, the sheer number of available products--and the often-subtle differences among them--pose significant challenges for users seeking the most appropriate dataset for their specific objectives. Here, we evaluate 27 derived products from 12 publicly available sources that quantify tree or forest cover and use across the conterminous United States (CONUS), with temporal coverage ranging from 5 to 30 years. The products include both satellite-based remote sensing data and ground-based national forest inventory data. We ask: How, why, and where do these datasets differ in their estimates of forest extent and change over time? Our analysis reveals that estimates of total forest area at the CONUS scale differ by over 2,000,000 km{superscript 2}, and correlations among forest change estimates vary widely in both direction and statistical significance. To support dataset selection and interpretation, we developed an open-access map comparison tool using Google Earth Engine. Our findings highlight the substantial implications of dataset choice for understanding forest dynamics and underscore the need for careful selection and transparent reporting in forest-related analyses."
"Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) is a redox-active compound with physiological functions, widely used in functional foods and supplements. However, quantifying the reduced form, PQQred, is difficult due to its low solubility and susceptibility to oxidation. This study presents a robust HPLC method for direct quantification of PQQred in complex matrices. By changing to a strongly acidic eluent, the oxidation of PQQred was suppress, and the optimized method successfully separated PQQred from its oxidized counterpart (PQQox)and matrix interferences, enabling accurate quantification. A pretreatment using ascorbic acid and {gamma}-CD effectively reduced and solubilized PQQred, and total PQQ can be analyzed as PQQred. The method achieved excellent linearity (R2 = 1), low detection limits (LOD: 0.20 mg/L, LOQ: 0.50 mg/L), and high precision (RSD < 3%). Application to commercial beverages showed consistent recovery (99-101%) with minimal interference. Moreover, the method suctandem mass spectrometry.cessfully detected biologically generated PQQred in yeast cultures, demonstrating its utility in physiological systems. This redox-specific and practical approach enables routine analysis and quality control of PQQ-enriched products, especially where accurate assessment of redox state is essential."
"High-content imaging (HCI) and analysis are the keys for advancing our understanding of the science behind organogenesis. To this end, culturing adult stem cell-derived organoids (ASOs) in a platform that also enables live imaging, staining, immobilization, and fast high-resolution imaging is crucial. However, existing platforms only partially satisfy these requirements. In this study, we present the OrganoidChip+, an all-in-one microfluidic device designed to integrate both culturing and HCI of ASOs all within one platform. We previously developed the OrganoidChip as a robust imaging tool. Now, the OrganoidChip+ incorporates several additional features for culturing organoids in addition to fluorescence staining and imaging without the need for sample transfer. The organoids grown within a culture chamber are stained and then transferred to immobilization chambers for blur-free, high-resolution imaging at predetermined locations. We cultured adult stem cell-derived intestinal organoids in the chip for 7 days and tracked growth rates of each organoid using intermittent brightfield images, followed by multiple image-based assays, including viability assay using widefield fluorescence imaging, a redox ratio assay using label-free, two-color, two-photon microscopy, and immunofluorescence assays using confocal microscopy. These assays serve as proof-of-concept to showcase the chips capabilities in HCI of ASOs. Organoids cultured in the chip exhibited superior average growth rates over those in traditional Matrigel dome cultures, off-chip. Viability and redox ratio measurements of on-chip organoids were comparable or slightly better than their off-chip counterparts. Confocal imaging further confirmed that the OrganoidChip+ supports robust organoid culture while enabling detailed, high-resolution analysis. This all-in-one platform holds great potential for advancing ASO-based research, offering a scalable and cost-effective solution for HCI and analysis in organogenesis, drug screening, and disease modeling."
"Investigations of the hydration repulsion between hydrophilic soft interfaces in water, in particular between lipid membranes, rely on accurate experimental measurements of the associated pressure-distance curves. Conventional experimental approaches face challenges especially when it comes to the pressure-distance curves between dissimilar surfaces, a scenario with particular value for the study of the mechanisms responsible for the hydration repulsion. Here, we present an alternative approach based on solid-supported inverse lipid bilayers (ILBs) in which two hydrophilic monolayer surfaces face each other across a thin water layer, as evidenced through x-ray reflectometry. The water uptake as a function of the dehydrating osmotic pressure is precisely measured with the help of ellipsometry under controlled humidity conditions. The measurements reproduce the known hydration decay lengths of interacting phospholipid membrane surfaces and of interacting glycolipid membrane surfaces. In addition, we present pressure-distance curves of the interaction between two dissimilar membrane surfaces, with phospholipids on one side and glycolipids on the other side. These unique measurements of asymmetrical interaction scenarios result in a curve that is very similar to that of two interacting glycolipid membrane surfaces, which can be rationalized on the basis of our current knowledge of the repulsion mechanisms."
"Mohoidae, the Hawaiian honeyeaters, are a group of extinct birds that once inhabited the Hawaiian Islands. Their genetic data are only available from historical museum specimens, so it is based on highly fragmented and damaged DNA. Poor sequence recovery in these ""antique"" samples can bias phylogenetic inference which often results in exceptionally long terminal branches in the phylogeny. These long branches can distort estimates of phylogeny, an artifact known as long branch attraction. However, the best way to analyze this data is unclear because these long branches are typically artifactual, reflecting DNA quality. We investigated the position of Mohoidae within the superfamily Bombycilloidea using published alignments of ultraconserved elements (UCEs) and re-assembled UCEs from raw sequencing reads. The uncertainty involves two monotypic families (Hypocoliidae and Hylocitreidae). Re-aligning UCEs using a smaller taxon set closely related to Mohoidae, along with edge trimming and re-assembly, eliminated the long branches of Mohoidae and Hypocoliidae (also represented by an antique sample). The sister relationship of these two families in previous studies appears to be artifactual; our new analyses yielded congruent topologies that placed Mohoidae as sister to a clade comprising Hypocoliidae and Hylocitreidae. We also found that different assemblers (SPAdes vs Trinity) yielded sequences with conflicts towards the ends of the UCEs, especially for the antique samples, although this did not alter the topology. Finally, combining the UCEs with legacy data allowed us to produce a strongly supported complete phylogeny of Bombycilloidea the included all extant species as well as the extinct Mohoidae."
"Attention deficits emerge early in Alzheimers disease (AD), where cholinergic dysfunction compromises goal-directed behavior and cognitive control. Therefore, attentional impairments may serve as early indicators of cognitive decline, and also as meaningful targets for therapeutic intervention. Despite their clinical importance, attention deficits remain under- targeted by current treatments, which offer only modest benefit. To support development of more effective therapies, preclinical models that closely mirror human neurobiology and behavior are essential. Non-human primates (NHPs), with their high degree of cortical and functional similarity to humans, particularly in prefrontal regions, offer a uniquely translational platform for evaluating cognitive enhancers. We assessed pharmacological interventions targeting sustained attention using the Continuous Performance Test (CPT) in adult male cynomolgus macaques. Monkeys were trained to detect target stimuli while ignoring distractors, achieving individualized stable performance. To simulate cholinergic dysfunction, we administered scopolamine, a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist, which produced dose-dependent declines in accuracy and reaction time. Mild and severe impairment levels were identified within each animal. We then tested three compounds: nicotine, guanfacine, and donepezil. Nicotine, a nicotinic receptor agonist, fully restored performance across both impairment levels, suggesting potential benefit in both early and advanced AD. Guanfacine, an 2A adrenergic agonist, improved accuracy only under mild impairment, while donepezil, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, showed inconsistent effects. None of the compounds reversed scopolamine-induced slowing of reaction time, indicating specificity for attentional control. These findings highlight the utility of the NHP CPT as a pharmacologically sensitive model for detecting attentional dysfunction and evaluating pro-cognitive therapeutics in aging and neurodegeneration."
"BackgroundCoronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of mortality worldwide and is associated with an increased incidence of cognitive decline, however the pathological mechanisms linking CAD to brain and cognitive health remain unclear. Prior research has identified regional deficits in cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR), a measure of vascular reserve, in patients with CAD. However, the impact of these cerebrovascular deficits on cognition has not been explored, nor has the effect of CAD on cerebral metabolic health. This study aims to fill these gaps by investigating how CAD influences cerebral vascular and metabolic health, and how these alterations relate to cognitive function across multiple domains.

MethodsQuantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was employed to measure a comprehensive profile of cerebral vascular and metabolic health, including CBF, CVR, cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2), and oxygen extraction fraction (OEF). Cognition was assessed using a validated neuropsychological battery from which composite scores were extracted, reflecting executive functions, working memory, processing speed, and verbal episodic memory.

ResultsA total of 35 patients with CAD and 37 healthy controls were included in the final analysis. Patients with CAD demonstrated widespread impairments in both cerebral vascular and metabolic health, characterized by lower CBF, CVR, and CMRO2, and increased OEF, indicative of insufficient oxygen delivery. Notably, lower CVR was associated with poorer executive function, suggesting a specific role of vascular reserve for preserving executive functions. Furthermore, higher OEF was associated with poorer working memory, showing the importance of preserved oxygen consumption for maintaining cognitive function.

ConclusionThis study reveals that CAD is associated with impaired cerebral vascular and metabolic health, providing a pathological basis for cognitive decline. Specifically, reduced CVR and elevated OEF emerged as sensitive biomarkers linking impaired brain health and cognition. These markers hold promise for guiding future interventions aimed at preserving cognitive health in patients with CAD.

"There is great diversity in retinal ganglion cells subtypes in the mouse retina, but little is known about the molecular factors required to generate this subtype diversity. Here, we identify the transcription factor Gfi1 as a conserved driver of differentiation specifically in two downward-tuned direction selective ganglion cells (DSGCs). Further, we describe a post-differentiation role for Gfi1 in regulating dendritic development of Down ON-type DSGCs crucial for their ability to detect downward motion. These results define novel temporally-segregated dual functions for Gfi1 in the development of retinal direction-selective circuits, and they provide a framework for understanding fundamental mechanisms underlying direction-selectivity in the retina."
"Understanding how threatened marine species use coastal areas and the extent of connectivity across different spatial and temporal scales is important for identifying critical habitats that can enhance conservation efforts in other regions of their distribution. In this study, we investigated the site fidelity and habitat use of juvenile yellow morphotype green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas) in the Gulf of Santa Elena, north Pacific coast of Costa Rica. Fifteen juvenile green sea turtles (49 - 83 cm curved carapace length; CCL) were monitored for 19 - 629 days with an array of 11 acoustic receivers placed within 5 main habitat types: muddy areas, reef patches, macroalgae, rocky reefs, and mangroves. Daily and seasonal locations of the turtles were estimated using a positioning estimation algorithm to determine the site fidelity and habitat use within the study area. Large juveniles ([&ge;] 65 CCL) were detected disproportionally in the macroalgae habitat during the upwelling season (43.9% detections) from December - April, and in the reef patch habitat during the non-upwelling season (36.0%) from May to November. Small juveniles (< 65 cm CCL) had more detections in the reef patch habitat during both seasons (Upwelling: 35.4%, non-upwelling: 45.4%) relative to other habitats sampled. More than half of the turtles monitored (67%) showed strong site fidelity to the study area, ranging from 68.9 to 100% from October 2020 to September 2022. Our results suggest that juvenile green sea turtles, particularly larger individuals, have a strong association with coral / rocky reef patches and macroalgae habitats, similar to adults. Our finding suggested that protecting similar habitats in other areas along the Central American coast will help rebuild the Eastern Pacific Ocean green sea turtle population."
"Gossypium hirsutum is the worlds most important source of cotton fiber, yet the diversity and population structure of its wild forms remain largely unexplored. The complex domestication history of G. hirsutum combined with reciprocal introgression with a second domesticated species, G. barbadense, has generated a wealth of morphological forms and feral derivatives of both species and their interspecies recombinants, which collectively are scattered across a large geographic range in arid regions of the Caribbean basin. Here we assessed genetic diversity within and among populations from two Caribbean islands, Puerto Rico (n = 43, five sites) and Guadeloupe (n = 25, one site), which contain putative wild and/or introgressed forms. Using whole-genome resequencing data and a phylogenomic framework derived from a broader genomic survey, we parsed individuals into feral derivatives and truly wild forms. Feral cottons display uneven levels of genetic and morphological resemblance to domesticated cottons, with diverse patterns of genetic variation and heterozygosity. These patterns are inferred to reflect a complex history of interspecific and intraspecific gene flow that is spatially highly variable in its effects. Wild cottons in both Caribbean islands appear to be relatively inbred, especially the Guadeloupe samples. Our results highlight the dynamics of population demographics in relictual wild cottons that experienced profound genetic bottlenecks associated with repeated habitat destruction superimposed on a natural ecogeographical distribution comprising widely scattered populations. These results have implications for conservation and utilization of wild diversity in G. hirsutum."
"The development of novel antidepressants is hindered by limited predictive validity of preclinical models. The Differential Reinforcement of Low-Rate (DRL) task is a classic rodent assay with strong sensitivity to antidepressants, but its translational potential remains unexplored in non- human primates (NHPs). Here, we adapted the DRL task for use in cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) and evaluated its pharmacological sensitivity, specificity, and clinical utility across 19 compounds spanning diverse drug classes. Antidepressants, including SSRIs, SNRIs, NRIs, NDRIs, TCAs, MAOIs, and PDE4 inhibitors, consistently improved DRL performance, increasing reinforcers earned and inter-response times while decreasing response rates. In contrast, benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, and psychostimulants without serotonergic or noradrenergic engagement failed to enhance performance. Critically, the primate DRL task identified antidepressant-like efficacy of PDE4 inhibitors, while also capturing emesis, a dose- limiting side effect not observable in rodent models. These findings validate the primate DRL task as a pharmacologically selective and translationally relevant platform for screening novel antidepressant therapies. By modeling core cognitive domains implicated in depression, impulse control and internal timing, this assay offers a unique opportunity to bridge preclinical and clinical development with improved sensitivity to both therapeutic efficacy and tolerability."
"Nature uses structural variations on protein folds to fine-tune the geometries of proteins for diverse functions, yet deep learning-based de novo protein design methods generate highly regular, idealized protein fold geometries that fail to capture natural diversity. Here, using physics-based design methods, we generated and experimentally validated a dataset of 5,996 stable, de novo designed proteins with diverse non-ideal geometries. We show that deep learning-based structure prediction methods applied to this set have a systematic bias towards idealized geometries. To address this problem, we present a fine-tuned version of Alphafold2 that is capable of recapitulating geometric diversity and generalizes to a new dataset of thousands of geometrically diverse de novo proteins from 5 fold families unseen in fine-tuning. Our results suggest that current deep learning-based structure prediction methods do not capture some of the physics that underlie the specific conformational preferences of proteins designed de novo and observed in nature. Ultimately, approaches such as ours and further informative datasets should lead to improved models that reflect more of the physical principles of atomic packing and hydrogen bonding interactions and enable improved generalization to more challenging design problems."
"Surface texture and material properties provide critical sensory feedback during object interactions. Although these features rarely occur in isolation, their combined influence on haptic perception remains underexplored. This study examined how material elasticity and stochastic surface roughness jointly shape perceived roughness using a Bayesian optimization discrimination procedure. We employed two stimulus sets (high/low elasticity), each varying in both elasticity and stochastic surface roughness, under two interaction conditions (direct/indirect touch). Our results indicate that variations in surface roughness and material elasticity can produce perceptual roughness confounds, or  metamers, wherein distinct cue configurations elicit indistinguishable roughness percepts. These metamers emerged across both direct and indirect touch, underscoring the role of contact-induced vibrations that depend on the relative stiffness of the stimulus and probe. Confidence ratings similarly reflected the influence of both stimulus parameters. The findings highlight the multidimensional nature of roughness perception, shaped by an integration of material and surface properties."
"Neurofibrillary tangles are dynamic neuropathologic hallmarks of Alzheimers disease with a hypothesized lifespan morphologically-defined by three maturity levels: pretangles, mature tangles, and ghost tangles. To better understand the progression of tangle pathophysiology, we characterized tangle maturity level predilection of 15 tau antibodies recognizing a broad range of linear, phosphorylation, conformational, and truncation epitopes in the hippocampus of 24 postmortem brains. We developed the tangle maturity scoring system to semi-quantitatively evaluate each tangle maturity level. Based on proportions of tangle maturity levels, we classified antibodies as ""early"" (mostly pretangles and mature tangles), ""middling"" (mature tangles with pretangles and ghost tangles), and ""advanced"" (mostly ghost tangles and mature tangles) tangle maturity markers. To summarize tangle maturity predilection, we developed the tangle maturity scale to integrate individual tangle maturity scores. Correlations showed stronger relationships between tangle maturity scale and subsector thickness for more advanced tangle maturity markers in CA1 and subiculum, whereas Braak tangle stage remained consistently correlated throughout markers of the tangle lifespan. To aid in scoring hippocampi, we used machine learning to recognize tangle maturity levels, which performed comparably to a domain expert and showed similar relationships by Spearman correlation. Pattern recognition software was used to assess tangle and neuritic tau burden separately, which generally correlated with Braak stage and neuronal counts. However, tangle-derived tau burden more consistently correlated with hippocampal subsector thickness. In conclusion, we developed manual and automated scoring systems to evaluate tangle maturity levels, demonstrating early 4R, phosphorylated, and oligomeric tau accumulation preceding more advanced 3R and truncated tau. Our study provides supportive evidence of disease-relevant ordering of tau posttranslational modifications in the brain, which may have implications for theragnostic development. These findings underscore the promise of computerized quantitative analyses (i.e., pathomics) for high-throughput feature extraction from whole-slide images to enhance our understanding of microscopically observed morphologic changes."
"Transcranial magnetic stimulation combined with electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) is a powerful technique for investigating human cortical circuits. However, characterizing TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs) at the group level typically relies on grand averaging across stimulus repetitions (trials) and subjects - an approach that assumes a level of spatial and temporal consistency that is often lacking in TEPs. Here, we introduce an adaptation of Group Task-Related Component Analysis (gTRCA), a novel multivariate signal decomposition method, to automatically extract TEP components that are maximally reproducible across both trials and subjects. Following the validation of a new permutation-based statistical test for gTRCA using simulated data, the method was applied to two independent TMS-EEG datasets, in which stimulation was targeted to the primary motor cortex (M1) in cohorts of 16 and 22 healthy participants. We found that gTRCA reliably identified TEP components that were reproducible at the group level. Notably, the main gTRCA component captured the key spatial, temporal, and spectral features of motor TEPs, remained robust despite reduced number of stimuli and participants, and was consistent across different recordings. These findings demonstrate that gTRCA affords a more reliable characterization of TEPs at the group level, thereby facilitating the translation of TMS-EEG research into clinical practice."

"Understanding how animals shift between different decision-making strategies is critical for bridging normative models with naturalistic behavior. While drift diffusion models (DDMs) provide a powerful framework for describing evidence accumulation in two-alternative forced choice (TAFC) tasks, they assume fixed parameters across trials--an assumption often violated in practice. Here, we intro- duce a state-dependent DDM framework in which discrete latent states modulate decision parameters from trial to trial. This approach reveals that mice dynamically switch between impulsive and deliberative decision states that differ in accuracy and response latency, suggesting active exploration of the speed-accuracy trade-off. We uncover rare high-bound states in which mice exhibit deliberation times and ac- curacies approaching those observed in humans. These results raise new questions about the cognitive flexibility of rodent decision-making and offer a foundation for studying how internal states and external variables--such as reward history or uncertainty--influence strategy selection. Our method provides a natural interface for integration with neural recordings and dynamical systems models, offering a path toward identifying the circuit-level mechanisms underlying adaptive decision behavior."
"Exercise has long been considered an essential part of human health and longevity. Recent physiological studies have expanded muscles role beyond simply acting as an actuator, revealing muscles exercise-mediated paracrine and endocrine relationships with other organ systems. In vitro engineered skeletal muscle models can address physiological questions about exercise adaptation with the precision of cell biology. Optogenetic tools have enabled a noninvasive approach to stimulating muscle contraction that avoids the potential off-target effects of electrical stimulation techniques. In this article we propose high-throughput culture and optical exercise protocols to generate statistically robust cellular exercise response datasets. We characterize optical rheobase for 2D muscle tissue morphology, finding that optical intensities as low as 5 W mm-2 can trigger contraction. We then analyze bulk RNA sequencing data collected from high throughput, acute exercise protocols and find a rich display of transcriptional behavior that is consistent with experimental observations. The spontaneous contractility of our tissue constructs introduced oxygen diffusion challenges when maintained in a 24 well plate, and our analysis shows divergent myogenic and pathological transcriptional consequences of hypoxia. We believe our techniques provide a practical foundation for conducting future high-precision in vitro exercise studies of skeletal muscle.

Translational impactHigh-fidelity, engineered skeletal muscle has potential to elucidate exercise-mediated response pathways at the cell and tissue level. We leverage optogenetic techniques to develop a high-throughput assay that optically stimulates 2D muscle monolayers, avoiding potential cell damage from electrical stimulation. Our culture and exercise protocol generates statistically robust RNA sequencing datasets which reveal myogenic and pathological responses to exercise and in vitro culture conditions, informing practical next steps to cultivate stronger, more physiologically relevant muscle models."
"Neurotoxic protein fragments such as amyloid-beta and tau accumulate in characteristic staging patterns in Alzheimers disease (AD). The brain clears such metabolic substances via multiple different systems, including via the glymphatic (extracellular/extravascular) pathway. Here, we ask how the distinct features that characterize human glymphatic function would affect the prion-like cascade of protein invasion associated with AD. To address this question, we extract and analyze individual clearance rates from human glymphatic MRI (gMRI) data sets. These clearance rates define subject-specific maps of glymphatic clearance that vary both across cortical lobes and Braak staging regions. We apply these clearance maps as initial states in a computational network model linking misfolded proteins, tissue damage, and local clearance to simulate a series of individual proteinopathy trajectories. Our results show that the spatial heterogeneity in initial clearance induces characteristic propagation patterns, delaying and redirecting the disease progression. Moreover, reducing this spatial heterogeneity accelerates disease progression and induces staging patterns typically associated with AD. A comparison between well-rested subjects and subjects who underwent a single night of sleep deprivation did not reveal differences in initial clearance maps nor in simulated disease progression. These findings suggest that spatial heterogeneity in brain clearance may be a key factor for neurodegenerative resilience."
"The brain localizes touch in space by integrating tactile and proprioceptive signals, a process known as tactile remapping. While it is often assumed that the remapped touch is encoded in an extrinsic, limb-independent reference frame, an alternative view proposes that touch may instead be represented within an intrinsic, limb-specific coordinate system. To test these hypotheses, we used electroencephalography (EEG) and a novel tactile stimulation paradigm in which participants received touch on their hands positioned at various locations relative to the body. Previous findings suggest that neural activity in primate sensorimotor and parietal regions monotonically encodes limb position. We therefore analyzed amplitude gradients in somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) to test predictions from each coding scheme. If touch is coded extrinsically, neural gradients should reflect changes of the external stimulus location, regardless of the limb. If coded intrinsically, gradients should be tied to the position of each limb and mirror each other between hands. Both univariate and multivariate EEG analyses found no evidence for extrinsic coding. Instead, we observed neural signatures of limb-specific, intrinsic spatial codes, the earliest emerging about 160 ms after touch in centro-parietal regions, later shifting to fronto-temporal and parieto-occipital areas. Furthermore, a population-based neural network model of tactile remapping successfully reproduced the observed gradient patterns. These results show that the human brain localizes touch using an intrinsic, limb-specific spatial code, challenging the dominant assumption of extrinsic encoding in tactile remapping."
"Preventing retinal ganglion cells (RGCs)s soma and axon degeneration and promoting optic nerve (ON) regeneration holds great promise for effective glaucoma treatment. To explore potential neural repair strategies, we focused on glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), a key regulator of lipid peroxidation. GPX4 is upregulated in surviving RGCs after acute ON crush or chronic ocular hypertension insult, and also in regenerating RGCs. AAV-mediated RGC-specific overexpression of GPX4 promotes significant ON regeneration and RGC survival, along with visual functional preservation, demonstrating the detrimental role of lipid peroxidation in glaucoma and the therapeutic potential of modulating lipid peroxidation through GPX4 in optic neuropathies."
"In near-threshold detection tasks, larger pre-stimulus pupil size is associated with improved accuracy. However, previous studies have used black and white peripherally presented stimuli, leaving open the question of whether the relationship persists when targets differ in their colour or eccentricity. Across three experiments (in years 2022-2024), we tested a total of 124 participants while systematically varying the lighting conditions and target properties in a near-threshold detection task. Light conditions ranged from dark to dim to bright, with the dark condition including a period of dark-adaptation. Possible target colours were blue and red on a black background (dark condition), blue and red on a grey background (dim condition), or yellow and cyan on a white background (bright condition). Possible target eccentricities ranged from parafoveal to peripheral, in a continuous manner (experiment 3) or as two predefined near and far eccentricities (experiments 1 & 2). Across all experiments we show that larger pre-stimulus pupil size is associated with improved performance. This large-pupil advantage is not modulated by the colour or eccentricity of the targets, the illumination of the testing room, or retinal adaptation-state. We conclude that the phenomenon is robust, indicating that pupil size affects vision in a behaviourally relevant manner, regardless of the exact conditions.

Significance statementBy showing that pupil size is robustly associated with performance in near-threshold detection tasks, we provide evidence for the functional role of endogenous pupil size fluctuations in visual perception."
"The human visual system is tasked with perceiving stable and moving objects despite ever-present eye movements. Normally, our visual system performs this task exceptionally well; indeed, under conditions with frames of reference, our ability to detect relative motion exceeds the sampling limits of foveal cones. However, during fixational drift, if an image is programmed to move in a direction consistent with retinal slip, little to no motion is perceived, even if this motion is amplified. We asked: Would a stimulus moving in a direction consistent with retinal slip, but with a smaller magnitude across the retina, also appear relatively stable? We used an adaptive optics scanning light ophthalmoscope to deliver stimuli that moved contingent to retinal motion and measured subjects perceived motion, under conditions with world-fixed background content. We also tested under conditions with background content closer and farther from the stimuli. We found a sharp discontinuity in motion perception. Stimuli moving in a direction consistent with retinal slip, no matter how small, appear to have relatively little to no motion; while, stimuli moving in the same direction as eye motion appear to be moving. Displacing background content to greater than 4{degrees} from the stimuli diminishes the effects of this phenomenon."
"ObjectivesThis study aimed to investigate the spatial transcriptomic landscape of muscle tissue from treatment-naive juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) patients in comparison to healthy paediatric muscle tissue.

MethodsMuscle biopsies from three JDM patients and three age-matched controls were analysed using the Nanostring GeoMx(R) Digital Spatial Profiler. Regions of interest were selected based on muscle fibres without immune cells, immune cell infiltration and CD68+ macrophage enrichment. Differential gene expression, pathway analysis and pathways clustering analysis were conducted. Key findings were validated in 19 cases of JDM using immunohistochemistry and chemical stains, and a bulk RNAseq dataset of four cases of JDM.

ResultsJDM muscle tissues exhibited significant interferon pathway activation and mitochondrial dysfunction compared to controls. A 15-gene interferon signature was significantly elevated in JDM muscle and macrophage-enriched regions, correlating with clinical weakness. In contrast, mitochondrial dysregulation, characterized by downregulated respiratory chain pathways, was present regardless of interferon activity or muscle strength. The interferon-driven and mitochondrial signatures were replicated in an independent RNAseq dataset from JDM muscle; lack of association between interferon signature and mitochondrial dysregulation was validated in 19 cases by conventional staining methods. Clustering analysis revealed distinct transcriptomic profiles between JDM and control tissues, as well as between JDM patients with varying clinical phenotypes.

ConclusionsThis study highlights mitochondrial dysfunction as a consistent pathological feature in JDM muscle, which may be independent of interferon-driven inflammation. These findings highlight the potential for mitochondrial-targeted therapies in JDM management and emphasise the need for further studies to explore their therapeutic value.

"Equitable sharing of benefits from the commercial use of biological resources is a cornerstone of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). This principle is pivotal in advancing the other two CBD objectives: conserving biological diversity and its sustainable use. India, as a CBD signatory, enacted the Biological Diversity Act in 2002 (amended in 2023) and established a three-tiered implementation system involving the National Biodiversity Authority (NBA), State Biodiversity Boards (SBBs), and Union Territory Biodiversity Councils (UTBCs). A critical regulatory framework within this system is the Access and Benefit Sharing (ABS) mechanism, guided by the Nagoya Protocol and NBA guidelines. This study addresses challenges in the identification and processing of biological resources listed as Normally Traded as Commodities (NTC), particularly when discrepancies in scientific nomenclature or taxonomic errors are present. We developed an R package, NTCmatch, designed to facilitate the identification of plant synonyms within the NTC list, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of the ABS mechanism. The package was created using devtools and roxygen2, with readxl for data management. Results demonstrate the utility of NTCmatch in synonym matching, although the manual verification of plant parts and sources remains crucial. The package aims to streamline workflows for NBA, SBBs, and UTBCs, ensuring compliance with the Biological Diversity Act and facilitating the equitable sharing of benefits."
"Conservation strategies and biodiversity assessments have long prioritized taxonomic metrics such as species richness and endemism, often neglecting intraspecific genetic diversity, a key driver of population adaptability and long-term resilience. Here, we present a scalable framework for quantifying and mapping multi-species genetic diversity using publicly available DNA sequence data. By calculating nucleotide diversity ({pi}) across taxa and aggregating values spatially, we define the Genetic Diversity Index (GDI): a site-level metric capturing geographic patterns of intraspecific genetic variation. Using simulations under different scenarios, we assessed the robustness of the GDI and implemented three corrective measures to address sampling bias and the additive effects of species richness.

We queried over 25 million accessions from public databases representing 9,409 European vascular plant species and applied this approach to [~]630,000 georeferenced sequences across 1,860 species. Our results reveal distinct genetic diversity hotspots in the Anatolian Peninsula, Southern Iberia, and Eastern Alps regions corresponding to historical glacial refugia and ecological transition zones. GDI values were largely uncorrelated with species richness or phylogenetic diversity, confirming that the index captures a unique and independent dimension of biodiversity. Our indices performed extremely well and showed that fewer than 1% of studied sites exhibited a significant effect of sampling bias, validating the methods reliability under uneven data coverage.

By integrating genetic diversity into spatial biodiversity analyses, the GDI detects large-scale patterns of evolutionary significance and fills a critical methodological gap, providing a reproducible tool to support conservation prioritization and policy at regional and global scales.

SignificanceGenetic diversity is a fundamental component of biodiversity and critical to species resilience, yet it remains absent from most biodiversity assessments. We present a scalable framework for evaluating multi-species genetic diversity across landscapes, introducing three complementary Genetic Diversity Indices (GDI) designed for different scenarios in biodiversity assessment and conservation planning. Applying this approach to European vascular plants, we reveal that genetic diversity patterns are largely decoupled from taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity, highlighting a fundamental yet overlooked dimension of biodiversity. Our framework charts a clear path for global assessments of genetic diversity in vascular plants and beyond. Incorporating GDI into conservation strategies is critical to complement traditional metrics and better safeguard evolutionary potential of biodiversity in a rapidly changing world."
"Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME) / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome is a disease of uncertain aetiology that affects up to 400,000 individuals in the UK. Exposure of cultured cells to the sera of people with ME has been proposed to cause phenotypic changes in these cells in vitro when compared to sera from healthy controls. ME serum factors causing these changes could inform the development of diagnostic tests. In this study, we performed a large-scale, pre-registered replication of an experiment from Fluge et al (2016) that reported an increase in maximal respiratory capacity in healthy myoblasts after treatment with serum from people with ME compared to serum from healthy controls. We replicated the original experiment with a larger sample size, using sera from 67 people with ME and 53 controls to treat healthy cultured myoblasts, and generated results from over 1,700 mitochondrial stress tests performed with a Seahorse Bioanalyser. We observed no significant differences between treatment with ME or healthy control sera for our primary outcome of interest, oxygen consumption rate at maximal respiratory capacity. Results from our study provide strong evidence against the hypothesis that ME blood factors differentially affect healthy myoblast mitochondrial phenotypes in vitro."
"Many congenital conditions and surgical interventions perturb the hemodynamics experienced by proximal pulmonary arteries during early postnatal development, thus leading to differential gene expression and associated changes in vascular structure and function. Among these, pathologic conditions include patent ductus arteriosus, pulmonary atresia and stenosis, and hypoxemia-induced pulmonary hypertension while surgical interventions include the placement of a Blalock-Taussig shunt as well as Glenn, Fontan, and Norwood procedures. Despite the significant morbidity associated with these diverse conditions, there has been little attention directed towards understanding natural postnatal development of pulmonary arteries from both biological and mechanical perspectives. With-out such information, we cannot truly understand the phenotype of the affected pulmonary artery, which is fundamental to improving diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. In this paper, we present novel data from wild-type mice that document normal postnatal changes in select gene expression, vascular wall composition, and biomechanical properties of proximal pulmonary arteries. These findings enabled the establishment of a novel, data-informed computational model of pulmonary artery development capable of simulating outcomes in response to perturbations in the pulmonary artery hemodynamic environment."
"A living cell is a nonequilibrium thermodynamic system where, nevertheless, a notion of local equilibria exists. This notion applies to all micro- and nanoscale aqueous volumes, each containing a large number of molecules. This allows one to define sets of local conditions, including thermodynamic ones; for instance, a defined temperature requires thermodynamic equilibrium by definition. Once such a condition is fulfilled, one can control local variables and their gradients to theoretically describe the thermodynamic state of living systems at the micro- and nanoscale. Performing ultralocal experimental manipulations has become possible thanks to the patch clamp technique to control the cell membrane potential, as well as fluorescent imaging to monitor molecular concentrations and their intracellular gradients. However, precise temperature gradient control at the micro-/nanoscale has yet lacked a reliable experimental realization in a living cell.

Here, we present a new methodology - microscale control of a temperature gradient profile in aqueous media by a fully optical Diamond Heater-Thermometer in a plug-and-play configuration combined with the patch clamp technique. In particular, we demonstrate applications of the combined Diamond Heater-Thermometer-patch clamp approach for the fast and reproducible thermal modulation of ionic current from voltage-gated Nav1.5 sodium channels expressed in HEK293 cells and freshly isolated ventricular mouse cardiomyocytes. Such an approach of manipulating the ultra-local temperature down to the nanoscale has the potential to uncover previously inaccessible phenomena in various physiological intracellular processes related to the endogenous nanoscale heat sources, such as open ion channels capable of producing Joule heat."

"Over 90% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients involve KRAS mutations (KRASMUT), for which current treatment options are limited. Statins, commonly used to lower cholesterol, have demonstrated certain selective toxicity towards KRAS-transformed cells, prompting the question of whether statins could achieve selective uptake specifically in KRASMUT cells. To investigate this, we synthesized statin-dye conjugates by attaching a fluorescent dye (Cy5.5) to two statins: simvastatin and pravastatin, aiming to assess whether selective uptake indeed occurs. Our findings revealed that these conjugates exhibited markedly enhanced uptake in KRASMUT cells compared to KRAS wild-type (KRASWT) cells. Given the magnitude of the selective uptake, we realized that the uptake of these conjugates itself is of considerable intrinsic interests. We evaluated the uptake of these conjugates in both KRASMUT and KRASWT cells and examined their potential to selectively target KRASMUT pancreatic cancer cells (PCCs) using an engineered PDAC tumor model co-cultured with PCCs and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Our findings indicate that KRASMUT cancer cells exhibited higher uptake of statin-Cy5.5 conjugates via enhanced macropinocytosis compared to KRASWT cancer cells and CAFs. We also found enhanced uptake of the statin-Cy5.5 conjugate in MCF10A cells with PTEN deficiency, a condition known to elevate macropinocytosis, compared to control MCF10A cells with wild-type PTEN. Notably, in the PCC and CAF co-culture model, the pravastatin-Cy5.5 conjugate selectively killed KRASMUT PCCs without affecting the KRASWT CAFs. These findings highlight the potential of stain-drug conjugates as targeted delivery vehicles for KRASMUT cancer therapy."
"Abscisic acid (ABA) is a key regulator of abiotic stress responses in plants. Understanding the regulation of ABA-dependent gene expression is key to uncovering how plants adapt to environmental stress and how their resilience can be improved. We explored gene expression regulation by ABA in Arabidopsis thaliana through the training of an interpretable deep learning model predicting ABA responsiveness in the root from proximal promoter sequences. Implementing state-of-the-art augmentation strategies to boost performance, our convolutional neural network-based model was able to confidently predict ABA responsiveness. We demonstrate that it learned actual motifs in the promoter sequences and confirm that ABRE-binding factor (ABF) binding sites play a key role in regulating ABA-dependent gene expression. However, also other motifs contributing to ABA-mediated gene expression regulation were identified. Our model outperforms a model trained to predict ABF binding, indicating it successfully learned the cis-regulatory code beyond the canonical ABF binding sites. Furthermore, the importance of motif clustering for regulating gene expression levels in response to ABA was unveiled by our model. Lastly, we identified genomic regions-beyond the proximal promoter-both with and without ABF binding sites, predicted by our model to drive ABA responsiveness. These genomic regions were used to generate reporter lines for experimental validation and were shown to drive the response to ABA in planta. This confirms that our model successfully inferred the regulatory code controlling ABA-dependent gene expression."
"Most plant embryos can survive for years in a dry state of less than 10% water(1). Rehydration during seed germination is critical but risky-too little environmental water can dehydrate and kill the developing embryo. Plants avoid this by germinating only when sufficient water is present. However, the mechanisms by which sufficient water is sensed and how it triggers germination remain unknown. FLOE1 suppresses seed germination under water limitation by undergoing reversible phase changes in response to water potential(2). To understand how FLOE1 affects germination, we compared water behavior in wild type and floe1-1 null mutants. While both had similar amounts of water when dry, floe1-1 seeds hydrated less than the wild type after imbibition. Additionally, bound water was less restricted in floe1-1 embryos, suggesting FLOE1 promotes macromolecular water binding. By developing plant-compatible versions of Genetically Encoded Multimeric nanoparticles (GEMs)(3), we show that FLOE1 increases cytoplasmic viscosity during embryo rehydration. FLOE1 in yeast was sufficient to increase cytoplasmic viscosity. FLOE1 also increased cytoplasmic viscosity during hyperosmotic stress in yeast, and this ability was ablated by FLOE1 domain deletions. Our study identifies FLOE1 as a regulator of water content, dynamics, and cytoplasmic viscosity, linking molecular water control to cellular physical properties."
"BackgroundAdvances in LED lighting technologies have allowed researchers to explore increasingly complex light regimes. This has given us greater insight into plants responses to dynamic light, including seasonality and fluctuating conditions, rather than the discrete (i.e. on / off) lighting previously explored. However, there is a need for methods to accurately program multi-channel / waveband LED lighting systems.

ResultsWe present a multi-step, multidimensional algorithm to accurately program LED lights. This algorithm accounts for non-linearity between intensity settings and irradiance output, as well as bleedthrough between channels of different wavebands. Our algorithm out-performs other methods which treat waveband channels as independent variables, predicting intensity settings more accurately.

ConclusionsWe have made this algorithm available to the plant sciences community as an R package, LightFitR (available on GitHub at: https://github.com/ginavong/LightFitR). We hope this package will enable the community to explore even more complex light regimes, gaining insight into the versatility of plant responses to light."
"Soybean (Glycine max) has not yet benefited from large-scale hybrid breeding efforts due to its small, self-fertilizing flowers that are difficult to emasculate, and limited attractiveness to pollinators. This study explores targeted floral trait engineering to enhance pollinator attraction, aiming to overcome barriers to soybean hybridization. We generated a high-resolution floral organ expression atlas and H3K4 trimethylation ChIP-Seq dataset to identify candidate genes involved in petal development, nectar sugar content, and petal pigmentation. Using CRISPR-based activation and repression systems, we modified the expression of AINTEGUMENTA (GmANT), BIGPETAL (GmBPE), and SUCROSE TRANSPORTER2 (GmSUC2). Contrary to expectations based on Arabidopsis homologs, transcriptional activation of GmANT_B and repression of GmBPE led to reduced, rather than increased, petal size, highlighting divergent regulatory mechanisms in soybean. Complementation of the W1 gene that controls petal pigmentation successfully converted white petals to purple, with preliminary evidence indicating that this color conversion may increase pollinator visitation. These results underscore the complexity of floral development in soybean and provide foundational tools and resources for future efforts to engineer reproductive traits for hybrid seed production."
"Introduction: Polyamines regulate plant growth and development under normal conditions and protect plants from a multitude of biotic and abiotic stresses. However, little information is available about how polyamines improve salt tolerance. Methods: This study was conducted to investigate whether exogenous polyamine application has the potential to maintain poplar growth and yield under a short duration of salt stress. We analyzed the trends in growth and physiological and biochemical responses of hybrid poplar (Populus nigra x maximowiczii, clone NM6) plants to salt stress by foliar application of putrescine (a diamine). Leaves of young greenhouse-grown plants were sprayed with 1 mM putrescine on several days following one-time application of 100 mM and 200 mM NaCl via roots. For measurement of growth, plant height, stem diameter, and leaf number for each plant were recorded throughout the experiment. Studies on the physiological and biochemical trends included gas exchange, total chlorophyll, carotenoids, soluble sugars and proteins, amino acids, polyamines, and relative water content in leaves. Results: Putrescine spray on the salt-treated plants caused a significant increase in chlorophyll a & b, carotenoids, and soluble proteins on a fresh weight basis. Putrescine application caused a significant increase in fructose, glucose, and galactose in all plants, but putrescine spray had a variable impact on the sucrose content of 100 mM NaCl-treated plants. Based on metabolic responses, plants treated with 100 mM NaCl fared better when sprayed with putrescine than those treated with 200 mM NaCl. Discussion: In conclusion, the results indicate that putrescine did reverse the effects of salt in many ways, and there were trends indicating that sprayed putrescine promotes salt tolerance in young poplar plants."

"Unlike animals, plants are sessile organisms that must adapt to localized and fluctuating environmental stimuli, including abiotic and biotic stresses. While animals use mobile immune cells to eliminate pathogens, plants rely on localized cells in contact with the pathogen to detect and mount immune responses. Although bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has enabled the assessment of plant responses to pathogen infection at the whole transcriptome level, the spatial coordination of plant immune responses remains elusive. In this study, we performed both spatial and single-nuclei transcriptomic experiments to capture the spatial pattern of soybean plant responses to Asian soybean rust infection caused by the pathogen Phakopsora pachyrhizi. Through the analysis of both spatial and single-nuclei transcriptomics data, we identified two distinct host cell states with specific spatial localization in response to pathogen infection: the infected regions with the presence of the pathogen and the surrounding regions bordering the infected regions. Importantly, the surrounding regions exhibited higher expression of defense response-related genes than the infected regions, despite having minimal presence of the pathogen, indicating a cell non-autonomous defense response in the surrounding regions. Additionally, gene co-expression network analysis with single-cell resolution identified a key immune response-related gene module activated in the stressed cells captured in our single-nuclei RNA-seq data. This study reveals the intricate spatial coordination of plant defense responses against pathogen infection and enhances our understanding of the importance of localized cell non-autonomous defense responses in plant-pathogen interactions."
"Gas exchange measurements provide crucial insights into the complex mechanisms of photosynthesis. Responses of CO2 assimilation rate (A) to intercellular CO2 partial pressure (Ci) and irradiance (I) link gas exchange measurements to the underlying photosynthetic biochemistry of a leaf. The unique biochemistry and leaf anatomy which distinguish C4 photosynthesis make it necessary to apply models and fitting routines which appropriately parameterise and incorporate these characteristics. Here we provide updates to the C4 photosynthesis model by improving the parameterisation of cyclic electron flow in C4 photosynthesis using experimentally derived values from S. viridis. We additionally describe two fitting routines for assessing C4 photosynthesis based on the updated model. Fitting of a CO2 response curve (A/Ci) provides estimates of maximum PEP carboxylase activity (Vpmax) and maximum Rubisco activity (Vcmax), and calculates the electron transport rate (J) needed to sustain the measured CO2 assimilation rate (A). Fitting of an irradiance response curve (A/I) provides estimates for the maximum electron transport rate (Jmax), day respiration rate (Rd), the quantum yield ({phi}CO2) and light compensation point ({Gamma}light). Values of the above output parameters are provided at both the measurement temperature and at 25 {degrees}C for ease of comparative reporting. The fitting tool has been designed in Microsoft Excel to minimise barriers to entry and enable simplicity of fitting while simultaneously catering to individuals with diverse expertise and experience in C4 gas exchange modelling."
"Calibrating biological models is challenging due to high-dimensional parameter spaces and the limited availability of reliable experimental data. In this study, we propose a hybrid calibra- tion framework that integrates expert knowledge into a multi-objective optimization process using NSGA-II algorithm. Our approach combines hard constraints derived from biological measurements with soft constraints encoding qualitative domain expertise, such as expected curve shapes or event timing. This dual-constraint strategy guides the search toward biologi- cally plausible parameter sets while preserving flexibility and interpretability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a benchmark model of skin wound healing, comparing it to standard and unconstrained optimization strategies. Results show that incorporating expert guidance significantly improves the biological relevance of simulated dynamics and mitigates overfitting, especially in underdetermined or uncertain settings. The framework is flexible, it- erative, and generalizable, offering a principled way to leverage domain knowledge for model calibration in complex biological systems."
"Disease prevention, diagnosis, and treatment monitoring often require ultrasensitive (sub-)femtomolar biomarker detection and quantification. While standard ELISA assays yield picomolar sensitivity, existing ultrasensitive approaches reach fM, aM or even zM sensitivity. This, however, is obtained at the expense of increased complexity and cost which hampers their biomedical applications. We propose a novel approach, NLISA, combining ultrasensitive, fM/sub-fM, quantitative detection with simplicity and ease of use based on 38-nm YVO4:Eu (20%) crystalline nanoparticles used as detection probes. These particles possess an extremely strong absorption in the UV leading to bright Eu3+-ion emission. We developed a transportable, multi-well plate reader providing LED excitation and detection with a photomultiplier enabling detection down to 16,000 nanoparticle probes/well. We obtained sensitivity gain factors with respect to ELISA ranging from 65 to 35,000 for insulin, IFN-{gamma}, and HIV-GAG-p24 while maintaining the same antibodies. We demonstrated femtomolar LOD and a dynamic range of 4-5 orders of magnitude and NLISA efficiency for HIV-positive patient diagnosis. This approach for straightforward, ultrasensitive polypeptide/protein detection is easily generalizable paving the way for a new generation of diagnostic tests."
"Population-scale genomics information provides valuable prior knowledge for various genomic analyses, especially variant calling. A notable example of such application is the human pangenome reference released by the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium, which has been shown to improve read mapping and structural variant genotyping. In this work, we introduce pangenome-aware DeepVariant, a variant caller that uses a pangenome reference alongside sample-specific read alignments. It generates pileup images of both reads and pangenome haplotypes near potential variants and uses a Convolutional Neural Network to infer genotypes. This approach allows directly using a pangenome for distinguishing true variant signals from sequencing or alignment noise. We assessed its performance on various short-read sequencing platforms and read mappers. Across all settings, pangenome-aware DeepVariant outperformed the linear-reference-based DeepVariant, reducing errors by up to 25.5%. We also show that Element reads with pangenome-aware DeepVariant can achieve 23.6% more accurate variant calling performance compared to existing methods."
"This study investigates the contribution of different vascular compartments on population receptive field (pRF) size estimates within the early visual cortex (V1, V2, and V3) using BOLD-fMRI. We employed T2*-weighted gradient-echo (GE) and T2-weighted spin-echo (SE) sequences at 7 Tesla (7T) and a multi-band GE sequence at 3T to explore how different vessel sensitivities across these sequences influence pRF modeling. Our results confirm the expected pRF size increase across eccentricity and visual areas but found no significant differences in pRF size estimates across MR sequences, voxel sizes, or field strengths. BOLD signal amplitudes were influenced by MR sequence, with largest signal changes observed for 7TGE, and amplitude increases were noted across cortical depth for GE sequences but not for SE sequences. Contrary to our hypotheses, pRF size estimates were not noticeably affected by the local vascularization, suggesting that pRFs primarily reflect neuronal activity rather than vascular compartment characteristics. Our study highlights the robust nature of pRF size estimates across various fMRI conditions and points toward the decoupling of pRF properties from vascular factors."
"We report the existence of two previously undescribed body-selective visual regions in the human brain, which we term the Ventromedial Body Area (VMBA) and the Medial Body Area (MBA). We localize these regions based on high-signal localizer contrasts and characterize selectivity in them with encoding model analysis of BOLD fMRI responses to thousands of naturalistic images. These regions respond to images of bodies away from the center of gaze."
"Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is an aggressive skin cancer with high propensity for metastasis, caused by Merkel-cell-polyomavirus (MCPyV), or chronic UV-light-exposure. How MCPyV spatially modulates immune responses within the tumor microenvironment and how such are linked to patient outcomes remains unknown. We interrogated the cellular and transcriptional landscapes of 60 MCC-patients using a combination of multiplex proteomics, in-situ RNA-hybridization, and spatially oriented transcriptomics. We identified a spatial co-enrichment of activated CD8+ T-cells and CXCL9+PD-L1+ macrophages at the invasive front of virus-positive MCC. This spatial immune response pattern was conserved in another virus-positive tumor, HPV+ head-and-neck cancer. Importantly, we show that virus-negativity correlated with high risk of metastasis through low CD8+ T-cell infiltration and the enrichment of cancer-associated-fibroblasts at the tumor boundary. By contrast, responses to immune-checkpoint blockade (ICB) were independent of viral-status but correlated with the presence of a B-cell-enriched spatial contexts. Our work is the first to reveal distinct immune-response patterns between virus-positive and virus-negative MCC and their impact on metastasis and ICB-response."
"Microbial fermentation facilitates the initial breakdown of organic matter into small molecules, and is thought to be the rate-limiting step for mineralization under anoxic conditions. Fermentation is understudied in modern and ancient biogeochemistry due to a lack of environmental biomarkers that would constrain its activity. It has long been assumed that fermentation, like respiration, does not express significant carbon isotope fractionations, precluding isotopic signals as a means of studying it in nature. Here, we tested this idea by growing pure cultures of four fermenting bacteria on glucose and measuring the carbon isotope compositions of the organic acids and alcohols produced. We found that fermentation exhibits a strong carbon isotope fractionation, ranging from -6{per thousand} to +16{per thousand}, depending on the fermentation product. This range can even be observed within a single organism. Using bioisotopic models that track site-specific isotope enrichments through metabolic networks, we constrained the enzymes responsible for these fractionations. Our models reproduced in vivo organic acid{delta} 13C values in all four organisms. These findings demonstrate that acetate 13C-enrichment is likely a consistent signature of fermentation. Furthermore, our study suggests that fermentation imposes an anaerobic trophic carbon isotope fractionation as organic carbon is passed from fermenters to secondary degraders like sulfate reducers. Looking to the geologic past, this trophic fractionation could have imprinted isotopic signals on the three billion year record of sedimentary organic carbon, specifically the inverse{delta} 13C pattern of Precambrian acyclic isoprenoid and n-alkane biomarkers. Pervasive evidence of fermentation in the rock record suggests its under-appreciated role in biogeochemical cycles throughout Earth history.

Significance StatementMicroorganisms drive the global cycling of elements like carbon and regulate the Earths climate on both human and geologic timescales. Of particular importance is the microbial breakdown of organic matter, which generates greenhouse gases like methane. Fermenting bacteria play a crucial role in anaerobic carbon degradation. However, they remain largely invisible to our analyses. We explored the natural abundance of carbon stable isotopes in the molecular products of fermentation as a tool to study this metabolism in modern ecosystems and the ancient biosphere. We identified significant isotopic signals in molecules produced by fermenting bacteria and compared them to previously observed isotopic signals in molecular fossils in sedimentary rocks, which may provide evidence of microbial fermentation on the Precambrian Earth."
"We have developed a 23 residue, optimized helical peptide biomimetic from the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein binding partner ACE2 that demonstrated a Therapeutic Index (TI) of >[~]20 in authentic viral cell challenge assays, including WT and Omicron strains. The therapeutic is an optimized ""peptide decoy"" based on the viruss human cell target ACE2 and, as such, may have more general applicability across coronavirus family members that use ACE2 for cellular entry. We experimentally verify a comprehensive, rational optimization strategy of the peptide through improved binding, helical content, and solubility from its native sequence. These techniques may have general applicability for helical peptide optimization for other therapeutic targets as well. Importantly, techniques also exist for protecting helical peptides in vivo for improved delivery. Peptides are readily modifiable with single residue substitutions for quick response to mutated targets, and they typically have relatively low toxicity and ease of manufacturing, making peptides extremely attractive as biological therapeutics against viral pathogens. The general concept of using peptide decoys across other viral human cell targets is also discussed.

Author SummaryAlthough the COVID-19 pandemic has ended, SARS-CoV-2 virus still causes hundreds of deaths each week world-wide. The virus uses a human cell receptor called ACE2 to latch on and enter cells. Here, the small critical attachment segment of ACE2 is developed as a ""decoy"" molecule thereby protecting host cells and significantly reducing viral replication, which is the role of a therapeutic agent. The effective segment in this case is called a helical peptide and it was optimized for better binding, solubility, and stability using rational methods based on our understanding of this class of molecule.

Moreover, future viruses from this family of coronaviruses may likely use ACE2 as their host cell receptor, as recently demonstrated in the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Virus of bats and, therefore, the ACE2 decoy therapeutic may have future applications as well. Development of a broader range of decoy molecules for different viruses using different human cell receptors may represent a forward-thinking approach to prepare for future pandemics and outbreaks."
"Suppression of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) signaling extends mammalian lifespan and protects against a range of age-related diseases. Surprisingly though, we found that reduced IGF-1 signaling fails to extend the lifespan of mitochondrial mutator mice. Accordingly, most of the longevity pathways that are normally initiated by IGF-1 suppression were either blocked or blunted in the mutator mice. These observations suggest that the pro-longevity effects of IGF-1 suppression critically depend on the integrity of the mitochondrial genome and that mitochondrial mutations may impose a hard limit on mammalian lifespan. Together, these findings deepen our understanding of the interactions between the hallmarks of aging and underscore the need for interventions that preserve the integrity of the mitochondrial genome."
"One major strategy for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to evade antibody drugs or preventive vaccines is high mutation rate of the spike receptor binding domain (RBD). Because variable RBDs of different SARS-CoV-2 strains must bind to the same human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) for viral cell entry and infection, we hypothesize that designing a protein with the same or very similar hACE2 binding interface might have a broad-spectrum effect against various SARS-CoV-2 strains. The designed protein binds specifically to the WT-RBD (with micromolar affinity) but not to RBDs from other SARS-CoV-2 strains. However, two rounds of the E. coli display and Magnetic Cell Sorting (MACS) selection are sufficient to yield a protein named CYN1 with nanomolar binding affinities not only to the WT-RBD but also to those of Omicron BA.1, XBB.1.16, and JN.1. Molecular dynamics simulations and free-energy hotspot analysis revealed that CYN1s broader spectrum capability stems from its engagement of essentially all ACE2 hotspot residues critical for WT-RBD binding, unlike the designed protein. The discovery of CYN1, differing by only four mutations from the designed protein, confirms that targeting the small interface of human viral receptors--rather than the entire receptor--offers a viable strategy for developing broad-spectrum inhibitors. This approach minimizes potential off-target effects arising from receptor multifunctionality."

"Cannabis sativa exhibits remarkable sexual plasticity, with both XX and XY plants capable of phenotypic sex reversal in response to ethylene modulation. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this process remain poorly characterized. Here, we applied a multi-omic framework-- integrating transcriptomics, metabolite quantification, and whole-genome sequencing--to study the regulatory basis of ethylene-mediated sexual plasticity across three genetically distinct cannabis genotypes. We show that sex reversal induced by silver thiosulfate (XX masculinization) and ethephon (XY feminization) results in >80% floral sex conversion across genotypes. Despite a shared phenotypic response, transcriptomic analysis of 47 ethylene-related genes (ERGs) revealed a temporally dynamic and sex-specific response: a shared early-phase upregulation of biosynthesis and signaling genes at Day 1, followed by divergent gene expression patterns at Day 14 associated with phenotypic stabilization. Network analysis identified 14 candidate ERGs, including CsMTN, CsACS1, CsACO3, CsACO5 and CsERF1, as key regulators of plasticity. Genomic variant profiling and chromosomal localization further revealed low nucleotide diversity in most ERGs, with several key genes localized exclusively to X chromosomes non-recombinant regions and notably, absent from the Y non-recombinant region. Together, our findings demonstrate that ethylene-mediated sex change in C. sativa involves temporally distinct transcriptional programs that differ between XX and XY plants and affirm that sexual plasticity does not exclusively rely on sex chromosome-linked genes. This study provides a high-resolution molecular framework for dissecting and ultimately controlling sexual plasticity in C. sativa, identifies candidate targets for functional validation, and lays the groundwork for breeding sex-stable genotypes in cannabis and other dioecious crops."
"Axolotl digits offer an experimentally versatile model for studying complex tissue regeneration. Here, we provide a comprehensive morphological and molecular characterization of digit regeneration, revealing both conserved features and notable divergences from classical limb regeneration. Digit blastemas progress through similar morphological stages, are nerve-dependent, contain key regenerative cell populations, and express many canonical morphogens and mitogens. However, they exhibit minimal expression of the A-P patterning genes Shh, Fgf8, and Grem1; suggesting distal outgrowth and patterning occur independently of these signals. Joint regenerative fidelity varies significantly across digits and cannot be explained by differences in nerve supply, cell proliferation, or differential expression of any patterning genes assessed in this study. Furthermore, functional experiments reveal Hedgehog signaling is essential for interphalangeal joint regeneration, but activation alone is insufficient to improve fidelity in less robust digits. This system combines experimental accessibility with intrinsic variation in regenerative outcomes, making it an ideal platform to identify critical determinants of successful tissue regeneration and refine models of appendage patterning."
"In the lichen symbiosis, the fungal and algal partners constitute a closely integrated system. The combination of fungal and algal partners changes along climate gradients in many species, and is expected to be adaptive. However, the functional mechanisms behind this symbiosis-mediated environmental adaptation are unknown. We investigate which transcriptional profiles are associated with specific fungal-algal symbiont pairings found in lichens from high elevation (cold temperate) and low elevation (Mediterranean) sites. Using laboratory-acclimatized thalli, we find that lichen fungal and algal symbionts show variable expression profiles between high- and low-elevation individuals: circadian- and temperature-associated genes for fungi and light-responsive genes for algae show site- specific patterns. We also find that high- and low-elevation individuals differentially express sugar and carbohydrate transporters in both fungal and algal symbionts, pointing to symmetrical and climate-dependent carbohydrate transport mechanisms between the symbionts. A light pulse treatment identified asymmetries between fungal and algal light response, with high- and low-elevation fungal symbionts but only low-elevation algal symbionts responding to the light pulse. We identify light responsive genes in fungal symbionts that may differ from those previously described for other fungi. Together, these results shed light on functional differences between environmentally specialized lichen individuals, made up of niche-specific partner combinations."
"Crayfish are an ancient clade of freshwater decapods that play vital and diverse ecological roles in the freshwater systems that they inhabit. One third of assessed crayfish species are threatened with extinction and 87% are highly sensitive to climate change. However, the extent to which the evolutionary history of crayfish is threatened, especially by climate change, remains unclear. To address this, we produced a phylogenetically-informed species prioritisation for the conservation of crayfish and explored the consequences of projected climate change scenarios on crayfish phylogenetic diversity. We used the EDGE2 metric to highlight 70 priority species for conservation. Their combined threatened evolutionary history accounts for 40.7% of the expected phylogenetic diversity loss for all 673 crayfish. Of these priority species, 45.7% are vulnerable to climate change, with the majority (32 species) located in Australia. Under a high warming scenario, individual species that are more evolutionarily distinct are projected to be disproportionately affected. The extinction of climate change vulnerable species could cause the loss of up to 26.3% more phylogenetic diversity than the random expectation, equivalent to 409 million years of evolutionary history. Our results highlight the need to consider climate change effects on phylogenetic diversity to fully understand its impact on biodiversity. If actions were taken to avoid a worst-case warming scenario in favour of an intermediate scenario, we could safeguard 251 million years of unique crayfish evolutionary history."
"Understanding gene function and protein network dynamics is a key challenge in biology and human health. In the light of the exponential growth in genomic data, phylogenetic profiling methods became more powerful in analysing thousands of genomes to uncover evolutionary associations and predict functional interactions [1,2,4,13,14,16,18,23,24,26]. It is based on the well-supported hypothesis that genes that work together are subject to similar evolutionary pressures and therefore their conservation patterns across phylogeny are correlated.

We introduce CladeOScope-GSA, a web-based tool designed for phylogeny-aware analysis of gene sets across extensive comparative genomics datasets. By integrating clade-focused normalized phylogenetic profiling (NPP) with interactive visualization, CladeOScope-GSA enables researchers to identify evolutionary patterns within user-defined gene sets. Building upon the infrastructure of the original CladeOScope visualization platform, the addition of statistical gene set analysis, expanded phylogenetic and genomic data, enhanced visualization, and improved statistical tools represent a significant advancement in the tools capabilities. We demonstrate its utility through case studies spanning 1905 species, showcasing how CladeOScope-GSA empowers researchers to extract biological insights from complex comparative datasets.

"Early-life oral microbiome development is a complex community assembly process that influences long-term health outcomes. Nevertheless, microbial functions and interactions driving these ecological processes remain poorly understood. In this study, we analyze oral microbiomes from a longitudinal cohort of 24 mother-infant dyads at 1 and 6 months postpartum using shotgun metagenomics. We identify two previously undescribed Streptococcus and Rothia species to be among the most prevalent, abundant and strongly co-occurring members of the oral microbiome of six-month-old infants. To explore the underlying genomic traits enabling this unique lifestyle, we leveraged metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) and genome-scale metabolic models (GEMS). Comparative analyses revealed specific genomic and functional characteristics relative to other closely related species and highlighted unique functional features, including genes encoding adhesins and carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes). The observed co-occurrence patterns were further supported by predicted metabolic interactions within a network of co-occurring oral taxa. Metabolic modeling identified potential exchange of key nutrients, particularly malate and lysine, between these species, suggesting metabolic cross-feeding interactions that may explain their co-occurrence across infant oral microbiomes. Overall, this study provides key insights into the functional adaptations and microbial interactions shaping early colonization in the oral cavity.

Author SummaryWe investigated how infant oral bacterial communities develop during their first six months of life, with the aim to understand which microbes colonize, how they establish themselves and why they succeed together. Using high throughput DNA sequencing techniques, we analyzed oral samples from 24 mother-infant pairs at one and six months after birth.

We found two abundant, but previously unknown bacterial species (one Streptococcus and one Rothia) at six months of age. These bacteria consistently appear together across different babies, suggesting they may depend on each other for survival and growth.

By reconstructing the genomes of these bacteria directly from our samples, we discovered specific genetic features that help explain their success in the infant mouth. Streptococcus carries genes that allow it to break down nutrients from breast milk. Rothia has genes that help it rapidly build cell membranes and protect against harmful molecules, while producing nutrients that Streptococcus needs. We predict these bacteria exchange key nutrients like malate and lysine, creating a mutually beneficial partnership. The bacteria seem to cooperate and are predicted to exchange key nutrients like malate and lysine which may help maintain a healthy oral environment by regulating acidity levels, potentially protecting against tooth decay."
"Comparative functional genomic studies are often affected by biased read mapping across species due to inter-species differences in genome structure, sequence composition, and annotation quality. We developed CrossFilt, a filtering strategy that retains only sequencing reads that map reciprocally between genomes, ensuring that quantification of read counts is based on directly comparable genomic features. Using both real and simulated RNA-sequencing data from primates, we show that CrossFilt outperforms five alternative approaches that are commonly used, resulting in more accurate inference of gene expression differences. Our results highlight the impact of preprocessing strategies on the analysis of cross-species functional genomics data."
"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWAccurate three-dimensional localisation of high-frequency ultrasonic bat calls is essential for advancing behavioural and ecological bioacoustic studies. Here, I present a novel, comprehensive simulation framework that enables the design, characterisation, and optimisation of microphone arrays tailored to specific localisation requirements-named Array WAH. This tool integrates realistic signal generation, frequency-dependent propagation effects, and advanced time difference of arrival (TDOA) localisation algorithms. I evaluate and compare three four-microphone array geometries--tetrahedral, planar square, and pyramid, and one with six, the octahedron configuration--across a volumetric spatial grid, generating detailed positional and angular error maps. My results demonstrate that the tetrahedral array offers the best balance between positional and angular accuracy, while the octahedral configuration excels in angular precision but with increased positional variability. Planar arrays perform less robustly, especially in angular localisation. My results demonstrate the critical influence of array geometry on localisation robustness and highlight the advantages of three-dimensional microphone arrangements for near-and mid-field echolocation monitoring. By providing a versatile, user-friendly software package, this framework facilitates informed microphone array design decisions for a range of bioacoustic and other ultrasonic sensing applications. Ultimately, it supports improved localisation accuracy in real-world settings, aiding the deployment of compact and effective acoustic monitoring systems."
"The Progressive Ratio (PR) schedule is a popular test for measuring the motivational value of a reinforcer, in which subjects must exert an increasing amount of work to obtain each successive reward. Despite its popularity, the PR task hinges on a low-dimensional behavioral readout--breakpoint, or the maximum work requirement subjects are willing to complete before abandoning the task. Here, we show that with a simple modification, the PR task can be transformed into an optimization problem reminiscent of the patch-leaving foraging scenario, which has been analyzed extensively by behavioral ecologists, psychologists, and neuroscientists. In the Progressive Ratio with Reset (PRR) task, rats perform the PR task on one lever, but can press a second lever to reset the current ratio requirement back to its lowest value at the cost of enduring a reset delay, during which both levers are retracted. Rats used the reset lever adaptively on the PRR task, and their ratio reset decisions were sensitive to the cost of the reset delay. We derived an approach for computing the optimal bout length--the number of rewards to earn before pressing the reset lever that produces the greatest long-term rate of reward--and found that rats flexibly changed their behavior to approximate the optimal strategy. However, rats showed a systematic bias for bout lengths that exceeded the optimal length, an effect reminiscent of ""overharvesting"" in patch-leaving tasks. The PRR task thus represents a novel means of testing whether and how rats adapt their behavior to the cost-benefit structure of the environment in a way that connects deeply to the broader literature on associative learning and optimal foraging theory."
"Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology has been widely used to study the activity and behaviour of various organisms, including bees. In this study, we rigorously evaluate the performance of a recently developed RFID system (iID(R)BEEscience from MicroSensys) in tracking bees under different conditions. We assessed the systems accuracy in detecting and identifying travel direction both in controlled laboratory settings and with free-flying bees. Additionally, we analysed the sources of incorrect or redundant readings and provide a Python script designed to filter out erroneous data, summarising the results in biologically relevant measurements (foraging trip number, trip duration, instances of drifting). Our controlled laboratory tests revealed that the RFID systems accuracy ranged from 93% to 100% in most cases, though accuracy diminished when a large number of transponders passed through the reader simultaneously. We also found certain transponder positions in relation to the reader position to be less reliable. In field conditions, we tracked 33 foraging trips of RFID-tagged honeybees trained to a sucrose solution feeder and observed a 100% success rate in identifying all foraging trips via the RFID data. Given that the transponders weigh only 2.1 mg, we propose that this system is a reliable tool for studying smaller bees (and other insects), which are currently understudied using RFID technology, although its application to species smaller than honeybees (Apis mellifera) requires further testing. This research demonstrates the potential of RFID technology for advancing the study of insect behaviour under field conditions beyond traditional models like honeybees or bumblebees."
"Clinically, no human diseases are currently diagnosed as being directly driven by {beta}- arrestins. Nonetheless, there is growing interest in developing {beta}-arrestin-biased drugs, due to the key regulatory role of {beta}-arrestins in modulating the cellular signaling of most G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). In cell-based studies of rhodopsin-family GPCRs, mutations in a conserved proline-hydrophobic (ProH) motif within the second intracellular loop (ICL2) have been shown to alter {beta}-arrestin signaling bias. The clinical relevance of such mutations in humans is unknown. However, if naturally occurring single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) affecting this ProH motif exist across the GPCR family, then cross-referencing these genetic variants with large-scale population sequencing and epidemiologic data could reveal potential roles for {beta}-arrestin signaling in human health. In this report, we identify SNPs in human GPCRs that correspond to ProH substitutions, and we show that, in the neurotensin receptor NTSR1, these variants can indeed shift signaling bias. We also estimate a lower-bound population frequency for such SNPs, suggesting that although rare for any given receptor, their cumulative prevalence across the GPCR superfamily may be large enough to impact phenotypic variation. Together with emerging data from biased ligands, our findings support the idea that genetic variations in {beta}-arrestin signaling could represent a meaningful source of therapeutic relevance.

Significance statementMutations altering G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling can affect health. We have identified a specific amino acid determinant in intracellular loop (ICL2) of human rhodopsin family GPCRs that influences {beta}-arrestin signaling. Although the medical consequences of this determinant remain unclear, we show that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) affecting the determinant routinely occur. By studying neurotensin receptor NTSR1, we confirm that the SNP alters {beta}-arrestin signaling bias. While individually rare per receptor, these SNPs may collectively contribute to {beta}-arrestin-related phenotypic changes in the human population. Our findings, combined with research on biased drugs, support the idea that {beta}-arrestin signaling might serve as a useful therapeutic target, opening new possibilities for precision medicine."
"Understanding the impact of genetic perturbations on cellular behavior is crucial for biological research, but comprehensive experimental mapping remains infeasible. We introduce PRESAGE (Perturbation Response EStimation with Aggregated Gene Embeddings), a simple, modular, and interpretable framework that predicts perturbation-induced expression changes by integrating diverse knowledge sources via gene embeddings. PRESAGE transforms gene embeddings through an attention-based model to predict perturbation expression outcomes. To assess model performance, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation suite with novel functional metrics that move beyond traditional regression tasks, including measures of accuracy in effect size prediction, in identifying perturbations with similar expression profiles (phenocopy), and in prediction of perturbations with the strongest impact on specific gene set scores. PRESAGE outperforms existing methods in both classical regression metrics and our novel functional evaluations. Through ablation studies, we demonstrate that knowledge source selection is more critical for predictive performance than architectural complexity, with cross-system Perturb-seq data providing particularly strong predictive power. We also find that performance saturates quickly with training set size, suggesting that experimental design strategies might benefit from collecting sparse perturbation data across multiple biological systems rather than exhaustive profiling of individual systems. Overall, PRESAGE establishes a robust framework for advancing perturbation response prediction and facilitating the design of targeted biological experiments, significantly improving our ability to predict cellular responses across diverse biological systems."
"Spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies offer rich spatial context for gene expression, with varying spatial resolutions and gene coverages. However, aligning and comparing multiple ST slices, whether derived from the same or different platforms, remains challenging due to nonlinear distortions and limited spatial overlap caused by tissue processing. We present CODA, an integrative framework for CrOss-sample alignment and spatially Differential gene Analysis. CODA first learns a shared low-dimensional latent feature space across samples. Within the latent space, CODA performs global rigid alignment, applies transformer-based feature matching to identify common spatial domains, and utilizes local nonlinear refinements via large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping, enabling a robust cross-sample comparison and extraction of spatial gene expression patterns. Benchmarking across various ST platforms demonstrates that CODA outperforms the existing methods in alignment accuracy, computational efficiency, and memory usage. Applications to vascular and brain datasets shows CODAs ability to uncover spatially informative genes associated with disease and sleep regulation. These results highlight CODAs broad applicability and effectiveness in ST analysis."
"Foundation Models (FMs) have dramatically increased the potential and power of deep learning algorithms in the fields of natural language processing and computer vision. However, their application in specialized fields like biomedical imaging and fluorescence microscopy remains difficult due to distribution shifts and the scarcity of high-quality annotated datasets. The high cost of data acquisition and the requirement for in-domain expertise further exacerbate this challenge in super-resolution microscopy. To address this we introduce STED-FM, a foundation model specifically designed for super-resolution STimulated Emission Depletion (STED) microscopy. STED-FM leverages a Vision Transformer architecture trained at scale with Masked Autoencoding on a new dataset of nearly one million STED images. STED-FM learns expressive latent representations without extensive annotations, leading to robust performance across diverse downstream microscopy image analysis tasks. Unsupervised experiments highlight the discriminative nature of its learned latent space. Our model significantly reduces the need for annotated data required to achieve strong performance in classification and segmentation tasks, both in- and out-of-distribution. Beyond its core capabilities, STED-FM enhances the quality of images generated by diffusion models, enabling latent attribute manipulation for the data-driven discovery of novel and subtle nanostructures and phenotypes. Moreover, its powerful structure retrieval capabilities are integrated into automated STED microscopy acquisition pipelines, paving the way for smart microscopy. In sum, we demonstrate that STED-FM lays a robust foundation for state-of-the-art algorithms across a wide array of tasks, establishing it as a highly valuable and scalable resource for researchers in super-resolution microscopy."
"MotivationIdentifying meaningful patterns in complex biological data necessitates correlation coefficients capable of capturing diverse relationship types beyond simple linearity. Furthermore, efficient computational tools are crucial for handling the ever-increasing scale of biological datasets.

CCC-GPU computes correlation coefficients for mixed data types, effectively detects non-linear relationships, and offers significant speed improvements over its predecessor.

"Genome size varies by several magnitudes among eukaryotes. Expansion and contraction are primarily driven by transposable element activity, but the underlying processes remain enigmatic due to a lack of historical records tracing these changes. Here, we present the TE Evolution Simulation Suite, or TESS, for versatile simulation of whole-genome sequences with varying transposon dynamics. We analyzed the pangenome of Pucciniomycotina, a subdivision of fungi containing the myrtle rust (Austropuccinia psidii) genome, which drastically expanded to 1018 Mb. Using TESS, we simulated digital replicas of Pucciniomycotina genomes and replicated the genome size evolution of A. psidii driven by LTR retrotransposons."
"Nucleic acid aptamers hold promise for clinical applications, yet understanding their molecular binding mechanisms to target proteins and efficiently optimizing their binding affinities remain challenging. Here, we present CAAMO (Computer-Aided Aptamer Modeling and Optimization), which integrates in silico aptamer design with experimental validation to accelerate the development of aptamer-based RNA therapeutics. Starting from the sequence information of a reported RNA aptamer, Ta, for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, our CAAMO method first determines its binding mode with the spike proteins receptor binding domain (RBD) through a multi-strategy computational approach. We then optimize its binding affinity via structure-based rational design. Among the six designed candidates, five were experimentally verified and exhibited enhanced binding affinities compared to the original Ta sequence. Furthermore, we directly compared the binding properties of the RNA aptamers to neutralizing antibodies, and found that the designed aptamer TaG34C demonstrated a comparable binding affinity to the RBD compared to all tested neutralizing antibodies. This highlights its potential as an alternative to existing COVID-19 antibodies. Our work provides a robust approach for the efficient design of a relatively large number of high-affinity aptamers with complicated topologies. This approach paves the way for the development of aptamer-based RNA diagnostics and therapeutics."

"DNA superhelicity and transcription are intimately related because changes to DNA topology can influence gene expression and vice versa. Information is transferred through the modulation of local DNA torsional stress, where the expression of one gene may influence the superhelical level of neighbouring genes, either promoting or repressing their expression. In this work, we introduce a one-dimensional physical model that simulates supercoiling-mediated regulation. This TORCphysics model takes as input a genome architecture represented either by a plasmid or by a linear DNA sequence with ends constrained under specific biological conditions, and computes the molecules output. Our findings demonstrate that the expression profiles of genes are directly influenced by the gene circuit design, including gene location, the positions of topological barriers, promoter sequences, and topoisomerase activity. The novelty that TORCphysics offers is versatility, where users can define distinct activity models for different types of proteins and protein binding sites. The aim of this research is to establish a flexible framework for developing physical simulations of gene circuits to deepen our comprehension of the intricate mechanisms involved in gene regulation."
"ObjectivesAerobic lactic acid fermentation (the ""Warburg effect"") is associated with OxPhos insufficiency and altered energy metabolism in most cancers. Whether lactate is a major fuel in cancer cells remains debated. This study investigated whether lactate could serve as a metabolic fuel in glioma cells and replace glucose to support viability.

MethodsA bioluminescence ATP assay and calcein-AM/EthD-III double-staining were used to measure ATP content and viability in mouse (VM-M3, CT-2A) and human (U-87MG) glioma cells differing in cell biology and genetic background. Viability was assessed in thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages (TPMs) from VM/Dk and C57BL/6J mice, used as syngeneic non-neoplastic controls for VM-M3 and CT-2A gliomas, respectively. Oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was determined using the Resipher system.

ResultsLactate alone failed to sustain ATP content and viability in all glioma cell lines. ATP content and viability were lower in cancer cells cultured in glutamine and lactate than in glucose and glutamine. In contrast, lactate alone sustained over 45% viability in both TPM models. Moreover, viability was similar between TPMs cultured in glutamine and lactate and in glucose and glutamine. In human U-87MG, lactate addition under severe glucose restriction increased OCR and viability. A low dose of the glycolysis inhibitor 2-deoxy-D-glucose abolished both increases.

ConclusionsOur results suggest non-neoplastic mouse TPMs utilize lactate more effectively than mouse glioma cells. In U-87MG, lactate utilization appears glycolysis-dependent, given its sensitivity to 2-deoxy-D-glucose. In conclusion, our data does not support lactate as a major oxidative fuel for viability in mouse and human glioma cells."
"Breast cancer brain metastases (BCBM) affect nearly 90,000 patients annually in the United States and carry a significant risk of mortality. As metastatic lesions develop, the unique milieu of the brain microenvironment shapes disease progression and therapeutic response. Among resident brain cells, astrocytes are both the most common, and are increasingly recognized as key regulators of this process, yet their precise role remains poorly defined. Here, we present a hybrid agent-based model (ABM) to simulate tumor-astrocyte interactions on a two-dimensional lattice. In our model, metastatic tumor cells induce phenotypic reprogramming of astrocytes from an antito a pro-metastatic state, thereby enhancing tumor proliferation. We systematically evaluate how variations in astrocyte density, spatial distribution, and chemotherapy impact tumor expansion and spatial morphology, quantified by fractal dimension, lacunarity, and eccentricity. Our simulations reveal that astrocyte reprogramming accelerates tumor progression and contributes to increased morphological complexity and chemotherapeutic resistance."
"Machine learning models are often used as scoring functions to predict the binding affinity of a protein-ligand complex. These models are trained with limited amounts of data with experimentally measured binding affinity values. A large number of compounds are labeled inactive throughs single-concentration screens without measuring binding affinities. These inactive compounds, along with the active ones, can be used to train binary classification models, while regression models are trained using compounds with binding affinities only. However, the classification and regression tasks are often handled separately, without sharing the learned feature representations. In this paper, we propose a novel model architecture that jointly performs regression and classification objectives, aiming to maximize data utilization and improve predictive performance by leveraging two complementary tasks. In our setup, the regression yields the binding affinity, whereas the classification task yields the label as active or inactive. We demonstrate our method using PDBbind, the standard 3D structure database, as well as a dataset of flavivirus protease compounds with binding affinity data. Our experiments show that the new joint training strategy improves the accuracy of the model, increasing applicability in various practical drug screening scenarios."

"Engineered RNA viruses can downregulate target genes through virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS). Largely optimized using the model plant Nicotiana benthamiana, current VIGS protocols rely on viral vectors engineered to deliver 200-400 nt inserts with homology to a target gene, often located in less conserved regions to ensure specificity. Given the N. benthamiana allopolyploidy and functional redundancy, we leveraged enhanced genomics and transcriptomics resources to obtain curated locus annotations, which guided the design of virus-delivered short RNA inserts (vsRNAi) for simultaneous targeting of homeologous gene pairs. Our results showed that quantitative silencing phenotypes could be obtained using 24-, 28-, and 32-nt vsRNAi that targeted conserved regions of functionally redundant gene pairs. vsRNAi triggered informative transcriptome-wide changes, and target transcript downregulation was linked to gene-pair-specific production of 21- and 22-nt sRNAs. The portability of vsRNAi to crops was confirmed in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and scarlet eggplant (Solanum aethiopicum). Overall, our results support the usefulness of vsRNAi-based approaches in functional genomics and trait reprogramming of the model species N. benthamiana, as well as of crops that contribute to global and local food provisions.

"Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is a staple food for half of the worlds population, but lacks essential nutrients such as iron (Fe). Fe deficiency is one of the most common nutritional problems in humans, and biofortification of rice grains is a cost-effective approach to deliver more Fe to peoples diet. Two Vacuolar Iron Transporters, OsVIT1 and OsVIT2, were shown to negatively regulate Fe translocation to rice developing panicles, as single mutants osvit1 and osvit2 have increased Fe concentration in seeds. Importantly, rice plants are frequently cultivated in waterlogged soils that are highly reductive and prone to Fe3+ reduction to the more soluble Fe2+, which can accumulate and cause Fe toxicity. Little is known about which genes control Fe excess detoxification. OsVIT1 and OsVIT2 transport Fe into the vacuole, and OsVIT2 is induced under Fe excess, but whether they play a role in Fe detoxification was not demonstrated. We generated double mutants osvit1osvit2 using CRISPR-Cas9 to test whether loss of function of both genes could increase Fe concentration in seeds, and to test whether their loss of function has impact in rice Fe excess tolerance. We showed that osvit1osvit2 double mutants accumulated more Fe in brown rice. Fe accumulation was clear in embryo scutellum and plumule, suggesting VIT transporters have a role in determining Fe spatial distribution. We also showed that root uptake contributed significantly for increased Fe accumulation in osvit1osvit2 seeds, suggesting OsVIT1 and OsVIT2 are involved in sequestering Fe in vegetative tissues and decreasing translocation. Strikingly, we found that osvit1osvit2 plants were more sensitive to Fe excess, revealing a trade-off between Fe biofortification and Fe excess tolerance. Our data indicates OsVIT1 and OsVIT2 are key for Fe excess detoxification, which should be considered in their use as targets for biofortification."
"Traditional crop delivery methods, such as foliar spray and soil application, face significant limitations including nutrient loss, environmental impacts, and low delivery efficiency. Recent advances in nanomaterials have offered novel molecular delivery platforms, but challenges such as toxicity, complexity, and labor-intensive processes persist. To address these issues, we developed a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-based microneedle (MN) delivery system that can be precisely applied to various plant tissues (e.g., leaves or stems), which demonstrates high delivery efficiency compared to the conventional methods while reducing application dose by 90-99%. This MN system facilitates delivery of diverse small molecules ranging from fluorescent dyes, growth promoters, to antiviral agents into plant tissues. By applying fluorescent dye-loaded MNs onto tomato stems, we demonstrated effective molecular diffusion through vascular tissues. Additionally, MNs loaded with gibberellic acid (GA3) enhanced stem and branch growth in tomatoes and restored the lateral flowering phenotype in Arabidopsis ft-10 mutants, with significant upregulation of GA receptor gene expression. Lastly, salicylic acid (SA) injections with MNs induced resistance to Tomato Spotted Wilt Virus (TSWV) in Nicotiana Benthamiana, comparable to conventional spray-based approaches. This easily fabricated and cost-effective PVA-MN system provides a promising tool for precision agriculture, enhancing plant health and productivity while addressing the limitations of conventional delivery methods."
"Strawberry (Fragaria X ananassa) is a globally cultivated fruit crop valued for its unique flavor and aroma. Major groups of volatile organic compounds that contribute to strawberry aroma include terpenes, fatty acid esters, furanones, and benzenoids. Understanding the biosynthetic genes and pathways underlying strawberry terpene metabolism provides resources for developing precision breeding strategies to improve strawberry aroma traits. Here we describe the genome-wide identification and functional analysis of the terpene synthase (TPS) family that governs terpene chemical diversity in strawberries. Mining of the allo-octoploid genome of the cultivar  Royal Royce identified 75 TPS gene candidates. Biochemical characterization of 27 predicted mono-, sesqui- and di-TPS enzymes via in vitro activity assays and in vivo enzyme co-expression studies demonstrated a range of TPS activities that are relevant for the biosynthesis of two thirds of known strawberry terpenes as well as products not previously described in octoploid strawberry. Complementary metabolomic and transcriptomic studies across a diversity panel of strawberry accessions demonstrated substantial variation in the composition and abundance of more than 30 detected accession-specific and common terpene aromas, nine of which matching characterized TPS products. Analysis of a developmental time series of two accessions with contrasting aroma further revealed accession-specific alterations of terpene metabolism during fruit ripening. These results expand our understanding of strawberry aroma metabolism and characterized terpene aroma genes as a resource for the molecular breeding of desirable aroma traits.

One-sentence summaryDiscovery and characterization of the terpene synthase family that controls the diversity of terpene aroma metabolism in accessions of strawberry.

Significance StatementThe diverse class of terpenoids contributes to complex crop traits, including plant growth, stress resilience, pollination, nutrition, and aroma. The discovery of terpene-biosynthetic pathways in octoploid strawberry (Fragaria X ananassa) provides foundational knowledge of the diversity of terpenoid metabolism in this important specialty crop toward applications in improving aroma traits."
"Nest building is a natural behavior that can readily be analyzed in mice in the home cage environment. Nest building is involved in thermoregulation, positive motivational states, and motor function, and has been proposed as an index for ethanol withdrawal severity in mice. However, nest building outcomes after voluntary ethanol consumption have not been examined. Here, we tested male and female C57BL/6J mice on a 4-day drinking in the dark (DID) paradigm of binge-like drinking with either ethanol or a water control and analyzed nest scores at two time points (48 hours and 7 days) after the last DID session. At 48 hours after the last DID session, there were no differences between the two groups in nest quality. At 7 days after DID, ethanol-drinking animals showed significantly lower nest scores than the water group. No differences were found between the ethanol- and water-drinking groups in locomotor activity or anxiety-like behavior at this timepoint, indicating that nest building deficits in the ethanol group were likely not due to underlying differences in these behaviors. Together, these results validate the use of nest building as a naturalistic assessment of withdrawal-associated behavioral changes following voluntary binge-like ethanol consumption."
"Emotional experiences involve more than bodily reactions and momentary feelings--they depend on knowledge about the world that spans contexts and time. Although it is well established that individuals conceptualize emotions using a low-dimensional space organized by valence and arousal, the neural mechanisms giving rise to this configuration remain unclear. Here, we examine whether hippocampal-prefrontal circuits--regions implicated in forming cognitive maps--also support the abstraction of emotional experiences. Using functional MRI data collected as participants viewed emotionally evocative film clips, we found that activity in hippocampal and prefrontal cortex predicted self-reported emotion across schematically distinct videos, consistent with a role in structural learning. Computational modeling of emotion transitions revealed that hippocampal responses to films and emotion self-reports could be predicted based on the statistical regularities of emotion transitions across different temporal scales. These findings demonstrate that hippocampal-prefrontal systems represent emotion concepts at multiple levels of abstraction, offering new insight into how the brain organizes emotion knowledge."
"Computation in recurrent networks of neurons has been hypothesized to occur at the level of low-dimensional latent dynamics, both in artificial systems and in the brain. This hypothesis seems at odds with evidence from large-scale neuronal recordings in mice showing that neuronal population activity is high-dimensional. To demonstrate that low-dimensional latent dynamics and high-dimensional activity can be two sides of the same coin, we present an analytically solvable recurrent neural network (RNN) model whose dynamics can be exactly reduced to a low-dimensional dynamical system, but generates an activity manifold that has a high linear embedding dimension. This raises the question: Do low-dimensional latents explain the high-dimensional activity observed in mouse visual cortex? Spectral theory tells us that the covariance eigenspectrum alone does not allow us to recover the dimensionality of the latents, which can be low or high, when neurons are nonlinear. To address this indeterminacy, we develop Neural Cross-Encoder (NCE), an interpretable, nonlinear latent variable modeling method for neuronal recordings, and find that high-dimensional neuronal responses to drifting gratings and sponta-neous activity in visual cortex can be reduced to low-dimensional latents, while the responses to natural images cannot. We conclude that the high-dimensional activity measured in certain conditions, such as in the absence of a stimulus, is explained by low-dimensional latents that are nonlinearly processed by individual neurons."
"Despite the advantages of optical imaging over electrophysiology, such as cell-type specificity, its application has been limited to the investigation of shallow brain regions (< 2 mm) because of the light scattering property of brain tissue. Passive optical conduits such as graded-index lenses and waveguides have permitted access to deeper locales but with restricted resolution and field of view, while creating massive lesions along the inserted path, with little pathway to improvement in the technology. As an alternative, we present the Acus device, an active implantable complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) neural imager with a 512-pixel silicon image sensor post- processed into a 4.1-mm-long, 120-m-wide shank with a collinear fiber for illumination, which is able to record transient fluorescent signals in deep brain regions at 400 frames/sec. Acus can achieve single-neuron resolution in functional imaging of GCaMP6s-expressing neurons at a frame rate of 400 frames/sec."
"Mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channel gene SCN2A, which encodes the NaV1.2 channel, cause severe epileptic seizures. Patients with SCN2A loss-of-function (LoF) mutations, such as protein-truncating mutations, often experience later-onset and drug-resistant epilepsy, highlighting an urgent unmet clinical need for new therapies. We previously developed a gene-trap Scn2a (Scn2agt/gt) mouse model with a global NaV1.2 reduction in the widely used C57BL/6N (B6) strain. Although these mice display multiple behavioral abnormalities, EEG recordings indicated only mild epileptiform discharges, possibly attributable to the seizure-resistant characteristics associated with the B6 strain. To enhance the epileptic phenotype, we derived congenic Scn2agt/gt mice in the seizure-susceptible DBA/2J (D2J) strain. Notably, we found that these mice exhibit prominent spontaneous absence seizures, marked by both short and long spike-wave discharges (SWDs). Restoring NaV1.2 expression in adult mice substantially reduced their SWDs, suggesting the possibility of SCN2A gene replacement therapy during adulthood. RNA sequencing revealed significant alterations in gene expression in the Scn2agt/gt mice, in particular a broad downregulation of voltage-gated potassium channel (KV) genes, including KV1.1. The reduction of KV1.1 expression was further validated in human cerebral organoids with SCN2A deficiency, highlighting KV1.1 as a promising therapeutic target for refractory seizures associated with SCN2A dysfunction. Importantly, delivery of exogenous human KV1.1 expression via adeno-associated virus (AAV) in D2J Scn2agt/gt mice substantially reduced absence seizures. Together, these findings underscore the influence of mouse strain on seizure severity and highlight the potential of targeted gene therapies for treating SCN2A deficiency-related epilepsies.

"Seasonal influenza viruses continue to pose a significant threat, causing substantial morbidity and mortality in the US and worldwide despite the availability of vaccines and antivirals. These challenges may be addressed by improving vaccine immunogenicity through the inclusion of adjuvants that enhance immune responses against key antigens including influenza hemagglutinin (HA). BECC (Bacterial Enzymatic Combinatorial Chemistry) adjuvants are novel Toll-like Receptor 4 (TLR4) ligands created by modifying enzymes from lipid A synthesis pathways in Gram-negative bacteria. This study compares the ability of the biological and synthetic versions of these adjuvants to enhance the efficacy of recombinant HA (rHA) antigens in mouse influenza virus challenge. Mice immunized with rHA adjuvanted with BECCs stimulate the humoral and cell-mediated arms of the immune system without exhibiting cytotoxicity/pyrogenicity. A robust HA-specific immunoglobulin subtype, especially IgG2a, response was observed in mice adjuvanted with BECCs as compared to control adjuvants, MPL, and PHAD Further, animals adjuvanted with BECC470 cleared infection seven days post-infection, demonstrating their potential for further translational development. Vaccination adjuvanted with BECCs were also able to increase immune recognition of linear B and T cell epitopes when compared to control adjuvants, as well as induce durable immune response eighteen months post-vaccination. Together, these findings indicate that BECCs may serve as highly effective adjuvants in influenza vaccination.

"Postnatal differentiation of gonadotrophs from Sox2-expressing stem cells is essential for maturation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, puberty, and reproduction. Here, we examined the differentiation and maintenance of gonadotrophs in developing and adult female mice. Gonadotrophs and Sox2-expressing cells were visualized by immunostaining, and gonadotrophs were also identified by specific expression of the fluorescent protein tdTomato during embryonic and postnatal development. Sox2-expressing cells are localized in the anterior parenchyma, marginal zone, and posterior pituitary, regardless of mouse age. Gonadotrophs are localized in the anterior parenchyma distinct from Sox2-expressing cells. During the juvenile and prepubertal periods, cells in transition from Sox2 expression to the tdTomato expression, as well as numerous differentiated gonadotrophs, were also present in the marginal zone. The size and distribution of newly differentiated gonadotrophs was consistent with their maturation and migration into parenchyma. Specific knockout of PI4 kinase A in gonadotrophs disrupted their postnatal differentiation in the marginal zone, causing a significant reduction in the size of the gonadotroph population. This was accompanied by a progressive loss of gonadotroph-specific gene/protein expression and an increase in the number of regressed tdTomato-expressing cells. Thus, cells expressing Sox2 in the marginal zone, but not in the parenchyma, serve as stem cells for postnatal gonadotrophs, and the differentiation and maintenance of these cells require PI4 kinase A-derived phosphoinositides."
"Rabies vaccination of vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) has been proposed as a superior control method to culling but has yet to be implemented. Success of rabies vaccination depends on a topical vehicle that spreads through a bat colony via allogrooming while additionally preserving vaccine immunogenicity. This work describes the in vitro and in vivo optimization of a new orotopical gel for rabies vaccine delivery to vampire bats. Autonomous transferability of our carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) gel vaccine delivery formulation was tested in a microchipped vampire bat colony in rural Jalisco, Mexico. Intra-colony gel uptake was traced using the fluorescent biomarker rhodamine B. Importantly, application of topical treatment of [~]20% of the bat colony resulted in estimated uptake by over 85% of the colony. The in vitro stability of our raccoon poxviral-vectored rabies vaccine candidate within CMC was measured at time points up to 3 months at 40 {degrees}C, 23 {degrees}C, and 4 {degrees}C. Extended storage at 4 {degrees}C and short exposure at higher temperatures of potential vampire bat environments preserved vaccine titers within CMC. Furthermore, physical properties of our CMC formulation were compared to the previously used glycerin jelly at 40 {degrees}C, 20 {degrees}C, and 0 {degrees}C using rheological tests. These tests indicate that CMC exhibits optimal properties for topical application to bats even at extreme temperatures possible during field vaccination. This study advances our rabies vaccination strategy for vampire bats by providing a topical vehicle suitable for field application that may additionally be employed for other significant bat diseases."
"Rabies vaccination of vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) has been proposed as a superior control method to culling but has yet to be implemented. Success of rabies vaccination depends on a topical vehicle that spreads through a bat colony via allogrooming while additionally preserving vaccine immunogenicity. This work describes the in vitro and in vivo optimization of a new orotopical gel for rabies vaccine delivery to vampire bats. Autonomous transferability of our carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) gel vaccine delivery formulation was tested in a microchipped vampire bat colony in rural Jalisco, Mexico. Intra-colony gel uptake was traced using the fluorescent biomarker rhodamine B. Importantly, application of topical treatment of [~]20% of the bat colony resulted in estimated uptake by over 85% of the colony. The in vitro stability of our raccoon poxviral-vectored rabies vaccine candidate within CMC was measured at time points up to 3 months at 40 {degrees}C, 23 {degrees}C, and 4 {degrees}C. Extended storage at 4 {degrees}C and short exposure at higher temperatures of potential vampire bat environments preserved vaccine titers within CMC. Furthermore, physical properties of our CMC formulation were compared to the previously used glycerin jelly at 40 {degrees}C, 20 {degrees}C, and 0 {degrees}C using rheological tests. These tests indicate that CMC exhibits optimal properties for topical application to bats even at extreme temperatures possible during field vaccination. This study advances our rabies vaccination strategy for vampire bats by providing a topical vehicle suitable for field application that may additionally be employed for other significant bat diseases."
"Coral reefs globally are experiencing escalating mass bleaching and mortality. Reefs along the western Indian Ocean have been relatively unimpacted. We assessed heat tolerance baselines in two widespread reef-building Acropora species and used selective breeding from two thermally distinct (present day and stress histories) northern (Mean Monthly Maximum 27.9 {degrees}C) and southern (26.6 {degrees}C) reefs along the Ningaloo World Heritage Reef. Fitness responses were measured in control and heat stress temperatures (adults = 31.0 {degrees}C, larvae = 35.5 {degrees}C), including survival, tissue necrosis, bleaching, and photosynthesis. Larvae with one parent from the warmer population exhibited >2.2-fold higher survival under heat stress, while those with both parents from the warmer population survived 1.6-fold better (compared to control larvae with two parents from the cooler population). Photosynthesis was maintained in both species and both populations, suggesting heat responses were host driven. Adults from both populations from one species (A. tenuis) exhibited similar responses to heat, while the other (A. millepora) was more variable. These findings are the first to demonstrate that selective breeding can provide heat tolerance enhancement for corals in the Indian Ocean and will be critical to preparing for future marine heatwaves."
"The distinction between sexual and asexual reproduction is fundamental to eukaryotic evolution. Testing theories about the evolution of reproductive modes first requires knowing whether sex is present or absent in a population. While this seems straightforward, the literature on asexuality reflects a history of shifting claims and uncertainty regarding reproductive mode, especially where sex is potentially rare or cryptic. Here, we develop a new framework to explore the challenges in detecting and quantifying sexual reproduction from population genomic data, based on genetic simulations. We first show that commonly calculated population genetic statistics do not reliably distinguish sexual and obligate asexual scenarios if asexuality is accompanied by sex-independent homologous recombination, as emerging evidence suggests is often the case. We then present a new method to quantify the relationship between evolutionary trees and mode of reproduction by exhaustively classifying local trees for pairs of diploid individuals using ancestral recombination graphs (ARGs). This approach accurately distinguishes signatures of genetic exchange and homologous recombination, although uncertainty remains due to unavoidable biases in the steps needed to reconstruct trees from genome data. We introduce a new statistic and simulation models to account for common reconstruction biases. Our approach offers the potential for improved quantitative inference of reproductive modes that is extendable and applicable to a broad range of eukaryotes.

Significance StatementDetermining how often, if at all, organisms have sex has implications across biology. Studies often use population genomic data to interrogate the private life of putative asexuals, but the answers prove surprisingly inconclusive. We develop a framework to explore the challenges in detecting and quantifying rates of sex. New simulation models show how sex-independent recombination, which occurs widely across a range of asexual eukaryotes, causes genetic patterns to resemble sexual populations, even when sex is absent. An approach based on ancestral recombination graphs (ARGs) and classification of local trees accounts for these problems and quantifies remaining uncertainty due to inevitable reconstruction biases. Our framework will enable improved inferences of reproductive mode across a wide range of eukaryotes."
"Why do some species have more genetic diversity than others? This question is one of the greatest remaining mysteries in evolutionary biology, and is particularly urgent in marine species, which are experiencing catastrophic anthropogenic impacts. We address this critical gap by estimating genetic diversity for 93 marine species sampled over 9,000 localities. For each species, we aggregate biotic traits and abiotic geographic data for their ranges. We show that diversity increases with range extent and planktonic dispersal. We hypothesize that these traits increase a species ability to avoid or recover from bottlenecks, thereby maintaining diversity. Our findings provide insights into the factors interacting to shape genomic variation in the ocean, and offer a predictive framework for understanding marine biodiversity in the face of global change."
"Prunus persica (peach) has long served as a model fruit tree for studying phenological events. It has a relatively small genome and exhibits tremendous plasticity in climate tolerances due to the high variation of chill requirements, bloom times, and fruit ripening times. The peach variety  Lovell 2D was used to generate one of the first high-quality genome assemblies for a tree species, using Sanger sequencing of genetic-map ordered BAC clones. A key to the high quality of this early assembly was the use of a doubled haploid variety, which eliminates the challenges posed by mixed haplotypes. Here, we re-sequenced and assembled the  Lovell 2D genome along with a doubled haploid sibling  Lovell 5D using 3rd generation technologies. The resulting genomes were significantly more contiguous than the current  Lovell 2D reference genome (ver2.0 updated in 2017) and are closer to the estimated total genome size for peach (265Mb). In addition, new gene, transposable element (TE), and Nucleotide-binding domain and Leucine-rich repeat receptor (NLR) annotations were performed to enhance the integrity and utility of the genome. These updated peach doubled-haploid reference assemblies will provide the research community with an improved reference genome for genomics-guided studies and breeding efforts."
"This study presents three genome assemblies within the Capsicum genus, enabling comprehensive comparative analyses for the Annuum and Baccatum complexes within the genus. We produced highly continuous assemblies of the nuclear genomes and complete chloroplast assemblies. Subsequent genome annotation identified 34,580 genes in non-pungent C. annuum cv. ECW, and 32,704 and 33,994 genes in pungent C. chacoense and C. galapagoense, respectively. These assemblies, including the first complete genomes for C. chacoense and C. galapagoense, provide additional genomic resolution within the Capsicum genus. The novel genomes were analyzed within a pangenomic framework, integrating 16 Capsicum genomes across the Annuum, Baccatum, and Pubescens complexes. Homology grouping was used to identify core, accessory and unique genes and showed a wide spectrum of genetic diversity, particularly in homology groups exclusive to C. chacoense and C. galapagoense. Out of 79,267 homology groups identified, 13% were core groups, present in all accessions, corresponding to approximately 30% of core genes per genome. Comparative analyses revealed distinct species and genus specific genomic characteristics. Additionally, we used the graph pangenome to illustrate locus-level exploration by examining the Pun1 locus associated with capsaicinoid biosynthesis, identifying multiple Pun1-like genes including their genomic position and homology information. The integration of these new resources into a dynamic Capsicum pangenome framework provides a versatile platform for extracting genetic information relevant to both fundamental research and breeding applications."
"Extreme environments impose strong mutation and selection pressures that drive distinctive, yet understudied, genomic adaptations in extremophiles. In this study, we identify 15 bacterium-archaeon pairs that exhibit highly similar k-mer-based genomic signatures despite maximal taxonomic divergence, suggesting that shared environmental conditions can produce convergent, genome-wide patterns that transcend evolutionary distance. To uncover these patterns, we developed a computational pipeline to select a composite genome proxy assembled from non-contiguous subsequences of the genome. Using supervised machine learning on a curated dataset of 693 extremophile microbial genomes, we found that 6-mers and 100 kbp genome proxy lengths provide the best balance between classification accuracy and computational efficiency. Our results provide conclusive evidence of the pervasive nature of k-mer-based patterns across the genome, and uncover the presence of taxonomic and environmental components that persist across all regions of the genome. The 15 bacterium-archaeon pairs identified by our method as having similar genomic signatures were validated through multiple independent analyses, including 3-mer frequency profile comparisons, phenotypic trait similarity, and geographic co-occurrence data. These complementary validations confirmed that extreme environmental pressures can override traditionally recognized taxonomic components at the whole-genome level. Together, these findings reveal that adaptation to extreme conditions can carry robust, taxonomic domain-spanning imprints on microbial genomes, offering new insight into the relationship between environmental mutagenesis and selection and genome-wide evolutionary convergence."
"Logistic regression provides a powerful tool for the predictive analysis of single cell and spatial omics data. It has been shown to outperform more complex models on fundamental tasks such as the selection of marker genes and the annotation of cell types. Training logistic regression models on increasingly large, publicly available single-cell datasets opens up opportunities to build accurate and robust cell type prediction models but poses major computational challenges. Here, we adapt and extend the theory of coresets for logistic regression. In particular, we compute a previously introduced classification complexity measure using linear programming to identify single-cell datasets which admit coresets, i.e. random samples of cells, that preserve logistic loss. We show that applying this complexity measure requires a prior dimensionality reduction by, e.g., principle component analysis, and prove that logistic loss is preserved under this linear transformation. In experiments on several cell atlases, we compared our method to CellTypist, a logistic regression-based immune cell atlas and scMulan, a pre-trained language model, to demonstrate that theoretical guarantees translate to an accurate cell type label transfer method that scales to atlas-scale datasets."
"Carbon fiber-reinforced polymers (CFRPs), particularly epoxy-based composites, have become essential in the aerospace, automotive, and wind energy industries due to their robust mechanical properties, and lightweight nature. However, there is a lack of recycling technologies that are environmentally sustainable while also ensuring the recovery of carbon fibers in their original state. Although certain bacterial and fungal strains can colonize epoxy polymers, enzymes capable of efficiently degrading these materials have not yet been reported. Consequently, there is an urgent need for an effective, sustainable, and biologically inspired solution for CFRP recycling. Here, a chemo-enzymatic two-step oxidation process was developed. A chemical pre-treatment with propionic acid and hydrogen peroxide was used to recover imbedded carbon fibers. Additionally, three novel bacterial laccases isolated from the European spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus) demonstrated the ability to degrade three epoxy resin scaffolds from Hexflow(R) RTM6, used in aircraft applications. The sequential combination of both oxidative steps enabled the retrieval of clean carbon fibers and partial modification of epoxy functional groups, with the release of defined products over time. This bio-inspired approach renders the process more environmentally friendly and marks an initial step toward developing a bio-based recycling method for epoxy CFRPs."
"While antibiotics mediate chemical warfare among microbes, their roles in the wild extend beyond direct growth inhibition(1). Some antibiotics have the potential to mediate interference competition by triggering a bacterial stress response that subsequently activates endogenous viruses integrated in bacterial genomes (prophages). Canonically, this activation is regulated by the SOS response upon DNA damage. Here we show that a metabolite produced by natural isolates of Vibrio ordalii circumvents the SOS response by directly triggering prophage induction in other Vibrio species, co-occurring in the same environment. While the metabolite was previously classified as a broad-spectrum antibiotic, we observe how it acts as a peptide deformylase inhibitor that specifically induces certain prophages, even when target bacterial cells carry multiple other prophages. Its biosynthetic gene cluster, or ord cluster, also encodes its own peptide deformylase (OrdE) which provides self-immunity to producer strains. Likewise, among natural Vibrio isolates that carry similar prophages, resistance against the ord metabolite was found in those that had acquired a divergent second peptide deformylase. Finally, we show that prophage induction by the ord cluster prevents slower-growing producer strains from being outcompeted by their otherwise fast-growing competitors if they carry an inducible prophage. Thus, we demonstrate how natural products play additional impactful roles in communities beyond antibiotic activity and that prophage induction serves as an interference competition strategy, sustaining community diversity."
"The influenza A virus polymerase, consisting of a heterotrimer of three viral proteins, carries out both transcription and replication of the viral RNA genome. These distinct activities are regulated by viral proteins that vary in abundance during infection, and by various co-opted host cell proteins, which serve as targets for the development of novel antiviral interventions. However, little is known about which host proteins direct transcription and which replication. In this report, we performed a differential interactome screen to identify host proteins co-opted as either transcription-or replication-specific factors. We found that distinct sets of host proteins interact with the influenza polymerase as it carries out the different activities.

We functionally characterised HMGB2 and RUVBL2 as replication-specific cofactors and RPAP2 as a transcription-specific cofactor. Our data demonstrate that comparative proteomics can be used as a targeted approach to uncover virus-host interactions that regulate specific stages of the viral lifecycle."
"Extracellular electron transfer is a respiratory process conducted by a number of microorganisms in order to access insoluble or membrane impermeable electron acceptors or donors. The process has wide implication for the biogeochemistry of our planet and offers many opportunities for biotechnological applications. Outer membrane spanning electron transfer is conducted by the model organism Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 by a stable trimeric protein complex. The electron conduit consists of two c-type cytochromes on either site of the outer membrane and a {beta}-barrel protein in the middle that seems to facilitate interaction of the two heme containing proteins. This study reveals that the periplasmic c-type cytochrome MtrA is not only part of the electron conduit, but also assists in the periplasmic transport of the unfolded outer membrane protein MtrB, a function that was so far believed to be conducted for all outer membrane {beta}-barrel proteins by one of the canonical chaperones SurA, Skp or DegP. However, three more {beta}-barrel proteins were identified that are independent of the canonical chaperones as well but still rely on the BAM complex in the outer membrane, suggesting that many more solutions for periplasmic transfer of {beta}-barrel protein towards the outer membrane exist in Gram-negative microorganisms."
"HIV-1-mediated CD4 downregulation is a well-known mechanism that protects infected cells from antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). While CD4 downregulation by HIV-1 Nef and Vpu proteins has been extensively studied, the contribution of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) in this mechanism is less understood. While Env is known to retain CD4 in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through its CD4-binding site (CD4bs), little is known about the mechanisms underlying this process. Here we show that the cytoplasmic tail of Env is a major determinant in CD4 downregulation. This function is highly conserved as it was observed with nine different infectious molecular clones from four clades. The small but significant accumulation of CD4 at the surface of cells infected with Env cytoplasmic tail deleted viruses is sufficient to trigger Env to adopt a more ""open"" conformation. This prompted recognition of such HIV-1-infected cells by plasma from people living with HIV (PLWH) and several families of CD4-induced (CD4i) antibodies, leading to the elimination of these cells by ADCC. While cytoplasmic tail truncations are known to enhance Env expression at the cell surface, this did not fully explain the increased recognition of infected cells by CD4i antibodies and plasma from PLWH. Introduction of the CD4bs D368R mutation, which abrogates CD4 interaction, decreased Env recognition and ADCC. Overall, our results show that CD4 downregulation by the cytoplasmic tail of Env contributes to the protection of infected cells from ADCC.

IMPORTANCEHIV-1-mediated CD4 downregulation is a central mechanism involved in the protection of infected cells from antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. CD4 downregulation prevents the premature interaction between HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins (Env) and CD4, which would otherwise ""open"" Env and expose vulnerable epitopes recognized by CD4-induced antibodies present in the plasma from people living with HIV. While the mechanisms of CD4 downregulation by the viral accessory proteins Nef and Vpu have been elucidated, the function of Env in this process is less clear. Here we show that the cytoplasmic tail of Env plays an important role, thus contributing to the protection of infected cells from ADCC."
"Bidirectional replication is a conserved principle requiring the coordinated loading and activation of two replicative helicases at the origin. In Escherichia coli, the initiator protein DnaA constructs a higher-order initiation complex at the origin oriC which locally unwinds the DNA, and recruits DnaB helicase-DnaC loader complexes to the unwound region. We previously demonstrated that the two DnaA subcomplexes formed on oriC bind a specific DNA strand of the unwound origin, and tether individual DnaB-DnaC complexes via stable interactions between DnaA domain I and DnaB. A low-affinity DnaA-DnaB interaction mediated by DnaA domain III His136 is essential for DnaB-dependent origin unwinding. Here, we identified DnaB Thr86 as the critical residue mediating this low-affinity interaction. Structural modelling suggests that Thr86 is surface-exposed near the DNA entry site of DnaB. Functional analyses revealed that DnaB Thr86 was specifically required for DnaB loading onto the DnaA-bound strand of the unwound oriC. Furthermore, this strand-specific DnaB loading was required for enabling translocation of the opposing DnaB helicase loaded on the DnaA-free strand. Our findings define a novel regulatory mechanism of strand-specific helicase loading, mediated by the low-affinity DnaA-DnaB interactions, which ensures the coordinated loading and translocation of DnaB helicases for bidirectional replication from oriC."
"Climate change poses a significant threat to European beech. These concerns highlight the need to assess the adaptive potential of European beech populations to climate change. Landscape genomics, also known as environmental association analysis, is a powerful tool for identifying gene loci that contribute to local adaptation to environmental pressures. Genotypic data was collected from [~]100 adult beech trees per stand in five locations in the South-Eastern Romanian Carpathians along an altitudinal gradient associated with precipitation and temperature. In total, 53 environmental variables, comprising frost frequency change, temperature and precipitation, were extracted from the climatology data base CHELSA. Based on these variables the Ellenberg-Quotient (EQ) was calculated. We performed environmental association analysis using LFMM (latent factor mixed models) to identify Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) markers associated with environmental variables and with the principal components calculated based on these. We identified 446 SNP markers significantly associated with the first principal component (PC). These were overlapping with the SNP markers significantly associated with all environmental variables except precipitation accumulated during the growing season. The first PC was correlated with all temperature-based variables and elevation at |r| [~]0.989 to [~]0.997 and with all precipitation-based and Ellenberg-Quotient variables at |r| [~]0.945 to 0.950, except precipitation accumulated during the growing season. A high peak region on chromosome 2 from [~]4.56 to [~]16.27 Mb appeared in all results. This region was [~]3.47 Mb downstream from a region for local adaptation identified by Lazic et al. (2024). In this peak, 273 markers located in the coding region of 22 genes were found. Ten out these 22 were described based on a literature review. Among these ten genes, two may be involved in local adaptation based on our literature review. These two genes are polygalacturonase QRT3-like and NRT1/PTR_FAMILY 5.4-like. The gene polygalacturonase QRT3-like plays a role in pollen development in Arabidopsis thaliana L. and Brassica rapa L. We observed at the corresponding SNP markers, a correlation of the minor allele frequency and temperature-based environmental variables."
"Prior to 1980, experimental induction of polyploidy (chromosome doubling) led to the release of several tetraploid Brassica rapa ssp. rapa as fodder turnip cultivars. Most experimentally induced polyploids are meiotically unstable and show reduced fertility. However, we hypothesized that based on the requirement to produce large amounts of commercial seed to sell to farmers, these turnip lines should have managed to restore fertility and stabilize meiosis. We collected and tested all B. rapa listed as or referred to as tetraploid from the IPK Gatersleben, CGN Wageningen and Nordgen germplasm banks, and subsequently investigated chromosome karyotypes, meiotic chromosome behaviour and fertility in confirmed tetraploid turnip accessions, using a combination of resequencing and fluorescent in situ hybridisation. Contrary to our expectations, all accessions showed unstable meiosis: the average tetravalent frequency per meiosis per plant ranged from 4.8 to 6.4 per line, and these tetravalent associations also persisted from diakinesis to metaphase I. Using chromosome-specific fluorescence in situ hybridisation probes, we found that most chromosomes showed similar frequencies of tetravalent formation except for chromosomes A03 and A06, which predominantly formed tetravalents (>90%). Of the 21 individuals sequenced (one per accession), approximately half (9/21) were aneuploid (loss or gain of a whole chromosome), and two displayed additional chromosomal rearrangements. We nevertheless observed no significant phenotypic abnormalities or reductions in fertility (although all accessions were self-incompatible). Our findings indicate that stabilizing meiosis may not always be necessary to produce relatively fertile and homogeneous outcrossing polyploid populations."
"Cas12a (Cpf1) is a class 2 CRISPR-Cas effector protein with RNA-guided DNA endonuclease activity widely used for genome editing. While its DNA cleavage and target recognition mechanisms have been studied extensively, the possibility of auxiliary enzymatic functions remains underexplored. Here, I report that Acidaminococcus sp. Cas12a (AsCas12a) possesses intrinsic ATPase activity, despite lacking canonical nucleotide-binding or hydrolysis motifs. Using a radiometric thin-layer chromatography (TLC) assay, I demonstrate that AsCas12a hydrolyzes ATP in a concentration and time-dependent manner. Importantly, this activity occurs independently of DNA cofactors, as neither single-stranded nor double-stranded DNA influenced the rate or extent of ATP hydrolysis. Bioinformatic analyses using NsitePred and SwissDock identified potential ATP-binding residues with predicted favorable binding energies. This preliminary finding uncovers a previously unrecognized biochemical property of AsCas12a and raises questions regarding the physiological role of this ATPase activity in CRISPR function."

"Identifying organism-level phenotypic variation that arises from genetic variation is a longstanding problem in genetics. Model organisms such as zebrafish are frequently used for genotype to phenotype studies as they can be genetically manipulated, grown and phenotyped for morphological changes in a high throughput manner through automated systems and imaging. However, individuals from model organisms are typically grown in groups: clutches for zebrafish and frogs, and litter for rodents. These clutches act as strong confounders during image analysis, as individuals from different genotypes but grown in the same clutch tend to look more similar to each other than to individuals with the same genotype in other clutches. Existing approaches such as conditional image classification models and domain adaptation approaches perform poorly on addressing these technical batch effects. Here, we propose a conditional latent diffusion model (cLDM) that disentangles these technical batch effects from morphological features by explicitly conditioning on batch-specific variables during generation, enabling targeted separation of technical artifacts from biologically relevant data. This approach enables accurate classification of genotypes using morphological images of individual zebrafish from distinct mutant classes. Furthermore, this approach allows us to efficiently correct for batch effect and demonstrates the versatility of cLDM in tackling domain-specific problems. This work highlights the potential of cLDM to overcome batch effects and extract meaningful features."
"Pathogens exploit host cellular machinery through protein-protein interactions (PPIs), often using molecular mimicry to hijack host cellular processes. While there have been thousands of host-pathogen PPIs determined to date, the lack of structural information for these impedes the study of the prevalence of molecular mimicry and convergent evolution of protein interaction interfaces. To address this, we benchmarked AlphaFold2 and 3 for prediction of structures of host-pathogen interactions observing that accurate models can be retrieved when ranking by modelling confidence, despite an overall low performance. We predicted structures for 6,782 pathogen-human PPIs yielding 803 models of higher confidence. Most pathogen proteins interacting with a common human protein are predicted to do so via the same interface, suggesting a high degree of convergent evolution of protein interaction interfaces. When comparing structural models from host-pathogen and host-host interactions, we observe that a majority of pathogen proteins are predicted to target existing human PPI interfaces. We categorized instances of mimicry into different modes, occurring at different frequencies: 1) via the same domain family (least common); 2) via a similar structural motif; and 3) via a similar linear motif (most common). We selected examples of linear motif interactions for binding assay testing, confirming 8 out of 12 predicted interfaces, including 3 viral linear motif interactions. This validates AlphaFolds ability to model some host-pathogen interactions and the mechanisms underlying molecular mimicry. This work showcases the value of large-scale structural modelling to study convergent evolution of host-pathogen interactions and how molecular mimicry may contribute to infection or host defense."
"Accurately predicting gene function from DNA sequences remains a fundamental challenge in genomics, particularly given the limited experimental annotation available for most genes. Existing computational approaches often formulate function prediction as a classification task over predefined categories, limiting their flexibility and expressiveness. We introduce GeneChat, a multi-modal large language model designed to generate free-form, natural language descriptions of gene functions directly from nucleotide sequences and textual prompts. GeneChat integrates three components: a DNABERT-2-based gene encoder optimized for long-range genomic context, an adaptor that aligns gene representations with the input space of a large language model, and Vicuna-13B, a fine-tuned LLaMA-2 variant used to produce coherent functional narratives. Trained on over 50,000 genes from the NCBI database, GeneChat outperforms GPT-4o on BLEU and METEOR metrics, demonstrating superior ability to generate accurate, context-aware, and semantically rich descriptions. This work highlights the potential of foundation models for advancing interpretable and scalable gene function prediction in a free-form, language-driven paradigm."
"Acid resistance is crucial for enterobacteria to withstand host acidic environments during infection, including the gastrointestinal tract and macrophage phagosomes. A key acid resistance mechanism of the facultative intracellular pathogen Salmonella is expression of the arginine decarboxylase AdiA. While AdiA confers acid resistance via an H+-consuming reaction, we discover that the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of adiA mRNA is processed by RNase E into a regulatory small RNA, AdiZ. Through RNA-RNA interactome profiling and transcriptomic analysis, followed by in vitro structural probing and in vivo validations, we demonstrate that AdiZ directly base-pairs with and negatively regulates ptsG, pykF, and dmsA mRNAs involved in glucose uptake, glycolysis, and anaerobic respiration, respectively. Intriguingly, AdiZ is induced and facilitates Salmonella survival within macrophages, where acidic and hypoxic stresses prevail. Thus, simultaneous expression of AdiA and AdiZ from a single mRNA ties arginine-dependent acid resistance to metabolic reprogramming of Salmonella in the host intracellular niches.

"Successful wastewater-based infectious disease surveillance programs depend on regular, reliable molecular detection of nucleic acids in municipal wastewater systems. This process is challenged by the gradual degradation of the viral content of the wastewater over time. Testing protocols are complex and often cannot be performed on site, resulting in delays between collection and testing. The evidence of continued degradation of viral RNA when stored at low temperatures is currently limited to a small number of studies with mixed results. Taking advantage of variable delays between sample collection and processing, we used a Bayesian temporal model and data from two winter periods of a national surveillance program in Switzerland to determine the rate at which the measured viral concentrations of four respiratory viruses declined as a result of RNA degradation between sample collection and processing. We found evidence of substantial degradation between the collection and processing of samples with daily rates of up to -0.28 (-0.38 - -0.19 95% CrI). We established that reduction in viral concentrations resulting from post-sampling degradation was responsible for a number of measurements falling below quantifiable limits. For one treatment plant, we estimate that 39 measurements fell below the limit of detection due to RNA degradation over the course of a single season. Measurements are more likely to be lost early in the seasonal epidemic when concentrations are still low. This delays consistent reliable measurement and sets back epidemiological assessments relevant to public health management strategies."
"Dietary fibre regulates the microbiome and gut health but increases murine whipworm (Trichuris muris) infection through unclear mechanisms. We show that mice fed inulin-supplemented diets exhibit dysregulated innate antimicrobial defences and altered tryptophan metabolism during T. muris infection. Inhibiting tryptophan catabolism or neutralizing IL-27 and IL-18 in inulin-fed mice restored infection resistance. Notably, inulin led to chronic infection even in microbiota-depleted mice. Removing inulin within a critical immune development window rapidly restored anti-helminth immunity, indicating direct, time-dependent modulation of mucosal immune responses. Our findings reveal a previously unrecognized, direct influence of dietary fibre on mucosal immunity to parasitic infection, independent of the microbiome, highlighting the complex interplay between diet timing and host defence."
"Demand for high-yield protein production in biotechnological applications is driving efforts to maximize heterologous protein expression in scalable microorganisms such as E. coli. While codon optimization techniques employed by contemporary sequence providers promise high-expression products, expression levels are often unsatisfactory. Whether the causes for this performance unreliability are due to fundamental constraints on the predictability of protein yields, or whether they stem from differences in theoretical approaches, is unknown. Here, we performed a comparative analysis to address this question. We assessed the performance of twelve different optimization approaches at enhancing expression of a sequence encoding a cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase. Six approaches stemmed from commercial providers and six from freely available sources. Through analysis of their elongation time profiles and multidimensional scaling we assessed which algorithms follow a unique optimization approach. We found that codon-optimized sequences are, on average, capable to raise protein expression levels with respect to the nonoptimised source sequence. However, variation in the protein expression levels was large. Simple, non-proprietary optimization techniques were capable of achieving protein expression levels that fall within the top expression range amongst candidate sequences. Lastly, we found that negative epistasis influences a sequences protein expression level. Since therefore the protein expression landscape arising from synonymous sequence space must exhibit a non-negligible degree of ruggedness, standard approaches will be limited in their capacity to predict protein expression levels of sequences."
"Alzheimers Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by complex, cell-type-specific molecular alterations. This study integrates single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) with network-based methodologies to decode transcriptional changes across major brain cell types in AD. Using scRNA-seq data from 432,555 single cells, we constructed Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) networks specific to each cell type and assessed the differential expression of genes in diseased conditions. Our findings reveal that glutamatergic neurons and inhibitory interneurons exhibit the highest transcriptional dysregulation, while pericytes and endothelial cells show limited changes. The analysis identified significant enrichment of Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) within the AD protein module. Network analysis highlights highly connected proteins such as HSPB1, which is implicated in proteostasis, and CXCR4, which is involved in neuroinflammation. Our results underscore the importance of cell-type-specific approaches in AD research, demonstrating that neurons experience more extensive dysregulation, while vascular-associated cells play key roles in maintaining Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) integrity. These insights emphasize the necessity of tailored therapeutic strategies addressing the heterogeneous molecular landscape of AD."
"The planthopper Pentastiridius leporinus has emerged as a severe crop pest, rapidly expanding both its host plant range and the affected areas in central Europe. Originating as a monophagous herbivore of reed grass, P. leporinus recently adopted polyphagous feeding and is now a pest of sugar beet, potato, carrot, and onion, suggesting rapid ecological niche expansion. P. leporinus vectors two bacterial pathogens, the {gamma}-proteobacterium Candidatus Arsenophonus phytopathogenicus (CAP) and the stolbur phytoplasma Candidatus Phytoplasma solani (CPS), which are responsible for a range of disease syndromes, including syndrome basses richesses (SBR) in sugar beet. We used long-read metagenomic sequencing to characterize the genomes of microbes associated with P. leporinus, resulting in the complete sequences of CAP and CPS, as well as primary symbionts of the genera Purcelliella, Sulcia and Vidania, and facultative symbionts Rickettsia and Wolbachia. The primary symbionts are inferred to provide all ten essential amino acids and contribute to B vitamin biosynthesis. The genomes of CPS and CAP encode numerous pathogenicity factors, enabling the colonization of different hosts. Bacterial fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed the tissue distribution, cellular localization, relative abundance and transmission patterns of these bacteria. The intracellular presence of all primary symbionts in bacteriomes, the intracellular presence of Wolbachia, and the intranuclear localization of Rickettsia, suggest vertical transmission. CPS was restricted to salivary glands, suggesting strict horizontal, plant-mediated transmission, whereas CAP colonized all tissue types, allowing for horizontal and vertical transmission. Our data suggest that P. leporinus hosts an exceptionally broad range of symbionts, encompassing mutualistic, commensal and pathogenic interactions.

ImportanceThe planthopper Pentastiridius leporinus has recently expanded its host plant range and emerged as severe pest of sugar beet and potato crops in central Europe, which is exacerbated by its capacity to vector bacterial pathogens to its host plants. Because microbial symbionts may play an important role for both the host plant shifts and the transmission of pathogens, we used metagenomic sequencing and fluorescence in situ hybridization to characterize the microbial community associated with P. leporinus. We detected three bacteriome-localized primary symbionts that together provision all essential amino acids and several B-vitamins to the host, as well as two intracellular bacteria with a broader tissue distribution. In addition, we infer localization, transmission, and putative pathogenicity factors for the two major phytopathogens that are vectored by P. leporinus. Our results reveal a complex community of symbiotic bacteria that likely shapes the interaction of this emerging pest with its host plants."
"Parasites can have profound effects on their hosts, and those effects can be altered by changing environmental conditions. The dinoflagellate Hematodinium sp. is a common and deadly parasite of the crab Chionoecetes bairdi, a species vulnerable to rising ocean temperatures. To examine the impact of parasitism under various temperature conditions, infected crabs (n = 9) were held under three temperature regimes (4{degrees}C, 7.5{degrees}C, and 10{degrees}C) for 17 days. RNAseq was performed on samples from three timepoints, and the relationships of temperature and time to gene expression were examined. Transcriptomes for C. bairdi and Alveolata symbiotes were created, and genes linked to immune function were identified within both host and parasite. Within the host, 1721 contigs were differentially expressed in response to a temperature increase, with 86% of these increased in expression. In total, 3013 contigs linked to temperature response were identified. Additionally, numerous changes in biological processes were observed in Hematodinium over the course of the experiment, including development and microtubule-based processes and ribosomal assembly. Through understanding the impact of changes in temperature on gene expression within both Hematodinium and infected C. bairdi, we provide a more complete picture of the response of these species to rising ocean temperatures."

"Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) is a crucial auxin governing plant development and environmental responses. While the indole-3-pyruvic acid (IPyA) pathway is the predominant IAA biosynthesis route, other pathways, like the indole-3-acetaldoxime (IAOx) pathway, have been proposed. The IAOx pathway has garnered attention due to its supposed activation in auxin-overproducing mutants (e.g., sur1, sur2, ugt74b1) and the auxin-like responses triggered by exogenous application of its proposed intermediates: IAOx, indole-3-acetonitrile (IAN), and indole-3-acetamide (IAM). However, despite supporting evidence for individual steps, conclusive physiological relevance of the IAOx pathway remains unproven. Using a comprehensive genetic approach combined with metabolic and phenotypic profiling, we demonstrate that mutating gene families proposed to function in the IAOx pathway does not result in prominent auxin-deficient phenotypes, nor are these genes required for high-auxin production in the sur2 mutant. Our findings also challenge the previously postulated linear IAOx pathway. While exogenously provided IAOx, IAN, and IAM can be converted to IAA in vivo, they do not act as precursors for each other. Finally, our findings question the physiological relevance of IAM and IAN as IAA precursors in plants and suggest the existence of a yet uncharacterized auxin biosynthetic route, likely involving IAOx as an intermediate, for the production of IAA in the sur2 mutant. Future identification of the metabolic steps and the corresponding genes in this new pathway may uncover the previously unknown way of synthesizing IAA in plants."
"Elucidating the socio-ecological factors that shape patterns of epigenetic modification in long-lived vertebrates is of broad interest to evolutionary biologists, geroscientists, and ecologists. However, aging research in wild populations is limited due to inability to measure cellular hallmarks of aging noninvasively. Here, we demonstrate that cellular DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles from fecal samples provide an accurate and reliable molecular clock in wild capuchin monkeys. Analysis of blood, feces, and urine samples from a closely related species shows that DNAm differentiates between species and different types of biological samples. We further find age-associated differences in DNAm relevant to cellular damage, inflammation, and senescence, consistent with hallmarks conserved across humans and other mammalian species, speaking to the comparative potential. By demonstrating that DNAm can be studied non-invasively in wild animals, our research opens new avenues in the study of modifiers of the pace of aging, and increases potential for cross-population and species comparisons."
"Single-cell gene expression is influenced by diverse covariates such as genomics protocol, tissue origin, donor attributes, and microenvironment, which are challenging to disentangle. We present CellDISECT, a novel method combining disentangled representations and causal inference for multi-batch, multi-covariate single-cell data analysis. CellDISECT employs a mixture of expert variational autoencoders to learn covariate-specific and unsupervised latent spaces, enabling counterfactual predictions and biological discovery. Drawing inspiration from LLM training on synthetic data, CellDISECT generates synthetic counterfactuals during training and their quality is scored in the loss function. This semi-autoencoding of counterfactuals during training increases model performance in counterfactual predictions at test time. Benchmarking across datasets, CellDISECT outperformed existing methods in disentanglement, counterfactual in-silico prediction of responses to perturbations, and cell type discovery. CellDISECT predicted responses of cells to changing tissue microenvironments and identified a novel pre-natal megakaryocyte subpopulation with immune characteristics distinct from classical platelet-producing MKs, highlighting its unique capabilities in single-cell analysis to help identify novel subpopulations and reduce concerns of technical effects during integration."
"Screening protein variants for desired functions has long relied on coupling of genotype (gene sequence) to phenotype (protein function), limiting the use of powerful single-molecule (SM) techniques. Here, we introduce a scalable SM screening method that bypasses this constraint by linking SM functional analysis to protein identity through SM protein sequencing. Protein variants are tagged with unique C-terminal peptide barcodes and loaded onto a semiconductor chip containing millions of nanowells. Protein-ligand interactions are monitored in real time at the SM level, and a dye-cycling strategy extends the measurable dynamic range, enabling quantification of slow dissociation rates typical of high-affinity interactions. After functional analysis, each protein molecule is identified by sequencing its barcode. We apply this method to 20 barcoded nanobodies spanning over 1,000-fold in affinity, yielding results consistent with published values and individual SM measurements. Our approach should accelerate protein engineering by enabling rapid, multiplexed SM screening of protein libraries."
"Interleukin-7 (IL-7) plays a central role in maintaining T cell development and immune homeostasis, and enhancing the cytokines immune-stimulatory functionality has broad therapeutic implications against various oncological malignancies. Herein, we show a computationally designed IL7 superkine, Neo-7, which exhibits enhanced folding efficiency and superior binding affinity to its cognate receptors. To streamline the protein candidate prediction and validation process, the loop region of IL7 was strategically targeted for redesign while most of the receptor-interacting regions were preserved. Leveraging advanced computational tools such as AlphaFold2, we show loop remodeling to rectify structural irregularities that allows for iterative stabilization of protein backbone and leads to identification of beneficial mutations conducive to receptor engagement. Neo-7 superkine shows improved thermostability and production yield, and it exhibits heightened immune-stimulatory and anticancer effect. These findings underscore the utility of a targeted computational approach for de novo cytokine development."
"In silico analysis provides valuable insights into studying macromolecules, particularly proteins. Protein structure prediction models, like AlphaFold (AF), offer a cost-effective and time-efficient alternative to traditional methods like X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and cryo-EM for determining protein structures. These models are increasingly used in protein-ligand interaction studies, a key aspect of drug discovery. Docking and molecular dynamics simulations facilitate this process, and researchers are continuously developing open-access tools for cavity detection and docking to accelerate protein-ligand interaction studies. However, while many of these tools perform well in specific cases, their strengths and weaknesses in analyzing predicted protein structures remain largely unknown. Therefore, it is crucial to compare docking analyses using experimentally determined protein structures and deep learning-based models. In this study, two well-characterized proteins, dopamine D3 receptor with its ligand ETQ and neprilysin with its ligand sacubitrilat, are used to evaluate docking predictions. The docking tools CB-Dock 2 and COACH-D are applied to both X-ray crystallography-derived structures and five different AF-generated models. The objective is to assess the accuracy of these docking approaches and determine whether this strategy can effectively simulate macromolecular behavior in their microenvironment. By doing so, this study aims to generate new insights and contribute to accelerating research in protein-ligand interactions."
"The discovery and validation of genetic biomarkers across diverse diseases demand intelligent systems capable of integrating complex multi-omics data with clinical relevance. We introduce HEAL-KGGen, an end-to-end framework that enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) through a hierarchical multi-agent architecture and an automatically constructed medical knowledge graph. The system includes a General Practitioner (GP) agent for initial biomarker triage and specialist agents for genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and clinical interpretation. The core innovation of HEAL-KGGen lies in its dynamic knowledge graph pipeline, which combines entity extraction based on patterns and semantics, ontology-aligned normalization (using UMLS, MeSH, SNOMED CT) and the construction of multi-source relationships from biomedical databases and literature. Retrieved subgraphs are transformed into contextual prompts that guide LLM reasoning via structured, explainable pathways. Our experiments show that HEAL-KGGen significantly improves question-answering accuracy across multiple mainstream large language models, with the highest improvement observed on Claude 3.5 Sonnetachieving a 43.75% increase in accuracy., confirming the value of domain-specific graph knowledge in advancing LLM performance for genetic and molecular diagnostics."
"We established a research-education partnership known as EvolvingSTEM that provides secondary school students the opportunity to conduct authentic research experiments centered on microbial evolution. These experiments are currently conducted by thousands of high school students and can offer an unprecedented window into biofilm adaptation while building a community of young researchers. Providing high school students access to research experiences improves learning and can have positive and long-lasting impacts on their attitudes towards science. Moreover, student research can make impactful scientific contributions. Through EvolvingSTEM, students evolve populations of Pseudomonas fluorescens in a biofilm bead model and observe heritable changes in colony morphology. Genome sequencing of 70 mutants that they picked identified parallel mutations in genes known to regulate biofilm growth (wsp, yfiBNR, morA, fuzY). We also uncovered novel adaptations: loss-of-function mutations in phosphodiesterase PFLU0185 that did not alter colony morphology, and mutations affecting periplasmic disulfide bond formation producing small colonies. PFLU0185 mutations consistently reached high frequencies and phenotyping revealed roles in cyclic di-GMP regulation, biofilm formation, and motility, prompting us to name this gene bmo (biofilm and motility optimizer). Competition experiments and microscopy demonstrated bmo mutants employ generalist strategies and coexist with the ancestor and specialist mutants through niche differentiation. Consequently, phenotypic diversity is maintained, with smooth (ancestral and bmo) colonies consistently outnumbering wrinkly and fuzzy variants. The study advances understanding of biofilm genetic architecture while demonstrating that student-led research can uncover mechanisms of microbial adaptation relevant to Pseudomonas infection biology and provide transformative STEM experiences.

IMPORTANCEBacterial biofilms dominate microbial life, yet their evolutionary genetics remain incompletely understood. This science education project engages thousands of high school students in experimental evolution, yielding discoveries about biofilm adaptation while transforming their science education. Selected mutants included PFLU0185/bmo, a conserved phosphodiesterase that helps bacteria balance the competing demands of attachment and dispersal essential for biofilm life cycle success. The finding that smooth-colony generalists rather than conspicuous variants dominate biofilm adaptation adds to our understanding of the process of niche differentiation in biofilms. This work also demonstrates the power of distributed research networks for discovery of new genetic pathways of adaptation. Students gained authentic research experience, potentially inspiring them to join the next generation of scientists, while identifying mutants adapted to discrete conditions that maintain diversity within biofilms. This synergy between education and discovery offers a scalable model for addressing complex biological questions while developing scientific literacy in diverse classrooms."
"2.Species of the fruit fly, Drosophila, are essential models for investigating host/virus interactions. Research aimed at understanding how hosts mount immune defenses against viruses and how viruses evade those immune defenses relies on host/virus pairs that have evolved together overtime, thus necessitating a need for a DNA virus model system for Drosophila with a virus that naturally infects the host. The Drosophila innubila Nudivirus (DiNV) is an emerging model system poised to take on the role as the DNA virus model for Drosophila. In this paper we describe the development of the DiNV model system with animal and cellular resources. We describe the development of new Drosophila cell lines, virus titration assays, anti-nucleocapsid antibodies, and injection-based DiNV infections in Drosophila innubila. We find that D. innubila cells can be used to grow DiNV for use in further experiments, and that DiNV is highly virulent when injected into adult D. innubila. The resources we have developed enable substantial future research on the DiNV-D. innubila system.

3. Impact statementDNA viruses are the cause of several important and challenging human diseases including hepatitis B, mononucleosis, respiratory disease, gastroenteritis, herpes and chickenpox. Recently there has even been a resurgence of many viral infections due to decreasing rates of vaccination, so to develop better therapeutics and intervention strategies, we must better understand the dynamics of how hosts and DNA viruses interact. The development of a natural DNA virus model in Drosophila creates the opportunity to better understand host/DNA virus interaction.

"Cleaner fish engage in mutualistic interactions by removing ectoparasites from client species, a behaviour that has traditionally been quantified through labour-intensive manual video analysis. This method is not only time-consuming but also susceptible to human error and bias. In this study, we developed a semi-automated system to track and classify cleaning interactions between the cleaner wrasse (Labroides dimidiatus) and the powder blue tang (Acanthurus leucosternon) in a controlled three-dimensional laboratory setting. We employed DeepLabCut (DLC), a deep learning-based tool for markerless pose estimation, to track both fish species simultaneously. The resulting model reliably tracked both individuals with low error rates. Using the tracking data, we designed a classification algorithm that detected cleaning interactions with 90% accuracy. Although the algorithm misclassified approximately 15% of non-interactions as interactions, it successfully identified 25% of video content as containing interactions, thereby reducing the amount of footage requiring manual annotation by 75%. This approach significantly decreases human labour while maintaining high classification performance. Overall, our system represents a valuable step toward automating behavioural analysis in marine mutualisms and can serve as a foundation for broader applications in ethology and conservation research."
"Protein sequence alignments are essential for identifying proteins shared structural and functional features. Detecting short amino acid sequences, termed patterns, across lung cancer and other related datasets facilitates the identification of relevant features. This study builds on previous findings by exploring proteins that share common patterns already identified. Using sequence matching at 5% and 10% occurrence thresholds, we identified 2,368 and 47 patterns, respectively. To reduce complexity and refine the dataset, shorter patterns from the 10% occurrence streamlined the analysis by isolating highly relevant patterns while reducing redundancy among proteins sharing sequence segments. Subsequent analyses integrated structural predictions for protein folding comparison, enabling the detection of patterns in different proteins and the identification of potential key residues. During cavity detection prediction, some amino acids were inspected in detail to assess their impact on protein function and their relevance in drug-target interactions. These insights were considered during docking studies, focusing on proteins used in treatments with pre-described ligands. By connecting raw sequence data to folding structures and functional features, we identified critical protein cavities that underscore the role of mutations in altering protein behavior and influencing drug-target interactions. These findings highlight protein activitys structural foundations and their importance in understanding cancer biology. By uncovering conserved sequence patterns and their structural implications, this study provides insights into potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets, that could aid in developing more effective cancer treatments."
"Phages and bacteria are locked in a molecular arms race, with phage anti-defence proteins (ADPs) enabling them to evade bacterial immune systems. To streamline access to information on ADPs, we developed the Encyclopaedia of Viral Anti-DefencE Systems (EVADES), an online resource containing sequences, structures, protein family annotations, and mechanisms of action (MoA) for 257 ADPs. Through computational structural analysis we established putative MoAs for 21 uncharacterised ADPs. We demonstrate the utility of EVADES by exploring three hypotheses and demonstrate that: (i) ADPs acting as DNA mimics exhibit broad-spectrum activity against defences; (ii) protein sharing across defence systems enables multi-defence inhibitory activity of ADPs; and (iii) eukaryotic dsDNA viruses encode ADP homologs, suggesting conserved immune evasion strategies across domains. These results highlight the broader relevance of phage ADPs in understanding interactions between prokaryotic or eukaryotic viruses and their hosts. EVADES is freely accessible at https://www.ebi.ac.uk/finn-srv/evades.

"Individual recognition is fundamental to the social behaviour of many animals. In high-density populations, animals encounter and compete with conspecific rivals more frequently, which should enhance the individuality of their signals to facilitate recognition among neighbours. We investigated vocal individuality in male territorial calls of two populations of little owls (Athene noctua) with different densities. Further, to explore the potential influence of local population distribution on individuality, we also examined isolated males without neighbours and clumped males with neighbours. Our findings indicate higher individuality at higher densities across both scenarios, measured using two individuality metrics: Beechers information statistic and Discrimination score. Additionally, clumped males exhibited significantly lower acoustic niche overlaps compared to isolated males, suggesting that the immediate social environment might be more influential than larger-scale population density patterns. This study is the first to demonstrate that vocal individuality in a territorial species is influenced by conspecific density, similar to findings in group-living and colonial species."
"Animals often balance asocial and social information strategically, adjusting when and from whom they copy based on context. Yet the cognition driving this dynamic--and its broader implications--remains poorly understood. Here, we show that nest-building zebra finches follow a copy-if-dissatisfied strategy, but only when social information aligns with recent experience: after observing a conspecific build a nest, males were more likely to choose the demonstrated  social material--particularly on their first choice--if they had previously used low-quality material. Using Bayesian cognitive modelling, we estimated how latent learning mechanisms underpinned males material choices, identifying two asocial and two social governing parameters. These parameters provide the first formal evidence for the cognitive basis of birds nest building. Forward simulations informed--but not prescripted--by these parameters approximated observed material-choice trajectories, supporting their causal role. Additional simulations targeting simplified real-world contexts showed that payoff structure--not (dis)satisfaction-- drove social material choice, though higher rewards did not proportionally boost its use, offering preliminary insights into the mechanisms underlying material-use variation more broadly. Our study illustrates how computational modelling can robustly link behaviour to underlying learning mechanisms and probe the generalisability of animal cognition--a rarity in this field."
"How brain networks and cognition co-evolve during development remains poorly understood. Using longitudinal data collected at baseline and Year 2 from 2,949 individuals (ages 8.9-13.5) in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, we show that baseline resting-state functional connectivity (FC) more strongly predicts future cognitive ability than concurrent cognitive ability. Models trained on baseline FC to predict baseline cognition generalize better to Year 2 data, suggesting that brain-cognition relationships strengthen over time. Intriguingly, baseline FC outperforms longitudinal FC change in predicting future cognitive ability. Differences in measurement reliability do not fully explain this discrepancy: although FC change is less reliable (intraclass correlation, ICC = 0.24) than baseline FC (ICC = 0.56), matching baseline FCs reliability by shortening scan time only partially narrows the predictive gap. Furthermore, neither baseline FC nor FC change meaningfully predicts longitudinal change in cognitive ability. We also identify converging and diverging predictive network features across cross-sectional and longitudinal models of brain-cognition relationships, revealing a multivariate twist on Simpsons paradox. Together, these findings suggest that during early adolescence, stable individual differences in brain functional network organization exert a stronger influence on future cognitive outcomes than short-term changes."

"Comprehensive single-neuron mapping is essential for understanding the brain connectome. However, focusing only on mapping the projections of neurons from a single brain region gives limited insight into the global organizational principles of brain connectivity. Here, we present a whole body-wide Common Physical Space (CPSv1.0) for larval zebrafish, integrating neuroanatomical parcellations, cytoarchitecture atlases of excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) neurons, and a dendrite-axon-annotated projectome comprising 12,219 E and 7,792 I neuronal morphologies ([~]25% of total E and I neurons). These neurons span all regions of the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral ganglia, forming 531 hierarchical morphotypes and generating weighted and directed inter-cell-type and inter-region connectomes. Projection and network analyses reveal structural divergence between E and I neurons, combinatory and modular projection rules, behavior-linked pathways, structured E and I connectivities, and multimodal sensorimotor hubs. Hosted on an open interactive platform, these digital atlases establish a scalable framework for multimodal neural data integration, offering insights into the global neural architecture across the whole central nervous system."
"Impulsivity is a multifaceted construct that typically increases during adolescence and is implicated in risk for substance use disorders that develop later in life. Here, we take a multivariate approach to identify latent dimensions of impulsivity, broadly defined, among youth enrolled in the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) study and explore associations with individual differences in demographics, substance-use initiation and canonical resting state networks (N=11,872, ages ~9-10). Using principal component analysis, we identified eight latent impulsivity dimensions, the top three of which together accounted for the majority of the variance across all impulsivity assessments. The first principal component (PC1) was a general impulsivity factor that mapped onto all impulsivity-related assessments. PC2 mapped onto a  mixed impulsivity style related to both poorer, less attentive performance on the SST and decreased delay discounting. PC3 linked externalizing behaviors across multiple measures with indices of delay discounting, making delay discounting the only impulsivity-related assessment to load on all three of the top PCs. Multiple impulsivity PCs were significantly associated with subsequent initiation of alcohol and cannabis use. Finally, we found both cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between the PCs and functional connectivity between and within frontoparietal, cingulo-opercular, and default mode networks. These data provide a critical empirical baseline for how facets of impulsivity covary in early adolescence which may be tracked through future waves of ABCD data, enabling longitudinal elucidation of how dimensions of impulsivity interact with other individual and environmental factors to influence risk for substance use later in life."
"The neural mechanisms underlying language processing involve a well-defined brain network, including mainly left perisylvian areas. Yet, the extent of individual variability remains largely unexplored, particularly in bilingual and multilingual contexts. Differences in linguistic profiles (e.g., age of acquisition, exposure, proficiency) provide an opportunity to assess how network topology is shaped by sociolinguistic factors. To address this, we developed NEUROLINGUA, a comprehensive database of functional and structural MRI data, enriched with sociodemographic, sociolinguistic, and behavioral information. It includes 725 healthy individuals aged 18-82 immersed in a Basque-Spanish multilingual environment, ranging from near-monolinguals to highly proficient multilinguals. Participants completed a functional MRI language localizer with both auditory and visual comprehension tasks, enabling cross-modal comparisons, as well as sentences involving arithmetic problem-solving. Exploratory analyses confirmed associations between structural MRI, sociodemographic, and cognitive measures. We demonstrate that NEUROLINGUAs functional MRI data localize the language comprehension network and thus capture linguistic profile effects. This integrative dataset offers an unparalleled resource to investigate factors influencing language network adaptability and variability in diverse sociolinguistic contexts."
"Neural crest (NC) cells are a transient, multipotent cell population that contributes to the formation of diverse tissues during vertebrate development. While numerous transcription factors and signalling pathways regulate NC specification and differentiation, the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in these processes remains underexplored.

In this study, we employed a double-transgenic zebrafish model (Tg(sox10:eGFP, sox10:mRFP)), in combination with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and RNA sequencing, to identify miRNAs enriched in NC cells and assess their role in the development of NC derivatives. Given the parallels between NC development and tumorigenesis, we focused on a subset of miRNAs previously implicated in cancer progression.

Functional assays revealed that overexpression of miR-133a and miR-338-3p resulted in significant craniofacial cartilage malformations and a reduction in melanophore numbers, correlating with the downregulation of key developmental genes, such as sox9b, sox10, and runx3. Reporter assays further demonstrated that miR-133a and miR-338-3p directly target the 3 untranslated region (3UTR) of sox9b, supporting their role in translational repression and mRNA degradation. Additionally, miR-338-3p overexpression increased the overall NC cell population, suggesting a regulatory function in cell proliferation.

These findings offer new insights into the molecular mechanisms governing NC development and highlight functional parallels between miRNA-mediated NC regulation and tumour biology. Given that miR-133a and miR-338-3p are known tumour suppressors, their roles in NC differentiation and proliferation may reflect conserved pathways underlying both embryogenesis and oncogenesis. This study enhances our understanding of miRNA function in vertebrate embryogenesis and underscores their potential relevance in neurocristopathies and NC-derived cancers."
"Standard QTL mapping approaches consider variant effects on a single gene at a time, despite abundant evidence for allelic pleiotropy, where a single variant can affect multiple genes simultaneously. While allelic pleiotropy describes variant effects on both local and distal genes or a mixture of molecular effects on a single gene, here we specifically investigate allelic expression ""proxitropy"": where a single variant influences the expression of multiple, neighboring genes. We introduce a multi-gene eQTL mapping framework--cis-principal component expression QTL (cis-pc eQTL or pcQTL)--to identify variants associated with shared axes of expression variation across a cluster of neighboring genes. We perform pcQTL mapping in 13 GTEx human tissues and discover novel loci undetected by single-gene approaches. In total, we identify an average of 1396 pcQTLs/tissue, 27% of which were not discovered by single-gene methods. These novel pcQTL colocalized with an additional 142 GWAS trait-associated variants and increased the number of colocalizations by 34% over single-gene QTL mapping. These findings highlight that moving beyond single-gene-at-a-time approaches toward multi-gene methods can offer a more comprehensive view of gene regulation and complex trait-associated variation."
"Speech production is supported by sensory-to-motor transformations to coordinate activity of the larynx and orofacial muscles. Here, we show that lesions to left temporal lobe areas involved in pitch processing cause reduced neural responses when repeating sentences and when humming piano melodies in a dorsal portion of the left precentral gyrus linked to laryngeal motor control. In contrast, lesions to left inferior parietal areas involved in somatosensory processing of speech cause reduced neural responses when repeating sentences but not when humming piano melodies in a ventral portion of the left precentral gyrus linked to orofacial motor control. Analyses in neurotypical participants converge in showing that the dorsal and ventral portions of the left precentral gyrus exhibit strong functional connectivity to left temporal and inferior parietal regions, respectively. These results provide causal lesion evidence that dissociable networks underlie distinct sensory-to-motor transformations supporting laryngeal and orofacial motor control for speech production."
"A single, acute traumatic experience can result in a host of negative impacts on behavior, such as increased violence, reduced sociability, and exaggerated fear responses. Despite the large body of research on the neurobiology of stress, we have a poor understanding of how trauma rewires social circuits in the brain. To identify how social circuits are re-organized by stress, we interrogated the role of the ventral hippocampus (VH), a key node for both the orchestration of emotionally-relevant behavior and the integration of sensory information. Using a footshock-based model of traumatic stress, we established that a single exposure to a series of unpredictable, inescapable footshocks was sufficient to negatively alter social behavior, resulting in increased violence and social hesitancy. Critically, we found that stress-induced changes to social behavior engaged neural ensembles in the VH, a critical node in the regulation of emotion states. Using a virally-mediated, activity-dependent cellular tagging approach to label two neural ensembles activated by temporally distinct experiences, we were surprised to find that stress-induced violence and stress-induced social hesitancy recruited largely non-overlapping populations of cells in the VH, in contrast to higher degrees of ensemble overlap in unstressed control mice, suggesting that stress biases the brain towards stronger differentiation of distinct social states. Additionally, we found that activity of VH neurons was required for stress-induced aggression. Finally, we found that stress-induced changes to social behaviors and VH activity profiles could be reversed by the introduction of social buffering post-stress. Collectively, our findings suggest that stress drives the VH to dissociably encode specific behavioral states, rather than a single state of negative valence, consistent with a role for multiple structures and distributed ensembles in the modulation of traumatic stress."
"In early human development, perceptual processes grow faster with maturation, as inferred using the duration of the attentional blink and multisensory integration window. The consequences of this developmental trend for sensory-cognition in fetuses are unclear: does the fetus perceive rapid stimuli as discrete events or, rather, one fused stimulus? We addressed this question using frequency tagging in two experiments with rapid auditory stimuli while neural responses were recorded in the third trimester with fetal magnetoencephalography (MEG). Our results are the first successful demonstration of frequency tagging in the fetal MEG amplitude spectrum and show that the fetal cortex generates separate neural responses to discrete auditory stimuli in both experiments, and similar results were also obtained when one experiment was repeated in newborns. While we cannot rule out perceptual fusion of rapid stimuli in higher-order association cortices, our results weaken the hypothesis that fetuses fuse rapid auditory stimuli into a single prolonged percept. Finally, our work points to frequency tagging analysis as a solution which avoids the uncertainties surrounding immature neural response latencies in time-domain analysis of fetal MEG."
"Ticks are vectors of many debilitating pathogens that are transmitted during blood meal acquisition. As both vector and pathogen species continue to emerge, there is a critical need for improved pathogen diagnostic and host remnant identification methods to develop interventions. Current pathogen detection methods are limited in their ability to subtype and detect emerging variants and non-vector borne ""look-alike"" diseases. Determination of tick blood meal sources is also an elusive step for understanding tick interactions with the biotic community in a given environment, with consequences for environmental management and disease prevention strategies. We have created an accessible hybridization capture next-generation sequencing panel called ""TICKHUNTER"" to improve molecular detection and subtyping of bacterial and parasitic pathogens in both clinical and tick samples. For disease ecology studies, the panel also detects host blood meal sources of interest. An alternative method for unbiased blood meal remnant analysis is also presented. We find that TICKHUNTER is a promising tool for effective and accurate detection of a variety of tick-borne pathogens, based on comparable linearity, limit of detection, sensitivity, and specificity to real-time PCR. Additionally, it can detect and characterize unexpected pathogens due to the large capacity for multiplexing and flexibility in variant detection."
"Essential genes are interesting in their own right and as potential antibiotic targets. To date, only one report has identified essential genes on a genome-wide scale in Clostridioides difficile, a problematic pathogen for which treatment options are limited. That foundational study used large-scale transposon mutagenesis to identify 404 protein-encoding genes as likely to be essential for vegetative growth of the epidemic strain R20291. Here, we revisit the essential genes of strain R20291 using a combination of CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) and transposon-sequencing (Tn-seq). First, we targeted 181 of the 404 putatively essential genes with CRISPRi. We confirmed essentiality for >90% of the targeted genes and observed morphological defects for >80% of them. Second, we conducted a new Tn-seq analysis, which identified 346 genes as essential, of which 283 are in common with the previous report and might be considered a provisional essential gene set that minimizes false positives. We compare the list of essential genes to those of other bacteria, especially Bacillus subtilis, highlighting some noteworthy differences. Finally, we used fusions to red fluorescent protein (RFP) to identify 18 putative new cell division proteins, three of which are conserved in Bacillota but of largely unknown function. Collectively, our findings provide new tools and insights that advance our understanding of C. difficile.

IMPORTANCEClostridioides difficile is an opportunistic pathogen for which better antibiotics are sorely needed. Most antibiotics target pathways that are essential for viability. Here we use saturation transposon mutagenesis and gene silencing with CRISPR interference to identify and characterize genes required for growth on laboratory media. Comparison to the model organism B. subtilis reveals many similarities and a few striking differences that warrant further study and may include opportunities for developing antibiotics that kill C. difficile without decimating the healthy microbiota needed to keep C. difficile in check."

"Caveolae are flask-shaped invaginations of the plasma membrane serving critical functions in mechano-protection and signal transduction. Caveolar dynamics, such as movement within the plasma membrane or endocytosis, relies on precise shaping of the highly curved caveolar necks. The dynamin-like EHD2 ATPase is proposed to form an oligomeric scaffold around the caveolar neck, but its detailed molecular action is poorly understood. Here, we employed cryo-electron tomography to elucidate structures of EHD2 filaments oligomerized on tubulated liposomes. EHD2 filaments form a highly curved membrane scaffold which stabilizes a sophisticated tubular membrane geometry with undulations along the tubes axis. An amino-terminal sequence facilitates this geometry by inserting into the membrane, thereby acting as a spacer between adjacent filaments. Moreover, in endothelial cells lacking EHD2, caveolar necks become narrower and elongated. Our structural work provides the molecular framework for understanding EHD2 scaffold formation and its cellular function in caveolar dynamics."
"Transglutaminase 2 (TG2) serves as a modifiable transamidating acyltransferase that precipitates calcium-induced protein alterations. The enzyme plays a crucial role in the cell and disease states, such as tissue repair, calcium signal transduction, celiac disease, and cancer. It is implicated in protein crosslinking and has been found in high concentrations in the small intestines of those with celiac disease. The function of TG2 hinges upon calcium ions binding to particular sites on the enzyme. In this study, we delve into the contribution of calcium-responsive transglutaminase 2 (TG2) in celiac disease, utilizing both molecular dynamics simulations and coarse-grained models, and investigate the impact of non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) on TG2. Molecular dynamics reveal prominent conformational differences between the open and closed conformations. In the coarse-grained model, key residues are found adjacent to the active site in the open conformation, while in the closed conformation, key residues are distant from the active site. We further explore the functional impact of non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) in TG2 using both sequence-based and structure-based computational tools. Through a consensus approach, we identify ten nsSNPs that are predicted to destabilize TG2 or alter its structural flexibility, with mutations such as R48H, E186Q, C277S, and E549G likely to influence active site accessibility and calcium coordination. The findings from this research enhances our understanding of the molecular processes underpinning celiac disease and helps facilitate innovative treatment approaches that target calcium-responsive TG2."
"FGFR3-TACC3 gene fusion drives a molecularly distinct subset of bladder cancer characterized by post-transcriptional immune evasion and metabolic rewiring. To elucidate the transcriptomic and regulatory consequences of this fusion, we performed an integrative analysis of mRNA and miRNA expression profiles in fusion-positive versus fusion-negative bladder tumors using TCGA-derived RNA-Seq and miRNA-Seq data. Fusion-positive tumors exhibited upregulation of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and ribosomal genes (e.g., COX5B, ATP5F1D, RPS15) and marked downregulation of immune regulatory genes (e.g., CD4, STAT3, IL6, CD86, PTPRC). Pathway enrichment revealed suppression of JAK/STAT, PD-L1 signaling, and cytokine networks, consistent with a fusion-driven immunosuppressive phenotype. We identified fusion-specific miRNA-mRNA regulatory interactions, including upregulated miRNAs (miR-1226-3p, miR-149-5p, miR-301b-3p) that target immune transcripts and downregulated miRNAs (miR-199b-5p, miR-214-3p) that normally suppress mitochondrial and ribosomal genes. In contrast, fusion-negative tumors displayed an immunoreactive signature marked by elevated IFNG, CXCL10, and IRF1 expression and downregulation of immune-suppressive miRNAs (miR-125a-5p, miR-23b-3p). Minimum free energy analysis and AlphaFold3-based AGO2-RISC docking confirmed structural feasibility of 3D duplex formation for 13 miRNA-target pairs, supporting active silencing complexes. Immune deconvolution revealed reduced infiltration of cytotoxic T cells, NK cells, and dendritic cells in fusion-positive tumors, while fusion-negative tumors showed robust immune cell presence. Key gene-immune cell correlations further confirmed differential immune architecture: SRC and CD4 were strongly linked to suppressed infiltration in fusion-positive tumors, while IFNG and CXCL10 positively correlated with T and NK cell abundance in fusion-negative cases. ROC analysis highlighted COMT, RPS15, and miR-187-3p as robust classifiers of fusion-positive tumors (AUC > 0.9), and CXCL10, CD74, and miR-142 for fusion-negative tumors. Connectivity Map analysis highlighted Lofexidine and Lenalidomide as candidate compounds predicted to reverse fusion-specific transcriptional programs. Collectively, our findings define immune suppression and metabolic reprogramming as core features of FGFR3-TACC3 fusion-positive bladder cancer and nominate fusion-specific miRNA-mRNA interactions as candidate biomarkers and therapeutic targets."
"Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling is a highly conserved pathway across multicellular organisms, playing a pivotal role in various cellular processes essential for development and tissue homeostasis. Aberrant activation of this pathway is a major driver of colorectal cancer (CRC). The transcription factor SP1 has been identified as a key component of the Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling pathway through its physical interaction with {beta}-catenin in colorectal cancer. However, the distinct roles played by this complex during development versus in disease contexts remain poorly understood. In this study, we conducted molecular and functional analyses by individually depleting SP1 and {beta}-catenin. Interestingly, genes co-regulated by the SP1:{beta}-catenin complex were significantly enriched for functions related to the cell cycle and DNA replication--key processes required for sustaining proliferation, whose disruption can promote tumorigenesis. These findings were further supported by data from mouse tumor models and clinical datasets. Additionally, cross-species analysis using zebrafish larvae revealed a synergistic interaction between SP1 and {beta}-catenin, leading to excessive cell proliferation and developmental defects. Collectively, our results suggest a conserved role for the SP1:{beta}-catenin complex in regulating cell proliferation during development and maintaining cellular homeostasis, processes critical for preventing cancer progression."
"Genome instability is a major force driving tumorigenesis. The ssDNA-binding protein complex CTC1-STN1-TEN1 (CST) plays a pivotal role in maintaining genome stability by countering replication stress, modulating DNA damage repair, and maintaining telomere integrity. Despite its well-documented role in genome maintenance, the involvement of CST in skin cancer development has yet to be investigated. We recently found that CST localizes at stalled DNA replication sites after UV exposure and may suppress the unwanted repriming activity, suggesting a potential role of CST in suppressing genome instability caused by UV damage. In this study, we first analyzed CST expression and alterations in cutaneous melanoma database and found that the CST genes are frequently altered in cutaneous melanoma and their expression is significantly downregulated in melanoma samples compared to normal tissues. We then generated a conditional knockout (cKO) mouse model with STN1 deficiency specifically in melanocytes to investigate its role in skin cancer formation. Upon chronic exposure to UV irradiation, STN1-deficient mice exhibit no obvious difference in melanoma incidence compared to control littermates, suggesting that STN1 downregulation in mature melanocytes has no significant effect on UV-induced skin cancer development in lab mice."
"LIMD1 (LIM domains containing 1) is a bona-fide tumour suppressor gene frequently lost during the early stages of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) development, resulting in a worse outcome for LIMD1-deficient patients. LIMD1 deficiency is present in approximately 50% of NSCLC cases, representing at least 21,000 patients in the United Kingdom and 1.2 million worldwide. During cancer progression, cells can accumulate genetic changes that render them more dependent on certain genes for their survival. By performing CRISPR-Cas9 dropout screens, we identified GPX4 as a novel vulnerability in LIMD1 deficient LUAD cells. By targeting GPX4 using RNA interference (RNAi) and pharmacological intervention in our isogenic LUAD lines along with a non-transformed lung cell line, we validated GPX4 as a novel dependency in LIMD1 deficient cells. GPX4 is a key defence mechanism against ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death. This state of increased ferroptosis susceptibility upon LIMD1 loss is due to increased basal reactive oxygen species levels and lipid peroxidation. Importantly, targeting GPX4 with ferroptosis inducing agents in NSCLC patients with LIMD1 loss may represent a novel therapeutic strategy."
"Pericytes undergo phenotypic alterations that influence cancer progression, yet the molecular mechanisms governing these changes remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated the role of Notch3 signaling in pericyte phenotype and functions in colorectal cancer (CRC). Using lineage tracing approaches, we showed that tumor pericytes originate from normal tissue-resident pericytes, which proliferate inside tumors. In vivo genetic manipulation revealed that Notch3 pathway activation promotes pericyte proliferation, while suppressing contractile protein expression, and leads to increased endothelial cell proliferation. In contrast, Notch3 deletion leads to reduced endothelial proliferation and a significant decrease in. This effect is associated with a shift toward a contractile phenotype. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis uncovered significant pericyte heterogeneity in both mouse colitis-associated cancer and human CRC. It specifically identified functionally distinct subpopulations characterized by differential Notch3 activity, which supported our in vivo and in vitro findings. Our results establish Notch3 as a key regulator of pericyte phenotypic plasticity in CRC and suggest that targeting this pathway could represent a promising strategy for improving therapeutic outcomes through vascular normalization."
"Prostate cancer cells exhibit heightened transcriptional activity to sustain their aggressive phenotype, yet this creates DNA topological stress, leading to RNA: DNA hybrids (R-loops) and DNA damage that compromise genomic stability. LSH, an SNF2-family chromatin remodeler, is frequently dysregulated in cancers and linked to tumor progression, but its mechanistic role in genome maintenance remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that LSH resolves R-loops in an ATP-dependent manner, mitigating transcription- replication (TR) conflicts in prostate cancer cells. LSH depletion caused R- loop accumulation due to reduced FANCD2 recruitment, exacerbating DNA damage and impairing Rad51 filament formation. Strikingly, LSH deficiency also increased R-loops at promoters of MYC and E2F target genes, stalling RNA polymerase II elongation and disrupting transcriptional programs critical for proliferation. Our findings reveal LSH is a key guardian of genome integrity, resolving R-loops to prevent TR conflicts and maintaining DNA repair fidelity. By linking LSH to R-loop resolution and transcriptional regulation, this study reveals its dual role in prostate cancer pathogenesis-- supporting malignant proliferation while safeguarding genomic stability. These insights nominate LSH as a potential therapeutic target to disrupt oncogenic transcription and induce synthetic lethality in prostate cancer."
"MotivationStudies on bulk RNA-seq of tumor biopsies can yield incorrect results because varying proportions of non-tumor tissues in the samples obscure the true signal and impact the accuracy of survival and differential expression analyses. Single-cell sequencing avoids these problems, but is still too expensive in clinical settings. Other deconvolution algorithms extract tissue-specific gene expression profiles from bulk sequencing, but cannot do this on a per-sample basis.

ResultsWe introduce SSCD - sample specific compartment deconvolution. SSCD extends non-negative matrix factorization with per-sample, per-gene constraint optimization. On simulated data, SSCD shows improvements in accuracy over existing methods. Using several real cancer datasets, we show that SSCD refines Differential Expression and survival analyses.

"Uveal melanoma (UM) is a highly aggressive intraocular malignancy with limited therapeutic options for metastatic disease. Existing transgenic UM mouse models inadequately recapitulate human disease progression, while transplant models lack immune competence for studying the tumor immune microenvironment and therapeutic interventions. To address these limitations, we developed a genetically engineered mouse model incorporating stepwise genetic alterations implicated in human UM progression. Spatiotemporally controlled expression of mutant GNAQQ209L from the endogenous locus induced choroidal nevi with limited penetrance. Concomitant BAP1 deletion enhanced nevus formation, while further MYC activation led to fully penetrant intraocular tumors with metastatic potential. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed malignant cells segregated into Melanocytic and Neural Crest-like subpopulations characterized by distinct transcriptional and biosynthetic programs. Trajectory analyses inferred dedifferentiation from the Melanocytic toward the Neural Crest-like state during tumor progression. Comparison to human UM revealed commonalities with highly aggressive Class 2 UM, including gene expression signatures and copy number gains affecting genes that map to human chromosome 8q beyond the activated MYC allele, suggesting cooperative effects of multiple drivers in this chromosomal region. The tumor microenvironment featured immunosuppressive macrophage populations and exhausted T cells, closely resembling human UM. This physiologically relevant, immune-competent model provides a platform for investigating UM biology, functionally characterizing candidate driver genes, and developing immune-based therapeutic strategies.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTWe developed a mouse model that resembles the genetic progression and phenotypic plasticity of human UM. This spatially controlled model confirms the critical role of driver mutations in GNAQ and BAP1, proposes MYC as a promoter of malignant transformation in coordination with other chromosome 8q genes, and reveals UM progression through distinct cellular states. This model offers an urgently needed preclinical platform for understanding the immunogenomics of UM and for testing immune and targeted treatments for this lethal cancer."
"A poorly studied mechanism suggests that growth is characterized by the expression of TATA-less genes under favorable conditions, while stress induces TATA-containing genes involved in stress responses. The role of this mechanism in cancer remains unclear. This study analyzes the presence of TATA boxes in gene expression data from bladder cancer (BC) cells undergoing ferroptosis (siUSP52 cells), a form of programmed cell death. We hypothesize that growth-related genes (TATA-less) are underrepresented in siUSP52 cells. We found a high prevalence of TATA-less genes in siUSP52 cells (62 of 90 differentially expressed), suggesting that BC promotes growth despite ferroptosis activation."
"Ovarian cancer is the deadliest gynaecological cancer and the fourth leading cause of cancer deaths in women. High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) accounts for 75% of cases, and chemotherapy resistance and relapse occur in 85% of patients, leading to a 5-year survival of 45%. Currently, the literature lacks comprehensive immunobiological models of HGSOC, and developing such models could provide critical insights into the diseases underlying mechanisms and interactions within the tumour microenvironment. We address this by constructing an immunobiological model using delay differential equations and then optimise chemotherapy regimens to maximise efficacy, minimise toxicity, and improve treatment efficiency for first-line treatment. The model consists of two compartments, the tumour site and tumour-draining lymph node, with immune processes such as DC maturation, T cell priming and proliferation, and cytokine interactions modelled. Parameter values are estimated using experimental data from ovarian cancer tissue samples as well as the TCGA OV database. The results indicate that low-dose dose more frequent chemotherapy provides comparable results to the standard regimen with a lower toxicity, and alternative dosing strategies with rest weeks can allow patients to recover from the toxic side effects of chemotherapy."

"BackgroundEpidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) family signaling is commonly dysregulated in cancer by amplification or activating mutations. We investigated the incidence of EGFR amplification with or without PI3Kinase pathway mutations in breast cancer and whether patients with genetic abnormalities in both pathways can be targeted by dual EGFR/PI3K inhibition.

MethodsEGFR amplification and PI3K pathway mutations were studied through data sets from cBioPortal and Caris. We used the triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines BT20 (amplified EGFR, PIK3CA activating mutation), MDA-MB-468 (amplified EGFR, PTEN deletion), and MDA-MB-231 (no amplification of EGFR or PI3K pathway mutations). EGFR amplification was determined by immunoblot and fluorescent in situ hybridization, and PI3K mutations by sequencing. Signaling was determined by immunoblot, drug synergy by cell viability, cell death by propidium iodide staining, cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry, and animal studies through xenografts.

ResultsEGFR amplification is found in approximately 1-2.5% of breast cancer patients, more frequently in TNBC (2.45-6.7%) and ER-/HER2+ (1.3-6.5%) breast cancers, and in the molecular basal (2.33-8.1%) and HER2 enriched (1.87-5.4%) subtypes. Overall survival is shorter among patients compared to those with unamplified EGFR. Up to 71% of EGFR amplified tumors have activating mutations in the PI3K pathway. Combination of EGFR and PI3K inhibitors more dramatically reduced mTOR and AKT signaling in the BT20 and MDA-MB-468 cells, whereas the inhibition of downstream signaling was less significant in MDA-MB-231 cells. Combination of EGFR and PI3K inhibitors reduced cell viability in these three cell lines, but inhibition was greater, statistically significant, and synergistic in MDA-MB-468 and BT20 compared to MDA-MB-231. Only MDA-MB-468 and BT20 cells had an increased fraction of apoptotic cells. EGFR or PI3K inhibition alone in a BT20 xenograft model reduced tumor volume, however the combination was the only statistically significant reduction in tumor volume when compared to vehicle control.

ConclusionsEGFR/PI3K inhibitor combination causes apoptosis and reduction in tumor growth in cells with EGFR amplification and PI3K alteration. Dual inhibition of EGFR/PI3K presents as a potential targeted therapy in patients with EGFR amplification and aberrant PI3K signaling."
"Live-cell imaging (LCI) of modified T cells co-cultured with cancer cells is commonly used to quantify T cell anti-cancer function. Videos captured by LCI show complex multi-cell behavioral phenotypes that go beyond simple cancer cell fluorescence measurements. Here, we develop an unsupervised analysis workflow to characterize LCI data generated using the Incucyte imaging platform. Unlike most LCI analyses, we avoid cell segmentation due to the low spatiotemporal resolution of the LCI videos and high levels of cell-cell contact. Instead, we develop methods that identify global aggregation patterns and local cellular keypoints to characterize the multicellular interactions that determine cancer cell sensitivity to, or escape from, T cell surveillance. We demonstrate our segmentation-free live-cell behavioral analysis (SF-LCBA) methods on TCR T cells from four donors with varying proportions of cells with a beneficial RASA2 knockout and effector-to-target initial concentrations in a co-culture with A375 melanoma cells. We find that different T cell modifications affect the spatiotemporal dynamics of multicellular aggregate formation. In particular, we show that fewer and smaller cancer cell aggregates form at high ratios of effector T cells to target cancer cells and high titrations of T cells with RASA2 knockouts. Our SF-LCBA method identifies, characterizes, and tracks cellular aggregate formation in datasets that are unsuitable for cell segmentation and tracking, opening the door to more therapeutically-relevant measurements of modified T cell therapy cell behavioral phenotypes from LCI data."
"RET gene rearrangements yield oncogenic fusion proteins that drive a subset of lung adenocarcinomas (LUAD). The tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) selpercatinib and pralsetinib are approved therapies for RET+ lung cancers and have markedly improved clinical outcomes in these patients, but acquired resistance remains a hurdle to their durable management. Using a recently developed murine model of RET+ lung cancer driven by a Trim24-Ret fusion protein, two Trim24-Ret cell lines (TR.1 and TR.2) were established. Orthotopic lung tumors generated by transplantation of these cell lines initially respond to selpercatinib followed by prompt progression within [~]3 weeks of initiating TKI treatment. Cell lines derived from the selpercatinib-resistant TR.1 and TR.2 tumors exhibited in vitro sensitivity to MET and ERBB-targeted TKIs, indicating acquired bypass signaling through these receptor tyrosine kinases. Moreover, the selpercatinib-resistant TR.1 and TR.2 cell lines exhibited increased sensitivity to MEK and PTPN11 inhibitors relative to the parental cell lines, indicating a greater dependence on MAPK pathway signaling. The TKI-resistant cell lines showed no evidence for MET gene amplification, but exhibited varied induction of multiple genes that function within MET and ERBB2:ERBB4 interaction networks including ligands (HGF, NRG1), adaptors (GAB1) and co-receptors (NRP1). Consistent with an important role for MET signaling in driving acquired selpercatinib resistance, mice bearing orthotopic lung tumors derived from TR.1 or TR.2 cells that had progressed on selpercatinib treatment underwent significant re-shrinkage upon co-treatment with the MET inhibitor, crizotinib, although progression re-occurred. By contrast, upfront treatment with selpercatinib and crizotinib in orthotopic tumors yielded complete elimination of 78% of TR.1 tumors and a prolonged duration of response in TR.2 tumors. The findings highlight the failings inherent in treating acquired resistance mechanisms at progression and the potential therapeutic impact of predicting and targeting dominant mechanisms of resistance prior to or early after initiating oncogene-targeting TKI treatment in RTK-driven LUAD."
"The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is central to the control of cellular metabolism and cell growth. However, pharmacological inhibition of the pathway is not uniformly effective across cancer types, or even within a single tumour. In this study, we leverage oblique plane microscopy (OPM) of breast cancer organoids containing molecular biosensors and lineage tracing approaches to uncover a source of heterogeneity in response to AKT inhibition. We find that organoids expressing KRT14, a marker of basal cells in the normal breast epithelium, are resistant to AKT inhibition. Furthermore, the master transcription factor of basal cell state, {Delta}Np63, is sufficient to confer resistance to AKT kinase inhibition in human triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) organoids. Our studies indicate that cells can transition between cell states within four weeks. This property means that AKT inhibition only delays tumour growth, with fully resistant tumours rich in KRT14+ cells resulting. Thus, resistance to AKT inhibition in TNBC exploits a repertoire of cell states and switching mechanisms inherent to the biology of the breast."
"Tumor neoantigens play a pivotal role in immunotherapy through eliciting tumor-specific immune responses. However, their clinical application is limited by the restricted repertoire of naturally occurring neoantigens, which undergoes continuous immune editing within the tumor microenvironment. To address this critical challenge, we explored translational regulation as a reversible and safer strategy to augment neoantigen production. Through systematic analysis of translational regulatory factors associated with immunotherapy response, we identified METTL5 as a key modulator of anti-tumor immunity. METTL5 depletion in syngeneic tumor models demonstrated significant enhancement of endogenous anti-tumor immunity across distinct MHC-I haplotypes, with synergistic effects observed when combined with immune checkpoint blockade. Based on evolutionary conservation of ribosomal decoding center modifications and established mechanisms from prokaryotic studies, we propose that METTL5-mediated m6A modification at the small ribosomal subunit decoding center may contribute to translational fidelity regulation. Mechanistically, integrated MHC-I immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry and ribosome profiling revealed the identification of non-canonical peptides, including those derived from novel unannotated open reading frames (nuORFs), which provide previously absent neoantigen sources for tumor cells. T-cell receptor sequencing further demonstrated significantly enhanced clonal diversity and tumor-specific reactivity of infiltrating T cells in METTL5-deficient tumors. Therapeutic vaccination strategies targeting METTL5-deficiency-induced neoantigens, including both peptide-based and mRNA vaccines, exhibited partial anti-tumor efficacy in murine tumor models. This study establishes METTL5 as a critical translational regulator that restricts neoantigen diversity and proposes a novel combinatorial strategy to enhance immunotherapy through translational control."
"Breast cancer (BC) remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality among women globally. Precise subtyping of BC is critical for optimizing treatment strategies. This study explored the capacity of bulk RNA- seq data to improve breast cancer characterization by analysis of complete expression profiles. We analyzed RNA-seq 274 tumor samples and six healthy tissue samples from diverse geographical origins. Using over 9,800 SNPs directly genotyped from RNA-seq data, we successfully predicted broad genetic ancestry, identifying European, African, Asian, South Asian, and Admixed American origins. Molecular subtyping through PAM50 showed ambiguous classifications for about half of the samples, underscoring the limitations of current molecular diagnostic tools. Unsupervised clustering separated tumors in three main clusters. Cluster C1 demonstrated immune activation and inflammatory response pathways, while C2 highlighted metabolic and immune interaction processes. Cluster C3 exhibited enriched metabolic regulation and adipokine signaling pathways. In silico drug sensitivity analysis identified potential therapeutic strategies, including vinorelbine and AZD6482, with cluster-specific efficacy. Our findings emphasize the integration of ancestry-informed data and complete transcriptomic profiles to redefine BC subtyping. These insights offer a foundation for more equitable, ancestry-informed therapeutic strategies and highlight the importance of diversity in cancer research."
"Pancreatic cancer patients have the highest rates and most severe forms of cancer cachexia, yet cachexia etiologies remain largely elusive, leading to a lack of effective intervening therapies. PTHrP has been clinically implicated as a putative regulator of cachexia, with serum PTHrP levels correlating with increased weight loss in PDAC patients. Here we show that cachectic PDAC patients have high expression of tumor PTHrP and use a genetically engineered mouse model to functionally demonstrate that deletion of Pthlh (encoding the PTHrP protein) blocks cachectic wasting, dramatically extending overall survival. The re-expression of PTHrP in lowly cachectic models is sufficient to induce wasting and reduce survival in mice, which is reversed by the conditional deletion of the PTHrP receptor, Pth1r, in adipocytes. Mechanistically, tumor-derived PTHrP suppresses de novo lipogenesis in adipocytes, leading to a molecular rewiring of adipose depots to promote wasting in the cachectic state. Finally, the pharmacological disruption of the PTHrP-PTH1R signaling axis abrogates wasting, highlighting that a targeted disruption of tumor-adipose crosstalk is an effective means to limit cachexia.

STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEPancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the prototypical cancer type associated with cancer cachexia, a debilitating wasting syndrome marked by adipose tissue loss and muscle atrophy. Herein, we establish that PTHrP is a tumor-derived factor that facilitates cachexia by downregulating de novo lipogenesis in adipocytes and that blocking PTHrP is an effective means to limit wasting in preclinical mouse models."
"Heterogeneity in cancer gene expression is typically linked to genetic and epigenetic alterations, yet post-transcriptional regulation likely influences these patterns as well. However, the quantitative contribution of post-transcriptional mechanisms to cancer transcriptome dynamics remains unclear. Here, we systematically measured mRNA dynamics across diverse breast cancer models, revealing that mRNA stability significantly shapes gene expression variability. To decipher the regulatory grammar underlying these dynamics, we developed GreyHound, an interpretable multimodal deep-learning framework integrating RNA sequence features and RNA-binding protein (RBP) expression. GreyHound identified an extensive network of RBPs and their regulons underlying variations in mRNA stability. Among these, we uncovered a metastasis-suppressive regulatory axis centered on the RNA-binding protein RBMS3 and its post-transcriptional control of the redox regulator TXNIP. Functional and molecular analyses revealed that RBMS3 depletion resulted in targeted transcript destabilization, which was associated with poor clinical outcomes and enhanced metastatic potential in xenograft models. Using in vivo epistasis studies, we confirmed that RBMS3 regulation of TXNIP mRNA stability drives this metastasis-suppressive program. These findings position the RBMS3-TXNIP regulatory axis as a key post-transcriptional mechanism in breast cancer and illustrate how interpretable models of RNA dynamics can uncover hidden regulatory programs in disease."
"High rates of heart failure (HF) morbidity and mortality have made targeting myocardial remodeling--particularly hypertrophy and fibrosis--a key therapeutic focus. RhoA, which regulates cytoskeletal reorganization and cell migration, plays a role in this process. However, RhoA has long been considered ""undruggable"", due to its strong binding to its endogenous substrates, GDP/GTP, and the lack of well-defined pockets for drug targeting. Here, we discovered a cryptic pocket proximate to GDP within RhoA and identified a natural product, AH001, binds here and interacts with GDP, stabilizing RhoAs interaction with its endogenous inhibitor, RhoGDI. AH001 reduced the downstream MRTFA nuclear translocation and downregulated fibrosis/hypertrophy proteins. Consequently, AH001 mitigated myocardial remodeling in multiple HF animal models, and in the 3D myocardial tissue model. Our findings highlight the therapeutic potential of inhibiting RhoA activation in myocardial remodeling, ultimately targeting HF, and offer a promising avenue for developing reversible inhibitors against undruggable GTPases."
"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized transcriptomic research, enabling the creation of detailed tissue, organ, and species-level atlases for model organisms. In Hydractinia, a cnidarian model for stem cell and regeneration studies, recent atlases have revealed key insights into cell types and developmental processes. However, these atlases remain limited in cell numbers and transcriptomic depth and cell type assignments were largely made in silico. Here, we present an updated Hydractinia single-cell atlas by integrating new datasets from fixed cells with previously published live-cell data. This expanded atlas captures over 47,000 cells from feeding polyps and stolon tissue, recovering and refining major somatic cell lineages including cnidocytes, neurons, gland cells, epithelial cells, and stem cells (i-cells), as well as identifying a novel population of putative immune cells. We investigated the spatial expression patterns of selected marker genes and validated all major cell types and several cell states. Our analyses uncovered a previously undescribed neural subtype, two spatially distinct gland cell populations, a stolon-specific cell type, and a putative immune cell cluster. Additionally, we recovered and explored a complete Hydractinia cnidocyte trajectory with two distinct endpoints, supported by spatial marker gene expression that reflects the developmental progression of cnidoblasts as they mature and migrate towards the tentacles. Subclustering of somatic i-cells revealed putative progenitor states and a potential population of true stem cells. Together, this atlas significantly advances our understanding of Hydractinia cellular diversity and dynamics, allowing us to generate new hypotheses and provide a valuable resource for the cnidarian research community and beyond."
"Epigenetic inheritance is generally less stable across generations than DNA sequence-based heredity. One common form of epigenetic inheritance, found in plants, fungi, and animals, is the transgenerational memory of gene silencing mediated by small RNAs. These small RNAs can be amplified through RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, thus maintaining the silenced state across multiple generations. Such molecular mechanisms raise questions regarding their natural variation and evolutionary impact. We here ask whether the presence and duration of epigenetic inheritance display genetic variation within a species. We use the ability of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to silence genes for multiple generations after an initial RNA interference trigger. We find that the presence and the duration of silencing in number of generations differ across C. elegans wild strains. Strikingly, several wild strains show no memory, while some display a longer memory than the reference strain. Natural DNA sequence polymorphisms, such as in the set-24 and drh-1 genes, affect epigenetic memory of an external trigger, demonstrating that intraspecific DNA sequence evolution affects the duration of epigenetic inheritance. We further show that the duration of silencing memory in wild strains is quite robust to environmental variation such as diet and passage through larval diapauses, but not to temperature variation. Altogether, these results demonstrate intraspecific diversity in the regulation of small RNA-based heredity, a prerequisite for selection acting on genetic variants affecting epigenetic inheritance duration."
"The role of extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) in lung cancer, particularly in subjects who never smoked (LCINS), remains unclear. Examination of 1,216 whole-genome-sequenced lung cancers identified ecDNA in 18.9% of patients. Enrichment of MDM2 and other oncogenes amplification via ecDNA possibly drives a LCINS subset. Tumors harboring ecDNA or other focal amplifications showed similarly poor survival. A strong association with whole-genome doubling suggests most ecDNA reflects genomic instability in treatment-naive lung cancer."
"Persistent infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) is the primary cause of cervical cancer worldwide. Notably, women co-infected with HPV and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) have a six-fold higher lifetime risk of developing cervical cancer compared to those without HIV, even when adhering to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and achieving T-cell reconstitution. While chronic HIV-1 infection is known to cause inflammation, how paracrine signals from immune cells alter signaling in cervical cells remain poorly understood. To address this, we conducted global transcriptomics analysis on cervical swabs from Kenyan women with HPV, stratified by HIV-1 and cancer status. Strikingly, women with HIV-1 showed cancer-like gene expression patterns in non-cancerous cervical epithelial cells. Complementary global mass spectrometry (MS) proteomics of cervical cells exposed to the secretome of HIV-1 infected primary CD4+ T-cells revealed altered expression of proteins in MAPK, PI3K-AKT, and {beta}-catenin signaling pathways. Integrative network analyses of transcriptomic and proteomic datasets revealed that HIV-1 altered gene expression in key pathways known to drive cervical cancer, including genes commonly mutated in HIV-1-naive disease. Notably, IRS-1, a key PI3K-AKT pathway activator, was found to be consistently upregulated in both participant samples and cell culture models, as were interferon-stimulated genes. Phosphoproteomics MS analysis confirmed PI3K-AKT pathway activation in cervical cells exposed to conditioned media from HIV-1-infected T-cells. Together, our findings uncover how HIV-1 reshapes cervical cell signaling via paracrine mechanisms and highlights the PI3K pathway as a potential therapeutic target in HIV-associated cervical cancer."
"Stomatal responses to atmospheric conditions are critical for balancing plant CO2 gain with water loss. Yet, the question of whether stomata respond directly to humidity or to the rate of water loss (transpiration) remains unresolved due to the tight coupling between these variables. To decouple them, we manipulated water vapor diffusivity using Helox (21% O2, 79% He), where vapor diffuses 2.33 times faster than in air, and Argox (21% O2, 79% Ar), where it diffuses 0.75 times slower. This allows control of VPD and transpiration independent of one another while maintaining a constant leaf temperature. We investigated the stomatal conductance (gsw) responses to air and Helox in several plant species, including Solanum lycopersicum, Vitis vinifera, and the fern Nephrolepis exaltata. In addition, we tested the Commelina communis, with coupled gas exchange and real-time imaging of stomatal aperture in intact leaves. In all angiosperms tested, we observed that stomatal closing was triggered exclusively by reductions in RH rather than by transpiration increases. When transpiration increased, but relative humidity remained constant, we detected an increase in gsw without a following decrease in the experimental time span. Exposure to Argox without altering RH reduced transpiration, likely enabling restoration of epidermal turgor and inducing passive mechanical closure. However, the rate of stomatal closure under reduced RH was 2.35 times faster than that observed under Argox, suggesting that passive turgor-driven responses cannot fully explain the kinetics or extent of closure under dry air. This work provides direct experimental evidence for humidity-driven stomatal closure."
"Dopamine (DA) neurons of the substantia nigra (SN) are essential for motor control and selectively degenerate in Parkinsons disease (PD). However, DA neurons are molecularly heterogeneous, with some showing greater vulnerability and others resilience. Here, we show that the DA subtype marker Anxa1, identified in mice, labels PD-vulnerable DA neurons in human SN. Using mice, we found that excitatory inputs from subthalamic (STN) and pedunculopontine (PPN) nuclei evoked frequency-dependent excitation in SN GABA neurons, but complex multiphasic DA neuron responses, suggesting heterogeneous DA subtype responses. Indeed, excitatory inputs evoked differential DA responses in striatal subregions, an increase in caudal striatum, but inhibition followed by rebound in dorsolateral striatum. Additionally, PD-resilient Vglut2+ DA neurons were excited by STN/PPN input, while vulnerable Anxa1+ DA neurons were inhibited. These findings demonstrate that DA subtypes are embedded in distinct functional networks, suggesting that some therapeutic interventions may differentially impact vulnerable and resilient DA subtypes."
"Mitochondria are trafficked along axons and provide the energy required for several intracellular mechanisms including molecular transport and local translation, which is believed to contribute to the homeostasis of the axonal compartment. Decline in mitochondria activity is one of the hallmarks of aging. It is still unclear, though, whether this decline corresponds to a concomitant reduction in the extent of axonal translation during aging. Using live cell imaging of sensory neurons, we found a significant decrease in the number of active mitochondria and the percentage of mitochondria localized to axons in aged mice compared to young mice. This decrease was mirrored by a loss of intracellular ATP as well as an ATP-dependent decrease in axoplasmic viscosity. In addition, the size of G3BP1 positive axonal granules and the number of FMRP axonal granules increased. Cumulatively, we found a functional decrease in the overall level of axonal translation in aged neurons. We were able to rescue this effect by increasing ATP synthesis, which induced a global decrease in axoplasmic viscosity, while promoting RNA granule solubilization and boosting axonal translation. Proteomic analysis of newly synthesized proteins in axons of aged vs young neurons revealed a dysregulation of pathways related to axonal biology and growth. We identified MAP1B and STAT3 as proteins whose axonal local synthesis was impaired in aged axons, and more notably show that this impairment could be rescued by increasing ATP synthesis. We believe that this research sheds light on axonal translation in aged neurons and its relationship with energy sources inside the axonal compartment, possibly presenting an opportunity for future therapeutics."
"While the respiratory rhythm is increasingly recognized as a key modulator of oscillatory brain activity across the wake-sleep cycle in humans, very little is known about its influence on aperiodic brain activity during sleep. This broadband activity indicates spontaneous fluctuations in excitation-inhibition (E:I) balance across vigilance states and has recently been shown to systematically covary across the respiratory cycle during waking resting state. We used simultaneous EEG and respiratory recordings over a full night of sleep collected from N = 23 healthy participants to unravel the nested dynamics of respiration phase-locked excitability states across the wake-sleep cycle. We demonstrate a prominent phase shift in the coupling of aperiodic brain activity to respiratory rhythms as participants were transitioning from wakefulness to sleep. Moreover, respiration-brain coupling became more consistent both across and within participants, as interindividual as well as intraindividual variability systematically lessened from wakefulness and the transition to sleep towards deeper sleep stages. Our results suggest that respiration phase-locked changes in E:I balance conceivably add to sleep stage-specific neural signatures of REM and NREM sleep, highlighting the complexity of brain-body coupling during sleep."
"Hawaiian picture-winged Drosophila are undergoing rapid biodiversity loss, with twelve species listed as endangered and others in decline. Gut microbiota are increasingly recognized as contributors to host adaptation that are capable of influencing stress tolerance, reproduction, and other fitness-related traits. We investigated the role of microbial communities in local adaptation using two populations of Drosophila basisetae from Hawaiian rainforests at 900 m and 1200 m elevation. Microbiome profiling of wild flies by high throughput amplicon sequencing revealed distinct bacterial and fungal communities between sites. Whole-genome resequencing of the two Drosophila populations identified weak but significant population genetic structure, with evidence of admixture and gene flow. Despite this connectivity, 16 outlier SNPs across 18 genes showed patterns consistent with divergent selection, suggesting localized adaptation. To test microbiome effects on host physiology experimentally, we conducted a fully factorial research design with microbiome inoculations in laboratory-reared flies acclimated to 18 {degrees}C (control) or 24 {degrees}C (stressful). Flies treated with low-elevation microbiota had higher survival across temperatures, whereas those treated with high-elevation microbiota produced more eggs, indicating microbiome-mediated differences in reproductive investment. Activity levels at 18 {degrees}C were higher when flies received microbiota from their native population. Measures of critical thermal maximum (CTmax) and male accessory gland size showed complex interactions among microbiome source, temperature, and fly population. These results indicate that microbes may modulate host thermal tolerance and reproduction in environmentally-dependent and population-specific ways. Our findings suggest that microbiome-host-environment interactions may contribute to both phenotypic plasticity and evolutionary adaptation to enhance resilience to environmental stress, with important implications for conservation in rapidly changing Hawaiian ecosystems.

Summary statementThis study demonstrates that microbiome composition influences thermal tolerance through alterations in survival and reproduction in the Hawaiian picture wing, Drosophila basisetae, potentially contributing to adaptive phenotypic changes between populations."
"Kompot is a statistical framework for holistic comparison of multi-condition single-cell datasets, supporting both differential abundance and differential expression. Differential abundance captures changes in how cells populate the phenotypic manifold across conditions, while differential expression identifies condition-specific changes in gene regulation that may be localized to particular regions of that manifold. Kompot models the distribution of cells and gene expression as continuous functions over a low-dimensional representation of cell states, enabling single-cell resolution inference with calibrated uncertainty estimates. Applying Kompot to aging murine bone marrow, we identified a continuum of shifts in hematopoietic stem cell and mature cell states, transcriptional remodeling of monocytes independent of compositional changes, and divergent regulation of oxidative stress response genes across cell types. By capturing both global and cell-state-specific effects of perturbation, Kompot reveals how aging reshapes cellular identity and regulatory programs across the hematopoietic landscape. This framework is broadly applicable to dissecting condition-specific effects in complex single-cell landscapes."

"Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are redox enzymes in the oxidative cleavage of recalcitrant polysaccharides, facilitating efficient biomass deconstruction for biofuel production. While computational annotation tools have accelerated LPMO discovery, the existing model is limited to the AA9 and AA10 families, leaving the broader diversity of LPMOs underexplored. In this study, we present an improved machine learning framework designed for classifying and annotating LPMOs across the eight families (AA9, AA10, AA11, AA13, AA14, AA15, AA16, and AA17). We curated a high-quality dataset by integrating sequences from GenBank, Joint Genome Institute, and the CAZy database, followed by data cleaning and redundancy reduction using CD-HIT, consisting of 33691 LPMO sequences. Feature extraction was performed using both Python (iFeature) and R-based pipelines, generating over 13,526 descriptors per sequence to capture compositional, physicochemical, and structural properties. Ensemble feature selection was used to identify the significant features for both binary and multiclass classification. An independent dataset was used to estimate the trained models performance. To address data imbalance, we maintained a 1:1 ratio for all positive and negative sets during both training and validation. A range of machine learning models were systematically trained and evaluated. The multiclass Bi-LSTM model demonstrated higher accuracy, robustness, and generalizability, outperforming traditional approaches. We compared the performance with dbCAN3, a CAZyme predictor. The final model was deployed as a user-friendly web server (https://predlpmo.in), enabling high-throughput, sequence-based functional annotation of LPMOs for the research community. This work bridges a critical gap in LPMO annotation, providing a scalable and reliable solution for enzyme discovery in bioenergy and industrial biotechnology."
"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) remains a principal cause of vision impairment worldwide, involved complex retinal cellular pathophysiology that remains incompletely understood. To elucidate cell-type-specific molecular signatures underlying DR, we generated a high-resolution single-cell transcriptomic atlas of 297,121 retinal cells from 20 Chinese donors, including non-diabetic controls (26.4%), diabetic without retinopathy (23.4%) and DR (50.2%). Following rigorous quality control, batch-effect correction, and clustering and annotation, 10 major retinal cell populations were delineated. Differential expression analyses across disease states within each cell type yielded candidate gene sets, which were further refined via a multi-stage machine-learning pipeline combining L1-regularized logistic regression and recursive feature elimination with cross-validation, alongside bootstrap stability selection. Resulting cell-type-specific classifiers achieved high accuracy (79-95%) and AUCs (0.85-0.99) in distinguishing DR disease states. Enrichment analyses implicated immune activation, oxidative stress, neurodegeneration and synaptic dysfunction pathways across multiple cell types in retina. Integrating 567 unique marker genes from all cell types, a general multilayer perceptron classifier achieved 95.31% overall accuracy on held-out test data, demonstrating the translational potential of these signatures for non-diabetic controls, diabetic without retinopathy and DR classification. This high-resolution atlas and the accompanying analytic framework provide a robust computational framework for biomarker discovery, mechanistic insight and targeted intervention strategies in diabetic retinal diseases."
"Protein liquid-liquid phase separation has recently been recognized as an essential process involved in cellular functions, including transcription, translation, and DNA damage repair. However, a further liquid-to-solid transition (LST) of condensates due to mutation or external stimuli can result in aggregation, sometimes pathological. The unique ability of protein condensates to concentrate and sequester biomolecules is at the heart of the regulatory mechanism, controlling the dynamics and function of the condensates. While the recruitment of essential biomolecules, such as RNA has been studied to have the impact to the condensate formation, how DNA partition can affect the phase behaviour and dynamics of protein condensates is not fully elucidated. In this study, we investigate both the short-term and long-term kinetics of double-stranded DNA partitioning into preformed fresh and aged FUS protein condensates. Confocal imaging shows that DNA partition follows the core-shell diffusion pattern within the condensates. LST slows down and reduces FUS condensates ability to recruit DNA but stabilizes the DNA-FUS condensate complex due to the heterogeneous solid network formation. Using the optical technique of Spatial Dynamic Mapping (SDM), we find that DNA partition promotes coalescence and alters the characteristics of the condensates. The partition made the condensates more dynamic in the short term (within minutes) but accelerated LST in long-term incubation (within hours), ultimately leading to an irreversible porous core-shell structure of FUS condensates. Our findings reveal the kinetics of DNA partition during aging and its impact on LST, underlining the modulation of condensate properties by molecule sequestration, shedding light on possible regulation of disease-related LST of biomolecular condensates."
"Thrombin (FIIa) signaling through protease-activated receptors (PARs) is a relevant platelet activation mechanism. Human (h) PAR1 antagonists are approved for antithrombotic therapy, but bleeding is a concerning complication. In addition to PARs, platelet glycoprotein (GP) Ib also binds FIIa enhancing human platelet response to lower agonist concentrations ex vivo. Signaling through GPCRs is well understood, but how GPIb association with distinct PARs modulates FIIa-dependent platelet activation in vivo remains unclear. One obstacle in addressing this question is the distinct human platelet PAR1/PAR4 expression as opposed to mouse (m) PAR3/PAR4. Previous attempts to express functioning hPAR1 in mouse platelets using platelet-specific promoters or targeting into the mPAR3 locus have not been successful. Here we report our studies using a hPAR1 transgene with a floxed STOP sequence and strong synthetic (CAG) promoter targeted into the mouse Rosa26 locus. Generated Rosa26-hPAR1Tgfl mice were then sequentially crossbred with PF4-Cre and PAR3-/- mice, yielding mP3-/-hP1Tg mice whose platelets expressed hPAR1 with endogenous mPAR4. These mice, unlike PAR3-/-, had no excessive bleeding after tail clipping, but bled profusely after administration of the hPAR1 antagonist, vorapaxar. Accordingly, mP3-/-hP1Tg mice had more frequent and stable post injury occlusion of the carotid artery than PAR3-/- mice, but this difference was abolished by vorapaxar treatment. We anticipate that studies in this mouse strain will help unravel the regulation of PAR-mediated thrombin-induced platelet activation in vivo with findings more directly relevant to human pathophysiology.

Key Points (<140 characters each)O_LIHuman (h) PAR1 expressed in the platelets of PAR3-/- mice shortens the bleeding time and promotes more frequent and stable post injury carotid artery occlusion.
C_LIO_LIThe specific hPAR1 antagonist drug, vorapaxar reverses the phenotypic changes associated with hPAR1 expression in PAR3-/- mice expressing mouse PAR4.
C_LIO_LIExperimental data from PAR3-/- mice expressing hPAR1 should be directly relevant to the development of specific thrombin-induced platelet activation inhibitors.

"Neurites of sensory neurons densely innervate the skin and are embedded within it. These delicate structures are exposed to acute and chronic mechanical strain and yet their integrity is maintained throughout life. Although evidence suggests a neuroprotective role for the skin, the molecular pathways involved are still poorly understood. In C. elegans, the cytoskeletal molecule UNC-70/{beta}-spectrin functions in synergy with the small GTPase RAB-35 within the skin to stabilize neuron-epidermal attachment structures against mechanical strain and prevent movement-induced damage to mechanosensitive axons. However, the full suite of molecules regulating these specialized attachments remains elusive. Here, through an unbiased forward genetic screen we have identified a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) previously associated with the endocytic-recycling machinery, AGEF-1a, that impacts axonal maintenance. We show that AGEF-1a functions selectively within the skin to regulate the integrity of the embedded axons. Mechanistically, we reveal that this effect is achieved through an interaction between AGEF-1a and epidermal RAB-35 to facilitate its activation, which in turn modulates the neuron-epidermal attachments. Finally, we demonstrate that the function of this GEF is highly conserved, with the expression of its human ortholog, BIG2 capable of replacing AGEF-1a. Together, we reveal the specific molecular machinery responsible for fine-tuning neuron-epidermal attachments and maintaining axonal integrity during life."
"A key pathological feature of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) is the loss of nuclear localization and the accumulation of cytoplasmic inclusions of hyperphosphorylated TAR-DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43). TDP-43 is a nucleic acid-binding protein involved in transcriptional repression, mRNA splicing, and the regulation of retrotransposable elements (RTEs) and endogenous retroviruses (ERVs). RTEs and ERVs are mobile genetic elements that constitute about 45% of our genome. These virus-like elements encode the capacity to replicate through an RNA intermediate and insert cDNA copies at de novo chromosomal locations. Their expression is a proven source of DNA damage and inflammatory signaling. Research in Drosophila has demonstrated a causal role of RTEs/ERVs in mediating both intracellular toxicity of TDP-43 and the intercellular spread of these toxic effects from glia to neurons. RTEs and ERVs are inappropriately expressed in postmortem tissues from ALS, FTD, and Alzheimers Disease (AD) patients, as well as in cell culture in response to TDP-43 disruption, suggesting that the findings in Drosophila may be conserved across species. But the role of RTEs and ERVs has not yet been examined in a vertebrate model of TDP-43 pathology. To investigate the functional contributions of RTEs in vertebrates, we utilized an established transgenic mouse model that overexpresses moderate levels of either human wild-type TDP-43 (hTDP-43-WT) or a mutant version with a specific causal amino acid substitution (hTDP-43-Q331K) associated with some inherited forms of the disease. Through RNA-sequencing of the motor cortex, and imaging of a LINE-1-EGFP retrotransposon indicator cassette, we found that the TDP-43 transgenic animals exhibit broad expression of RTEs and ERVs, along with replication of LINE-1 in glia and neurons in the motor cortex. This expression begins at the age of onset of neurological phenotypes, earlier in the hTDP-43-Q331K animals and much later in hTDP-43-WT. Although the motor defects progressively worsen over time, the LINE-1-EGFP replication reporter transiently labels spatially clustered groups of neurons and glia at the time of onset of motor symptoms. These EGFP-labeled neurons undergo cell death and are therefore lost over time. Unlabeled cells also die as a function of distance from the clusters of LINE-1-EGFP labeled neurons and glial cells. Together, these findings support the hypothesis that TDP-43 pathology triggers RTE/ERV expression in the motor cortex, that such expression marks cells for programmed cell death, with non-cell autonomous effects on nearby neurons and glial cells."
"Adaptive treadmills (ATMs) that change speed based on the users gait mechanics can allow for healthy stride to stride variability observed during overground walking, while maintaining the benefits of traditional treadmill training for gait rehabilitation. To enable unilateral targeting of propulsion, we developed an adaptive split-belt treadmill (sATM) that updates the speed of each belt of the treadmill based on the users propulsion and position. The present study validated the sATM against an existing tied-belt ATM that updates the speed of both belts based on the users propulsion, step length, and position. We also determined the effect of modifying the importance of propulsion unilaterally on the sATM. To validate the sATM, fourteen young, healthy participants completed five trials at their comfortable walking speed on the tied ATM and sATM with unilateral and bilateral modifications. We hypothesized that propulsion and walking speed on the novel sATM would be equivalent to the tied ATM, and further that the sATM could be preferentially weighted to encourage higher propulsion unilaterally while maintaining walking speed. Participants maintained similar propulsion and walking speed between treadmills and belts for bilateral modifications. While a few participants increased unilateral propulsion to maintain similar walking speeds for the unilateral modification, others showed no change in propulsion with slight differences in walking speed. Our results suggest that the response to unilateral modifications was user-specific, and the sATM could be tuned individually to allow unilateral control strategies. The present study demonstrates that walking speed can be modulated on an adaptive split-belt treadmill."
"The existence of -synuclein conformational strains provides a potential explanation for the clinical and pathological differences among synucleinopathies such as Parkinsons disease and multiple system atrophy. However, how distinct -synuclein strains are formed in vivo remains unknown. Here, we examined whether unique strains of self-propagating -synuclein aggregates can arise within a consistent molecular environment. Unexpectedly, we observed conformational heterogeneity between individual preparations of -synuclein pre-formed fibrils (PFFs) generated by polymerizing recombinant wild-type or A53T-mutant human -synuclein under identical conditions. Moreover, we found that -synuclein aggregates formed spontaneously in the brains of a transgenic synucleinopathy mouse model were conformationally diverse, leading to the identification of three distinct disease subtypes. Propagation of putative PFF- and brain-derived -synuclein strains in mice initiated several distinct synucleinopathies, characterized by differences in disease onset times, cerebral -synuclein deposition patterns, and the conformational attributes of -synuclein aggregates. The conformational diversity of -synuclein aggregates across PFF preparations and between the brains of individual transgenic mice demonstrates that -synuclein can spontaneously form multiple self-propagating strains within an identical environment both in vitro and in vivo. This suggests that stochastic misfolding into distinct aggregate structures drives the emergence of -synuclein strains and implies that the intrinsic variability of common synucleinopathy research tools must be considered when designing and interpreting experiments."
"The transition from autotrophy to heterotrophy in parasitic plants disrupts organellar coordination and presents a unique opportunity to examine the coevolution of cellular genomes. Using the Broomrape family (Orobanchaceae) as a model, we analyzed mitochondrial and plastid genome evolution across 30 species representing the full spectrum of parasitic lifestyles. We show that plastid genome reduction is correlated with mitogenomic expansion, revealing a striking inverse relationship between genome compaction and inflation. Mitogenome enlargement in parasitic taxa is driven by the accumulation of horizontally and intracellularly transferred DNA, proliferation of short repeats, and integration of unique sequences with no detectable homology. Notably, foreign DNA insertions converge toward native mitochondrial GC content and often retain structural functionality, suggesting selective maintenance. Relaxed selection in ATP synthase and ribosomal genes contrasts with intensified selection on components of electron transport and cytochrome c maturation, reflecting functional reconfiguration of mitochondrial respiration in parasitic plants. RNA editing, intron loss, and frameshift insertions further reshape gene structure, particularly in obligate parasites. Together, our findings suggest that parasitism initiates a systemic genomic feedback loop in which relaxed selection and disrupted maintenance mechanisms affect even distant genomic compartments. This study provides the first comprehensive evolutionary framework for multi-compartment genome remodeling in parasitic plants and highlights the dynamic interplay between lifestyle specialization and organelle genome evolution."
"Birds outperform engineered aircraft with exceptional maneuverability, achieved by continuously morphing their wings and tails in flight. Yet the coordination and control of these shape changes remain poorly understood. Using high-speed motion capture of Harris hawks, we analyzed 289,000 wing-tail configurations in over 2000 flights and identified four fundamental shape change patterns, or ""morphing shape modes"", that capture over 96% of wing and tail variation. Further modes reflect subtle but critical fine-tuning, in line with known morphing control mechanics. The hawks morphing flight is highly structured yet flexible, and we find adaptive strategies in response to obstacles, added weight, with maturity, while each individual shows unique morphing signatures. Our approach defines a shared kinematic morphospace for hawk flight, and more broadly a framework that enables future comparative biomechanics, bio-inspired design, and for interpreting high-dimensional natural motion."
"There are currently no therapies for the staggering disability and public health costs of chronic low back pain (LBP). Innervation of the degenerating intervertebral disc (IVD) is suspected to cause discogenic LBP, but the mechanisms that orchestrate the IVDs neo-innervation and subsequent symptoms of LBP remain unknown. We hypothesize that Vascular Growth Endothelial Factor-A (VEGFA) critically mediates the neurite invasion in the IVD and contributes to prolonged LBP. Initiating IVD degeneration through a mechanical injury, we evaluated the progression of neurovascular features into the IVD, as well as resultant LBP symptoms and locomotive performance at acute (3-weeks) and prolonged (12-weeks) time points following IVD injury. To determine the role of VEGFA, we used a mouse model with ubiquitous inducible recombination of the floxed VEGFA allele (UBC-CreERT2; VEGFAfl/fl). The ablation of VEGFA attenuated the neurite and vessel infiltration into the degenerating IVD, and the VEGFA-null animals exhibited alleviated mechanical allodynia and improved locomotive performance. To determine the effects of IVD-derived VEGFA on endothelial cells and neurons, we cultured HMEC-1 endothelial cells and SH-SY5Y neurons using conditioned media from VEGFA-silenced (siRNA) human primary IVD cells stimulated by IL1{beta}. The endothelial cells and neurons exposed to the secretome of the VEGFA-silenced IVD cells exhibited reduced growth, suggesting that the inhibition of IVD-derived VEGFA may be sufficient to attenuate intradiscal neurovascular features. Together, we show that VEGFA orchestrates the growth of intradiscal vessels and neurites that cause low back pain and impaired function, and the inhibition of VEGFA can prevent prolonged low back pain.

One Sentence SummaryVEGFA critically mediates the infiltration of neurovascular features into the degenerating intervertebral disc, and the ablation of VEGFA prevents chronic low back pain behavior."
"Exposure of the developing brain to environmental neurotoxicants can result in permanent alterations in structure and/or function. To investigate the effects of chemical exposures on neurodevelopment, the human induced-pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neural BrainSphere model has been utilized due to its ability to form mature neuronal populations and exhibit spontaneous electrical activity. To model network formation for developmental neurotoxicity screening, developing BrainSpheres were plated on high-density microelectrode arrays (hdMEA) three weeks after beginning differentiation. Starting two days post-plating, BrainSpheres were treated three times per week with compounds known to disrupt in vitro network formation (i.e. assay positive controls; loperamide, dieldrin and deltamethrin), or with an assay negative control, glyphosate, expected to have no effect. For 29 days, BrainSphere activity was recorded to measure neural network activity, general activity, and features of action potential propagation. Concentration-dependent disruption in neural network formation was observed for positive controls at concentrations below cytotoxicity. Dieldrin, deltamethrin, and loperamide exposure disrupted several features of general activity, neural network formation, and action potential propagation. BrainSpheres on hdMEAs detected chemically induced perturbations in neural network formation and may represent a valuable complex in vitro model useful for developmental neurotoxicity screening."
"Prediction error, both at the level of sentence meaning and at the level of the next presented word, has been shown to successfully account for N400 amplitudes. Here we address the question of whether people differ in the representational level at which they implicitly predict upcoming language. To this end, we compute a measure of prediction error at the level of sentence meaning (magnitude of change in hidden layer activation, termed semantic update, in a neural network model of sentence comprehension, the Sentence Gestalt model) and a measure of prediction error at the level of the next presented word (surprisal from a next word prediction language model). When using both measures to predict N400 amplitudes during the reading of naturalistic texts, results showed that both measures significantly accounted for N400 amplitudes even when the other measure was controlled for. Most important for current purposes, both effects were significantly negatively correlated such that people with a reversed or weak surprisal effect showed the strongest influence of semantic update on N400 amplitudes, and random-effects model comparison showed that individuals differ in whether their N400 amplitudes are driven by semantic update only, by surprisal only, or by both, and that the most common model in the population was either semantic update or the combined model but clearly not the pure surprisal model. The current approach of combining large-scale models implementing different theoretical accounts with advanced model comparison techniques enables fine-grained investigations into the computational processes underlying N400 amplitudes, including interindividual differences."
"BackgroundNinety percent of the 65,000 human diseases are infrequent, collectively affecting [~] 400 million people, substantially limiting cohort accrual. This low prevalence constrains the development of robust transcriptome-based machine learning (ML) classifiers. Standard data-driven classifiers typically require cohorts of over 100 subjects per group to achieve clinical accuracy while managing high-dimensional input ([~]25,000 transcripts). These requirements are infeasible for micro-cohorts of [~]20 individuals, where overfitting becomes pervasive.

ObjectiveTo overcome these constraints, we developed a classification method that integrates three enabling strategies: (i) paired-sample transcriptome dynamics, (ii) N-of-1 pathway-based analytics, and (iii) reproducible machine learning operations (MLOps) for continuous model refinement.

MethodsUnlike ML approaches relying on a single transcriptome per subject, within-subject paired-sample designs -- such as pre-versus post-treatment or diseased versus adjacent-normal tissue -- effectively control intra-individual variability under isogenic conditions and within-subject environmental exposures (e.g. smoking history, other medications, etc.), improve signal-to-noise ratios, and, when pre-processed as single-subject studies (N-of-1), can achieve statistical power comparable to that obtained in animal models. Pathway-level N-of-1 analytics further reduces each samples high-dimensional profile into [~]4,000 biologically interpretable features, annotated with effect sizes, dispersion, and significance. Complementary MLOps practices--automated versioning, continuous monitoring, and adaptive hyperparameter tuning--improve model reproducibility and generalization.

ResultsIn two case studies--human rhinovirus infection versus matched healthy controls (n=16 training; 3 test) and breast cancer tissues harboring TP53 or PIK3CA mutations versus adjacent normal tissue (n=27 training; 9 test)--this approach achieved 90% precision and recall on an unseen breast cancer test set and 92% precision with 90% recall in rhinovirus fivefold cross-validation. Incorporating paired-sample dynamics boosted precision by 8.8% and recall by 6%, while the MLOps workflow yielded additional gains of 14.5% and 12.5%, respectively. Moreover, our method identified 42 critical gene sets (pathways) for rhinovirus response and 21 for cancer mutation status.

ConclusionsThese proof-of-concept results support the utility of integrating intra-subject dynamics, ""biological knowledge""-based feature reduction (pathway-level feature reduction grounded in prior biological knowledge; e.g., N-of-1-pathways analytics), and reproducible MLOps workflows can overcome cohort-size limitations in infrequent disease, offering a scalable, interpretable solution for high-dimensional transcriptomic classification. Future work will extend these advances across various therapeutic and small-cohort designs."
"MotivationAlignment-based methods are fundamental for sequence comparison but are often computationally prohibitive for large-scale genomic analyses. This limitation has spurred the development of quicker, alignment-free alternatives, such as k-mer analysis, which are crucial for studying long non-coding ribonucleic acids (lncRNAs) in plants. These lncRNAs play critical roles in regulating gene expression at both the epigenetic and transcriptomic levels. However, existing alignment-free approaches typically lose positional information, which can be vital for achieving accurate classification.

ResultsWe propose positional frequency chaos game representation (PFCGR), a novel encoding that improves the traditional frequency chaos game representation (FCGR) by incorporating four statistical moments of k-mer positions: mean, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. This creates a multi-channel image representation of genomic sequences, enabling machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forests, and Convolutional Neural Networks to classify plant lncRNAs directly from raw genomic sequences. Tested on seven major crop species, our PFCGR-based classifiers achieve classification accuracies comparable to or exceeding those of the computationally intensive DNABERT-based model (Danilevicz et al. (1)), while requiring significantly less computational resources. These results demonstrate PFCGRs potential as an efficient and accurate tool for plant lncRNA identification, as well as its ability to facilitate large-scale computational studies in genomics."
"Single-cell fluorescence characterization has gained much attention for studying the dynamics of individual cells in human diseases such as cancer. Despite the abundance of literature on quantitative fluorescence microscopy and its advantages in measuring cell-to-cell and spatial variation over other high-throughput instruments, it lacks a concise model that one can follow to maximize the quality of images. Here, we used the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) model to verify camera parameters and optimize microscope settings to maximize SNR for quantitative single cell fluorescence microscopy (QSFM). We determined the microscope cameras readout noise, dark current, photon shot noise, the clock-induced charge, and validated the additive noise model for each noise source. The dark current and the clock-induced charge were both higher than reported in literature, compromising camera sensitivity. We also reduced excess background noise and improved SNR by 3-fold, by adding secondary emission and excitation filters as well as by introducing wait time in the dark before fluorescence acquisition. Additionally, our work opens new avenues for enhancing superresolution microscopy techniques such as small molecule localization microscopy (SMLM)."
"Ferritins are ubiquitous among life forms, as they are essential for iron homeostasis. Here, we unveiled a novel member of the ferritin family, baptised mini-bacterioferritin. The characterised mini-bacterioferritin was isolated from a microbial enrichment dominated by the methanotrophic archaeon  Candidatus Methanoperedens BLZ2. Its atomic resolution crystal structure reveals a 12-mer assembly with a diiron ferroxidase centre located within a four-helix bundle. Redox cycling experiments on protein crystals reveal a shift in iron position at the active site, which follows the established ferritin catalytic cycle. The 12-mer sphere-like structure harboured six Fe-coproporphyrin III ligands, positioned at the interdimeric interface, a characteristic previously only found in 24-mer bacterioferritins. Phylogenetics, together with structure predictions of closely related proteins, revealed that mini-bacterioferritins form a new clade within the ferritin family that might conserve ancestral traits. Future research will need to investigate the physiological roles of these enzymes, which were unsuspectingly widely distributed among prokaryotes.

TeaserA novel ferritin family, the heme-binding mini-bacterioferritin, assembles as a dodecamer and is widely distributed among microbes."
"AlphaFold2 protein structure predictions are widely available for structural biology uses. These predictions, especially for eukaryotic proteins, frequently contain extensive regions predicted below the pLDDT 70 level, the rule-of-thumb cutoff for high confidence. This work identifies major modes of behavior within low-pLDDT regions through a survey of human proteome predictions provided by the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database. The near-predictive mode resembles folded protein and can be a nearly accurate prediction. Barbed wire is extremely unproteinlike, being recognized by wide looping coils, an absence of packing contacts, and numerous signature validation outliers, and it likely represents a nonpredicted region. Pseudostructure presents an intermediate behavior with a misleading appearance of isolated and badly formed secondary structure-like elements. These prediction modes are compared with annotations of disorder from MobiDB, showing general correlation between barbed wire/pseudostructure and many measures of disorder, an association between pseudostructure and signal peptides, and an association between near-predictive and regions of conditional folding. To enable users to identify these regions within a prediction, a new Phenix tool is developed encompassing the results of this work, including prediction annotation, visual markup, and residue selection based on these prediction modes. This tool will help users develop expertise in interpreting difficult AlphaFold predictions and identify the near-predictive regions that can aid in molecular replacement when a prediction does not contain enough high-pLDDT regions."
"The development of technologies for screening proteins that bind to specific tissues in vivo and facilitate delivery of large cargos remains challenging, with most approaches limited to cell culture systems that often yield clinically irrelevant hits. To overcome this limitation, we developed a novel molecular screening platform using an extracellular vesicle (EV) display library. EVs are natural molecular carriers capable of delivering diverse cargos, which can be engineered to enhance specificity and targeting through surface modifications. We constructed an EV-display library presenting monobody repertoires on EV surfaces, with genetic cargo inside the EVs corresponding to the displayed proteins. These libraries were screened for tissue specific delivery through serial passage in mice via sequential intravenous administration in and recovery of tissue-selected EVs and amplification of their encapsulated monobody genes at each passage. Our results demonstrated successful selection of tissue-specific targeting proteins, as revealed by fluorescence and bioluminescence imaging followed by DNA sequencing. To understand the stochastic relationship between displayed proteins and packaged genes, we developed a Markov chain model that quantified selection dynamics and predicted enrichment patterns despite the imperfect correlation between phenotype and genotype. This EV-based monobody screening approach, combined with mathematical modeling, is a significant advancement in targeted drug delivery by leveraging the natural capabilities of EVs with the selection of targeting proteins in a physiologically relevant environment."
"Image derived phenotypes (IDPs) harmonization from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data is essential for reducing scanner-induced, non-biological variability and enabling accurate multi-site analysis. Existing methods like ComBat, while widely used, rely on linear assumptions and explicit scanner IDs - limitations that reduce their effectiveness in real-world scenarios involving complex scanner effects, non-linear biological variation, or anonymized data. We introduce BARTharm, a novel harmonization framework that uses Image Quality Metrics (IQMs) instead of Scanner IDs and models scanner and biological effects separately using Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART), allowing for flexible, data-driven adjustment of IDPs. Through extensive simulation studies, we demonstrate that IQMs provide a more informative and flexible representation of scanner-related variation than categorical Scanner IDs, enabling more accurate removal of non-biological effects. Leveraging this and its ability to model complex relationships, BARTharm, consistently outperforms ComBat across a range of challenging scenarios, including model misspecification and confounded scanner-biological relationships. Applied to real-world datasets, BARTharm successfully removes scanner-induced bias while preserving meaningful biological signals, resulting in stronger, more reliable associations with clinical outcomes. Overall, we find that BARTharm is a robust, data-driven improvement over traditional harmonization approaches, particularly suited for modern, large-scale neuroimaging studies."
"The entorhinal cortex (EC) plays a crucial role in memory functions. Long before the clinical symptoms of Alzheimers disease (AD) emerge, it has already undergone significant degeneration, making it a primary site for the onset of the disease. The reasons for this remain elusive. It was recently shown that in layer II neurons of the anterolateral entorhinal cortex (alECLII neurons), which are especially prone to display a very early increase in intracellular amounts of amyloid-{beta} peptide (A{beta}) and hyperphosphorylated tau protein (p-tau), the large glycoprotein reelin binds to A{beta}, suggesting that reelin functions as a sink for intracellular A{beta}. The expression of reelin is extraordinarily high in alECLII neurons compared to most other cortical neurons. Here, we show by computational modeling that, in a senescent physiology predisposing to frequent inflammation-driven A{beta}42 production bursts, the intracellular amount of A{beta}42-reelin complexes can accumulate to extraordinarily high levels in alECLII neurons compared to the vast majority of cortical neurons. This explains experimental data showing that intracellular accumulations of A{beta}42 positive material ranged from 20 to 80% of the total cytoplasmic volume in EC neurons from patients with sporadic AD. We also show that this extreme intracellular aggregation can cause the accumulation of detrimental hyperphosphorylated tau fragments. Thus, when exposed to recurrent AD-promoting stress, the exceptionally high expression of reelin in alECLII neurons appears to be instrumental in their early demise relative to other cortical neurons."
"Understanding the forces shaping genomic diversity within bacterial species is essential for interpreting microbiome evolution, ecology, and host associations. Here, we analyze over one hundred prevalent gut bacterial species using the Unified Human Gut Genome (UHGG) collection to characterize patterns of intra-specific genomic variability. Gene content divergence scales predictably with divergence in core genome single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), though there is substantial variability in evolutionary dynamics across species. Overall, accessory genes exhibit consistently faster linkage decay compared to core SNPs, highlighting the fluidity of functional repertoires within species boundaries. This signal is strongest for mobile genetic elements, which show minimal linkage to core genome SNPs. Together, our findings reveal species-specific recombination regimes in the gut microbiome, underscoring the importance of accounting for horizontal gene transfer and genome plasticity in microbiome-wide association studies and evolutionary models."
"Climate warming presents a critical challenge to global ecosystems, with rising temperatures inducing the emergence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in aquatic environments. Given the natural correlation between rising temperatures and declining oxygen levels in aquatic systems, we hypothesized that decoupling temperature and oxygen stress would reveal regulatory mechanisms mitigating ARG expression under future warming scenarios. Through transcriptomic analysis of Escherichia coli under temperature upshift (TU), dissolved oxygen upshift (DOU), and dissolved oxygen downshift (DOD), we identified 101 distinct regulons with 8 showing significant regulation (|log2FC| > 1.5). Key regulons (cusR, mhpR, pdhR) exhibited parallel regulation under TU and DOD but opposite patterns under DOU, revealing mechanistic links between temperature and oxygen stress through shared regulatory networks involving oxidative stress regulators (oxyR-metR) and aerobic respiration control (arcA-betI). Evolved strains from controlled temperature-oxygen fluctuations demonstrated sophisticated metabolic reprogramming, including enhanced carbohydrate metabolism, nucleotide biosynthesis, and putrescine degradation. These strains exhibited optimized energy metabolism through reduced downregulation of ATP synthase subunits and NADH dehydrogenase complex genes, preserving electron transport chain function under thermal stress. Simultaneously, they displayed strategic ROS management with reduced upregulation of peroxiredoxin (ahpF) and Cu/Zn-SOD (sodC), while reversing Fe-SOD (sodB) expression patterns. To validate these mechanisms, we conducted independent batch reactor experiments with two dissolved oxygen conditions (2-8 mg/L) using intermittent perturbation patterns. Non-targeted metaproteomic analysis revealed that lowered oxygen levels (2 vs. 8 mg/L) triggered comprehensive reconfiguration of antimicrobial resistance mechanisms, including downregulation of penicillin-binding proteins, alanine racemase, and cationic antimicrobial peptide resistance systems, while modulating two-component regulatory networks. Our findings reveal coordinated regulatory networks optimizing energy metabolism, ROS management, and antibiotic resistance, suggesting oxygen management strategies could mitigate climate warming effects on antibiotic resistance in aquatic environments."
"Aquatic ecosystems are facing severe threats from climate change, with rising temperatures as a major driving force posing a significant challenge to their ecological balance. Microorganisms constitute the majority of biomass in the water ecosystems and mediate the flux of carbon, nitrogen, sulfate and other essential nutrients. Climate warming profoundly influences microbial communities by shaping their distribution and ecological roles in the ecosystem, and in turn microorganisms play a significant role in climate feedback. The Yellow River, Chinas second-longest river, is crucial for agricultural irrigation and provides drinking water for millions, yet little is known about microbial community adaptations under future warming scenarios in the system. In this study, we analyzed a publicly available metagenomic dataset from Yellow River water samples that were previously subjected to temperature treatments of 23, 26, 29, 32, and 35 degrees Celsius. We employed metagenomic analysis to identify how gradually increasing temperatures affected microbial community profiles. The study identified 140 species tolerant to high temperatures, showing a significant increase in abundance with elevated temperatures. The elevated temperature stress impacted the network properties of microbial communities substantially. Certain temperature-tolerant species were identified as hubs in the network across five temperatures, with their number increasing with temperature. Deltaproteobacteria bacterium was present at all five temperatures, while Parcubacteria bacterium, Parvularcula sp., Phenylobacterium sp., Phycisphaeraceae bacterium, and Sphingobium xenophagum were only present at high temperatures of 32 {degrees}C and 35 {degrees}C. The percentage of taxa nodes connected to tolerant hubs in the overall network rose from 57.48% to 95.94%, indicating the growing importance of these tolerant hubs. The positive connections among these tolerant hubs also increased, with the number of positive edges rising from 1166 to 2811, indicating a potential collaborative relationship among these taxa in response to temperature stress. These findings suggest that tolerant hubs may initially respond to temperature stress and subsequently transfer this function to other species through cooperative interactions. Understanding these microbial dynamics is crucial for developing strategies to maintain freshwater ecosystem health amid climate change."
"In recent years, the importance of alternative splicing (AS) of certain genes in the nature and progression of diabetic nephropathy (DN) has been studied. We report a novel AS event observed in the diabetic kidney - AS of the apoptosis gene BCL-X to increase the pro-apoptotic BCL-XS and decrease the anti-apoptotic BCL-XL. This study aimed to further investigate the role of this novel AS event in the pathogenesis of DN.

To characterize important splicing events in progression of DN, human glomerular endothelial cells (GEnCs) were exposed to a diabetic environment for 1 week and RNAseq was performed. While several splicing changes have been discovered we have focused further on the apoptosis gene BCL-X isoforms.

In GEnCs, an upregulation of the BCL-XS/BCL-XL ratio was observed which resulted in an increase in GEnC apoptosis. An upregulation of IL-6 was also observed; treatment with IL-6 alone induced a dose-dependent shift in BCL-X splicing to promote expression of the pro-apoptotic BCL-XS. Furthermore, we identified certain splicing factors, SF3B1 and PTBP1, involved in the BCL-X splicing regulation. A switch in expression of the anti-apoptotic BCL-XL isoform rescues apoptosis, suggesting a possible therapeutic avenue. In patients, an increase in the pro-apoptotic BCL-XS in urinary RNA correlated with a decline in the GFR, while in blood it correlated with the level of albuminuria.

There is an increase in the pro-apoptotic BCL-XS isoform in the diabetic glomerular endothelium, resulting in increased GEnC apoptosis. Increased BCL-XS expression correlates with a markers of renal function decline, implicating this AS event as a potential biomarker for DN severity and suggesting that the switch of isoforms from BCL-XS to BCL-XL may for a novel therapeutic strategy."
"Physiologically, hepatocytes perform an estimated 500 essential liver functions to ensure systemic homeostasis. The mechanisms how hepatocytes maintain these numerous crucial functions in response to physiological and pathophysiological challenges are largely unknown. In this study, we found that vital liver function genes (e.g., HNF4A, ALB, coagulation factors, and SLC2A2) in hepatocytes possess super-enhancers. Interfering with the super-enhancers by dCas9-sgRNA remarkably decreases the expression of these genes. Quiescent liver progenitor cells (LPCs) do not have active super-enhancers in vital liver function genes. In acute liver failure (ALF) caused by massive hepatic necrosis, activated LPCs perform liver function and differentiate into hepatocytes to rescue patients lives. We show that activated LPCs gradually form super-enhancers in liver function genes (e.g., HNF4A, ALB, and coagulation factors) during proliferation and differentiation. These super-enhancers are regulated by FOXA2 through the recruitment of HNF4 a, p300 and Mediators in most liver function genes, such as ALB and coagulation factors. However, super-enhancers in some genes (e.g., SLC2A2) are FOXA2-indenpendent. Hepatic FOXA2 expression is closely associated with the clinical outcome of ALF. In a cohort of ALF patients, robust FOXA2 is observed only in the surviving patients. Collectively, super-enhancers represent a critical epigenetic regulatory mechanism that enables rapidly enhanced transcription of liver function genes in response to pathophysiological challenges. In urgent clinical syndrome such as ALF, LPCs rescue liver function by rapid formation of super-enhancers in vital genes."
"BackgroundIdiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (iDCM) in children is a life-threatening disease. Little is known about its cellular and transcriptional landscape, and the lack of disease-specific animal models limits our understanding of its mechanisms. We previously demonstrated that pediatric iDCM serum-circulating proteins promote pathologic remodeling in vitro, and that secreted frizzled related protein 1 (sFRP1) increases stiffness in cardiomyocytes. Here we investigated the mechanisms by which sFRP1 contributes to cardiac dysfunction.

MethodsThe effect of sFRP1 in combination with isoproterenol (ISO) (to recapitulate the increase in circulating catecholamine observed in pediatric DCM patients) was evaluated in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (in vitro), and in neonatal rats through intraperitoneal injections (in vivo). Function and molecular mechanisms were investigated through echocardiography and next-generation-sequencing respectively. Protein levels and localization were determined by Western blot. Tissue stiffness was measured by Atomic Force Microscopy. In vitro and in vivo data were compared to explanted human heart tissue (ex vivo).

ResultsWe show that ISO+sFRP1 reactivates the fetal gene program in vitro, and promotes cardiac dysfunction, dilation and stiffness in vivo. Importantly, we show stiffness is also increased in pediatric iDCM hearts. We identified co-activation of Notch and WNT signaling in both ISO+sFRP1-treated rats and pediatric iDCM hearts. Mechanistically, in vitro inhibition of Notch or {beta}-catenin prevented pathological remodeling, and Notch inhibition improved cardiac function and reduced ventricular dilation in ISO+sFRP1-treated rats and NRVMs.

ConclusionWe identified concordant alterations in Notch and WNT signaling in pediatric iDCM hearts and in our ISO+sFRP1-treated rats. Notch inhibition abrogated pathologic changes in vitro and in vivo. These findings provide novel mechanistic insights and a potential therapeutic target for pediatric iDCM.

"Protein-DNA interactions are crucial for cellular processes, but current quantification methods lack sensitivity. We developed the Real-time PCR-based DNA Binding Assay (RP-DBA) to detect and quantify these interactions. The target protein, expressed as a Strep-tag II fusion, is purified and incubated with double-stranded DNA probes containing 4 bp 3 overhangs. Protein-DNA complexes are immobilized on Strep-Tactin beads, washed, and eluted. A complementary single-stranded DNA amplification arm is added, extended by Taq polymerase, and quantified via qPCR with SYBR Green. RP-DBA enables real-time kinetic analysis and is 4- to 10-fold more sensitive than EMSA, depending on amplification arm length (30-90 bp). Its simplicity, speed, accuracy, and high-throughput potential make it a valuable tool for advancing molecular biology research."
"Early Stuart sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka undergo one of the most intensive and far-reaching migrations in the Fraser River (British Columbia, Canada) that has likely exerted selective pressures shaping their genetics and physiology. To support upper Fraser River sockeye management objectives, there is a need to further understand the unique genetics of these populations. Based on neutral genetic markers, Early Stuart sockeye are considered a metapopulation with little to no genetic differentiation among their approximately 50 spawning streams. In this study we make use of existing resources to evaluate genome-wide genetic differentiation in this metapopulation and put it into the context of other nearby populations. We confirm that genetic differentiation is low or negligible in the metapopulation at a whole-genome level, although we identify a slight increase in differentiation at greater distances within the watershed compared to more proximal streams (e.g., FST = 0.001-0.002 compared with undifferentiated). Even the greatest differentiation detected is very low, being nine times lower than that between run timing groups (Early Stuart vs. Stuart-Summer; e.g., FST = 0.0091). Notably, a region of major differentiation was detected between the run timing groups on Chr18 between 56.3-58.0 Mbp (average FST = 0.661). This genomic region appears to contain a unique haplotype specific to the Stuart-Summer, Nadina River, and Stellako River populations (i.e., upstream to the Nechako River). By contrast, Early Stuart and other upper Fraser River sockeye outside of the Nechako Watershed do not possess this haplotype. The genomic region is within ancestral chromosome 15.2, the homeolog to a chromosome arm of Chr12 (i.e., 15.1); this arm of Chr12 is known to contain a major differentiated region associated with run timing and life history variation in Alaska and the Okanagan. This finding provides additional evidence for the importance of this genomic region in both homeologous chromosomes within different populations of the same species, and points to the uniqueness of upper Fraser River sockeye in this potential major effect locus."
"Parasitic nematodes are major pathogens of humans, animals, and plants, contributing to global health challenges and substantial agricultural losses. Fatty acid- and retinol-binding proteins (FARs), secreted by parasitic nematodes, are believed to play key roles in host-pathogen interactions, including immune modulation and nutrient acquisition. In this study, we characterize a FAR protein from the gastrointestinal nematode Heligmosomoides polygyrus, Hp-FAR-2. Unlike FARs from Caenorhabditis elegans, Steinernema carpocapsae, and Ancylostoma ceylanicum, Hp-FAR-2 did not influence immunity or survival in a Drosophila melanogaster infection model, suggesting functional divergence within the FAR family. Competitive lipid-binding assays revealed a preference for omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, indicating selective binding to bioactive lipids that may modulate immunity. Using RAW 264.7 macrophages, we found that Hp-FAR-2 suppresses the expression of both M1-associated (TNF-, IL-6) and M2-associated (Chil3) markers during polarization, implicating it as a broad immunomodulator that may inhibit inflammatory responses and tissue repair mechanisms to promote chronic infection. Our findings support a model in which Hp-FAR-2 disrupts host lipid signaling and immune function to favor parasite persistence, suggesting its potential role in the excretory/secretory products of H. polygyrus. Together, these data enhance our understanding of FAR-mediated host manipulation and may inform the development of novel anthelmintic or immunoregulatory therapies."
"The rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened new possibilities in various fields, including microbiome research. This dissertation explores the application of LLMs for differential abundance analysis, a crucial method for understanding the relationship between microbial communities and health conditions. Through a series of experiments, we assessed the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in automating and enhancing the differential abundance analysis process.

Our findings reveal that while LLMs can effectively extract relevant information from scientific literature and assist in generating reports, they also face significant challenges, including data inaccuracies, hallucinations, and issues with reference generation. These challenges highlight the importance of integrating LLMs with human oversight to ensure scientific rigor. The study suggests that while LLMs can increase research efficiency, they are not yet reliable enough to replace human expertise in complex scientific tasks.

This research contributes to the ongoing dialogue on the role of AI in scientific research, emphasizing the need for further development of LLMs and the exploration of hybrid models that combine AI capabilities with human judgment. The dissertation concludes with recommendations for improving the accuracy and consistency of LLMs, and expanding their applications."
"Protein synthesis relies on accurate mRNA decoding by tRNA, a process guided by EF-Tu. We investigated how mutations at a conserved residue, aspartate 81, affect EF-Tu function using GTPase assays, AlphaFold modeling, and quantum-sensing-based super-resolution force spectroscopy (SURFS). All D81 variants retained GTPase activity but impaired tRNA release, revealed by sub-nucleotide ribosome footprinting. AlphaFold3 modeling suggests that D81 mutations disrupt magnesium coordination and interaction with the sarcin-ricin loop in the GTP-bound state. AlphaFold2-based sequence-structure analysis indicates that D81 anchors coevolutionary constraints, and its mutation enables cryptic structural variation. These results show how a single conserved residue links catalytic coordination, allosteric communication, and evolutionary constraint, offering mechanistic insight into translation fidelity and demonstrating the utility of an unconventional force spectroscopy in probing ribosome dynamics."
"Accurate localization of neural sources in Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and Electroencephalography (EEG) is essential for advancing clinical and research applications in neuroscience. Traditional approaches like dipole fitting (e.g., MUSIC, RAP-MUSIC) are limited to discrete focal sources, while distributed source imaging methods (e.g., MNE, sLORETA) assume sources distributed across the cortical surface. These methods, however, often fail to capture sources with complex spatial extents, limiting their accuracy in realistic settings. To address these limitations, we introduce PATCH-AP, an enhanced version of the Alternating Projection (AP) method that effectively localizes both discrete and spatially extended sources. We evaluated PATCH-AP against leading source localization methods, including distributed source imaging techniques (MNE, sLORETA), traditional dipole fitting (AP), and recent extended source methods (Convexity-Champagne (CC), FLEX-AP). PATCH-AP consistently outperformed these methods in simulations, achieving lower Earth Movers Distance (EMD) scores--a metric indicating closer alignment with the true source distribution. In tests with real MEG data from a face perception task, PATCH-AP demonstrated high alignment with the fusiform face area, a region critical for face processing. These results highlight PATCH-APs potential to enhance source localization accuracy, promising significant advancements in neuroscience research and clinical diagnostics."
"Alternative splicing of precursor-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) bearing introns with competing and overlapping 5 splice sites (5SS) produces more mRNAs. We investigated the mechanism of this form of alternative splicing by monitoring RNA and protein products of the yeast SRC1/HEH1 gene. Its alternative splicing requires a sixteen-nucleotide pre-mRNA segment spanning the two 5SS. The nucleotides are decoded by U5 and U6 small nuclear RNAs (snRNA), further supported by proteins of the spliceosomal B and Bact complexes. Specific variants of the pre-mRNA segment with recalibrated binding to U5 and U6 snRNAs allowed alternative splicing independently of the trans-acting proteins. Conversely, snRNA variants specified for modified 5SS selection suppressed the splicing defects in the B complex mutants. Further data suggest that alternative splicing from HEH1-type introns containing overlapping and competing 5SS relies on pre-mRNA-snRNA interactions during B to Bact transitions of the spliceosome, supported by proteins that stabilize low-fidelity, high-efficiency conformations."
"Serum response factor (SRF) and its cofactors, Myocardin-related transcription factors A/B (MRTF-A/B), regulate transcription of numerous cytoskeletal structural and regulatory genes, and most MRTF/SRF inactivation phenotypes reflect deficits in cytoskeletal dynamics. We show that MRTF-SRF activity is required for effective proliferation of both primary and immortalised fibroblast and epithelial cells. Cells lacking the MRTFs or SRF proliferate very slowly, express elevated levels of SASP factors and SA-{beta}-galactosidase activity, and inhibit proliferation of co-cultured primary wildtype cells. They exhibit decreased levels of CDK1 and CKS2 proteins, and elevated levels of CDK inhibitors, usually CDKN1B/p27. These phenotypes, which can be fully reversed by re-expression of MRTF-A, are also seen in wildtype cells arrested by serum deprivation. Moreover, in wildtype cells direct interference with cytoskeletal dynamics through inhibition of ROCKs or Myosin ATPase induces a similar proliferative defect to that seen in MRTF-null cells. MRTF-null cells exhibit multiple cytoskeletal defects, and markedly reduced contractility. We propose that MRTF-SRF driven cytoskeletal dynamics and contractility are essential for operation of the pro-proliferative signal provided by cell-substrate adhesion."
"The skin is a diverse reservoir of immune cells with strong potential for immunotherapeutic delivery. Langerhans cells (LCs) in the epidermis are antigen-presenting cells, accessible for vaccination using carbohydrate-conjugated therapeutics targeting their endocytic lectin receptor, Langerin. As carbohydrate-lectin binding is highly dependent on valency, scaffolds that enable control over ligand spacing and stoichiometry are instrumental in enhancing receptor binding and selectivity. Here we utilized a self-assembled nucleic acid-based Holliday Junction scaffold, fully modified for nuclease protection and with a well-defined carbohydrate arrangement to optimize drug delivery to LCs. In vitro screening with Langerin-expressing cells revealed that mannosylated Holliday Junctions showed the strongest binding. This was confirmed in human epidermal cell suspensions, demonstrating specificity and valency-driven interactions. Topical administration of mannosylated scaffolds on skin explants enabled effective targeting of epidermal LCs. Finally, in an antigen-presentation assay, in vitro differentiated LCs loaded with mannosylated and peptide-conjugated scaffolds significantly enhanced T cell activation. Overall, our study presents a promising nucleic acid-based platform for precise LC targeting and drug delivery, with broad potential for skin-directed immunotherapies."
"The establishment of morphogen gradients is fundamental during embryonic patterning. Yet, the mechanisms by which morphogens disperse remain highly controversial. In a paradigmatic example, the dispersal of the morphogen Hedgehog (Hh) is both limited by, and dependent on, its lipid modifications. To address this paradox, several competing transport models have been proposed, from lipid-shielding solubilizing factors to the transport via specialized filopodia called cytonemes. In this study we uncover that the lipid-shielding protein DmWif1/Shifted (Shf) participates in the contact-dependent cell transfer of Hh. By using nanobody-based immobilization we demonstrate the tight association of Shf and Hh to cytoneme membranes. We show that Shf is anchored to membranes by the Hh co-receptor Interference Hedgehog (Ihog), and that the Ihog-Shf complex is required for Hh dispersal and signaling. Together, our results syncretize cytoneme-mediated transport and membrane release in a single dispersal model, in which local solubilization is required for cytonemes to exchange Hh-bound Shf at cell-cell contacts between presenting and receiving cytonemes."
"BackgroundUnderstanding recombination rates is crucial in evolutionary biology, as recombination shapes genetic diversity, natural selection, and adaptation. We investigated recombination rate variation in Chironomus riparius across different latitudes, seasons, and experimental treatments using Pool-seq data from five studies and the ReLERNN neural network-based method. We examined its relationship with genetic diversity, GC content, and FST, assessing causality through structural equation modeling.

ResultsIn natural populations, recombination rates showed no clear latitudinal pattern, likely due to interactions between climate-driven selection and regional environmental heterogeneity. However, seasonal variation was evident, with higher recombination rates in autumn than winter, possibly due to temperature-induced plasticity or seasonal bottlenecks. A cold snap in March 2018 triggered a sharp recombination increase, potentially suggesting a stress-induced adaptive response. In experimental populations, thermal regimes had no direct effect on recombination, but adaptation to lab conditions was significant. Environmental stressors produced distinct responses: microplastic exposure reduced recombination genome-wide, likely due to stress-induced DNA repair prioritizing genome integrity, while cadmium exposure generally suppressed recombination.

ConclusionsOur findings reveal recombination as a highly dynamic process influenced by environment, selection, and genetic background, underscoring the importance of the context in shaping genomic architecture under both natural and experimental conditions."
"Outbreeding populations harbor large numbers of recessive deleterious alleles that reduce the fitness of inbred individuals, and this inbreeding depression potentially shapes the evolution of mating systems, acting as a counterweight to the inherent selective advantage of self-fertilization. The population biological factors that influence inbreeding depression are numerous and often difficult to disentangle. We investigated the utility of obligately-outcrossing (gonochoristic) Caenorhabditis nematodes as models for inbreeding depression. By systematically inbreeding lines from ten populations and tracking line extinction, we found that inbreeding depression is universal but highly variable among species and populations. Inbreeding depression was detected across the life cycle, from mating to embryo production to embryonic viability and larval growth, and reciprocal crosses implicated female-biased effects. In most cases, the surviving inbred lines have dramatically reduced fitness, but the variance among inbred lines is substantial and compatible with the idea that inbreeding depression need not be an obstacle to the evolution of selfing in these worms. Populations of some species, including Caenorhabditis becei, exhibited modest inbreeding depression and could be tractable laboratory models for gonochoristic Caenorhabditis."
"During meiotic cell division, homologous chromosomes align and exchange large segments of DNA through crossover recombination. Rates of recombination often show distinct differences between males and females, a phenomenon known as heterochiasmy. Despite decades of research documenting the presence of heterochiasmy across eukaryotes, the specific feature of sex leading to this curious sexual dimorphism remains to be explained. Some species, such as salmonids, also display extensive differences between the sexes in crossover positioning. A critical part of solving this puzzle is to establish whether heterochiasmy is driven by genetic sex or if it is a result of the physiological differences between producing sperm and eggs. In this study, we show that phenotypic sex determines recombination rate and distribution in hormonally sex-reversed rainbow trout. With pedigree and genotype information from 18 452 individuals and 33 913 SNP markers we map crossover events in families where the fathers were hatched as genetic XX females and sex-reversed as young trout fry with a masculinising hormone 17-methyltestosterone and compare the crossover patterns to those in families with normal XY male fathers. We find that recombination patterns in XX males resemble those of normal XY males with crossovers exclusively in sub-telomeric regions. Crossover count per gamete was 25.8{+/-}4.4 in XX females vs 19.5{+/-}3.9 and 19.9{+/-}4.0 in XY males and XX males, respectively. These results support the hypothesis that heterochiasmy arises from physiological differences between oogenesis and spermatogenesis rather than effects related to genetic sex and will aid in guiding the research on heterochiasmy going forward."
"The mountain-dwelling lizards of the genus Iberolacerta inhabit several isolated massifs across central and southwestern Europe. Their restricted and fragmented ranges, coupled with high altitude specialization in most species, entail a significant threat in the context of climate change for this group of lizards that has attracted interest from different fields. On the one hand, the alpine confinement of these relict species precedes the Pleistocene glacial cycles, and a few hypotheses have been proposed to explain it: from competitive exclusion by the wall lizards of the genus Podarcis, to adaptations to either cold or hypoxia, that would prevent them from expanding into lowlands. On the other hand, extensive research on chromosome evolution has shown Iberolacerta karyotypes to fairly differ from other lacertid lizards, exhibiting reductions in chromosome numbers and multiple sex chromosome determination systems. Here we present a chromosome-level genome assembly for Iberolacerta aurelioi, an Endangered rock lizard endemic to the Pyrenees. This genome has shed light on a genome architecture shaped by chromosome fusions, whose adaptive potential we discuss, as well as on expression shifts towards a hemoglobin isoform of enhanced oxygen affinity, as an adaptation to altitudinal hypoxia. In addition, medium coverage whole-genome sequencing data from 12 representatives encompassing all species and subspecies within the genus allowed us to address phylogenomic relationships, unveiling introgression events, gathering evidence in support of the competitive exclusion hypothesis through past demographic inference, and providing insights into homozygosity burdens, which offer valuable information for conservation efforts."
"Cytoplasmic dynein-1 (dynein) is the primary retrograde-directed microtubule motor in most eukaryotes. To be active, dynein must bind to the dynactin complex and a cargo-specific adaptor to form the active transport complex. There are nearly 20 adaptors that, despite having low sequence identity, all contain two discrete domains that mediate binding to the same regions of dynein and dynactin. Additionally, all adaptors seem to generate active transport complexes with grossly similar structures. Despite these similarities, active transport complexes formed with different adaptors show differences in their velocity, run length, and microtubule binding affinity. The molecular features in adaptors that underlie the differences in activity is unknown. To address this question, we first generated a library of synthetic adaptors by deleting or systematically swapping characterized dynein and dynactin binding domains for four endogenous, model adaptors, NINL, BicD2, KASH5, and Hook3. We then used in vitro binding assays and TIRF-based motility assays to assess each synthetic adaptors ability to bind and activate dynein and dynactin. First, we found that the adaptors coiled-coil domains, which bind dynactin and the tail domain of dynein, are necessary and sufficient for dynein activation. Second, we found that all endogenous adaptors could be modified to yield a synthetic adaptor that formed more motile active transport complexes, which suggests that there is no selective pressure for adaptors to maximize dynein motility. Indeed, our data suggest that some endogenous adaptor sequences may have evolved to generate active transport complexes that are only moderately motile. Finally, we found that one synthetic adaptor was hyperactive and generated active transport complexes that moved faster, farther, and more frequently than all other endogenous and synthetic adaptors. By performing structure-function analyses with the hyperactive adaptor, we discovered that increased random coil at key positions in an adaptor sequence increases the likelihood that dynein-dynactin-adaptor complexes that assemble will be motile. Our work supports a model where increased adaptor flexibility facilitates a type of kinetic proofreading that specifically destabilizes improperly assembled and inactive dynein-dynactin-adaptor complexes. These results provide insight into how differences in adaptor sequences could contribute to differential dynein regulation."
"Hearing and balance disorders are the most prevalent sensory impairments, affecting hundreds of millions worldwide, yet their underlying cellular and molecular pathologies remain poorly understood. This knowledge gap stems from the inaccessibility of the ears sensory organs--embedded within the temporal bone (TB), the hardest bone in the body--which cannot be biopsied in living patients without causing irreversible damage. Conventional histopathology workflows rely on postmortem en bloc extraction of TBs, followed by lengthy decalcification, celloidin embedding, and manual serial sectioning of these large specimens--a process that takes one to two years, is labor- and cost-intensive, and lacks compatibility with most modern protein, DNA, and RNA assays. Here, we present a rapid, reversible polymethyl methacrylate (rPMMA) workflow that enables advanced molecular histopathology studies on formalin-fixed, calcified, TBs. Our protocol uses low-temperature (-40 {degrees}C to +4 {degrees}C) resin embedding, precision near-serial sectioning (10-50 {micro}m) via femtosecond laser microtomy or precision diamond wire sawing, and subsequent deacrylation to fully restore tissue accessibility for high-fidelity histomorphology, multiplexed immunofluorescence, whole-genome sequencing, and in situ mRNA detection (RNAscope) assays. Compared to the gold-standard celloidin workflow, our method reduces processing time and costs by approximately 90% while integrating equivalent histomorphology with advanced molecular assays, providing a new benchmark for multidimensional studies in human hearing and balance pathologies."

"Our goal was to leverage synthetic biology approaches to engineer lung-sensing T cells that trigger synthetic transcriptional programs only when in the lung. First, we identified a lung-specific cell surface protein, receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE), expressed at high levels exclusively in the lung. Then, we engineered chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) and synthetic notch receptors (SynNotch) to bind this protein. We showed that anti-RAGE CAR-T cells traffic to and proliferate in the lung exclusively. Anti-RAGE SynNotch receptors activate transcription of a fluorescent reporter only when co-cultured with RAGE+ cell lines or primary lung cells. Finally, we tested an anti-RAGE SynNotch to anti-CD19 CAR circuit in vivo in mice implanted with lung and flank tumors and found that this approach cleared CD19-expressing lung tumors without affecting CD19-expressing flank tumors. Thus, we demonstrate that RAGE is a lung-specific target and that T cells expressing anti-RAGE receptors can sense and activate lung-specific therapeutic transcriptional programs. This approach could be extended to allow cell-based therapies that target and deliver genetically encoded payloads to treat lung diseases while avoiding systemic toxicity."
"The mental representation of multiword verb constructions is a central question in neurolinguistics: are they stored as single lexical units or completely compositional items? This study investigates the neurocognitive processing of two multiword verb types: phrasal verbs (e.g., look up) and prepositional verbs (e.g., decide on). Taking in consideration verb-to-infinitive constructions (e.g., want to go) as a control group. We analyse event-related potentials from eleven native English speakers who completed a listening task while EEG data were recorded. Grand-averaged waveforms and root-mean-square amplitudes were analysed across four-time windows. Therefore, statistical comparisons showed a significantly larger N400 amplitudes for prepositional verbs compared to phrasal verbs, while no significant differences were found between prepositional and to-infinitive constructions. Multivariate pattern analyses confirmed neural discriminability between phrasal and prepositional verbs, but not between prepositional and verb-to-infinitive structures. These results confirm that prepositional and verb-to-infinitive constructions are processed compositionally via valency-based integration, whereas phrasal verbs are stored as lexicalized units. The findings support a theoretical model in which multiword verb constructions differ in their degree of lexicalization, with measurable consequences for real-time neural processing."
"A Wnt activity gradient is essential for the formation of the anterior-posterior (AP) axis in all vertebrates. The relationship between the dynamics of Wnt signaling and specification of AP coordinates is difficult to study in mammalian embryos due to the inaccessibility of developing embryos and the difficulty of live imaging. Here, we developed an in vitro model of human neuroectoderm patterning, where the anterior-posterior axis self-organizes along the radius of a micropatterned human pluripotent stem cell colony. We used this system to study the quantitative relationship between Wnt signaling in space and time and the resulting AP patterns. We found that rather than a smoothly varying gradient along the axis, signaling is elevated in midbrain compared to either surrounding region. The timing, rather than the amplitude or duration, of the Wnt response played the most important role in setting axial coordinates. These results establish a simple system for studying the patterning of the human nervous system and elucidate how cells interpret Wnt dynamics to determine their position along the AP axis."

"Perivascular fibroblasts (PVFs) are a cell type associated with large diameter blood vessels in the brain and spinal cord parenchyma and leptomeninges. PVFs have previously defined roles in injury and neuroinflammatory diseases and predicted roles in supporting neurovascular function. The temporal dynamics of PVF development in the pre- and postnatal cerebral cortex have recently been described, however the molecular mechanisms that underly PVF development have not been identified. PVFs express both platelet derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRs), PDGFR and PDGFR{beta}. Here we investigate the role of PDGF signaling in PVF development. We use immunohistochemistry and RNA transcript detection methods to show developmental expression of PDGFRs by PVFs and examine distribution of PDGF ligand expression in the brain. We show that postnatal deletion of PDGFR in fibroblasts using the Col1a2-CreERT mouse line significantly impairs PVF coverage of cerebral vessels at postnatal day 10. Perivascular macrophages, a cell type previously shown to co-develop with PVFs, have impaired cerebral vessel coverage in conditional mutants that is similar to PVF coverage defects. This work establishes a requirement for PDGFR signaling in PVF development and may shed light upon the potential pathways that are over-activated in PVFs in injury and disease contexts."
"Ageing is a major risk factor for many neurodegenerative diseases, and the hippocampus is particularly vulnerable to the effects of ageing. To define the transcriptomic changes related to ageing and the impact of genetic variation, we analysed hippocampal gene expression data generated from a genetically diverse panel of inbred mouse strains belonging to the BXD Family. We applied a combination of differential expression, differential correlation, and weighted gene co-expression network analyses, followed by genetic mapping to delineate age-associated transcriptomic patterns and genetic modulators. This study revealed an upregulation in immune response and microglial genes. We identified a key age-associated co-expression module enriched in immune related genes, and quantitative trait locus mapping of this module uncovered a genetic regulatory locus in which Apbb1ip was the primary candidate gene. Additionally, gene level differential correlation analysis identified a substantial restructuring of the hippocampal transcriptome during ageing. Notably, Ywhab, an important signalling chaperone displayed altered gene expression correlations with >70 genes, between young and aged mice. These results provide novel insights into transcriptional dynamics of hippocampal ageing and identified the immune gene Apbb1ip as a potential modulator of immune response and microglial gene upregulation with implications for neurodegenerative disease pathogenesis.

HighlightsO_LIComplementary gene expression analyses indicated an upregulation of immune responses in the ageing hippocampus of a genetically diverse mouse cohort, likely driven by microglia subtypes.
C_LIO_LIA systems genetics approach revealed the Apbb1ip locus as a modulator of immune gene co-expression, highlighting a novel candidate regulator of age-associated neuroimmune dynamics.

"Molecular dynamics simulations based on coarse-grained (CG) models are used to accelerate conformational dynamics of biomolecules and other chemical systems with reduced computational costs. CG models achieve it by discarding atomic information necessary for downstream structural analysis. Recovering the atomic detail from CG structures, i.e. backmapping, remains a fundamental challenge in multiscale modeling, especially for proteins and complex biomolecular assemblies. Recent machine learning methods have shown promise in reconstructing atomistic details, but most approaches only target simple systems at a small scale. In particular, conventional backmapping pipelines often fail to preserve stereochemistry, induce high-energy configurations, or require extensive minimization. Here we present CGBack, a backmapping framework that employs a denoising diffusion probabilistic model to reconstruct all-atom molecular structures from CG representations. CGBack consists of backmapping and refinement procedures and accurately recovers atomic coordinates across diverse protein systems from small to large scales. We show that CGBack is capable of accurately backmapping both single-chain and multi-chain molecular systems, including densely packed intrinsically disordered proteins in condensates. These results suggest that CGBack can be a powerful tool for multiscale molecular simulation pipelines. We anticipate that CGBack will enable more efficient workflows for protein modelling, as well as for other biomolecules across different CG models."
"Structural-Maintenance-of-Chromosome (SMC) complexes such as condensins are well-known to dictate the folding and entanglement of interphase and mitotic chromosomes. However, their role in modulating the rheology and viscoelasticity of entangled DNA is not fully understood. In this work, we discover that physiological concentrations of yeast condensin increase both the effective viscosity and elasticity of dense solutions of{lambda} -DNA even in absence of ATP. By combining biochemical assays and single-molecule imaging, we discover that yeast condensin can proficiently bind double-stranded DNA through its hinge domain, in addition to its heads. We further discover that presence of ATP fluidifies the entangled solution possibly by activating loop extrusion. Finally, we show that the observed rheology can be understood by modelling SMCs as transient crosslinkers in bottle-brush-like entangled polymers. Our findings help us to understand how SMCs affect the rheology and dynamics of the genome."
"IntroductionPhysical fatigue is a key determinant of operational readiness in the physically demanding occupations of tactical athletes. Specific hormonal, immune, and enzymatic biomarkers have been proposed for fatigue assessment, but their reliability can be affected by external factors. This study aimed to explore the predictive accuracy of targeted stress-related small molecules to proteins identified via untargeted salivary proteomics in classifying physical fatigue.

MethodsTen recreationally active adults (6M, 4F) completed a fatiguing protocol designed to simulate common operational movements and intensities. Saliva samples were collected pre- and post-protocol and analyzed for targeted biomarkers using commercial immunoassays and for untargeted proteins via liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Machine learning models were trained to classify pre- vs post-exercise state using these biomarkers, with performance assessed through sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).

ResultsTargeted small molecules achieved an overall model accuracy of 86%, with immunoglobulin A and uric acid demonstrating the highest predictive power. However, a proteomic panel of four proteins (ATP1B1, STOML2, PGLYRP2, FH) exhibited superior performance, with 95% classification accuracy and improved sensitivity. Pathway analysis revealed that these proteins were involved in mitochondrial function, immune regulation, and metabolic adaptation, suggesting their role in fatigue-associated physiological changes.

ConclusionsSalivary proteomics identified biomarkers with greater sensitivity and specificity for detecting physical fatigue than targeted stress-related molecules within this sample. These findings support the potential for non-invasive proteomic monitoring of fatigue in operational and athletic settings. Future studies should validate these findings in larger, more diverse populations and assess their applicability to chronic fatigue monitoring."
"Optic flow processing is critical for the visual control of body and eye movements in many animals. Rotational and translational binocular optic flow patterns need to be clearly distinguished to induce different behavior outputs. However, the specific neuron types and their connectivity involved in this computation remain unclear. Here, we developed a method to link the functional labeling using a photoconvertible calcium indicator called CaMPARI2 and single-cell RNA-sequencing (CaMPARI-seq) to investigate the transcriptional profile of the pretectum, a center for processing optic flow in larval zebrafish. Using this technique, we identified a pretectal cluster expressing tcf7l2, which can be further classified into molecularly distinct subclusters. In vivo calcium imaging and cell ablation revealed that nkx1.2lb-positive pretectal neurons are commissural inhibitory neurons required for the optomotor response but not for the optokinetic response. Our genetic and functional dissection using CaMPARI-seq uncovered the neuronal organization essential for dissociating different optic flow-dependent behaviors."
"The intestinal microbiota plays a pivotal role in regulating metabolic processes, and its imbalance is linked to metabolic disorders. Modulating the gut microbiota composition and function through prebiotic supplementation has been repeatedly shown to improve host metabolism. While most studies have focused on the fecal microbiota due to the ease of sampling, fecal samples do not reflect the microbial dynamics throughout the gastrointestinal tract, as regional environmental conditions shape distinct microbiota composition.

Given the metabolic significance of the proximal intestine and the potential influence of microbiota on these processes, we characterized the microbiota composition along the gastrointestinal tract in a widely used model for studying host-microbiota interactions: C57Bl6J male mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) with or without prebiotics supplementation (FOS, fructooligosaccharides).

The microbiota composition, determined by long-read Nanopore sequencing, was markedly altered by HFD and FOS supplementation not only in feces but also in the jejunum, ileum and caecum. In contrast to previous observations made in humans, obesity in mice was associated with a decrease in microbiome diversity in the small intestine, highlighting species-specific microbial responses to metabolic challenges. Additionally, the pronounced bifidogenic effect of FOS supplementation in the ileum suggests FOS fermentation in the small intestine in mice, contrary to what has been previously described in humans. Finally, we report a relative homogeneity of microbiome composition along the digestive tract, possibly due to the coprophagic behavior of mice. These findings challenge the translational relevance of rodent models for studying the role of the small intestinal microbiota in human metabolic disease."
"Clinical testing and public health surveillance can be significantly improved by incorporating sequencing-based molecular detection and subtyping for real-time monitoring of virus evolution. With phylogenetic analysis used for speciation and variant subtyping, target analyte specificity can be relaxed well beyond typical parameters acceptable in PCR-based diagnostics. Hybrid capture is a promising way to enrich large numbers of sequences with maximal flexibility, using standard molecular biology laboratory equipment and small benchtop sequencers. Here, we report the development and bench validation of a hybrid capture based next-generation sequencing diagnostic panel for all known viral tick-borne pathogens, TITAN-RNA. Based on systematic testing with simulated novel viruses and field samples, we determined a 10% tolerance for evenly distributed mutations or 27% tolerance for naturally occurring viral divergence. The TITAN-RNA extrapolated limit of detection in blood is 19.1 genome copies by complementary log-log analysis, and linearity performance (R2 [&ge;] 0.99) is amenable for its use as a quantitative assay. As proof of principle for public health surveillance and evolutionary studies, we report two putatively novel segmented Flavi-like viruses in New York State, USA, identified from the invasive Haemaphysalis longicornis tick."
"IntroductionFreedom from chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) is a key objective after lung transplantation, yet predicting its onset remains challenging. This study investigated whether early proteomic changes in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) can differentiate between patients maintaining stable graft function at 36 months and those developing CLAD within the first year. Additionally, findings were compared to proteomic data from non-transplanted individuals.

MethodsBALF samples were collected at one and twelve months post-transplant from 43 lung transplant recipients together with clinical parameters. Proteomic analysis was performed using mass spectrometry with label-free quantification for global protein profiling and heavy-labelled peptides for absolute quantification of mucins and related proteins. Differentially expressed proteins were identified and analyzed through pathway enrichment to explore biological mechanisms associated with CLAD.

ResultsNo significant proteomic differences were detected at one month. By twelve months, 63 proteins were differentially expressed between patients who developed early CLAD and those with stable function. Mucin levels declined in stable patients but remained elevated in both groups compared to healthy controls. Cartilage acidic protein 1 was significantly higher in stable patients at twelve months and correlated with better pulmonary function. Pathway analysis linked several altered proteins in CLAD patients to networks associated with lung injury and remodelling.

ConclusionProtein profiles in BALF that resemble those of healthy lungs are associated with sustained graft function, while persistent expression of lung injury markers is associated with early CLAD. This suggests an adaptive process is needed for long-term post-transplant success."
"In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, glucose depletion induces metabolic reprogramming through widespread transcriptional and translational reorganization. We report that initial, very rapid translational silencing is driven by a specialized metabolic mechanism. Following glucose withdrawal, intracellular NTP levels drop drastically over 30 sec, before stabilizing at a regulated, post-stress set-point. Programmed translational control results from the differential NTP affinities of key enzymes; ATP falls below the (high) binding constants for DEAD-box helicase initiation factors, including eIF4A, driving mRNA release and blocking 80S assembly. Contrastingly, GTP levels always greatly exceed the (low) binding constants for elongation factors, allowing ribosome run-off and orderly translation shutdown. Translation initiation is immediately lost on all pre-existing mRNAs, before being preferentially re-established on newly synthesized, upregulated stress-response transcripts. We conclude that enzymatic constants are tuned for metabolic remodeling. This response counters energy depletion, rather than being glucose-specific, allowing hierarchical inhibition of energy-consuming processes on very rapid timescales."
"Radiation-induced skin injury is a poorly understood complication affecting cancer patients who undergo radiotherapy, with no current therapies able to prevent or halt its progression to debilitating radiation-induced skin fibrosis (RISF). Addressing the need for clinically relevant human models, this study developed and characterized a human ex vivo skin model that recapitulates the temporal molecular processes of cutaneous radiation injury, as demonstrated through bulk RNA-sequencing and tissue validation studies. Human skin explants subjected to ionizing radiation demonstrated rapid induction of DNA double-strand breaks, followed by a robust, p53-driven transcriptional program involving genes related to cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and senescence. Over time, the irradiated skin exhibited increasing activation of pro-fibrotic pathways, notably epithelial-mesenchymal transition and TGF{beta}1-mediated signaling. This resulted in upregulation of classic fibrosis markers such as COL1A1, FN1, and increased collagen thickness. Importantly, regulators of the p53 axis, MDM2 and miR-34a, was observed, implicating these factors as potential therapeutic targets to modulate the balance between repair of radiation injury and pathologic fibrosis. Transcriptome analysis of irradiated and non-irradiated breast skin from post-mastectomy patients showed notable concordance of p53 and pro-fibrotic gene signatures comparable to the ex vivo model, underscoring its translational relevance. This work provides a platform for identifying early biomarkers and testing therapeutic strategies to prevent or mitigate cutaneous radiation toxicities, including RISF, beginning with elucidating the dynamic interplay between the p53-mediated DNA damage response and the onset of fibrosis following radiation. Ultimately, this work aims to improve long-term skin health and quality of life for cancer patients.

One Sentence SummaryHuman ex vivo skin recapitulates a clinically relevant p53-mediated DNA damage and pro-fibrotic response to radiation."
"MotivationThe Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) platform allows for the direct detection of RNA and DNA modifications from unamplified nucleic acids, which is a significant advantage over other platforms. However, the rapid updates to ONT basecalling models and the evolving landscape of computational tools for modification detection bring about challenges for reproducible and standardized analyses. To address these challenges, we developed Dogme, which is a Nextflowbased workflow that automates the processing of ONT data, including basecalling, alignment, modification detection, and transcript quantification. Dogme automates the reprocessing of ONT POD5 files by integrating basecalling using Dorado, read mapping using minimap2 and subsequent analysis steps such as running modkit. The pipeline supports three major types of ONT sequencing data - direct RNA (dRNA), complementary DNA (cDNA), and genomic DNA (gDNA) - enabling comprehensive analyses across different library preparations. Dogme facilitates detection of diverse RNA modifications supported by Dorado such as N6-methyladenosine (m6A), 5-methylcytosine (m5C), inosine, pseudouridine, 2-Omethylation (Nm) and DNA methylation, while concurrently quantifying full-length transcript isoforms LR-Kallisto for transcript quantification for dRNA and cDNA.

ResultsWe applied Dogme to three separate mouse C2C12 myoblast replicates using direct RNA sequencing on MinION flow cells. We detected an average of 147,879 m6A, 86,673 m5C, 21,242 inosine, 24,540 pseudouridine, and 83,841 2- O-methylation sites per replicate with 96,581 m6A, 43,446 m5C, 8,825 inosine, 10,048 pseudouridine, and 30,157 2-O- methylation sites detected in all three biological replicates. The pipeline produced reproducible modification profiles and transcript expression levels across replicates, demonstrating its utility for integrative long-read transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses.

"The design of gene therapies with drug-regulatable expression of therapeutic payloads is of interest for diverse applications. We hypothesized that a regulated expression system based on alphavirus-derived self-amplifying RNAs (saRNAs), which encode 4 non-structural proteins (nsPs) that copy the RNA backbone to enable sustained expression, would have advantages in safety and simplicity of delivery. Here we designed saRNAs where payload expression is regulated by the FDA-approved drug trimethoprim (TMP), by fusing TMP-responsive degradation domains (DDs) to nsPs to regulate RNA self-amplification. Screening a library of nsP-DD fusions, we identified an optimal design with DDs fused to nsP2, nsP3, and the payload, achieving a high fold-change in expression level in response to TMP and low expression in the off state. In mice, this saRNA circuit enabled diverse dynamic expression patterns in response to oral TMP. Implementing this circuit for controlled expression of an HIV antigen, an escalating TMP regimen significantly enhanced germinal center responses critical for B cell affinity maturation. This drug- regulated RNA technology holds potential for vaccines, immunotherapies, and gene therapies."
"Pathogens deploy effector proteins to manipulate host physiology and promote infection. YopJ family effectors are highly conserved across bacterial genera that cause crop diseases. Nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat receptors (NLRs) play a central role in direct or indirect recognition of effectors and trigger immune responses, including hypersensitive cell death (HR). Two NLRs, Nicotiana benthamiana homologs of Pseudomonas tomato race 1 (NbPtr1) and HOPZ-ACTIVATED RESISTANCE 1 (NbZAR1) were recently identified as independently recognizing two YopJ family effectors, HopZ5 and AvrBsT/XopJ2. NbZAR1 also detects XopJ4 via the receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase XOPJ4 IMMUNITY 2 (JIM2). Here, we conducted Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression assays with 20 YopJ family effectors from five phytopathogenic bacterial genera and identified 12 YopJ family effectors that are recognized either by NbZAR1 or independently by NbZAR1 and NbPtr1. Furthermore, we show that YopJ family effector-induced HR was differentially suppressed by the deacetylase SUPPRESSOR OF AVRBST-ELICITED RESISTANCE 1, suggesting more than one mechanism for YopJ family effector recognition. This work provides the genetic basis of the recognition of YopJ family effectors in N. benthamiana and lays a foundation for the mechanistic study of NbZAR1/JIM2 and NbPtr1 mode of activation."
"Glioblastoma is a highly aggressive and difficult-to-treat brain cancer that resists conventional therapies. Recent advances in chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy have shown promising potential for treating glioblastoma; however, achieving optimal efficacy remains challenging due to tumor antigen heterogeneity, the tumor microenvironment, and T-cell exhaustion. In this study, we developed a mathematical model of CAR T-cell therapy for glioblastoma to explore combinations of CAR T-cell treatments that take into account the spatial heterogeneity of antigen expression. Our hybrid model, created using the multicellular modeling platform PhysiCell, couples partial differential equations that describe the tumor microenvironment with agent-based models for glioblastoma and CAR T-cells. The model captures cell-to-cell interactions between the glioblastoma cells and CAR T-cells throughout treatment, focusing on three target antigens: IL-13R2, HER2, and EGFR. We analyze tumor antigen expression heterogeneity informed by expression patterns identified from human tissues and investigate patient-specific combination CAR T-cell treatment strategies. Our model demonstrates that an early intervention is the most effective approach, especially in glioblastoma tumors characterized by mixed antigen expression. However, in tissues with clustered antigen patterns, we find that sequential administration with specific CAR T-cell types can achieve efficacy comparable to simultaneous administration. In addition, spatially targeted delivery of CAR T-cells to specific tumor regions with matching antigen is an effective strategy as well. Our model provides a valuable platform for developing patient-specific CAR T-cell treatment plans with the potential to optimize scheduling and locations of CAR T-cell injections based on individual antigen expression profiles."
"BackgroundThe global aging population is increasingly inflicted with Alzheimers disease (AD), but a cure is still unavailable. Neurotrophic Factor-1/carboxypeptidase E (NF-1/CPE) gene therapy has been shown to prevent and reverse memory loss and pathology AD mouse models However, the mechanisms of action of NF-1/CPE are not fully understood. We investigated if a non-enzymatic form of NF-1/CPE-E342Q is efficient in reversing AD pathology and carried out a proteomic study to uncover the mechanisms of action of NF-1/CPE in AD mice.

MethodsAAV-human NF-1/CPE and a non-enzymatic form, NF-1/CPE -E342Q were delivered into hippocampus of 3xTg-AD mice and effects on cognitive function, neurodegeneration, synaptogenesis and autophagy were investigated. A quantitative proteomic analysis of hippocampus of 3xTg-AD mice with and without AAV-NF-1/CPE treatment was carried out.

ResultsHippocampal delivery of AAV-NF-1/CPE-E342Q prevented memory loss, neurodegeneration and increase in activated microglia in 3xTg-AD mice, indicating its action is independent of its enzymatic activity. Quantitative proteomic analysis of hippocampus of 3xTg-AD mice that underwent NF-1/CPE gene therapy revealed differential expression of >2000 proteins involving many metabolic pathways. Of these, two new proteins down-regulated by NF-1/CPE: Nexin4 (SNX4) and Trim28 which increase A{beta} production and tau levels, respectively were identified. Western blot analysis verified that they were reduced in AAV-NF-1/CPE treated 3xTg-AD mice compared to untreated mice. Our proteomic analysis indicated synaptic organization as top signaling pathway altered as a response to CPE expression. Synaptic markers PSD95 and Synapsin1 were decreased in 3xTg-AD mice and were restored with AAV-NF-1/CPE treatment. Proteomic analysis hypothesized involvement of autophagic signaling pathway. Indeed, multiple proteins known to be markers of autophagy were down-regulated in 3xTg-AD mice, accounting for impaired autophagy. Expression of these proteins were upregulated in 3xTg-AD mice with NF-1/CPE gene therapy, thereby reversing autophagic impairment.

ConclusionsThis study uncovered vast actions of NF-1/CPE in restoring expression of networks of critical proteins including those necessary for maintaining neuronal survival, synaptogenesis and autophagy, while down-regulating many proteins that promote tau and A{beta} accumulation to reverse memory loss and AD pathology in 3xTg-AD mice. AAV-NF-1/CPE gene therapy uniquely targets many metabolic levels, offering a promising holistic approach for AD treatment.

"BackgroundGlioblastoma (GBM) remains uniformly lethal due to pronounced intratumoral heterogeneity and a highly immunosuppressive microenvironment that limits the efficacy of targeted therapies.

MethodsWe engineered chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells targeting EGFRvIII and armored them with a single-chain interleukin-12 (scIL12) payload. These cells were tested in syngeneic, orthotopic GBM mouse models exhibiting heterogeneous EGFRvIII expression. CAR T cells were delivered intracranially without lymphodepletion.

ResultsIntracranial administration of of scIL12-secreting CAR-T cells eradicated tumors without requiring lymphodepletion, achieving 50% long-term survival. Survival benefits depended entirely on endogenous CD8 T cells, as efficacy was abolished in CD8-deficient hosts and unaffected by NK cell depletion. Notably, therapeutic efficacy was abrogated by lymphodepletion, underscoring the necessity of an intact endogenous immune response. Mechanistically, scIL12 enhanced CAR-T cell persistence and reprogrammed tumor-associated microglia, indicating potential epitope spreading through polyclonal endogenous CD8+ T-cell responses, which facilitate the elimination of EGFRvIII-negative tumor cells.

ConclusionsThis study demonstrates the pleiotropic benefits of IL-12 armored CAR-T cells with improved targeting of antigen-positive tumor cells and simultaneous remodeling of the microenvironment to engage adaptive immunity against antigen-negative clones. This strategy offers a potential clinically actionable approach to improve outcomes in GBM by circumventing the need for toxic lymphodepletion and addressing tumor heterogeneity."
"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is a deadly malignancy with limited effective therapies. Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) is a promising treatment modality for patients with solid tumors but has been limited by the highly fibroinflammatory and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Transforming growth factor-{beta} (TGF{beta}) participates in the inordinately suppressive TME in PDA. Here, we test the impact of selective Tgfbr2 deletion using CRISPR/Cas9 or genetic approaches in mesothelin (Msln)-specific T cell receptor (TCR) engineered T cells during ACT of PDA. Abrogating TGF{beta} signaling augmented TCR-engineered T cell accumulation in autochthonous and orthotopic PDA models and promoted terminal effector T cells, although this largely required inclusion of a vaccine at the time of T cell transfer. While loss of Tgfbr2 impaired CD103 upregulation, it only modestly impaired donor T cell central, tissue resident, or Tcf1+Slamf6+ stem-like memory T cell formation. These attributes ultimately result in heightened functional capacity and delayed tumor growth. Unexpectedly, however, most tumor-infiltrating engineered T cells failed to differentiate into PD-1+Lag3+ exhausted T cells (TEX) regardless of TGF{beta}R2 expression and despite abundant Msln protein expression by PDA cells. Forcing Msln epitope processing in KPC tumor cells promoted donor T cell accumulation, acquisition of PD-1 and Lag3, increased IFN{gamma} production by TCR-engineered T cells refractory to TGF{beta} and bypassed the vaccine requirement for therapeutic efficacy. Thus, promoting increased antigen processing/presentation by tumor cells while abrogating Tgfbr2 in engineered T cells can sustain donor T cell function in the suppressive TME and enhance the therapeutic efficacy of ACT. Our study supports pursuit of strategies that modulate tumor intrinsic antigen processing while relieving T cell suppression to safely promote the antitumor activity of TCR-engineered T cells."
"Elucidating the gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that govern human B cell differentiation is essential for understanding immune responses to infection, vaccination and autoantigens. Here, we show that individual naive B cells can give rise to both plasma cells and germinal centre (GC) B cells. In contrast, memory B cells display a progressive increase in IRF4 activity over time, leading to PRDM1 induction and exclusive differentiation into plasma cells. Using CRISPR-based perturbations, we demonstrate that IRF4 is indispensable for both GC and plasma cell development. Notably, IRF4 promotes GC fate independently of PRDM1, as PRDM1 disruption did not impair GC differentiation. We also find that while the abundance of antibody mRNAs is clonally correlated, class switch recombination (CSR) occurs stochastically and is clonally independent. Together, these findings reveal distinct regulatory dynamics during naive and memory B cell activation and offer new insights into the GRNs underlying human B cell fate decisions."
"Enterococcus faecalis is a prolific opportunistic pathogen responsible for a range of life-threatening infections for which treatment options are increasingly limited due to the high prevalence of multidrug-resistant isolates. Cyclic di-AMP has emerged as an essential bacterial signaling molecule due to its impact on physiological processes, including osmotic adaptation, cell wall homeostasis, antibiotic tolerance, and virulence. In addition, c-di-AMP is a potent pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) molecule recognized by the host immune system to trigger protective responses. In previous work, we identified and characterized the enzymes responsible for the synthesis and degradation of intracellular c-di-AMP in E. faecalis, demonstrating that maintaining c-di-AMP homeostasis is vital for bacterial fitness and virulence. In addition to the intracellular enzymes that regulate c-di-AMP levels, a limited number of bacteria encode surface-associated nucleotidases capable of cleaving extracellular c-di-AMP, potentially facilitating immune evasion. Here, we characterize a novel and unique cell wall-anchored phosphodiesterase, termed EecP (E. faecalis extracellular c-di-AMP phosphodiesterase), which features duplicated catalytic domains and specifically degrades extracellular c-di-AMP. Deletion of eecP ({Delta}eecP) resulted in a marked accumulation of extracellular c-di-AMP. Although the {Delta}eecP strain exhibited comparable growth and behavior to the parent strain in vitro, it displayed increased susceptibility to killing by phagocytic cells. Using two murine infection models, we show that the impact of eecP deletion and the consequent buildup of extracellular c-di-AMP on E. faecalis pathogenesis may be site-specific. Notably, disseminated infection was more severe in mice infected with the {Delta}eecP strain, suggesting that extracellular c-di-AMP influences infection outcomes, likely through modulation of host immune responses.

Author SummaryEnterococcus faecalis is a major opportunistic pathogen and a leading cause of several life-threatening hospital-associated infections. Cyclic di-AMP is a bacterial second messenger nucleotide that regulates essential cellular processes and plays key roles in bacterial pathogenesis and host immune activation. We previously characterized the enzymes responsible for the synthesis and degradation of c-di-AMP in E. faecalis, demonstrating that this signaling molecule is crucial for bacterial fitness and virulence. In this study, we describe the characterization of EecP, a novel cell wall-associated enzyme that degrades c-di-AMP extracellularly. Our findings identify EecP as a new virulence factor in E. faecalis, capable of modulating infection outcomes."
"The growing illegal wildlife trade (IWT) threatens biodiversity and is a conduit for zoonotic disease, yet its risk of detection is low. Once processed, trafficked species are difficult to identify morphologically, and currently require DNA-based approaches that are time-consuming, costly, and lab-based. There is thus a need for a rapid, cheap, on-site method for species identification. We describe VeRIF-ID (Vertebrate Rapid In-Field Identification via DNA), a method that employs simultaneous on-site nanopore sequencing of four different mitochondrial DNA barcodes. Primers were designed to produce short amplicons to aid analysis of damaged DNA, and to be effective over a broad taxonomic range of vertebrates from lamprey to chimpanzee. Validation demonstrated species-level identification in 91% of 83 tested species, and genus/tribe-level identification of the remaining species (which are also problematic with existing approaches). DNA extraction, PCR and library preparation steps were simplified and optimised so that sampling to species identification takes <3 h for a single sample. Species components are identifiable non-quantitatively in prepared mixtures of muscle tissue from up to five species, and laboratory tests of Traditional East Asian Medicine samples reveal DNA from species including critically endangered saiga antelope and black rhinoceros. In conjunction with a portable BentoLab device the necessary equipment and reagents are easily portable, and we apply the method to analyse seized bushmeat and fish samples within an airport customs zone, identifying mammal and fish species in 15 samples within 6 h. The initial equipment costs for VeRIF-ID are [~]$8K, and the cost per sample of [~]$10-48 (depending on set-up), considerably cheaper than current conventional lab-based approaches. The method requires only basic hands-on skills. Ongoing trials with potential end-users will focus on establishing forensic reporting criteria prior to casework implementation. Future development of user-friendly bioinformatic interfaces will aim to fully democratise species identification."
"H/ACA small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins (H/ACA snoRNPs) facilitate essential cellular processes such as RNA modification, folding, and stability. Here, we present multiple cryo-EM structures of endogenous, catalytically active insect H/ACA snoRNPs containing two protomers assembled on a two-hairpin H/ACA snoRNA. By characterizing key protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions, we reveal the coordination of pseudouridylation activity across the two protomers which explains the predominance of two-hairpin structures in eukaryotic H/ACA snoRNAs. Moreover, we discovered that several mutations in H/ACA proteins associated with Dyskeratosis congenita directly impair pseudouridine formation suggesting how these mutations disrupt RNA modification and ribosome biogenesis in this disease. Additionally, we uncover coordinated structural changes between Nop10, Nhp2 and the N-terminal extensions of Cbf5 in the 3' protomer that resemble active and inactive conformations and may regulate H/ACA snoRNP activity. In summary, this study provides detailed insight into the structure and function of RNA modification-competent, asymmetric H/ACA snoRNPs, which play pivotal roles in cellular processes including ribosome biogenesis, rRNA folding, (m)RNA modification, and telomere maintenance.

Significance statementH/ACA snoRNPs are critical for numerous RNA processes as they utilize different H/ACA snoRNAs to introduce pseudouridines in ribosomal and other non-coding RNAs as well as mRNAs. In addition, H/ACA snoRNPs stabilize and fold RNA thereby contributing to ribosome biogenesis and telomere maintenance. Mutations in H/ACA snoRNP subunits such as dyskerin (pseudouridine synthase), Nhp2, and Nop10 cause the genetic disorder Dyskeratosis congenita. Here, we present cryo-EM structures of active eukaryotic H/ACA snoRNPs, revealing an asymmetric, dimeric complex of two protomers. We identify the key inter-protomer contact hotspots and biochemically characterize mutations at these interfaces. Our findings emphasize the importance of inter-subunit interactions for snoRNP stability and activity, providing mechanistic insight into H/ACA snoRNP function and Dyskeratosis congenita pathogenesis."
"Studying synaptic transmission and plasticity is facilitated in experimental systems that isolate individual neuronal connections. We developed an integrated platform combining polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microstructures with high-density microelectrode arrays to isolate and record single neuronal pairs from human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived neurons. The system maintained hundreds of parallel neuronal pairs for over 100 days, demonstrating functional synapses through pharmacological validation and long-term potentiation studies. We coupled this platform with a biophysical Hodgkin-Huxley model and simulation-based inference to extract mechanistic parameters from electrophysiological data. The analysis of long-term potentiation stimulation using a biophysical model revealed (-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid) AMPA and (N-methyl-D-aspartate) NMDA receptor-specific alterations, providing quantitative insights into synaptic plasticity mechanisms. This integrated approach represents the first system combining isolated synaptic pairs, long-term stability, and mechanistic modeling, offering unprecedented opportunities for studying human synaptic function and plasticity."
"BackgroundOpioid abstinence induces persistent emotional disturbances and widespread neuroplastic changes, in areas of the brain including the hippocampus. Although ketamine and its metabolite (2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine (HNK) show potential in reversing opioid abstinence-related deficits in rodents, the molecular mechanisms underlying their efficacy remain poorly understood.

MethodsMale C57BL/6J mice underwent a 3-week opioid abstinence paradigm, followed by a single (2R,6R)-HNK (10 mg/kg, i.p.) or saline injection on day 28. Sucrose and social preference tests were used to assess behavioral deficits. We conducted RNA sequencing of ventral hippocampal tissue from these mice, followed by differential gene expression and functional enrichment analyses. Additionally, Random Forest machine was applied to identify predictive differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with (2R,6R)-HNK treatment response.

ResultsTranscriptomic analysis identified 206 DEGs in morphine-abstinent mice without treatment compared to opioid-naive controls (MOR-SAL vs. SAL-SAL), implicating altered immune signaling, synaptic function, and structural plasticity. Comparison of opioid-abstinent mice treated with (2R,6R)-HNK to opioid-naive controls (MOR-HNK vs. SAL-SAL) revealed 186 residual DEGs, enriched for Th17-mediated immune and fear regulation pathways, suggesting a persistent intermediate molecular phenotype despite normalized behavioural scores. DEGs overlap analysis between MOR-HNK vs. MOR-SAL and MOR-SAL vs. SAL-SAL indicated that (2R,6R)-HNK treatment reversed 55 DEGs in opioid-abstinent mice, including Transthyretin (Ttr) and T-cell surface glycoprotein (Cd5) expression levels. Machine learning identified interleukin 1 receptor accessory protein-like 1 (Il1rapl1) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 2 beta (Ctla2b) as top predictors of (2R,6R)-HNKs treatment response. Notably, while (2R,6R)-HNK induces transcriptional changes in opioid-naive mice (SAL-HNK), it does not affect behavior compared to untreated controls (SAL-SAL). In contrast, its therapeutic effects are evident in morphine-abstinent mice (MOR-HNK), highlighting its context-dependent efficacy.

Conclusion(2R,6R)-HNK promotes both transcriptional and behavioral recovery in opioid-abstinent mice, reversing key gene expression changes. However, persistent dysregulation of neuroimmune and emotion-related pathways suggests an intermediate molecular state, reflecting ongoing recovery."
"Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are persistent environmental toxicants that bioaccumulate in the food chain and readily cross the placenta, raising concerns for developmental toxicity. While PCB exposure has been associated with metabolic and neurodevelopmental disorders, its cell type-specific effects on liver development remain poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate how maternal exposure to an environmentally relevant Fox River PCB mixture affects liver development in female offspring at single-cell resolution. We hypothesized that early-life PCB exposure disrupts hepatic metabolic and immune function in a cell type-specific manner. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on liver tissue from postnatal day 28 female mice perinatally exposed to PCBs, we identified major hepatic and immune cell populations and assessed cell-specific transcriptional responses. PCB exposure significantly altered the proportions of endothelial cells and Kupffer cells and reduced neutrophil abundance. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that PCBs dysregulated key pathways in hepatocytes and non-parenchymal cells, including ER stress responses, drug metabolism, and glucose/insulin signaling. Notably, hepatocytes exhibited upregulation of phase-I drug-metabolizing enzymes and uptake transporters, but downregulation of phase-II enzymes and efflux transporters. Kupffer cells and endothelial cells had altered immune and metabolic gene expression, and intercellular communication analysis predicted disrupted fibronectin, collagen, and chemokine signaling due to PCB exposure. RT-qPCR validation confirmed increased hepatic ER stress marker expression. Together these findings demonstrate that perinatal PCB exposure induces persistent, cell type-specific transcriptomic reprogramming in the liver, impairing metabolic and immune functions. This study highlights the utility of single-cell transcriptomics for revealing toxicant effects with cellular precision during critical windows of development."
"Flavin-binding proteins (flavoproteins) are widespread in nature, revealing versatile oxidation-reduction reactions and photochemistry. Flavoproteins derived from LOV domains are used for engineering of ligh-tresponsive tools in optogenetics, as well as fluorescent markers and photogenerators of reactive oxygen species. Despite extensiev efforts, all currently used LOV-derived proteins have similar absorption spectra with maxima around 275, 35-0375, and 450-485 nm. Here, we describe the discovery of a large Stokes shift flavi-nbased fluorescent protein, LSSFbFP, which can be obtainedin vivo and in vitro, with absorption maxima at 340-350 and 395-405 nm. Fluorescence emission of LSSFbFP mirrors that of classical FbFPs with the maximum at ~500 nm. We sho that the protein binds lumichrome as the chromophore and use low temperature and time-resolved spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography and modeling to prove that the apparent Stokes shift of LSSFbFP occurs due to excited state proton phenomena observed in flavoproteni s and pave the way for engineering of new flavin-based molecular instruments."
"Given the global impact of the cervical cancer epidemic on peoples health, it is critical to have readily available and effective screening technologies. In order to effectively fight this disease, it is crucial to identify the groups who are most at risk. Our study aims to build a robust deep learning system tailored for the classification of cervical cancer using images acquired from Pap screenings; this will allow us to tackle this challenge head-on. Our approach improves upon previous methods of visual feature detection by using a deep learning model based on transfer learning called Squeeze-and-Excitation-ResNet152. The Deer Hunting Optimization method is used to optimise the network by modifying its hyper-parameters. We test our methods on eleven distinct disease sets, with a total of 8838 images distributed differently. Sources such as CRIC and SIPaKMeD were consulted for the acquisition of these images. In order to reduce dataset bias, we use a cost-sensitive loss function all through training. Impressive performance metrics were generated by the testing set analysis, which significantly outperformed the previous methods. Accuracy was 99.74%, precision was 98.98%, recall was 98.15%, specificity was 98.97%, and F1-Score was 99.06%. We can greatly enhance the identification of problems connected to cervical cancer with our technologies. One way to achieve this goal is to make it easier for medical professionals to make quick diagnosis."
"BackgroundGene fusions play a critical role in cancer development by persistently activating kinases or inactivating tumor suppressor genes, leading to altered signal transduction and gene expression regulation. However, their impact on treatment responses remains poorly understood. Although existing cancer databases catalog numerous fusion events or immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) studies, no unified platform integrates gene fusion data across cancer types while linking them to the tumor microenvironment (TME) and patient outcomes. Such integration is essential for elucidating how fusions shape immune responses and for developing improved biomarkers for personalized cancer therapies.

MethodsTo address this gap, we constructed the Fusion Immune Atlas (ImmunoFusion), a platform integrating data from TCGA, TARGET, CPTAC, and 29 ICB cohorts (including ICB treatments and other treatment modalities) across diverse cancer types. We identified fusion events from raw RNA-seq data using Arriba and STAR-Fusion, and standardized fusion calls by adapting MetaFusion to the GRCh38 reference genome. Additionally, we curated clinical data and estimated TME signatures and cell fractions using the Immuno-Oncology Biological Research (IOBR) approach. ImmunoFusion was developed using the high-quality Rhino framework for Shiny applications, built on R.

ResultsImmunoFusion (https://shiny.zhoulab.ac.cn/ImmunoFusion) encompasses 21,014 clinical samples, serving as a comprehensive RNA-seq-derived gene fusion database and analytical tool. It offers functionalities to investigate fusion breakpoints, confidence scores, frequency patterns, and associations with clinical variables. The platform also enables TME evaluation and interactive exploration of fusions for analyzing tumor immunophenotypes in cancer and immunotherapy contexts. As an illustration, analysis of MTAP fusions in lung cancer cohorts revealed their association with a metabolically depleted, ""cold"" (immune-suppressive) tumor environment and poorer patient outcomes, pinpointing MTAP fusions as a novel biomarker for treatment selection.

ConclusionsImmunoFusion represents a significant advancement, delivering a unified platform to explore the influence of gene fusions on cancer and immune responses. It offers particular value in understanding fusion-driven immunotherapy outcomes, paving the way for more effective therapeutic strategies."
"Drug repurposing is an effective strategy to identify novel therapeutic options by leveraging existing drugs with known mechanisms of action and safety profiles. This work introduces a pathway-based drug repurposing approach that combines protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and transcriptomic data to prioritize candidate drugs. The underlying assumption is that if disease 1 and disease 2 are both associated with the same biological pathway, then drugs known to be effective for disease 2 may be potential treatments for disease 1. To explore these relationships, disease-pathway-drug triplets are constructed. Genes shared between disease 1 and the associated pathway are identified, and their proximity is calculated within the PPI network using a Z-score based on random permutations. Candidate drugs for disease 2 are then analyzed using the Connectivity Map data, assessing whether their up- or down-regulated gene signatures are enriched for the genes contributing to the proximity between disease 1 and the pathway. This integration enables the ranking of candidate drugs based on their potential biological impact on disease 1. Finally, top-ranked drug-disease associations are evaluated through manual curation of the scientific literature to assess existing evidence supporting the proposed repurposing hypothesis."
"BACKGROUNDTo explore hub genes and pathways related to sarcopenia progression associated with mitochondria and macrophage activation.

METHODSGEO datasets GSE8479, GSE1428, and GSE136344 were obtained based on GEO database. MRGs and MARGs were acquired. Thereafter, GO, KEGG, GSEA and PPI analysis were implemented. Later, pooled GEO datasets (Combined Datasets) were further obtained to construct the sarcopenia diagnostic model and sarcopenia subtypes.

RESULTSA total of 62 M&MARDEGs were finally identified. There were altogether 9 model genes incorporated into the multifactorial regression model. Immunoinfiltration analysis revealed low scores of M&MARDEGs in the samples with sarcopenia. For macrophage activation in sarcopenia samples, most immune cells were strongly correlated in LowScore group (r = -0.707, p < 0.05). Many immune cells in Mitochondria & Macrophage Activation (HighScore) group were strongly correlated with each other (r = -0.661, p < 0.05).

CONCLUSIONScreening key genes for sarcopenia associated with mitochondrial and macrophage activation in this study assists in understanding the pathogenesis of sarcopenia and providing new targets for intervention."
"The preparation of cryo-EM samples by soft-landing mass spectrometry promises to significantly simplify sample optimization, which has remained an important bottleneck in single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). However, only compacted configurations are observed after soft-landing since the proteins are dehydrated in the process. Here, we demonstrate that proteins can be returned to their native state by depositing a layer of amorphous ice and briefly flash melting the sample to rehydrate the soft-landed proteins. Melting with a 30 {micro}s laser pulse creates a broad ensemble of partially rehydrated conformations. However, a subset of particles recovers their native configuration. This allows us to propose strategies to fully rehydrate the entire ensemble and brings routine sample preparation by soft-landing mass spectrometry within reach. Finally, the experiments also expand the toolbox of microsecond time-resolved cryo-EM for initiating a broader range of protein dynamics."
"Pongamia pinnata (Linn.) Pierre, also called Millittia pinnata or Indian beach, is a fast-growing legume tree that has gained considerable attention for its potential as a feedstock for biofuel. In this study, we assessed the growth characteristics and carbon sequestering potential of Pongamia grown under sub-tropical environments. At two different sites located in Queensland, Australia, Pongamia was found to produce considerable biomass, even when planted in nutrient-poor environments having low soil organic carbon. The seedlings planted were all derived directly from genetically diverse, yet related seed. Variability observed in growth appeared to be associated with the mother tree from which the seeds were sourced, underscoring the importance of planting elite genetic material for commercial purposes. Pongamia is known to be drought tolerant, with findings here demonstrating that even young seedlings have this characteristic. Collectively, our findings indicate that Pongamia can grow quickly, reaching a biomass of 13-19 kg over 3-4 years in our studies, and sequester high quantities of carbon, at 2.9 to 4.0 t of carbon per ha (assuming a tree density of [~]450/ha), even when planted in suboptimal growing conditions on marginal, nutrient-poor lands."
"Mobile genetic elements (MGEs) play a critical role in shaping the response and evolution of microbial populations and communities. Despite distinct maintenance mechanisms, different types of MGEs can form nested structures. Using bioinformatics analysis of 14,338 plasmids in the NCBI RefSeq database, we found transposons to be widespread and significantly enriched on plasmids relative to chromosomes, highlighting the prevalence of transposon-plasmid nesting. We hypothesized that this nested structure provides unique adaptive advantages by combining transposition-driven genetic mobility with plasmid-mediated copy number amplification. Using engineered transposon systems, we demonstrated that nesting enables rapid and tunable responses of transposon-encoded genes in fluctuating environments. Specifically, transposition maintains a reservoir of the encoded genes, while plasmid copy number fluctuations further amplify the dynamic range of gene dosage, thus enhancing the response speed and stability of transposon-encoded traits. Our findings demonstrate an adaptive benefit of transposon-plasmid nesting and provide insights into their ecological persistence and evolutionary success."
"Tumors are highly heterogeneous tissues, and this heterogeneity impacts metastasis and its progression. Spatial data are essential for studying these hetrogeneity. However, its limited resolution makes crucial the integration of spatial data with molecular networks to identify relevant genes for the progression of metastasis. We develop a new data integration method, named iTissue, based on Graph Non-negative Matrix Tri-Factorization that integrates spatial and single-cell transcriptomics with molecular interaction networks, producing low-dimensional space. For three clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) patients, we applied iTissue to their tumour-core and tumour-normal interface samples. We identified the top 100 with the highest euclidean distance between these two samples, since we show that the genes with the highest euclidean distance are relevant for ccRCC. By taking the intersection of the top 100 genes for the three patients, we identify 50 genes enriched in GO-BP terms relevant for metastasis. Moreover, we find that we can cluster the three regions of the tumour-normal interface (healthy tissue, tumour tissue and interface) using the identified genes. Our framework is general and can enable insight into other diseases."
"Adaptive decision-making emerges from the integration of innate preferences and learned experiences to guide behavior. Using Drosophila larvae as a model, we investigated the neural circuitry underlying olfactory processing, focusing on Odd neurons--a distinct neuronal population that receives innate valence signals from Kenyon cells (KCs) rather than lateral horn inputs. Through larval connectomics, trans-tango labeling, and detailed anatomical analyses, we found that Odd neurons integrate innate valence through dendro-dendritic connections with KCs and learned valence via inhibitory inputs from mushroom body output neurons (MBON-g1 and MBON-g2). Optogenetic silencing of Odd neurons disrupted larval chemotaxis and associative memory by selectively impairing memory retrieval, while sparing memory formation, and by altering the turn rate during navigation. These results suggest that Odd neurons serve as an integrative hub, converging innate olfactory cues with learned reinforcement signals to fine-tune navigational choices. This study illuminates how distinct neural pathways converge in the larval brain to shape behavior, offering novel insights into decision-making circuitry that may extend to more complex nervous systems."
"Recent advancements in neuroproteomics have enabled detailed analysis of protein expression and function in the human brain. Post-mortem human brain studies have significantly advanced our understanding of the relationship between genetics, cell biology of neurological and psychiatric disorders and their clinical diagnosis. Given the central role of the synapse in these disorders, we evaluated the sensitivity of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to detect synaptic proteins in whole-tissue lysates versus synaptosome preparations. First, we optimized sample preparation protocols for frozen human gray matter (GM), refining the suspension TRAPping (S-TRAP) digestion method to improve protein solubilization using thin tissue sections and to accomplish low technical variation by minimizing sample handling. Together, we achieved a highly reproducible sample preparation workflow by rigorously applying standardization and randomization across dissection, processing, and LC-MS/MS runs. Comparative LC-MS/MS analysis showed that whole-tissue lysates are practical for large-scale studies and broadly detecting synaptic proteins. However, enrichment by synaptosome isolation offered improved resolution of synapse-specific proteins. Because synapse-proteomics enables insight into spatial regulation--i.e., alterations at the synapse that are not reflected in the soma- we recommend a tiered approach: initial whole-tissue analysis for broad disease-associated changes, followed by targeted synaptosome proteomics to deepen insight into synaptic alterations. This strategy optimally balances throughput, reproducibility, and biological relevance, and enhances the study of brain disorders through proteomics. Moreover, analyzing synaptic proteins first at the tissue level improves insight into overall regulation of synaptic proteins induced by synapse loss or gain."

"Obesity is associated with structural alterations of brain regions that support eating behavior. Exposure to air pollutants might exacerbate this association through neurotoxic effects on the brain. This study evaluated whether air pollution exposure 9-10 years old children, coupled with brain microstructure development in appetite-regulating regions, is associated with body mass index (BMI) changes over two years, and whether these associations differ by sex.

Data were gathered from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study(R) (nbaseline=4,802, ages=9-10, males=49.9%, nfollow-up=2,439, ages=11-12, males=51.1%). Annual average estimates of ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ground-level ozone (O3), and redox-weighted oxidative capacity (Oxwt, a joint measure of NO2 and O3) were gathered from youths residential addresses. Brain microstructure in 16 subcortical regions was assessed using diffusion-weighted MRI, focusing on proxies of cellular and neurite density: restricted normalized isotropic (RNI) and directional (RND) diffusion, respectively. Linear mixed-effects models examined whether air pollution and brain microstructure are related to BMI changes over two years, and whether these associations differed by sex.

Exposure to PM2.5 coupled with high RND estimates in right caudate nucleus, bilateral putamen, and pallidum were associated with higher BMI over time, with pronounced effects in males (all p<0.05).

PM2.5 coupled with greater neurite density in regions involved in reward-processing and decision-making were associated with higher BMI over a 2-year follow-up, especially in males. This research highlights air pollution as a modifiable risk factor for how differences in basal ganglia neurite density map onto obesity risk, with important implications for public health policy.

"Alzheimers disease (AD) is characterised by the accumulation of beta-amyloid (A{beta}) and tau proteins, leading to neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. While A{beta} and tau are known to disrupt synaptic function, the mechanisms linking these molecular pathologies to network-level dysfunction and memory impairment remain poorly understood. Here we investigated the effects of A{beta} and tau pathology (CSF A{beta}42/40 ratio and tau phosphorylated at position 181, p-tau-181, respectively) on effective connectivity (EC) related to memory encoding, which may constitute a link between synaptic pathology and cognitive outcomes. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during visual memory encoding was acquired from participants of the multicentric DZNE Longitudinal Cognitive Impairment and Dementia Study (DELCODE), including 203 cognitively normal older participants (CN) as well as individuals with subjective cognitive decline (SCD; N = 204), mild cognitive impairment (MCI; N = 65), and early dementia due to AD (DAT; N = 21). EC was assessed by applying Dynamic causal modelling (DCM) to the fMRI data, using brain regions previously implicated in memory-encoding: the parahippocampal place area (PPA), the hippocampus (HC) and the precuneus (PCU). Disruptions in forward connectivity from the PPA to the HC and PCU were associated with both memory impairment and indices of AD pathology. Specifically, reduced excitatory EC from the PPA to the HC was associated with higher p-tau-181 levels and correlated with poorer memory performance. Diminished inhibitory EC from the PPA to the PCU was driven by both tau and amyloid pathology and was likewise linked to memory decline. Our findings suggest that disrupted forward connectivity within the temporo-parietal memory network constitutes a candidate mechanism mediating the relationship between molecular pathology and cognitive dysfunction."
"Linking behavior to its neuroanatomical basis in non-conventional model species remains a significant challenge due to the scarcity of imaging and molecular tools. Commonly used approaches such as electrophysiological recordings rely on precise stereotaxic atlases or species-specific antibodies, while optogenetics requires transgenic lines which are largely unavailable beyond classical model organisms (e.g., mice, rats, zebrafish). Moreover, surgical lesion studies, a staple for verifying brain structure and behavior relationships, are logistically complex in species lacking atlases or living in aquatic environments. Here, we present a protocol integrating Manganese-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MEMRI) and MR-guided High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) to overcome these limitations, which we demonstrate in the convict cichlid (Amatitlania nigrofasciata), a teleost fish lacking conventional neuroscience tools. MEMRI enables non-invasive, sub-millimeter resolution mapping of brain activity during behavior, and HIFU facilitates precise, surgery-free lesioning of targeted regions, adaptable to species without stereotaxic atlases. This combined approach offers a versatile, broadly applicable framework for linking brain structure and behavior in non-model organisms, advancing evolutionary and comparative neuroscience."
"Cells regulate protein synthesis, folding, and degradation to maintain proteostasis, and disruptions in these processes have been linked to neurodegenerative diseases. In Alzheimers disease (AD), the protein Tau mislocalizes from axons to the somatodendritic compartment and aggregates into pathological filaments. Although Tau aggregation is a hallmark of AD, the subcellular dynamics of its synthesis and degradation are not well characterized. Because nascent polypeptides are particularly susceptible to misfolding, local control of Tau synthesis and degradation may be essential to prevent aggregation. Here, we develop STARFISH, a method for visualizing the subcellular site of endogenous mRNA translation in primary neurons and in vivo with single-molecule sensitivity and near-codon resolution, without modifying the nascent polypeptide. Using STARFISH, we show that despite the broad distribution of Mapt mRNA, Tau is translated almost exclusively in neuronal dendrites, revealing an unexpected level of spatial regulation. We further identify that one-third of newly synthesized Tau is co- or peri-translationally degraded in dendrites by a neuronal-specific plasma membrane-associated proteasome, the neuroproteasome. Failure of neuroproteasome-mediated degradation leads to the protein synthesis-dependent accumulation of somatodendritically mislocalized Tau aggregates. These findings define a previously unrecognized proteostasis mechanism that counterbalances the constitutive physiological overproduction of Tau. We speculate that failure of this proteostasis system contributes directly to Tau aggregation in dendrites, defining a new pathomechanism in Alzheimers disease."
"Drug addiction is characterized by neuronal adaptations that support a shift from goal-directed behaviors to habitual, compulsive drug-seeking with persistent effects on cognition and decision-making. Emerging evidence increasingly indicates that astrocytes are also involved in nervous system disorders, including addiction, but the cocaine-induced astrocyte-specific transcriptome has not yet been investigated. We utilized whole cell sorting of astrocytes, RNA-sequencing, and bioinformatic approaches to characterize the astrocyte transcriptome in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a key brain region involved in reward-processing, following cocaine self-administration, prolonged abstinence, and ""relapse"" in male mice. We found that astrocytes exhibit robust and contextually-specific transcriptional signatures that converge strongly with human cocaine use disorder. Bioinformatic analysis revealed CREB as a highly ranked predicted upstream regulator of cocaine-induced transcriptional regulation in NAc astrocytes, and CUT&RUN-sequencing mapped increased CREB binding across the astrocyte genome in response to cocaine. Viral-mediated manipulation of CREB activity selectively in NAc astrocytes, in combination with several measures of addiction-related behaviors including conditioned place preference and self-administration, revealed that astrocytic CREB increases the rewarding and reinforcing properties of cocaine. This effect is sex-specific, with no change in astrocytic CREB activity or CPP found in females. Subsequent experiments identify potential molecular mechanisms of astrocytic CREBs influence through modulating astrocytic Ca2+ signaling in response to cocaine. Finally, we show that astrocytic CREB selectively modulates D1-type medium spiny neurons in NAc to control cocaine-related behaviors. Together, these data demonstrate that the astrocyte transcriptome responds robustly to cocaine and that CREB mediates cocaines effects on gene expression in astrocytes, with consequent effects on neuronal activity and rewarding responses to the drug."
"IntroductionElectromyography (EMG) remains the gold standard for estimating the Resting Motor Threshold (RMT) Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) studies, but its cost and limited accessibility often lead researchers to use visual inspection (VIS). However, VIS may introduce variability and systematic bias. Accelerometry (ACC) offers a cost-effective, objective alternative to capture TMS-evoked responses.

ObjectiveTo compare the RMT as estimated using EMG, ACC, and VIS.

MethodsFive participants underwent TMS while EMG, ACC, and video recordings were collected. Separately, 64 observers judged hand movement in videos to estimate RMT via VIS. RMTs were compared across the three methods using Bayesian model comparison, Bland-Altman analyses, and Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICCs).

ResultsRMTs estimated via EMG were lower than those obtained using either ACC or VIS. Compared to EMG, VIS tended to overestimate RMT (mean bias = 5.23%, 95%CI = [1.00-11.00]), while ACC and VIS estimates were more closely aligned (mean bias = 0.43%, 95%CI = [-4.00 - 5.00]). ICC (2,1) values indicated moderate reliability for VIS vs EMG (mean = 0.580, 95%CI = [0.389 - 0.748]), and good-to-excellent reliability for VIS vs ACC (mean = 0.845). However, bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals identified significant variability in the estimates provided by visual inspection, ranging from +1 to +11 for VIS vs EMG, but as low as -4 to +5 for VIS vs ACC.

ConclusionsEMG remains the most sensitive technique for estimating the RMT, but when EMG is not feasible, accelerometery provides a quantifiable, more objective, and less variable alternative than visual inspection.

HighlightsVisual inspection introduces observer-related variability in RMT estimation

Visual inspection & accelerometry systematically overestimate RMT compared to EMG

EMG remains the most sensitive method for estimating RMT

Accelerometry is an objective alternative to visual inspection if EMG is unavailable"
"Safe and effective vaccines against co-circulating mosquito-borne orthoflaviviruses such as Zika virus (ZikV) and the four serotypes of dengue virus (DenV1-4) must elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) to prevent the risk of enhancement of infection by non-neutralizing antibodies. We recently discovered new orthoflavivirus-directed bnAbs, including F25.S02, which neutralizes DenV1-4 and ZikV with comparable or superior potency to the previously characterized E dimer epitope (EDE) bnAbs. Mutagenesis studies of viral envelope proteins showed that the epitope specificity of F25.S02 is distinct from EDE1 bnAbs. Here, we used cryoEM and X-ray crystallography to understand the basis of cross-neutralization of F25.S02 at the molecular level. We obtained a [~]4.2 [A] cryoEM structure of F25.S02 Fab bound to a stabilized DenV3 soluble E protein dimer and a 2.3 [A] crystal structure of F25.S02 Fab bound to ZikV soluble E protein dimer. Like previously described EDE1 bnAbs, the structural epitope of F25.S02 is at the E dimer interface, encompassing predominantly conserved regions in domain II, including the fusion loop. However, unlike EDE1 bnAbs, F25.S02 binding is almost entirely dependent on the heavy chain and is shifted slightly away from the dimer symmetry axis. Our findings emphasize the importance of this cross-neutralizing site of vulnerability for DenV and ZikV that can facilitate rational design of vaccines and therapeutics."
"The cell surface harbors thousands of distinct proteins whose function depend on continuous cycles of internalization and replenishment. Disturbances in this turnover are typical hallmarks of many diseases. Yet, tools to study the dynamics of most surface proteins are suboptimal or unavailable. Here, we present a new method that enables the analysis of surface protein turnover of virtually any surface protein at endogenous levels. Our approach combines CRISPR/cas9-mediated genome engineering with a cleavable recombinant probe, which addresses many of the shortcomings of current methodologies. We demonstrate the capabilities our method by studying the internalization behavior of a previously uncharacterized surface protein and by assessing the effect of ligands and activity modulators in the endocytic behavior of established receptors. In summary, our method represents a versatile strategy to explore surface protein biology and enhances our ability to study the mechanisms of membrane protein retrieval and recycling."
"Cellular plasticity and transitional cellular states are crucial for tissue regeneration across multiple organs. In the pancreas, oncogenic Kras hijacks this program, acting on tissue-specific enhancers to prevent the resolution of acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM) and lock regeneration into a pro-inflammatory state that progresses to cancer. Enhancer transcription, an early event during cellular state transitions, can generate stable enhancer-associated long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) positioned near key transcription factors and chromatin contact boundaries, often enriched for disease-associated variants. While enhancer-associated lncRNAs have been implicated in transcriptional regulation and genome organization, their role in pancreas regeneration and cancer initiation has remained unexplored.

In this study, we investigated the expression of epithelial long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and their target genes in PDAC precursor lesion formation. We focus on lncRNAs transcribed from enhancer elements near cell identity transcription factors. We demonstrate that LINC00673, expressed from a Sox9-associated super-enhancer during pancreatic development, is reactivated in PDAC. Conditional deletion of LINC00673 in the murine pancreatic epithelium accelerates resolution of ADM and significantly impairs PDAC initiation. Notably, LINC00673 harbors a variant associated with risk of developing PDAC. Our study identifies a critical function of LINC00673 in regulating both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous processes during pancreas regeneration and Kras-driven cancer initiation. Furthermore, we highlight a previously unrecognized role of transcribed super-enhancers in facilitating long-range gene regulation during pancreatic cancer initiation. These findings reveal a novel regulatory layer linking developmental enhancer activity, cellular plasticity and pancreatic disease progression.

TeaserLong noncoding RNAs from developmental enhancers play a role in long-range gene regulation with crucial biological impacts in development and cancer.

"Immunological variations of bats throughout their life cycle represent an underexplored and controversial topic that has great potential for understanding their immunology. This gap is particularly large regarding the state of immunity during early life and migration, and how different immune components interact with each other. In this study, the partial migratory long-nosed bat (Leptonycteris yerbabuenae) was used as a model to assess the state of acquired humoral immunity (total IgG concentration, tIgG) during early life, during the reproductive cycle and at the extremes of the migratory range of females. We also determined the relationship of tIgG with plasma bactericidal activity against Escherichia coli. The concentration of tIgG was stable throughout the reproductive cycle of adults, and no significant changes were detected at the extremes of the migratory range of females. However, tIgG concentration was reduced during early life (2 to 3 months of age) and in non-reproductive males in March-May 2019 relative to non-reproductive males in March 2020. The tIgG concentration had a positive relationship with plasma bactericidal ability in non-reproductive females, but no relationship was observed in non-reproductive males and reproductive females. These results suggests that tIgG concentration is resilient to physiological and ecological changes experienced by adults throughout their reproductive and migratory cycle. The reduction of tIgG during early life suggests that young individuals have not developed an IgG pool comparable to that of adults. Finally, the positive relationship observed between tIgG and BKA in non-reproductive females suggests that E. coli clearance is enhanced by the presence of antibodies that facilitate the elimination of this bacteria."
"BackgroundBreeding pelagic seabirds feed over wide areas. Their diet and space use can therefore provide proxies for otherwise be difficult to observe environmental conditions but interpretation of these proxies requires knowledge of foraging range. Antarctic sea ice regulates global climate, but a paucity of data on its past extent causes uncertainty in climate reconstruction and prediction. Deposits of stomach oils, produced defensively by snow petrels Pagodroma nivea (near-obligate sea-ice foragers), reflect sea ice conditions, sometimes over tens of millennia, but spatial interpretation of these biological archives is hampered by lack of data on foraging range, and how this varies seasonally, among colonies and with sex.

MethodsWe tracked 34 and 60 snow petrels using light-based geolocators and GPS loggers, respectively to estimate foraging ranges at three colonies located 180-200 km inland in Dronning Maud Land. We tested whether foraging latitude is associated with ice edge latitude, estimated via satellite remote sensing. We then projected potential foraging ranges for all known colonies on the study area to reexamine assumptions made in paleoclimate studies.

ResultsDuring most breeding stages, and across breeding seasons, core home ranges were centred approximately 2{degrees} south of the outer sea-ice edge and tracked this habitat as it receded during the spring melt. Females were approximately 7% lighter than males but foraged at similar distances and in similar areas. Foraging ranges differed little between colonies but substantially between breeding stages. For example, median range was [~]1,400 km during the pre-laying exodus vs. [~]550 km during brood-guard.

ConclusionsSnow petrel stomach-oil deposits potentially integrate environmental conditions over greater and more seasonally variable areas than previously assumed, probably with a bias towards conditions in the outer Marginal Ice Zone during the early summer when stomach oil deposition due to nest competition is likely greatest. Projected potential home ranges of snow petrel colonies in the western Weddell Sea suggest that breeding is limited by access to foraging habitat, such as coastal polynyas. We hypothesise that as sea ice fluctuated over previous glacial-interglacial cycles, this also regulated breeding distribution across the region."
"BackgroundDrosophila melanogaster has been a valuable model for dissecting the molecular architecture of innate immunity. However, the family Drosophilidae encompasses over 4000 species, spanning deep evolutionary divergences and diverse ecologies. Here, we use immune challenge with the gram-negative pathogen Providencia rettgeri to investigate the conservation and evolution of immune responses in three non-model drosophilid species that diverged from D. melanogaster over 45 million years ago--Hirtodrosophila cameraria, H. confusa, and Scaptodrosophila deflexa.

ResultsWe find that all three species retain a core set of immune signaling and recognition genes, but exhibit substantial variation in effector gene content and inducibility. In particular, Scaptodrosophila deflexa lacks orthologs of multiple antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) known from D. melanogaster, including DptA, AttA, and AttC, and shows little transcriptional response to bacterial-challenge with Providencia rettgeri. In contrast, both of the Hirtodrosophila species exhibit substantial transcriptional responses, including strong induction of canonical Imd pathway genes. Microbiome profiling of our samples revealed higher Providencia abundance in H. cameraria, and high levels of the defensive symbiont Spiroplasma in S. deflexa--potentially explaining differences in infection outcome. Our combined annotation and expression analysis of these species also allowed us to identify 20 novel AMP-like candidates, many with structural features like known AMPs.

ConclusionsOur study demonstrates the feasibility of functional immune analyses in non-model Drosophila species and reveals striking lineage-specific differences in immune gene repertoire and expression. These findings highlight the importance of non-model, wild-derived taxa for uncovering novel immune effectors and understanding evolutionary forces shaping insect immunity."
"AimTo investigate how past climate change has shaped the genetic diversity and demographic responses of tarantulas across latitudes, and to test whether climate-demography relationships vary with latitude.

LocationGlobal; spanning tropical to temperate regions.

TaxonTarantulas (family Theraphosidae).

MethodsWe compiled mitochondrial Cytochrome oxidase I (COI) sequences for 48 tarantula species worldwide, including newly generated sequences, to estimate nucleotide diversity ({pi}) and Tajimas D. Species distribution models (SDMs) were constructed under present-day and Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) climatic conditions to quantify changes in habitat suitability since the LGM. Using generalized linear models (GLMs), we tested whether genetic and demographic metrics were associated with latitude and climate-driven habitat change, and whether their relationship varied with latitude.

ResultsPairwise correlations among latitude, habitat change, and genetic metrics showed no significant associations. However, GLMs revealed a significant interaction: the effect of habitat suitability change on Tajimas D was strongly positive at high latitudes but negative or negligible at low latitudes. This indicates that demographic responses to past climate change varied latitudinally. Several high-latitude species showed genetic signatures of demographic expansion and range increase since the LGM.

Main conclusionsOur results support the hypothesis that species at higher latitudes experience stronger demographic fluctuations due to historical climate change, aligning with Darwins early predictions. Moreover, patterns of demographic growth in temperate taxa suggest that some species may benefit from recent warming, consistent with Janzens climatic variability hypothesis. These findings demonstrate that climate-driven genetic and demographic responses in tarantulas are shaped by latitude, highlighting the importance of integrating phylogeography with ecological niche modeling to understand species resilience under climate change."
"The rapid development of genome sequencing techniques in recent decades has revolutionized the field of evolutionary biology, facilitating the study of adaptation and speciation at the genome level. Genomic data has also become a cornerstone in conservation management, allowing inferences of population demography and genetic diversity. Here, we sequenced the genome of the holotype specimen of the elusive lesula (Cercopithecus lomamiensis), a recently described member of the guenons (tribe Cercopithecini) endemic to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Using published and novel genomic data, we explore the evolutionary and demographic history of C. lomamiensis and its sister species C. hamlyni, the only two members of the hamlyni species group. We estimate that the two species split ca. 3-4 million years ago, and find that they both show high genetic diversity despite being listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. We identify signatures of positive selection in the hamlyni group in genes involved in, e.g., pelage coloration and immune functions, as well as skeletal morphology and locomotor behavior, potentially related to their terrestrial lifestyle which stands out among the otherwise arboreal Cercopithecus genus. We specifically explored whether introgression from more distantly related terrestrial guenons was involved in the evolution of terrestriality in the hamlyni group. However, molecular convergence with other terrestrial species was low, suggesting that putative terrestrial adaptations occurred largely independently. By sequencing the C. lomamiensis genome, this study provides insights into the demography and evolutionary history in a threatened primate lineage, with relevance to conservation management."
"The ends of linear eukaryotic chromosomes are protected from being recognized as DNA double-strand breaks by telomeres, containing repetitive DNA sequences which bind specific proteins. In humans, mutations in telomere regulatory genes lead to short or long telomere syndromes. These syndromes often show genetic anticipation, where disease has earlier onset and a more severe manifestation in each new generation. Later generations inherit not only the mutation affecting telomere length, but also abnormal length telomeres.

Many aspects of telomere length homeostasis are conserved between mammals and yeast. Here we explored telomere length inheritance patterns through the sexual cycle in yeast. Analysis of single telomeres, rather than bulk telomeres, shows that if haploid yeast with short telomeres mate with wild-type yeast creating diploids, short telomere lengths rapidly normalize (within 30 cell divisions). However, long telomeres inherited from one parent can persist for more than 200 mitotic cell divisions. Long telomere can also be transmitted through more than one round of meiosis, independently of mutations that cause long telomeres. These patterns, along with haploinsufficiency effects, show that even in yeast there is a complex relationship between telomere length, telomere length inheritance, and mutations that affect telomere length. Our findings may have implications for families affected by telomere syndromes.

Article summaryTelomeres protect the ends of chromosomes from DNA damage responses. In humans, mutations causing short or long telomeres, lead to inherited disease syndromes, often showing evidence of genetic anticipation. Here we show that in budding yeast, long telomeres can be transmitted through several generations in the absence of mutations causing the long telomere phenotype. Therefore, even in a simple single-celled eukaryotic organism, complex patterns of telomere length inheritance occur.

"Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) crops, engineered to produce insecticidal proteins such as Vip3Aa and Cry toxins, have revolutionized pest management by providing a sustainable alternative to chemical pesticides. However, the development of resistance to these toxins has driven the investigation of underlying mechanisms to better understand how pests evade toxicity and to develop more effective resistance management strategies. Recently, a laboratory-selected Spodoptera frugiperda strain exhibited a high level of resistance to Vip3Aa (resistance ratio: 5562-fold), with the mutation of the chitin synthase gene, SfCHS2, identified as a key factor. In this study, we extend these findings to additional lepidopteran species, including Spodoptera exigua and Agrotis ipsilon. Our results show that CHS2 knockout strains lack the peritrophic matrix (PM), while the resistant Sfru_R3 strain retains its PM. Knockout of this gene in five lepidopteran species resulted in high levels resistance to Vip3Aa. Notably, homozygous knockout strains suffered significant fitness costs and had difficulty surviving on corn leaves, in contrast to the Sfru_R3 strain, which showed no such survival issues. These findings further validate the role of the CHS2 gene in Vip3Aa resistance and highlight its potential as a target for resistance management in lepidopteran pests. This study advances our understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind resistance to Vip3Aa and supports the development of strategies to delay resistance in Bt crop management."
"Recent work has shown how to test conditional independence hypotheses between an outcome of interest and a large number of explanatory variables with false discovery rate control (FDR), even without access to individual level data. In the case of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) specifically, summary statistics resulting from the standard analysis pipeline can be used as input of a procedure which identifies distinct signals across the genome with FDR control. This secondary analysis requires sampling of negative controls (knockoff) from a distribution determined by the linkage disequilibrium patterns in the genome of the population under study. In prior work, we have pre-computed this distribution for European genomes, starting from information derived from the UK Biobank. Thus, researchers working with European GWASes can carry out a knockoff analysis with minimal computational costs, using the distributed routine GhostKnockoffGWAS.

Here we introduce and release a new software (solveblock) that extends this capability to a much richer collection of studies. Given a set of genotyped samples, or a reference dataset, our pipeline efficiently estimates the high-dimensional correlation matrices that describe correlation structures across the genome, making rather common sparsity assumptions. Taking this sample-specific estimate as input, the software identifies groups of genetic variants that are highly correlated, and uses them to define an appropriate resolution for conditional independence hypotheses. Finally, we compute the distribution for the exchangeable negative controls necessary to test these hypotheses. The output of solveblock can be passed directly to GhostKnockoffGWAS, allowing users to carry out the complete analysis in a two step procedure.

We illustrate the performance of the routine analyzing data from five UK Biobank sub-populations. In simulations, our method controls FDR. Analyzing real data relative to 26 phenotypes of varying polygenicity in British individuals, we make an average of {approx} 19 additional discoveries, compared to standard marginal association testing. Our code, precompiled software, and processed files for these five sub-populations are openly shared."
"The study of mitochondrial genetics has long been limited to polymorphisms and high frequency mutations owing in part to technical and technological limitations in reliably detecting and quantifying rare somatic mutations. Over the past decade or so, the study of rare somatic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variants has expanded and continues to garner increasing interest in a wide range of research fields. Here, we describe a unique molecular identifier (UMI)-based library preparation and Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) method for the identification and quantification of ultra-rare mutations in the mtDNA control region. Our method exploits degenerate primers to label individual mtDNA molecules. This is followed by several purification, quantification and amplification steps, to obtain high quality amplicons for sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq platform. This method enables the use of total genomic DNA extract as starting point for the assay, overcoming the need for organelle isolation and/or mtDNA enrichment, hence broadening the type of specimen that can be studied, while offering cost and time benefits. The assay described herein has been demonstrated to reliably measure somatic variants present at approximately 0.05% variant allele frequency in a variety of tissues, including fresh and frozen biobanked specimens. Using this protocol, library preparation of 300 specimens can be completed by a single individual with general nucleic acid handling experience in approximately 20 days. Given its flexibility and scalability, this method is particularly well suited for epidemiological studies using a large number of specimens."
"Interindividual genetic variation associated with cardiovascular traits and disease is commonly found in the non-coding genome, suggesting regulatory changes underlie many genetic association signals. Mammalian gene regulation is controlled by promoters and enhancers with rapidly divergent activities. However, the interplay between human non- coding genetic variation and regulatory evolution remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigated promoter and enhancer evolution in the mammalian heart using genome-wide epigenomic profiling, intersected these elements with genetic variants associated with cardiovascular traits, and experimentally tested candidate regions in human cardiomyocytes derived from pluripotent stem cells. First, we applied a comparative genomics approach to identify epigenomically-conserved promoters and enhancers in the heart, as well as elements with primate-specific or human-only epigenomic signals. Second, we evaluated the association of common genetic variation and signatures of cell-type specific gene regulation with mammalian epigenomic conservation. We report an enrichment of common genetic variants in epigenomically-conserved promoters and enhancers, which also associate with regulatory pleiotropy across cardiac cell types, and promoter-enhancer contacts in cardiomyocytes. Based on these findings, we selected candidate epigenomically-conserved elements across three cardiovascular genetics loci (KCNH2, CPEB4 and PRKCE), and investigated gene expression and cellular outcomes upon CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of each region in human cardiomyocytes. These analyses inform how mammalian epigenomic conservation associates with specific gene expression contributions and downstream cellular responses, such as cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and sensitivity to hypoxia/reoxygenation. Moreover, the comparative analyses we present here contribute to ongoing efforts to prioritise and functionally characterise cardiovascular association signals from human population genetics."
"Centromeres are a specialized chromatin domain that are required for the assembly of the mitotic kinetochore and the accurate segregation of chromosomes. Non-coding RNAs play essential roles in regulating genome organization including at the unique chromatin environment present at human centromeres. We performed Chromatin-Associated RNA sequencing (ChAR-seq) in three different human cell lines to identify and map RNAs associated with centromeric chromatin. Centromere enriched RNAs display distinct contact behaviors across repeat arrays and generally belong to three categories: centromere encoded, nucleolar localized, and highly abundant, broad-binding RNAs. Most centromere encoded RNAs remain locally associated with their transcription locus with the exception of a subset of human satellite RNAs. This work provides a comprehensive identification of centromere bound RNAs that may regulate the organization and activity of the centromere."
"The Drosophila accessory gland performs functions analogous to the mammalian prostate in production of seminal fluid components that are essential for male fertility. The mammalian prostate and Drosophila accessory glands share a similar tissue organization and structure. Both organs contain secretory epithelial cells forming a gland lumen, surrounded by a stroma with extracellular matrix enveloped by innervated muscle for organ contraction and fluid release. However, the Drosophila accessory gland secretory epithelium is postmitotic, polyploid and binucleate, and lacks a known stem cell population. By contrast, the mammalian prostate epithelium is made up of diploid luminal secretory cells and diploid basal cells that are maintained by at least two stem cell populations. Despite the differences in the tissues, it has been argued these tissues may share a  deep homology based on the expression of conserved genes during development. Here we performed a cross-species comparative analysis using single-cell RNA sequencing data from adult tissues using data from the Drosophila Fly Cell Atlas and mammalian adult prostate single-cell datasets. Our analysis provides additional evidence of transcriptomic similarity between the main epithelial cells of the Drosophila prostate-like accessory gland and the basal epithelial cells of the mammalian prostate. While we do not know whether these similarities reflect shared evolutionary homology, or independently derived features due to shared tissue functions, our results strengthen the arguments that the Drosophila accessory gland can be used to effectively model aspects of human prostate biology and disease."
"Animals flexibly adjust posture and movement in response to vibrational sensory input to extract information from dynamic environments. While sensorimotor transformations have been extensively studied in visual and somatosensory systems, their structure remains poorly understood in substrate-borne vibration sensing. Here, we combine high-resolution web vibration recordings with fine-scale behavioral tracking in the orb-weaving spider Uloborus diversus to dissect the sensorimotor basis of prey capture.

Using unsupervised modeling, we identified discrete behavioral states that structure spider capture sequences, achieving over 83% classification accuracy. We then developed a predictive framework combining a linear-filtered generalized linear model (GLM) with a hidden Markov model (HMM) that robustly forecasts behavioral transitions across diverse prey vibration contexts. Notably, spiders exhibit context-dependent motor transitions--such as crouching and shaking--following decreases in prey vibrational power, consistent with active sensing behaviors that enhance signal detection. Furthermore, spiders reliably turn toward the web radius exhibiting the highest vibration amplitude during prey localization, demonstrating that amplitude alone predicts turning direction.

These findings reveal a structured, predictive sensorimotor transformation linking external vibration cues to internal behavioral states. Our results highlight general principles of active sensing and closed-loop control in non-visual invertebrate systems, with broader implications for sensorimotor integration across species."

While sensorimotor transformations have been extensively studied in visual and somatosensory systems, their structure remains poorly understood in substrate-borne vibration sensing. Here, we combine high-resolution web vibration recordings with fine-scale behavioral tracking in the orb-weaving spider Uloborus diversus to dissect the sensorimotor basis of prey capture.

Using unsupervised modeling, we identified discrete behavioral states that structure spider capture sequences, achieving over 83% classification accuracy. We then developed a predictive framework combining a linear-filtered generalized linear model (GLM) with a hidden Markov model (HMM) that robustly forecasts behavioral transitions across diverse prey vibration contexts. Notably, spiders exhibit context-dependent motor transitions--such as crouching and shaking--following decreases in prey vibrational power, consistent with active sensing behaviors that enhance signal detection. Furthermore, spiders reliably turn toward the web radius exhibiting the highest vibration amplitude during prey localization, demonstrating that amplitude alone predicts turning direction.

These findings reveal a structured, predictive sensorimotor transformation linking external vibration cues to internal behavioral states. Our results highlight general principles of active sensing and closed-loop control in non-visual invertebrate systems, with broader implications for sensorimotor integration across species."
"Falls are one of the leading causes of non-disease death and injury in the elderly, partly due to the loss of muscle mass in a musculoskeletal disorder named sarcopenia. Studying the impact of this muscle weakness on standing balance through direct human experimentation poses ethical dilemmas, involves high costs, and fails to fully capture the internal dynamics of the muscle. To address these limitations, we employ neuromusculoskeletal modeling to explore the impact of sarcopenia on balance. In this study, we introduce a novel full-body musculoskeletal model comprising both the torso and lower limbs, with 290 muscle actuators controlling 23 degrees of freedom and supporting varying levels of sarcopenia. Using reinforcement learning coupled with curriculum learning and muscle synergy representations, we trained an agent to perform standing balance on a backward-sliding plate and compared its behavior to human experiments. Our results demonstrate that, without pre-recorded experimental data, both healthy and sarcopenic agents can reproduce ankle and hip balancing strategies consistent with experimental findings. Furthermore, we show that as the degree of sarcopenia increases, the agent adapts its balancing strategy based on the platforms acceleration."
"Prediction of stroke is a critical challenge in healthcare, where early intervention can significantly reduce risks and improve patient outcomes. Traditional methods often struggle with imbalanced datasets and low prediction accuracy. This paper proposes a novel approach to address these issues by combining PSO-optimized Stacked Ensemble ML Classifiers with SMOTEEN data balancing to predict strokes effectively. The technique optimizes 3 Baseline ML Classifiers(RF, SVM, XGB) using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Stacked Ensemble approach is applied that significantly improving prediction performance. The proposed methodology achieved an impressive 95.57% accuracy, outperforming conventional models such as SVM, LR, RF, KNN, XGB. Overall, the PSO-optimized stacked ensemble approach outperforms traditional machine learning techniques in stroke prediction, providing a more accurate and robust model for early detection and intervention."
"Dimensionality reduction and clustering are critical steps in single-cell and spatial genomics studies. Here, we show that existing dimensionality reduction and clustering methods suffer from: (1) overfitting to the dominant patterns while missing unique ones, which impairs the detection and annotation of rare cell types and states, and (2) fitting to technical noise over biological signal. To address this, we developed DR-GEM, a self-supervised meta-algorithm that combines principles in distributionally robust optimization with balanced consensus machine learning. DR-GEM supervises itself by (1) using the reconstruction error to identify and reorient its attention to samples/cells that are otherwise poorly embedded, and (2) using balanced consensus learning as a mechanism to increase robustness and mitigate the impact of low-quality samples/cells. Applied to synthetic and real-world single cell  omics data, single cell resolution spatial transcriptomics, and Perturb-seq datasets, DR-GEM markedly and consistently outperforms existing methods in obtaining reliable embeddings, recovering rare cell types, filtering noise, and uncovering the underlying biology. In summary, this study surfaces and addresses a gap in single cell genomics and brings self-supervision to the realm of dimensionality reduction and clustering to better support data-driven discoveries."
"Nanobodies have emerged as promising protein therapeutics due to their high-stability, low immunogenicity, and ease of production. However, experimental screening of high-affinity nanobodies for specific antigens and their post optimization remain costly and time-consuming, mainly due to the large number of possible variants. Here, we developed a computational approach that integrates graph neural networks (GNNs) with Monte Carlo Metropolis algorithm for nanobody design. We constructed a GNN model, AiPPA, to predict the protein-protein binding free energy (BFE) without requiring the complex structure, achieving a Pearson correlation of 0.62 on benchmark. We then combined AiPPA with Metropolis importance sampling to design low-BFE nanobodies from a non-affinity template. We applied this method to the antigen TL1A, and generated two affinity nanobodies. This work establishes a physics-informed deep learning method for computational nanobody design, providing a novel development strategy for protein therapeutics."
"Agonists of the glucagon receptor (GCGR) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP1R) are key to treating metabolic diseases like type 2 diabetes and obesity, but often limited by being linear. Cyclic peptides offer greater stability and potential oral delivery, but their de novo design with computational methods as agonists is unproven. Here, we used the EvoBind AI platform to design cyclic peptide agonists for GCGR from sequence alone, without any structural templates or prior binding site information. EvoBind consistently identified the receptors activation surface, producing peptides that also activated GLP1R. Of three synthesised peptides, two showed potent dual activation of GCGR and GLP1R in cAMP assays, while all three activate GLP1R, with the 18-residue design achieving EC50 values of 32 nM (GLP1R) and 542 nM (GCGR), rivalling natural hormones. The designed sequences show no similarity to known agonists, and structural modelling indicates that they adopt novel binding modes compatible with active-state stabilisation. This is made possible by EvoBinds purely sequence-based, template-free approach, which enables the discovery of alternative solutions that are inaccessible to structure-guided methods. This study presents the first successful blind de novo design of a cyclic peptide agonist for a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), using only the receptor sequence as input. The findings highlight EvoBinds capacity to go beyond static binding, offering a generalisable strategy for therapeutic discovery through target-agnostic, sequence-driven peptide design."

"Species-specific orphan genes (orphans) lack homologues outside of a given taxon and frequently underlie unique species traits. It is thus important to elucidate the evolutionary origins of orphans. Orphan genes can result from sequence divergence beyond recognition, when homologous proteins diverge to an extent at which tools that rely on sequence similarity to establish homology can no longer identify them as homologues. Orphans can also result from other processes, including de novo gene emergence from previously noncoding sequences, in which a homologous protein-coding gene truly does not exist.

Here we propose that orphans resulting from divergence might be recognizable from their patterns of non-statistically significant similarity hits which are almost always discarded. To test this, we simulated diverged orphan protein sequences based on conserved proteins from the Unified Human Gastrointestinal Protein catalogue (UHGP) and used reversed protein sequences as negative data sets. We trained four machine learning classifiers on features extracted from the similarity search tool DIAMONDs output, like total query coverage or maximum bit score. We tested the influence of evolutionary parameters such as simulation tree branch length, indel rate and among-site rate heterogeneity.

We found that the performance of the models depends on the simulation parameters: when the underlying simulated divergence was moderate, accuracy reached [~]90%, but when extremely diverged scenarios where simulated accuracy dropped to [~]70%. The most important features for the classification were the number of alignments (hits) and the minimum hit E-value. When applying our classifier on a set of [~]170,000 eligible simulated orphans from the UHGP dataset, we found that [~]30% of them are predicted to be divergent and these are shorter and more disordered than the rest. Our classifiers and pre-processing python scripts are available at https://github.com/emiliostassios/Classification-of-divergent-genes-using-ML and can be readily used as a computationally fast means to obtain a candidate set of diverged orphans from any similarity search output. Therefore, our work allows to study such orphans across the tree of life and in doing so to recover cases of remote homology, get better estimates of the evolutionary age of protein families, detect cases of rapid divergence and more generally better understand how genetic novelty arises."
"Down syndrome (DS) is caused by trisomy of chromosome 21 and is associated with diverse clinical manifestations, yet the molecular pathways linking chromosome-21 dosage effects to DS comorbidities remain poorly defined. Here we address this gap by applying a network-based, integrative framework that combines whole-blood transcriptomic data with gene-trait associations to uncover mechanistic insights into DS-associated conditions. First, we performed matrix factorization using PLIER on Human Trisome Project (HTP) RNA-Seq profiles from 304 trisomy-21 (T21) and 95 euploid (D21) individuals, deriving 156 biologically interpretable gene modules. We then identified 92 modules whose activity differed significantly between T21 and D21 and annotated these with prior-knowledge and KEGG pathways. To connect modules to clinical traits, we integrated PrediXcan-derived TWAS results from the UK Biobank, revealing 25 T21-specific modules with significant gene-trait associations (FDR < 0.1), including modules linked to cardiovascular, hematological, immune, metabolic, and neurological phenotypes relevant to DS. Using HTP clinical records as a replication cohort, 13 of these modules reliably predicted comorbidity status (AUC > 0.65, mAPS > 0.65). Most notably module 37, an interferon-stimulated gene network, whose elevated expression robustly distinguished DS individuals with pulmonary hypertension (AUC = 0.76, mAPS = 0.73). Overall, our study demonstrates that integrating blood-derived gene modules with population-scale genetic data uncovers coherent molecular signatures underlying DS comorbidities, identifies candidate biomarkers and therapeutic targets (e.g., ISG15, IFITs, MX1), and highlights the power of combining transcriptomic and genetic evidence to elucidate complex disease mechanisms."

"Traditional differential gene expression methods are limited for analysis of single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) studies that use paired repeated measures and matched cohort designs. Many existing approaches consider cells as independent samples, leading to high false positive rates while ignoring inherent sampling structures. Although pseudobulk methods address this, they ignore intra-sample expression variability and have higher false negatives rates. We propose a novel meta-analysis approach that accounts for biological replicates and cell variability in paired scRNA-seq data. Using both real and synthetic datasets, we show that our method, single-cell MetaIntegrator (https://github.com/Khatri-Lab/scMetaIntegrator), provides robust effect size estimates and reproducible p-values."
"Live-cell imaging captures dynamic cellular processes, but many structures remain beyond the diffraction limit. Fluctuation based super-resolution techniques reach beyond the diffraction limit by exploiting correlations in fluorescence blinking. However, the methods require the acquisition of hundreds of frames and involve computationally intensive post-processing, which can take tens of seconds, thereby limiting the suitability for real-time sub-diffraction imaging of fast cellular events. To address this, we use the recursive neural network model termed MISRGRU, which integrates sequential low-resolution frames to extract spatio-temporally correlated signals. Using super-resolution optical fluctuation imaging as a target, our approach not only significantly improves temporal resolution but also doubles the spatial resolution. We benchmark MISRGRU against the widely used U-Net architecture, evaluating performance in terms of resolution enhancement, training complexity, and inference latency using both synthetic data and real microtubule structures. After optimizing MISRGRU, we demonstrate a 400-fold reduction in computational latency compared to SOFI, highlighting its promise as an efficient, real-time solution for live-cell super-resolution imaging."
"The gut microbiome modulates metabolic, immune, and neurological functions and has been implicated in Alzheimers disease (AD), though the specific mechanisms remain poorly defined. The bacterial metabolite imidazole propionate (ImP) has been previously associated with several AD comorbidities, such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Here, we show that elevated plasma ImP levels are associated with lower cognitive scores and AD biomarkers in a cohort of >1,100 cognitively unimpaired individuals. Metagenomic profiling identified gut bacteria encoding putative orthologs of the ImP-synthesizing enzyme, urocanate reductase (UrdA), whose abundance correlated with both cognitive measures and multiple AD biomarkers. Chronic ImP administration to mice activated neurodegenerative pathways, worsened AD-like neuropathology, and increased blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability. Complementary in vitro studies showed that ImP compromised the integrity of human brain endothelial cells. Collectively, these findings implicate ImP in AD progression via both neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular mechanisms, identifying it as a potential target for early intervention.

One Sentence SummaryGut bacterial metabolite increases dementia risk."
"Building on established methods for molecular docking, structure-based deep learning has recently yielded important advances in virtual drug screening. We present simpatico, a method that follows an alternate approach, based on the field of Representation Learning, to dramatically speed the process of accurate drug screening. Simpatico employs graph neural networks to produce high-dimensional embeddings for the atoms of proteins and small molecules, and uses these embeddings to rapidly produce accurate predictions of the interaction potential for drug candidates with target protein pockets. Simpatico can search a database containing 600 million drugs for good binding candidates to a single protein pocket in 2.5 hours on a single GPU. Despite being >1000x faster than state of the art docking and diffusion-based methods, simpatico is competitive with the most accurate of those methods. We also observe that simpatico embeddings can be used to explore toxicity risk and to identify proteins with similar binding potential. Simpatico is open source software; all code, weights, and data may be accessed at https://github.com/TravisWheelerLab/Simpatico."
"N-acetyl L-leucine (NALL, USAN or levacetylleucine, INN or trade name Aqneursa) is an FDA-approved agent for the treatment of Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC). The N-acetyl group renders the compound a prodrug of L-leucine, making it a substrate for membrane-spanning monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs), which are ubiquitously expressed delivering NALL to all tissues with high capacity, including to the central nervous system. NALL enters enzyme-controlled pathways that correct metabolic dysfunction and enhance mitochondrial bioenergetics. Because NALL improves energy production (adenosine triphosphate, ATP) and ameliorates lysosomal function, it is potentially a therapy for a broad range of neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders (in addition to lysosomal storage disorders) in which energy homeostasis and lysosomal function are impaired.

Here, we have performed a series of in vitro studies which reveal an additional aspect of NALLs polypharmacological mechanism of action. The studies demonstrate a direct lysosomal effect whereby NALL rapidly activates the translocation of the Transcription Factor EB (TFEB, a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy) from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in HeLa cells. The activation of TFEB is known to trigger the activation of specific genes that restore lysosomal biogenesis and function, as well as autophagy. Consistent with this, we show that NALL increases production of a TFEB target gene LAMP1, an integral lysosomal membrane protein responsible for maintaining lysosomal integrity, function and pH. This in vitro effect occurs at concentrations consistent with concentrations in plasma in humans after standard therapeutic dosing. We further demonstrated that acetylation is critical to this aspect of NALLs mechanism of action, as L-leucine itself had no effect on the activation of TFEB. Consistent with previous studies N-acetyl-D-leucine was inactive and also had no effect. Similarly, N-acetyl-DL-leucine also had only a modest effect, providing further evidence that N-acetyl-D-leucine is even antagonistic and inhibits the effects of the active L-enantiomer.

This mechanism of action of NALL to activate TFEB signalling, thereby enhancing lysosomal and autophagic function, further elucidates the ways by which this compound targets the fundamental etiology of rare and common neurodegenerative disorders, from Niemann-Pick disease type C to Parkinsons disease. Based on its mechanism of action by improving the mitochondrial-lysosomal axis, NALL has the potential to be an effective therapy for a broad range of neurological and neurodevelopment conditions."
"Plants participate in intricate interactions with a multitude of microorganisms, many of which also influence each other. This holobiont is situated in a chemical soil environment that is defined, in parts, by the specialised metabolite legacy of proximal and preceding organisms, including other plants. Here, we investigated the influence of external plant-derived specialised metabolites on the interactions among root-associated bacterial strains, and between these strains and a plant host. Using benzoxazinoids and their derivatives as a model in both simplified pairwise experiments and more complex multi-organism analyses, we show that these chemicals can modulate bacteria-bacteria, as well as bacteria-plant interactions. While the chemical environment alone had little effect on the plant at the molecular level, it differentially affected plant chemical defences, immunity, and sugar transport when combined with single-isolate or micro-community inoculums. Our study underlines the importance of the chemical environment in modulating organismic interactions and illustrates the value of combining reduced-complexity, bottom-up reconstruction approaches with top-down holobiont profiling.

SIGNIFICANCEMany plant species secrete specialized metabolites into the soil, where they can have a long-lasting effect on subsequent plant generations and their associated microbiomes. Understanding the effect of this chemical environment on soil- and plant-associated microbiomes is crucial to determine the impact of soil legacy on host plants, for example in the context of crop rotations. Here, we report that the interactions among root-associated microbes are modulated by specialized metabolites of the benzoxazinoid family, which are prominent metabolites in many grasses. We further show that the chemical environment can inhibit the defence capacity of the plant towards colonizing bacteria, and that more complex bacterial communities are able to mitigate these effects. Our work highlights the importance of deconstructing bacterial communities and the chemical environment to gain insights into the fine-tuned molecular mechanisms that determine the outcome of complex organismic interactions."
"Tall-grass expansion in natural plant communities is a concern under current global change scenarios. Driven by factors such as community vulnerability and the competitive abilities of tall-grass species, this phenomenon is exemplified by Brachypodium rupestre (Host) Roem. & Schult, a perennial tall-grass native to Europe. B. rupestre spreads aggressively in the grasslands of the western Pyrenees due to a disrupted regime of lack of herbivory and recurrent burnings that has persisted over several decades. This study aims to investigate whether the contrasted managements of grazing, abandonment and burnings have promoted specific reproductive traits and impacted the population genomics of B. rupestre. Nine sites varying in cover of B. rupestre classified into three expansion phases associated to different management regimes were monitored: i) scattered populations in multispecific grazed sites, ii) stand populations expanding at sites of relaxed grazing or abandonment, and iii) superdominant populations constituting dense degraded covers in recurrently burned sites. ddRADseq data showed high genomic diversity but relatively low genomic structure, likely due to substantial gene flow and the absence of wind barriers. The standardized index of association supported asexual reproduction in all populations, which is coupled with sexual reproduction. Contrasting management practices did not promote distinct genomic identities between expansion phases; rather, the genetic differentiation and divergence of populations responded to life history and spatial isolation, even within a small geographic area. The similar levels of genetic diversity and the significantly different number of clones between expansion phases suggest a complex pattern of genotypic and clonal variability, which may be influenced by environmental factors (historical disturbance regimes)."
"O_LIThe competitor, stress-tolerator, ruderal (CSR) theory, first proposed by John Philip Grime, is a useful framework for understanding plant ecological strategies and predicting responses to environmental changes and pressures. However, current tools for assigning CSR strategies are limited to an Excel sheet format and have yet to be integrated into modern computational platforms that enable reproducible research.
C_LIO_LIWe present CSRcalculator (https://github.com/TeddyGaskin/CSRcalculator), an open-source R package and shiny application that calculates CSR scores and assigns strategies based on user-uploaded trait data. CSRcalculator supports CSR assignments according to the three most prominent models: The original soft approach, the global StrateFy, and a morpho-physiological model.
C_LIO_LIThe R package outputs a table including CSR scores, assigned strategies and intermediate traits for the selected model. The shiny application produces this same table alongside an interactive ternary plot to visualise the strategy distribution and an optional summary table describing the overall CSR strategy distribution, using metrics such as, the modal strategy, axis means, standard deviations, and ranges. Group-level analyses calculate the same statistics across user-defined categories.
C_LIO_LIWe provide a worked example using our tool to assign CSR strategies to plants for an example dataset.

"In this study, we describe the cytotoxic and antibacterial capabilities of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) synthesized from Dillenia indica leaves. Here, we used an environmentally friendly method to synthesize GNPs and then characterized them using techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), UV-visible spectroscopy, XRD, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The Surface Plasmon Resonance of GNPs was identified by an absorption peak at 533 nm in the UV-visible spectroscopic studies. The biosynthesized GNPs had an average size of 83 nm and were spherical in shape, according to TEM examination. Its interesting to note that the biosynthesized GNPs exhibited antibacterial action against a variety of bacterial isolates, both Gram-positive and negative. By using an MTT assay, growth inhibition and the cytotoxic effect of the synthesized GNPs against Daltons lymphoma cell lines were also evaluated."
"We describe a Q-learning approach to optimized chemotherapy dose scheduling in a stochastic finite-cell Markov process that models tumor cell natural selection dynamics. The three competing subpopulations comprising our virtual tumor are a chemo-sensitive population (S), and two chemo-resistant populations, R1 and R2, each resistant to one of two drugs, C1 and C2. The two drugs are toggled off or on which constitute the actions (selection pressure) imposed on our state-variables (S, R1, R2), measured as proportions in our finite state-space of N cancer cells (S + R1 + R2 = N). After the converged chemo-dosing policies are obtained, corresponding to a given reward structure, we focus on three important aspects of chemotherapy dose scheduling. First, we identify the most likely evolutionary paths of the tumor cell populations in response to the optimized (converged) policies. Second, we quantify the robustness in the ability to reach our target of balanced co-existence in light of incomplete information in both the initial cell-populations as well as the state-variables at each step. Third, we evaluate the efficacy of simplified policies which exploit the symmetries uncovered from an examination of the full policy. Our reward structure is designed to delay the onset of chemo-resistance in the tumor by rewarding a well-balanced mix of co-existing states, while punishing unbalanced subpopulations to avoid extinction."
"There is a long history of using experimental and computational approaches to study noise in single-cell levels of mRNA and proteins. The noise originates from a myriad of factors: intrinsic processes of gene expression, partitioning errors during division, and extrinsic effects, such as, random cell-cycle times. Although theoretical methods are well developed to analytically understand full statistics of copy numbers for fixed or Erlang distributed cell cycle times, the general problem of random division times is still open. For any random (but uncorrelated) division time distribution, we present a method to address this challenging problem and obtain exact series representations of the copy number distributions in the cyclo-stationary state. We provide explicit cell age-specific and age-averaged results, and analyze the relative contribution to noise from intrinsic and extrinsic sources. Our analytical approach will aid the analysis of single-cell expression data and help in disentangling the impact of variability in division times."
"Humans perform tasks involving the manipulation of inputs regardless of how these signals are perceived by the brain, thanks to representations that are agnostic to the stimulus modality. Investigating such modality-agnostic representations requires experimental datasets with multiple modalities of presentation. In this paper, we introduce and analyze SemReps-8K, a new large-scale fMRI dataset of 6 subjects watching both images and short text descriptions of such images, as well as conditions during which the subjects were imagining visual scenes. The multimodal nature of this dataset enables the development of modality-agnostic decoders, trained to predict which stimulus a subject is seeing, irrespective of the modality in which the stimulus is presented. Further, we performed a searchlight analysis revealing that large areas of the brain contain modality-agnostic representations. Such areas are also particularly suitable for decoding visual scenes from the mental imagery condition. The dataset will be made publicly available."
"Although generated by different mechanisms, electroen-cephalography (EEG) rhythms and blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) activity have been shown to be correlated. The level of correlation varies between EEG frequency bands, brain regions and experimental paradigms, but the underpinning mechanisms of this correlation remain poorly understood. Here we create a mathematical, data-informed model of a cortical microcircuit that encompasses all major neuron types across cortical layers, and use it to generate EEG and BOLD under various external input conditions. The model exhibits noise-driven fluctuations mimicking EEG rhythms, with external inputs modulating EEG spectral characteristics. Consistent with experimental results, we observe negative alpha-BOLD correlation and positive gamma-BOLD correlation across different input configurations. Temporal variability of the input is found to increase EEG-BOLD correlation and to improve the correspondence with experimental results. This study provides a mathematical framework to theoretically study the correlation of EEG and BOLD features in a comprehensive way."
"Progressive neurodegenerative diseases involve neuronal dysfunction from cellular to circuit to whole-brain levels, but complexity and variability, both between and within diseases, pose significant research challenges. However, although they are differentiated by anatomical origins, vulnerable neuronal subtypes, and specific misfolded proteins, neurodegenerative diseases also share many important features. During presymptomatic disease phases, neural networks initiate multiple compensatory processes to maintain network function, including increased network centralisation and reliance on a rich-club of hub nodes, which have been proposed as common reconfigurations to neural network damage. Currently, while supporting evidence for such mechanisms has been found in some neurodegenerative diseases, it is limited in others, like ALS. This knowledge gap makes it challenging to ascertain if there are indeed common pre-symptomatic mechanisms within and across different neurodegenerative diseases. To address this, we investigated the structural and functional properties of ALS patient derived motor neuron networks and counterpart networks from a healthy donor using longitudinal multielectrode array recordings and graph theory-based network analysis. We demonstrate microscale-level motor neuron dysfunction, including TDP-43 proteinopathy, hyperactivity and reduced spike amplitude. Structurally, we observed neurite hypertrophy, indicating that degenerating networks attempt to establish new connections. We furthermore document mesoscale-level functional reconfigurations, including increased rich-club connectivity and network assortativity, indicating functional compensation in ALS where networks become more centralised to maintain computational capacity. We thus provide novel evidence that ALS networks become increasingly centralised, which places progressively mounting demands on a rich-club, predisposing networks to further damage, consistent with existing models of common reconfigurations in neurodegenerative disease.

Significance statementThis study makes significant contributions to preclinical modelling of neurodegenerative disease, with specific relevance for ALS research. By utilising human cellular models, longitudinal extracellular electrophysiology, and advanced network analysis, we show that known features of ALS can be recapitulated in in vitro engineered neural networks, and that these networks allow for novel hypothesis testing and identification of pre-symptomatic pathological processes including increased centralisation. This has previously been observed in other neurodegenerative diseases, but evidence has been limited in ALS. Our results advance our understanding of motor neuron network dynamics in ALS and contribute to a shared understanding of how neurodegenerative diseases affect neural networks which go beyond specific disease diagnosis, elucidating fundamental processes in neural network function and disease response."
"In humans, the neural processing of millisecond time is associated with the activation of a wide range of brain areas and involves different types of neural responses. Unimodal tuning to stimulus duration, for example, has been observed in some of these areas but not in others, and its presence is either inconsistently reported or appears redundant along the cortical hierarchy. Moreover, how this duration tuning supports different functions or perception remains unclear. To address these questions, we measured brain activity with ultra-high field (7T) functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) while participants performed a visual duration discrimination task. Using neuronal-based modeling we estimated unimodal responses to visual durations across a multitude of cortical areas defined with high anatomical precision. In the parietal and premotor cortices, and the caudal portion of the supplementary motor area (SMA), we observed neuronal populations tuned to the full range of presented durations, spatially clustered in well-defined maps. In contrast, in the rostral SMA, inferior frontal cortex, and anterior insula, neuronal units showed duration preferences centered around the mean of the presented duration range. This preference also correlated with the perceptual boundary participants used to solve the task. Differences in preference, spatial clustering, and behavioral correlation suggest distinct functional roles for these cortical areas--ranging from abstract duration representations for readout and task-related goals in the parietal and premotor cortex, to more categorical and subjective representations in the insula and inferior frontal cortex. In line with these hypothesized roles, we also observed distinct patterns of correlation in duration preferences across these cortical regions. Overall, our findings provide a framework for a more comprehensive understanding of the neural circuits and mechanisms underlying duration processing and perception in vision."
"Degraded vision (caused by pathological reasons or monocular viewing) has been shown to affect fine motor control. However, there is a dearth of work examining the effects of ""cataract-like"" blur on reach-to-grasp performance. There is, however, a trend towards amblyopic blur being associated with deficits in reach-to-grasp performance, suggesting that timely intervention in treating cataracts is likely to be essential to maintain a functional ageing population. 18 participants performed a reach-to-grasp task. They reached for and precision grasped high and low-contrast cuboid targets under three visual conditions: binocular blur, monocular blur (full vision in the other eye) and full vision. They also performed contrast sensitivity, stereoacuity and visual acuity tests. Visual blur was associated with changes to the kinematics of prehensile movements early/acceleration stage (maximum acceleration and maximum velocity) and maximum grip aperture. Visual blur also caused the period from first contact with the target to the time it was lifted (dwell time) to be elongated. These results suggest that changes in prehension associated with visual blur are linked to differences in the planning and online control of prehension movements."
"Humans possess a unique capacity for technical reasoning--the ability to infer and manipulate the causal structure of the physical world. Although this faculty is central to technological innovation, its neural substrates remain incompletely understood. Here, we show that grey matter volume in the left cytoarchitectonic area PF, within the supramarginal gyrus of the inferior parietal lobule, selectively predicts and accurately classifies technical reasoning performance in healthy adults (N = 75; 54 females; mean age = 20.92 {+/-} 3.28 years). This association persists independently of demographic factors, personality traits, and total brain volume. By contrast, grey matter volume in right prefrontal regions, examined as control areas, correlates with broader cognitive functions--namely, fluid intelligence and abstract reasoning, but not with technical reasoning. These findings support the hypothesis that the left area PF is a domain-specific substrate for technical reasoning. Situated within a parietal territory that is evolutionarily expanded in humans, this region may constitute a neural signature of the human capacity to understand and reshape the material world."
"The invasive Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus (Skuse), and yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti (L.) are known to compete for resources during the larval stage, often resulting in the ecological displacement of Ae. aegypti by Ae. albopictus. The chemosensory system plays a pivotal role in larval foraging behavior and may contribute to the competitive advantage. Here, we employed comparative transcriptomics and functional characterization of odorant receptors (ORs) to investigate species-specific differences in larval olfaction. Notably, we uncovered functional variation within the conserved olfactory indole receptor clade, indicating distinct ecological adaptations across species and life stages. We also developed a novel approach to functionally characterize the larval sensory cone and mapped its receptor neuron projections to two key brain regions: the antennal lobe and the subesophageal ganglion. This study provides new insights into the molecular and neural basis of chemosensory-driven behavior in mosquito larvae and highlights the potential role of olfaction in shaping interspecies competition and ecological success."
"Alzheimers disease (AD) alters the gut microbiome. It remains unclear whether manipulation of miRNA could modulate the gut microbiome and AD pathologies. Depletion of gut miRNA in App-knock-in mice by conditional knockout of Dicer1 gene in intestinal epithelial cells: 1) decreased the absolute number and changed the composition of bacteria in both the gut and brain; 2) reduced cerebral A{beta} load by inhibiting {beta}-secretase activity and increasing the expression of LRP1 and ABCB1 at the blood-brain barrier; 3) increased Il-10 transcription and decreased the transcription of Ccl-2 gene, and that of Ndufa2 and Ndufa5 genes encoding mitochondrial respiratory enzymes in the brain; and 4) induced anxiety symptoms without affecting cognitive function in AD mice. Thus, manipulating miRNA in the gut can modify AD pathogenesis. Future studies should focus on identifying AD-specific miRNAs in the gut that can be therapeutically exploited (e.g. by oral administration) to prevent the progression of AD."
"Contrast modulation (CM) stimuli have been previously used to reveal nonlinear contributions of Y-like retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) such as parasol cells to cortical responses and perception. To test whether CMs are selectively processed within the magnocellular pathway, we assessed envelope motion discrimination and detection for achromatic (yellow-black) and chromatic (red-green) CMs in the presence of luminance masking noise to disrupt luminance-based mechanisms of motion processing. Compared to achromatic CMs, perception of chromatic CMs was more sensitive to luminance masking noise, suggesting that CM envelope motion perception relied predominantly on luminance signals. Specifically, envelope motion discrimination performance was better maintained for achromatic CMs than chromatic CMs, even at high masking noise levels. Notably, luminance masking noise greatly impaired envelope direction discrimination for chromatic CMs but had minimal impact on their detection, suggesting that chromatic aberrations may enhance envelope motion perception for chromatic CMs by introducing luminance signals. These findings collectively emphasize that CM stimuli selectively activate Y-like/parasol RGCs of the retino-geniculate magnocellular pathway, underscoring their potential to specifically target this pathway. This might have clinical advantages for early diagnosis in disorders such as glaucoma or dyslexia, where magnocellular pathway dysfunction is predominant."
"Despite internal cues that signal fullness, animals can continue eating when motivated by context or palatability. The neural pathways and signals that enable animals to override these fullness cues remain unclear. We examined a central amygdala (CeA) projection to the dorsolateral pons that targets the parabrachial nucleus, a well-established meal termination center, and the adjacent supratrigeminal nucleus, a region that controls orofacial movements. Activity in this CeApons pathway correlated with the animals licking behavior but was not modulated by metabolic need or palatability cues. CeApons stimulation caused animals to overeat, consume non-edible objects within reach, or exhibit ingestion-like behaviors--licking, chewing, and grasping--even when no target was present. Depending on training and context, stimulation elicited either licking or pellet consumption, suggesting that CeApons promotes a flexible, goal-directed ingestive state by recruiting consummatory motor circuits rather than simply suppressing satiety signals. These findings highlight how forebrain-brainstem interactions can re-engage feeding behavior beyond homeostatic need."
"Subjective confidence in perceptual choices depends on computations occurring prior to and after choice commitment. However, the nature of these computations remains unclear. Current models disagree on two fundamental questions: what stopping-rule is applied to post-choice evidence sampling and to what degree do choice and confidence reports rely on shared versus distinct evidence accumulation processes? These models have proven difficult to dissociate because they often make similar behavioural predictions. Therefore, we used a neurally-informed modelling approach to jointly model initial choices and subsequent confidence reports while leveraging the additional constraints offered by human electrophysiological signatures of evidence accumulation. Participants made self-paced confidence reports after indicating perceptual choices on a random dot motion task, with stimulus presentation continuing during the interval between these responses. Model comparison showed that boundary-based stopping rules provided superior fits to the behavioural data than time-based stopping rules, as the latter could not account for relationships between confidence and confidence-RT. The behavioural fits were inconclusive when comparing models with a single evidence accumulation process dictating choices and confidence reports compared to models invoking a distinct post-choice process. However, the single-process model markedly outperformed the other models in terms of its ability to recapitulate the observed neural evidence accumulation patterns associated with choice confidence. Our study thus demonstrates that choice behaviour, subjective confidence, and associated neural decision signals can be jointly explained by a model invoking a single process of evidence accumulation with separate boundaries for the initial choice and subsequent confidence reports."

"Neuropathic pain is a highly prevalent condition for which treatments are hampered by low efficacy and dose-limiting side-effects. Injury to the somatosensory nervous system causes maladaptive plasticity that initiates and maintains chronic pain. Emerging evidence suggests that inflammatory cells of the innate immune system shape the response of the injured nervous system and thereby contribute to the pathogenesis of pain. Data from preclinical models and human patient biopsies have specifically implicated peripheral macrophage populations for a pro-algesic role, yet how these cell types influence damaged sensory neurons and whether they directly contribute to neuronal hyperexcitability is unclear. Here, we have developed an iPSC co-culture system to study the interactions of macrophages and sensory neurons in a fully humanised experimental model. We found that analogous to endogenous counterparts, iPSC-derived macrophages (iMacs) display a dynamic molecular and functional profile that is highly dependent on neuronal state. Co-culture with injured iPSC-derived sensory neurons (iSNs) induces morphological, gene expression, and secretory profile changes in iMacs that are consistent with the response of macrophages to nerve injury in vivo. iMacs in turn amplify spontaneous firing in damaged sensory neurons, implicating macrophages in this cardinal feature of neuropathic pain. These results illustrate the utility of an iPSC-based model to study signalling between these two cell types; they support a role for macrophages in directly amplifying damaged sensory neuron activity and highlight disrupting pathological signalling between these cell types as a promising strategy for future analgesic drug development."
"BackgroundImpulsivity is a multifaceted transdiagnostic trait that emerges in childhood. Research has identified genetic loci and brain systems associated with different facets of impulsivity and risk-taking. However, how these genetic underpinnings overlap across different facets, and how they are associated with brain development during childhood remain unknown.

MethodsUsing genomic structural equation modeling on 17 impulsivity and risk-taking traits, we identified latent factors capturing overlapping genetic architecture. We then calculated polygenic scores for these factors using Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study data (N = 4,142) and examined their associations with brain structure, development, and behavior in children aged 9-14 years. Finally, we tested whether socioeconomic status modulated the associations between latent polygenic scores and brain structures.

ResultsWe identified three distinct genetic latent factors, which we label lack of self-control, reward drive, and sensation seeking. In children, polygenic scores for the three factors showed associations with distinct brain patterns: lack of self-control associated with reduced prefrontal cortical thickness, reward drive with increased subcortical cellular density, and sensation seeking with increased cortical surface area and white matter integrity. Longitudinally, lack of self-control predicted slower white matter development. The association between polygenetic score for lack of self-control and white matter mean diffusivity was modulated by socioeconomic status.

ConclusionsWe identified three genetically distinct dimensions of impulsivity and risk-taking with separable neurodevelopmental origins. These genetic predispositions manifested as distinct brain patterns as early as ages 9-10. Environmental experience modulated some of the genetic effects on brain development."

"The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is one of the last brain regions to fully mature, making it particularly sensitive to stress and drug use early in life. Both human and rodent studies find long-lasting behavioral changes after adolescent alcohol exposure that implicate underlying disruptions in PFC development, including structural abnormalities and altered brain functional connectivity. Few rodent studies have been conducted to understand the network-level implications of these disruptions. We assessed how adolescent binge-like alcohol consumption in a drinking in the dark (DID) model affected adult aversion-resistant alcohol consumption, exploration, and brain-wide functional connectivity in mice. Approximately one month after the conclusion of DID, only female mice exposed to alcohol during adolescence exhibited aversion-resistant alcohol preference in adulthood. Adult females exhibited additional sex-specific changes in exploratory behavior in the elevated plus maze after adolescent alcohol consumption. Resting state neuroimaging revealed changes in prefrontal cortical connections with sensory motor, hippocampal, striatal, and other networks, providing insights into the putative systems underlying deficits caused by adolescent alcohol exposure. Critically, our data corroborate a growing body of literature in human and rodent studies demonstrating that adolescent alcohol use may increase risk for adult alcohol use more strongly in females. Finally, we identify neural correlates of this effect that include both known and novel networks and tie these back to human datasets, allowing biological and mechanistic targets to be further explored for future study and interventions."
"Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) genes are the most polymorphic in vertebrate genomes due to their important function of presenting a diversity of peptides from pathogens to initiate an adaptive immune response. Here, we have characterized MHC class II genes and explored their polymorphism and evolution in one of the most abundant vertebrates in the world, Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus). The vast population size and schooling behavior make Atlantic herring an attractive target for pathogens. Hence, we hypothesized that it would maintain exceptionally high MHC polymorphism. We used PacBio HiFi long-read whole genome sequencing data of 14 individuals from three different geographic regions in the Atlantic Ocean and Baltic Sea. The analysis identified nine MHC class II loci distributed across four chromosomes. We found two distinct lineages of class II genes, a highly polymorphic one denoted DA and a non-polymorphic DB lineage, arranged as alpha-beta gene pairs (DAA-DAB or DBA-DBB). The DA genes showed extremely high nucleotide diversity in exon 2, strong signatures of positive selection (dN/dS >> 1) as well as copy number variation. Structure prediction revealed that all highly polymorphic amino acid residues occurred in the predicted peptide binding cleft. Two of the most polymorphic loci showed distinct allelic groupings (supertypes), with high sequence similarity within supertypes and high sequence divergence between supertypes. Most of the haplotypes had genes from different supertypes, thus maintaining diverse class II repertoire in a single individual. There was also a highly significant nonrandom association of DAA and DAB alleles within supertypes, strongly suggesting coevolution of DAA and DAB alleles forming the peptide binding domain. This study reveals that the herring MHC class II genes are among the most, if not the most, polymorphic so far described in vertebrates. Their exceptional polymorphism surpasses that of human due to a larger gene repertoire, copy number variation, and pronounced sequence divergence among alleles. This unheralded polymorphism is most likely explained by the combined effects of the vast population size, minimizing genetic drift, and strong pathogen-driven balancing selection."
"Environmental stress contributes to several disease conditions - including cardiovascular disease, mental illness, and autoimmune disorders - through immune dysregulation. Stress operates through the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal and sympathoadrenal axes, leading to peripheral secretion of cortisol and norepinephrine, respectively. While stress profoundly influences immune function, the underlying single-cell and cell-type-specific mechanisms remain poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we employed an ex vivo model investigating the transcriptomic responses of primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells and neutrophils to physiological stress levels (i.e., levels reached during in vivo stress) of cortisol and norepinephrine at single-cell resolution. We identified novel stress-hormone-dependent and cell-type-specific transcriptomic changes, including uniquely regulated genes and inflammation-related signatures within distinct innate (e.g., CD163+ monocytes/macrophages, neutrophils) and other immune cell types. The single-cell-derived signatures, applied to two independent human cohorts, effectively distinguished stress-related diseases. Our findings provide cell-type-level insights into how stress hormones modulate immune function relevant to stress-related conditions."

"The co-option of transposable elements (TEs) as immune sentinels represents an evolutionarily conserved strategy across metazoans, yet the molecular mechanisms linking retrotransposon reactivation to antiviral defense remain enigmatic. Here, we identify LmGypsy, a long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposon in Locusta migratoria, as a critical mediator of biphasic antiviral immunity against Acrididae reovirus (ARV). ARV infection triggers selective de-repression of LmGypsy, which orchestrates dual antiviral pathways: (1) its encoded reverse transcriptase synthesizes viral DNA (vDNA) from ARV RNA, fueling RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated viral RNA degradation through Dicer-2-dependent vsiRNA biogenesis; (2) LmGypsy-derived nucleic acids activate cGAS-like receptors (LmcGASs) and induce immune responses. Strikingly, vDNA persists in infected locusts from 24 h post-infection until host death, suggesting a role in sustaining antiviral activity akin to immune memory mechanisms observed in Diptera. This study provides the first evidence that insect cGAS homologs function as retrotransposon sensors, mirroring mammalian cGAS-STING recognition of endogenous retroviral elements. Our findings redefine retrotransposons as central hubs in arthropod antiviral immunity, bridging RNAi and nucleic acid-sensing pathways to establish a coordinated defense network. These results illuminate conserved principles of TE-immune crosstalk and highlight LmGypsy as a paradigm for understanding host-transposon coevolution in antiviral contexts."
"While some studies have implicated the histone 3 lysine 4 demethylase KDM5A in tumorigenesis and promotion of metastasis, KDM5A has also been shown to boost immunotherapy responses in melanoma. The distinct functional role of KDM5A in the context of immunotherapy and the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we report that higher KDM5A expression strongly correlates with higher MHC-I expression, CD8+ T cell infiltration, and prolonged survival in colorectal cancer and gastric cancer patients receiving anti- PD-1 therapy. KDM5A promotes MHC-I-mediated antigen presentation and CD8+ T cell-mediated tumor killing across multiple murine cancer models. Mechanistically, KDM5A upregulates MHC-I expression through the SOCS1/IFN-{gamma}/STAT1 signaling and improves tumor cell-intrinsic antigen presentation capacity by inhibiting lysosomal proteases in a demethylase-dependent manner. Moreover, KDM5A directly represses lysosomal cathepsins in dendritic cells and promotes the cross-priming activity. Through a high-throughput chemical compound library-based screen, we identified Clomiphene, an FDA-approved small molecule, which significantly elevates KDM5A expression, and enhances antitumor immunity during anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in mouse models of melanoma and colon cancer. Our findings that KDM5A functions in MHC-I-mediated immune activation during anti-PD-1 therapy present an opportunity for developing KDM5A-enhancing therapies to increase tumor immunogenicity, sensitize solid tumors to immunotherapy and exclude immune evasion."
"The primary cilium is a signaling organelle that extends from many cell types to detect and relay extracellular signals. Beyond its signaling role, the cilium also produces cilia-derived extracellular vesicles (cEVs), although the mechanisms underlying their biogenesis and functions remain poorly understood. We characterized the cEV biogenesis in vivo using ciliated sensory neurons of C. elegans. In response to sensory cues, interruption of the intraflagellar transport (IFT) -a ciliary trafficking machinery carrying cargoes along the cilium-occurs together with ciliary membrane fission, resulting in the release of cEVs. Similarly, mutants disrupting IFT and ciliary receptor trafficking also enhance cEV production. To investigate how IFT influences the rate and location of cEV biogenesis, we selected a membrane marker that spans the entire length of the ciliary membrane independently of IFT. Single-molecule tracking demonstrates that the tetraspanin TSP-6 enters and diffuses within the cilia and does it independently of IFT. Lack of receptor retrieval or receptor entry in the cilium induces membrane budding from ciliary or periciliary membranes, respectively. Prior to fission, these membrane buds get enriched in TSP-6 as well as signaling receptors. Coupling receptor buildup with their export by cEVs provides a mechanism to preserve ciliary function and to modulate ciliary signaling.

HIGHLIGHTS- The cone-shaped tetraspanin TSP-6 crosses the transition zone and moves by passive diffusion within the ciliary membrane, independently of IFT.
- The production of ciliary EVs loaded with TSP-6 increases upon acute sensory stimulation or when IFT of ciliary membrane proteins is disrupted.
- Depending on the nature of the perturbations, ciliary EVs remove excess material from the distal, proximal or periciliary segments of the cilia."
"C. elegans sense organs provide a powerful model for understanding how different cell types interact to assemble a functional organ. Each sense organ is composed of two glial cells, called the sheath and socket, and one or more neurons. A major challenge in studying their development has been the lack of methods to directly observe these structures in the embryo. Here, we mine a recently published high-resolution ultrastructural dataset of a comma-stage embryo that provides an untapped resource for visualizing early developmental events. From this dataset we reconstructed all head sense organs (two amphid (AM), four cephalic (CEP), six inner labial (IL), four outer labial quadrant (OLQ), and two outer labial lateral (OLL)). Symmetric sense organs were at different stages of morphogenesis, allowing us to infer developmental steps by which they form. First, we found that the sheath glial cell begins wrapping its partner neurons at the distal tip of the dendrites where it self-fuses into a seamless tube and then ""zippers"" down the dendrite. In many cases, sheath glia wrap the progenitors of partner neurons prior to their terminal division. After sheath wrapping has begun, the socket glia wraps the sheath glia circumferentially before presumably elongating to form the mature sheath-socket channel. We also observed transient interactions not found in the mature animal, such as amphid sheath glia wrapping the AUA neuron, that may reflect ancestral relationships. This study demonstrates the value of large public EM datasets that can be mined for new insights, and sheds light on how neurons and glia undergo coordinated morphogenesis."
"Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) can be used as a scalable source of lymphocytes for adoptive cell therapies, contingent on the robust generation of definitive hematopoietic intermediates. Early WNT activation with CHIR99021 during mesoderm induction promoted the formation of KDR+ ALDH1A2+ mesodermal progenitors and subsequent generation of T cells in a retinoic acid (RA)-dependent manner. Integrated scRNA-seq and ATAC-seq defined a WNT-dependent developmental trajectory from hPSCs to KDR+ ALDH1A2+ mesoderm. Gene regulatory network modeling predicted HDAC2 and E-box transcription factors as regulators of RA-responsive mesodermal differentiation downstream of WNT. HDAC2 knockout impaired, while HDAC2 overexpression enhanced, KDR+ ALDH1A2+ progenitor formation. E-box factor manipulation had no discernible effect. An orthogonal chemical screen confirmed that HDAC2 inhibition suppressed KDR+ ALDH1A2+ mesodermal progenitors, whereas modulating histone methylation enhanced their formation. These findings reveal mechanisms by which WNT signaling promotes RA-responsive mesoderm and suggest methods to improve the generation of lymphocytes from hPSCs."
"In Bilateria with centralized nervous systems (e.g. in vertebrates or arthropods), the minimum of the BMP signaling activity gradient defines the position of the central nervous system. BMP-dependent patterning of the secondary body axis is ancestral for Bilateria and possibly also for the bilaterian sister clade Cnidaria. However, the variety of levels of centralization of the nervous systems in Bilateria - from diffuse to fully centralized - as well as the lack of centralization of the nervous system in Cnidaria, suggest that BMP signaling cannot be perceived as a universally ""anti-neural"" signal. Here we use transgenic reporter lines in the anthozoan cnidarian Nematostella to show that BMP signaling is active in distinct neuronal populations. Moreover, attenuation of BMP signaling followed by RNA-Seq shows that BMP signaling is a positive regulator of many neuronal genes, including the top-tier neural progenitor marker soxB(2). Further, we analyze BMP signaling activity in the true jellyfish Aurelia and box jellyfish Tripedalia proving that BMP signaling in the diffuse cnidarian nervous system is not an anthozoan but an ancestral cnidarian feature, shared by anthozoans and medusozoans. Finally, we show that the highly centralized ventral nervous system of the non-model spiralian, the chaetognath Spadella, forms out of paired BMP signaling-positive domains on the lateral sides of the embryo. Together, our data suggest that one of the ancestral roles of BMP signaling was in promoting neurogenesis. We propose that the ""anti-neural"" function of BMP signaling in vertebrates and arthropods is a side effect of its global role in the dorsoventral patterning of the ectoderm."
"We present the BOOPTHAT (Batch-Operating Optically Powered Targeted Heater for Activating Transgenes) as a low-cost system for activating heat-shock inducible transgenes with spatiotemporal control in multiple zebrafish embryos at a time. Gaining finer spatiotemporal control over gene expression is critical for unraveling the regulatory networks that coordinate embryogenesis. While the heat-shock inducible gene expression system is a widely used tool for controlling temporal transgene expression, its applicability in spatiotemporal control is limited. By adding a level of spatial control onto this well-established system, we take advantage of the existing infrastructure surrounding the HS induction system and introduce new ways to use the multitude of existing lines. The BOOPTHAT system is built from 3D printed components and inexpensive consumer parts. Independent 3D printed micromanipulators are used to position optical fiber probes. When coupled to a light source, the probes are heated photothermally and are used to perform targeted gene activation in multiple samples at a time. We demonstrate the capabilities of our system and highlight some areas of research that stand to benefit from this frugal and effective system."
"Inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) are rare disorders, typically presenting as Mendelian traits, that result in stationary or progressive visual impairment. They are characterized by extensive genetic heterogeneity, possibly the highest among all human genetic diseases, as well as diverse inheritance patterns. Despite advances in gene discovery, limited understanding of gene function and challenges in accurately interpreting variants continue to hinder both molecular diagnosis and genetic research in IRDs. One key problem is the absence of a comprehensive and widely accepted catalogue of disease genes, which would ensure consistent genetic testing and reliable molecular diagnoses. With the rapid pace of IRD gene discovery, gene catalogues require frequent validation and updates to remain clinically and scientifically useful. To address these gaps, we developed RetiGene, an expert-curated gene atlas that integrates variant data, bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing, and functional annotations. Through the integration of diverse data sources, RetiGene supports candidate gene prioritization, functional studies, and therapeutic development in IRDs."
"Genomes have maintained stable sets of protein-coding genes during evolution, while chromosome organization and genome size vary drastically. Changes in genome size are often attributed to variable amounts of repetitive sequences, including transposable elements. However, it remains poorly understood how such changes were accommodated while maintaining other genomic components. Elasmobranchs, including sharks, rays, and skates, exhibit high among-species variation of genome size and high within-species variation of chromosome length, offering a unique study system to address the question. In this study, we present the first whole genome sequences of the whitebelly skate with remarkably small genome size among elasmobranchs (2.2 Gb), and the red stingray. These chromosome-scale assemblies enabled the assessment of genomic compositions including centromeres and non-coding elements, which revealed notable profiles of tRNA loci and unbiased intragenomic distribution of transposons in elasmobranch genomes. Comparative analyses across these species revealed a shared genomic architecture characterized by correlations of intergenic and intronic sequence lengths with chromosome sizes, with repetitive element accumulation in elongated regions. We analyzed tandemly duplicated genes with high copy number variability. This genome-wide survey revealed the tendency for more frequent tandem gene duplications along with genome size expansion. We document the batoid HoxC cluster in the red stingray genome, which has undergone extensive repetitive element invasion and co-localizes with the HoxB cluster on a sex chromosome. Our study demonstrates an inclusive analysis encompassing both coding and non-coding regions, adaptable to more species in the taxon and a basis for molecular-level understanding on phenotypic diversity of elasmobranchs."
"As genome-wide data has become increasingly available, software libraries for their analysis have proliferated. While new tools for downstream analyses are constantly emerging, existing workflows are hindered by inefficiencies. Switching between coding languages and object types in the early stages of pipelines wastes researchers time, impedes reproducibility, and creates opportunity for error. To confront these obstacles, we introduce tidypopgen, a comprehensive R package for population genetic analysis of biallelic SNP data. Genotype data can be read, filtered, and analysed within a single environment, without the need for prior data cleaning or setup with other software. tidypopgens gen_tibble object structure makes analysis efficient and intuitive, while standardised tidy grammar makes data manipulation clear.

Functionality within tidypopgen supports cleaning and merging datasets, basic descriptive statistics, multivariate analysis, clustering algorithms, and F-statistics, as well as integrating with existing tools for population genetic analyses in R. We use the Human Genome Diversity Project SNP dataset (Li et al., 2008) to show that a basic population genetic workflow can be executed in under 25 lines of code in a single environment using one file set, without the need to write superfluous outputs or change directories. By supporting data assembly through to data analysis, tidypopgen significantly streamlines workflows without compromising speed or functionality."
"Accurate prioritisation of near-native protein-protein interaction (PPI) models remains a major bot-tleneck in structural biology. Here we present SAKE-PP, a physics-inspired, spatial-attention equivariant graph neural network that directly regresses interface RMSD (iRMSD) without any native references. Trained on docking decoys generated through our novel hierarchical sampling strategy applied to PDB-Bind dataset, SAKE-PP combines force-field-like attention with Laplacian-eigenvector orientation to couple local interaction forces with global topology. On the 2024PDB benchmark comprising 176 het-erodimers, SAKE-PP demonstrates effective optimization and selection of AF3 decoys, achieving improvements of 13.75% based on iRMSD statistics and 12.5% based on DockQ scores. It consistently outperforms the AF3 ranking score in multiple metrics, including overlap, hit rate, and correlation. In zero-shot evaluation of 139 antibody-antigen complexes, SAKE-PP improves the score-iRMSD correlation by 0.4. By unifying geometric deep learning with physics-based realism, SAKE-PP provides a robust, plug-and-play scoring function that streamlines reliable PPI evaluation and accelerates downstream structure-guided drug-design workflows."
"Thermosensitive TRP ion channels enable somatosensory nerve fibers to detect changes in our thermal environment over a wide physiologic range 1-3. In mammals, the menthol receptor, TRPM8, is activated by temperatures below [~]26{degrees}C and is essential for the perception of cold or chemical cooling agents 4-6. A fascinating, yet still unachieved goal is to elucidate structural mechanisms whereby TRPM8 or other thermosensitive channels are gated by changes in ambient temperature. Recent studies using cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) have attempted to address this challenging question but are limited by difficulties in visualizing temperature-evoked conformational substates or assessing the energetic landscape governing gating transitions 7,8. Here, we close this gap by using cryo-EM to visualize TRPM8 channels in cellular membranes, where bona fide menthol- and cold-evoked open states are captured. We identify a novel  semi-swapped architecture in which interdigitation of channel subunits is substantially rearranged following repositioning of the S6 transmembrane helix and elements of the pore region. By combining this structural analysis with thermodynamic measurements using hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS), we are able to pinpoint the pore and TRP helices as key regions undergoing stimulus-evoked conformational dynamics that drive channel gating. Structural mechanisms associated with activation are validated by comparison of human TRPM8 with the menthol-sensitive, but relatively cold-insensitive avian orthologue. We propose a free energy landscape to explain channel gating by cold or cooling agents."
"DNA nanotechnology has emerged as a promising field for biomedical applications, both in the therapeutic and diagnostic domains. The ability of DNA nanostructures to carry cargos in precise numbers and orientations, makes them competitive candidates for drug delivery, biosensors or imaging agents. Two of the main challenges for translating DNA nanostructures from the laboratory to the clinic are achieving cost-effective largescale production and establishing comprehensive safety profiles. Having the ability to reliably and efficiently purify functionalized DNA nanostructures is key to both challenges, and an open question in the field of DNA nanotechnology. Here, we present a scalable method for the fast and efficient purification of high concentration of peptide- or protein-functionalized DNA nanostructures. We use a gravity-driven size exclusion chromatography approach, that has the potential to purify DNA nanostructures within 10 minutes, with yield up to 93% and purity up to 99% and is appropriate for both protein and peptide conjugates.

"AbstractSymbiosis is everywhere, and ""we have never been individuals""[1, 2]. In animal-microbe symbioses, established symbionts are often thought to be confined to a specific cellular or tissue niche[3-7] and generally lose their motile appendages such as flagella[8-15]. However, whether the loss of motile appendages necessarily implies immobility within the animal host remains an open conundrum. Here, we present the discovery of long-range, host actin-driven symbiont mobility in a dinoflagellate-acoel worm symbiosis. Using long-term tracking, fluorescence, and electron microscopy, we find that dinoflagellate symbionts (Amphidinium sp., 10-20{micro}m in size) travel throughout an extensive network of thin host cells ([~]200 nm in regions without symbionts) in Waminoa sp. acoel worms, which are part of a deep-diverging bilaterian lineage[16-18]. Although FIB-SEM-based 3D reconstruction shows symbionts still retain both flagella, we uncover that it is host actin machinery that plays a primary role in overcoming large drag forces under confinement to achieve mobility throughout the worm at surprisingly high velocities (around 1{micro}m/s). Long term in-toto imaging further reveals diel rhythms and spatiotemporal regulation of symbionts during regeneration. Our findings show the presence of host-mediated mobility in animal-microbe symbioses, which suggests the existence of previously overlooked regulatory processes in holobionts maintenance of dynamic homeostasis."
"Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are chromatin-based structures released by activated neutrophils in response to pathogens or chemical stimuli, contributing to host defense but also implicated in autoimmune disease and inflammation. As NET formation gains attention as an endpoint in in vitro immunotoxicity screening, the lack of reproducible and scalable systems hampers its broader application. Here, we developed an in vitro assay using HL-60-derived neutrophil-like cells (dHL-60) differentiated with all-trans retinoic acid to evaluate NET-inducing activity in a standardized, non-animal model. Graphene oxide (GO), a model nanomaterial known to trigger NETs in primary neutrophils, induced concentration-dependent NET formation in dHL-60 cells, with maximal induction at intermediate doses and attenuation at higher concentrations, likely due to particle aggregation. NET formation was validated by extracellular DNA staining and scanning electron microscopy. GO also induced superoxide-mediated ROS production, as confirmed by electron spin resonance, consistent with canonical NETosis pathways. Furthermore, GO suppressed PMA-induced NET formation, suggesting a dose- and context-dependent immunomodulatory effect. Collectively, our results demonstrate that dHL-60 cells recapitulate key features of NETosis observed in primary neutrophils and provide a practical, reproducible model for investigating immune responses to nanomaterials. This system supports the development of non-animal approaches for assessing immunological effects of chemical substances under controlled in vitro conditions."
"BackgroundReliable and non-invasive methods for assessing welfare in poultry are essential for improving evidence-based welfare monitoring and advancing management practices in commercial production systems. The iris-to-pupil (IP) ratio, previously validated by our group in primates and cattle, reflects autonomic nervous system balance and may serve as a physiological indicator of stress in laying hens. This study evaluated the utility of the IP ratio under field conditions across diverse commercial layer housing systems.

Materials and Methods296 laying hens (Lohmann Brown, n = 269; White Leghorn, n = 27) were studied across four locations in Canada housed under different systems: Guelph (indoor; pen), Spring Island (outdoor and scratch; organic), Ottawa (outdoor, indoor and scratch; free-range), and Toronto (outdoor and hobby; free-range). High-resolution photographs of the eye were taken under ambient lighting. Light intensity was measured using the light meter app. The IP ratio was calculated using NIH ImageJ software. Statistical analysis included one-way ANOVA and linear regression using GraphPad Prism.

ResultsBirds housed outdoors had the highest IP ratios, followed by those in scratch systems, while indoor and pen-housed birds had the lowest IP ratios (p < 0.001). Subgroup analyses of birds in Ottawa and Spring Island farms confirmed significantly higher IP ratios in outdoor environments compared to indoor and scratch systems (p < 0.001). IP ratio correlated weakly with ambient light intensity (r = 0.25) and age (r = 0.05), indicating minimal influence of these variables. Although White Leghorn hens showed lower IP ratios than Lohmann Browns, this difference was confounded by housing type; all White Leghorns were housed in pens. Thus, housing system but not breed was the primary driver of IP variation.

ConclusionIP ratio is a robust, non-invasive physiological marker of welfare assessment in laying hens, sensitive to housing environment but minimally influenced by light or age. Its potential for integration with digital imaging technologies supports its use in scalable welfare assessment protocols."
"Anthocyanins, flavonoid pigments, are essential photoprotective agents and play a pivotal role in enhancing plant resilience to environmental stressors. It has been shown that anthocyanin production is inhibited when pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) is activated in Arabidopsis thaliana. An important component of PTI is the phytohormone salicylic acid (SA). Interestingly, exogenous treatment with SA has been shown to induce anthocyanin content in grape, apple, maize roots, rose callus, or Arabidopsis seedlings. In this study, we used several A. thaliana mutants with modulated SA content to decipher the role of endogenous SA in anthocyanin production in A. thaliana. We treated WT and mutants with anthocyanin-inducible conditions and measured anthocyanin content using spectroscopy. We showed that high endogenous SA accumulation correlates with low anthocyanin production. This was confirmed by the treatment of the A. thaliana seedlings with exogenous SA. Additionally, using microscopy in the 5gt mutant, which exhibits enhanced production of anthocyanin vesicular inclusions (AVIs) due to the inhibition of ligandin-dependent vacuolar import, we showed that high endogenous SA also correlates with lower AVI abundance. Comparative analysis of Arabidopsis WT and mutants used in this study indicates a possible inhibitory effect of SA accumulation on anthocyanin content under anthocyanin-inducible conditions (AICs). We suggest that under AICs, SA downstream signaling independent of NPR1 is responsible for lower anthocyanin accumulation.

Anthocyanin-inducible conditions (AICs), such as changes in day length, high sucrose in the medium, or treatment with kinetin, trigger the biosynthesis of anthocyanins. Previously, it was shown that activated pattern-triggered immunity (PTI), caused by the recognition of microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), inhibits anthocyanin production. A typical PTI response is an increased production of salicylic acid (SA). In this study, we show that a high concentration of SA and its downstream signaling, rather than SA biosynthesis itself, reduces anthocyanin accumulation."
"Drought considerably affects crop productivity, and its severity is being intensified by climate change. Therefore, enhancing drought resistance is a crucial priority in crop breeding for ensuring sustainable agriculture. The root system architecture (RSA) influences the efficiency of water acquisition from land; therefore, a deep RSA is advantageous for avoiding drought stress. Here, we demonstrated that deeper RSA promoted by the qSOR1-v mutant allele (an enhanced functional allele of the quantitative trait locus for SOIL SURFACE ROOTING 1) significantly improves rice yield under drought when compared to the deep RSA achieved through the functional qSOR1 allele that originated from natural variation. The qSOR1-v mutant exhibited stronger root gravitropism than the wild type. This was characterized by a more pronounced polarization of auxin on the lower side during root curvature, leading to a robust vertical rooting phenotype that was consistently expressed across different soil-water environments. Additionally, the qSOR1-v mutation site was well conserved among angiosperm orthologs, and the corresponding mutation in LZY3 of Arabidopsis (qSOR1 ortholog) resulted in a steeper root growth angle. The rice introgression line, which was substituted from the functional qSOR1 allele to qSOR1-v through marker-assisted selection, showed vertical rooting, resulting in increased grain yield in an upland field under drought stress. No yield penalty was observed for this line under well-watered upland conditions than the original variety. These findings highlight the potential of qSOR1-v and corresponding mutations in angiosperm orthologs to promote vertical rooting across plant species, which can help sustain crop yields in drought-prone areas.

Significance StatementGenetic modification of the root system architecture in crops represents a viable strategy for the development of climate-resilient crops. This study identified the qSOR1-v allele that consistently demonstrates a vertical rooting phenotype in rice across diverse growth conditions, from dry to wet. The preservation of the qSOR1 and LZY3 orthologs in angiosperms provides opportunities for the development of genotypes characterized by vertical rooting. The introgression of the qSOR1-v allele enhanced drought resistance under upland conditions. These findings underscore the potential of these genetic modifications to improve crop resilience in an era characterized by water scarcity."
"1Metabolic behaviours of cells, such as metabolic overflow, involve regulation of metabolic fluxes across different pathways. Two well-established concepts in flux regulation are the transcriptional regulation, involving changes in enzyme levels through gene regulation, and allosteric regulation, involving changes in enzyme catalytic activities through metabolite binding. Here, we describe an additional mechanism arising through co-substrate usage around metabolic branch points. We find that asymmetric usage of a given co-substrate by reactions at and around a branch point introduces nonlinear flux switching at that branch point with increasing influx. This provides cells with an  inherent self-regulation embedded in the architecture of metabolic pathways. Using models of different branch point motifs, we explain this regulation mechanism and provide parameter ranges under which it can operate. We then develop a specific model of the yeast pyruvate branch point and NADH usage around it to show that co-substrate based flux switching can explain experimental data obtained during yeast metabolic overflow. Furthermore, the model captures observed effects of altering NADH dynamics on the metabolic overflow initiation point. We conclude that co-substrate dynamics around branch points provides an inherent regulatory mechanism that could explain observed relations between co-substrate dynamics and metabolic behaviors. Additionally, the presented theory offers a quantitative approach to manipulation of co-substrate dynamics for metabolic engineering."
"Humans monitor their actions, including detecting errors during speech production. This self-monitoring capability also enables speech neuroprosthesis users to recognize mistakes in decoded output upon receiving visual or auditory feedback. However, it remains unknown whether neural activity related to error detection is present in the speech motor cortex. In this study, we demonstrate the existence of neural error signals in speech motor cortex firing rates during intracortical brain-to-text speech neuroprosthesis use. This activity could be decoded to enable the neuroprosthesis to identify its own errors with up to 86% accuracy. Additionally, we observed distinct neural patterns associated with specific types of mistakes, such as phonemic or semantic differences between the persons intended and displayed words. These findings reveal how feedback errors are represented within the speech motor cortex, and suggest strategies for leveraging these additional cognitive signals to improve neuroprostheses."
"Hippocampal theta oscillations regulate the timing of neurons to support navigation, memory formation, and sensorimotor integration. Theta is modulated by running speed, breathing, whisking, and jumping and increases in tasks involving memory encoding or retrieval. The positive relationship between theta frequency and running speed is believed stabilize hippocampal representations of space amid movement variability. Here, we incorporated a novel string-pulling task to determine if established relationships between movement and theta hold when progress to a reward is determined by the length of string pulled. This task eliminates many speed-associated inputs, such vestibular, visual, and hindlimb information, and allows an unprecedented level of precision in the analysis of individual paw movements. Given that animals move the string a fixed length to acquire a reward, we predicted that the positive relationship between theta frequency and speed would hold.

ApproachFive Sprague Dawley rats (4 mo.) were trained to continuously pull a string a fixed distance of 208 cm using an automated string-pulling system and run on a track for food reward. Local-field data was acquired from electrodes in dorsal CA1.

ResultsRelationships between theta and movement speed were distinct during string pulling and running. While theta was robust in both conditions, frequency was significantly reduced during string-pulling and showed no speed-frequency coupling, unlike running. This difference could result from the conflict between hindlimb and forelimb signals, with only forelimb movement signaling advancement. Fine-grained analysis of paw movements during string-pulling (lift, advance, grasp, pull, push) revealed that theta power and frequency peaked during the contralateral paws downward push despite paw speed being low during this action. This suggests that theta frequency and power could respond to effort rather than purely kinematic information. Notably, running-associated theta may similarly reflect both speed and effort as most locomotor tasks conflate these variables. Finally, theta phase aligned from one reach-pull cycle to the next during the downward pull motion - the first action that directly advances the string forward. Since phase-locking has been associated with sensorimotor gating, synchrony at this point could reflect the gating of inputs that are the most causally relevant for reaching the reward, potentially facilitating integration of action-outcome signals for memory encoding and navigation. Taken together, these data support a dual-scale view of hippocampal processing and theta-band activity where macroscale theta activity requires suprathreshold sensory, vestibular, and proprioceptive drive and microscale theta remains sensitive to subsecond limb movements."
"Oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation-derived aldehydes, such as acrolein, play a central role in the pathology of spinal cord injury (SCI) and have emerged as promising therapeutic targets. Mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 (ALDH2) is a key oxidoreductase responsible for detoxifying reactive aldehydes. Pharmacological activation of ALDH2 using Alda-1, a selective agonist, has been shown to reduce aldehyde accumulation, alleviate inflammation, and enhance functional recovery in experimental SCI models. However, approximately 8% of the global population carries the ALDH2*2 mutation, which severely impairs this detoxification pathway. In this study, we used a transgenic ALDH2*2 mouse model to investigate the role of ALDH2 in SCI pathology. This model mimics the human ALDH2*2 condition, allowing us to examine the impact of impaired aldehyde clearance on acrolein accumulation and its pathological consequences. We modulated endogenous aldehyde detoxification through both genetic deficiency and pharmacological activation with Alda-1. Our results showed that ALDH2 deficiency led to significantly elevated acrolein levels, which were associated with increased microglial activation, cytokine storm, neuronal loss, demyelination, and tissue damage compared to wild-type (WT) mice. Treatment with Alda-1 enhanced ALDH2 activity and significantly reduced acrolein levels in both ALDH2*2 and WT mice from 2 to 28 days post-SCI. This was accompanied by reduced inflammation, improved preservation of myelin, and marked improvements in locomotor and sensory function, especially in ALDH2*2 mice. Notably, even beyond the traditionally ideal treatment window, Alda-1 treatment remained effective in promoting recovery, particularly in motor function and to a greater extent in ALDH2*2 mice. Our study comprehensively evaluated ALDH2s role in SCI by both genetically impairing and pharmacologically enhancing its activity, highlighting ALDH2 as a critical modulator of acrolein-mediated damage and suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target, especially for individuals with the ALDH2*2 mutation."
"Approximately 30% of cochlear implant (CI) users report that restoring their ability to enjoy music is a primary goal. However, music perception in CI users has mostly been investigated in controlled laboratory settings using simplified stimuli, such as pure tones or monophonic melodies. There is an increasing interest in developing objective measures of CI outcomes in everyday listening situations, particularly in music listening, which involves complex stimuli rich in timbre, pitch, rhythm, and overlapping sounds. One promising approach is to measure cortical auditory evoked responses (ERs) in CI users. We investigated whether ERs to sound on-sets in a naturalistic four-minute music piece could be measured in adult CI users (N: 25; ages 18-80; CI experience: 0.3-14 years). We assumed that the accumulation of CI experience might be reflected in the morphology of the ERs. The results confirmed that P2 responses to sound onsets embedded in a whole piece of music can be detected in experienced CI users. Compared to a control group with normal hearing, the CI users showed P2 responses with lower amplitudes and longer latencies. Exploratory linear regression models suggested that the logarithmic duration of CI experience significantly predicted both perceived quality of musical sounds and P2 amplitude, explaining 38% and 28% of the variance, respectively. The findings suggest that music perception outcomes may continue to improve for up to 2-4 years post-implantation. Altogether, the results are consistent with the use of ERs to track CI adaptation to music listening."
"Deep brain stimulation (DBS) with electrodes implanted in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) alleviates motor symptoms in Parkinsons disease (PD). However, the surgical complexity and associated side effects limit deployment of DBS to late-stage patients. Here, we explore a neuromodulation approach that employs locally injected magnetoelectric nanodiscs (MENDs) as an alternative to electrode-based DBS. The MENDs, composed of Fe3O4 cores and two consecutive shells of magnetostrictive CoFe2O4 and piezoelectric BaTiO3, convert weak magnetic fields into electric polarization, enabling remote neuronal excitation in the mouse STN comparable to electrode DBS. To assess the effects of the MEND and electrode DBS on motor performance in a unilateral mouse model of PD, we develop a computational pipeline that extracts salient gate features. Our findings suggest that DBS mediated by the injected MENDs not only diminishes motor symptoms associated with PD but may also inform future strategies for early-stage interventions aimed at delaying disease progression."
"BackgroundNociceptin (N/OFQ) and its receptor OPRL1 play crucial roles in emotional processing, reward-related behaviors, learning, and neurotransmitter regulation, but their involvement in Alzheimers disease (AD) pathology remains poorly understood. This study investigated possible relationships between prepronociceptin (PNOC) and OPRL1 expression and psychiatric symptoms in AD, utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) to assess Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) domains.

MethodsPost-mortem brain tissue from the dorsal anterior cingulate gyrus (BA32) was analyzed in 61 donors across different Braak and Braak (B&B) stages. RNA expression of PNOC and OPRL1 was quantified and correlated with RDoC scores derived from medical records using NLP. Sex-stratified analyses, circadian rhythmicity analysis, and cell-type specific expression patterns were examined.

ResultsBoth genes showed significant downregulation in AD cases (PNOC: p = 0.024; OPRL1: p < 0.001), with notable sex differences. Men displayed higher post-mortem PNOC (Cohens d = -0.482) and OPRL1 (Cohens d = -0.237) expression compared to women. In adjusted models controlling for B&B stage and post-mortem interval, PNOC expression significantly correlated with dimensional scores of positive valence ({beta} = -0.38, p = 0.035) and arousal regulatory systems ({beta} = -0.43, p = 0.015) derived from a text classification algorithm applied to medical records. OPRL1 showed disrupted circadian rhythmicity in AD cases (p = 0.151 vs. p = 0.020 in controls).

ConclusionsThese findings suggest distinct roles for PNOC and OPRL1 in AD pathology, with PNOC primarily associated with psychiatric symptoms and OPRL1 showing disrupted circadian regulation. Sex-specific expression patterns further indicate the need for personalized therapeutic approaches targeting the nociceptin system."
"Antibodies produced by B cells aid in recognition and clearance of pathogens and is the cornerstone of vaccination strategies. Humans produce nine different antibody isotypes and their effector functions differ according to the type of antigen and route of exposure. Phenotypic variation between isotype-switched B cell subsets is expected but not studied in detail. To obtain a molecular definition of isotype-defined cell identity, we performed proteomics and transcriptomics on isotype-defined populations of human naive and memory B cells (MBCs): CD27-IgM+IgD+, CD27+CD38lo/-IgM+IgD+, CD27+CD38lo/-IgM+IgD-, and IgA1, IgA2, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4 MBCs (CD27+CD38lo/-Ig+). Combined proteome and transcriptome analysis revealed that mRNA and protein expression profiles separate isotype-defined B cell subsets according to their differentiation status. mRNA and protein expression levels correlated reasonably well for many genes. IgG4-switched B cells were most distinct from naive B cells in terms of mRNA as well as protein expression profiles. Besides a distinct expression profile of cytokine and Fc receptors, we identified a high expression of IgE-coding mRNA in IgG4-switched B cells. SDR16C5 was identified as uniquely upregulated in IgG4-switched B cells. Taken together, this study highlights the distinct phenotypic profile of IgG4-switched B cells."
"Accurate classification of cell death pathways is critical in understanding disease mechanisms and evaluating therapeutic responses, as dysregulated cell death underlies a wide range of pathological conditions including cancer and therapy resistance. Conventional imaging methods such as fluorescence and bright-field microscopy, or 2D phase imaging, often suffer from phototoxicity, labeling artifacts, or limited morphological contrast. Here, we present a real-time, label-free platform for classifying cell death phenotypes--apoptosis, necroptosis, and necrosis--by combining three-dimensional holotomography with deep learning. Our convolutional neural network, trained on refractive index (RI)-based features from HeLa cells, achieved high classification accuracy (97.2 {+/-} 2.8%) under varying cell densities. Notably, the model identified early RI changes during necroptosis several hours prior to fluorescence-based markers. These findings demonstrate the potential of holotomography-based AI for high-resolution, label-free cell death profiling."
"Cardiac regeneration using human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) is a promising therapy for heart failure. Successful treatment requires effective integration of transplanted cells with host myocardium, yet the migratory capacity of hiPSC-CMs remains poorly understood. This study investigated hiPSC-CM migration using in vitro models with myocardial infarction (MI) stimulus mimicked using homogenised rat MI tissue. Transwell assays revealed a concentration-dependent chemotactic response, with a three-fold increase in migration toward MI homogenate. Wound healing assays confirmed enhanced migration speed under MI conditions. Bulk RNA sequencing identified TGF-{beta} signalling as a key regulatory pathway, and both pharmacological inhibition and antibody neutralisation of TGF-{beta} significantly impaired migration. These findings demonstrate the inherent chemotactic ability of hiPSC-CMs and identify TGF-{beta} signalling as a central mediator in response to MI stimuli. This work provides new mechanistic information on hiPSC-CM migratory behaviour in the context of MI and offers new insights to optimise cardiac regeneration therapies."
"Dysfunction of mitochondrial complex I (MCI) has been implicated in the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinsons disease. Here, we report the effect of expressing MitoLbNOX, a mitochondrial-targeted version of the bacterial enzyme LbNOX, which increases regeneration of NAD+ in the mitochondria to maintain the NAD+/NADH ratio, in dopaminergic neurons with impaired MCI (MCI-Park mice). MitoLbNOX expression did not ameliorate the cellular or behavioral deficits observed in MCI-Park mice, suggesting that alteration of the mitochondrial NAD+/NADH ratio alone is not sufficient to compensate for loss of MCI function in dopaminergic neurons."
"Chromatin remodeling plays an integral part in endometrial homeostasis, having roles in the maintenance of cell identity, epithelial integrity, and prevention of endometrial disease. Chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding protein 4 (CHD4) is a chromatin remodeling protein and member of the NuRD complex, which predominantly represses transcription. CHD4 is mutated in endometrial carcinoma, with most mutations leading to loss of function. CHD4 has been identified as a tumor suppressor and regulator of stemness in endometrial carcinoma cells, but little is known about the tissue-specific roles of CHD4 in the endometrial epithelia in vivo. We generated a conditional Chd4 floxed allele and combined it with BAC-Sprr2f-Cre to drive Chd4 loss in the endometrial epithelium. Consistent with previous reports, BAC-Sprr2f-Cre expression is absent in the oviducts, ovaries, and kidneys, and it shows variegated expression within the endometrial epithelium. Loss of CHD4 was confirmed by immunohistochemistry, and stained cells were quantified to determine the percentage of endometrial epithelial cells with and without CHD4. Compared to the glandular epithelium, the extent of CHD4 loss was higher in the luminal epithelium and unaffected by age. Mice with conditional knockout of Chd4 had normal endometrial histology. A 6-month breeding trial was performed to assess the functional effects of endometrial epithelial Chd4 loss on fertility. No difference in litter size, mean number of pups per litter per dam, or pup weight was found between genotypes. These findings demonstrate that Chd4 conditional loss using BAC-Sprr2f-Cre is not sufficient to alter the structure and function of the endometrial epithelium or drive tumorigenesis. As CHD4 is frequently co-mutated with other cancer driver genes such as TP53, PIK3CA, and PTEN, future mouse modeling efforts emulating patient mutational profiles might provide insight into the role of CHD4 in endometrial carcinoma."
"Environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis is a cost-effective and non-invasive tool for species and biodiversity monitoring in aquatic environments. Passive eDNA sampling method is focused as a novel and alternative to conventional sampling methods, such as water filtration. In this study, we examined the efficacy of the sponge skeleton as an eDNA passive sampler for the freshwater fish monitoring tool. We compared the performance of passive sampling method with standard water filtration in the river environment. A total of five different DNA extraction methods were also conducted in three experiments, and a suitable DNA extraction method from sponge skeleton was estimated. Quantitative fish metabarcoding using MiFish primers revealed no significant difference in species richness between water and passive sampling methods. While both sampling methods showed comparable trends in fish community structures, different clusters were identified for water sampling and passive samplers by the differences in DNA concentration of each fish species. Fish diversity in passive samples was comparable among the four DNA extraction methods using the Direct Capture method, except for the filtration method. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of passive eDNA sampling for monitoring freshwater fish diversity and potential use of sponge skeletons for the absorption material of the eDNA passive sampler."
"Twin models of natural ecosystems hold great promise for informing real-world decisions on sustainable land use and biodiversity conservation. However, existing simulations of animal behavior often rely on manually crafted rules, limiting their scalability and practical utility. Here, we present a flexible and scalable agent-based modeling approach that uses reinforcement learning--instead of hand-coded rules--to simulate animal behavior. We validate this approach across ten alpine ecosystems featuring wolves, chamois, and vegetation. By comparing model outputs with empirical data, we show that the simulations reproduce realistic ecological and behavioral patterns, including population dynamics, life history traits, and social interactions. We then use the model to assess ecosystem resilience under scenarios of habitat degradation, game hunting, and heat stress. Our framework paves the way for realistic simulations advancing our ability to predict ecosystem responses to disturbance and tipping points leading to biodiversity loss, in order to support conservation planning and guide the sustainable use of natural resources."
"Evolutionary dynamics are often conceptualized as walks on an adaptive landscape, with populations climbing toward optimal fitness peaks. However, environmental changes can transform static landscapes into dynamic ""fitness seascapes"" where natural selection fluctuates in time. Here, we used a path integral approach derived from statistical physics to reveal time-varying selection pressures from genetic sequence data. We found that constraints on the fitness seascape are determined by the screened Poisson equation, which also describes the screening of electric fields in media with mobile charge carriers. In our model, changes in mutation frequencies act as ""charges"" that reveal the underlying fitness seascape, which is analogous to an electrostatic potential. After validating our method in simulations, we applied it to study how HIV-1 evolves to escape immune control by T cells within individual hosts. Our analysis showed that the fitness benefit of immune escape declines as T cell responses approach their peak intensity, suggesting that functional exhaustion may impair the effectiveness of the immune response against HIV-1. Overall, our approach provides a general framework for capturing the complex dynamics of natural selection in rapidly evolving populations."
"Aging is associated with increases in risk of multiple chronic diseases and at the cellular level, with disruptions in RNA homeostasis. Single-cell transcriptomic studies have revealed RNA abundance heterogeneity across brain cell types but the more complex changes in RNA processing such as alternative splicing, isoform usage, transcription start and polyadenylation site selection remain uncharacterized. Here, we combine single-cell analysis with long-read nanopore sequencing to capture full-length RNA isoforms and uncover temporal changes in RNA transcription, processing, and alternative splicing in the aging mouse cortex and hippocampus. By profiling transcriptomes from young adult to very old mice, we identify non-linear, cell-type-specific isoform expression changes and isoform usage shifts, primarily driven by transcription start site selection. These aging-associated isoform changes alter the coding potential and poly(A) site position of genes. Our data also reveal a high proportion of senescence in immune cells, far exceeding that of other cell types. We also identify isoform markers that, when applied to a machine learning model, distinguish senescent from normal immune cells. This study provides a full-length RNA isoform-based atlas of the aging mouse brain, offering insights into RNA metabolism remodeling across brain cell types throughout the lifespan."
"Ethanol is a neuroactive compound that alters affect and cognition in humans and other vertebrates, but its effect on affective-like states in invertebrates remain remains unknown. In this study, we tested whether exposure of honeybees to field-realistic ethanol concentrations (1%) induces  pessimistic or  optimistic cognitive judgment bias (CJB), a behavioral proxy of affect. Bees were trained in a classical olfactory conditioning paradigm and then presented with conditioned stimuli and ambiguous odor mixtures to assess decision-making changes under uncertainty. We additionally measured locomotor performance and ethanol absorption via spectrophotometric analysis of hemolymph. Ethanol levels peaked rapidly and remained elevated for at least two hours post-ingestion. Despite this, ethanol had no detectable effect on CJB responses, memory, or motor behavior. These findings suggest that acute exposure to low-dose ethanol does not induce affect-like changes in honeybees. Our study represents the first test of pharmacologically induced judgment bias in an invertebrate and contributes to understanding the resilience of insect cognition to natural neuroactive compounds. The results highlight the limits and potential of CJB paradigms for probing affect-like states across taxa and support the honeybee as a valuable model in comparative cognition and the behavioral ecology of neuroactive substance exposure."
"Over the past decade, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have emerged as a transformative delivery platform, particularly in the field of mRNA vaccines, by enabling the stabilization and efficient intracellular delivery of nucleic acids. Importantly, the FDA approved LNPs used in the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines, rely on polyethylene glycol (PEG) to stabilize the nanoparticle in vivo. However, recent studies revealed that anti-PEG antibodies are ubiquitous in the population and are known to be a major cause of anaphylaxis and reduced therapeutic efficacy by accelerating blood clearance of PEGylated products. In this study, we report the development of novel poly(2-oxazoline) (POx) ""stealth"" lipids as PEG alternatives for LNP formulation. POx polymers are known to be poorly immunogenic and mitigate accelerated blood clearance. Upon varying polymer hydrophilicity and molecular weight, we screened transfection efficiency in multiple cell lines and evaluated top candidates in vivo by intramuscular administration. Our findings demonstrate that POx-lipids incorporating shorter hydrophilic methyl- and ethyl-oxazoline POx chains enhance transfection both in vitro and in vivo, while concurrently reducing liver accumulation and improving dendritic cell uptake - key features for effective vaccine delivery. These POx-lipids boost expression in muscle tissue by up to threefold, and greatly increase accumulation in extrahepatic tissues, including lymph nodes and spleen - critical sites for immune priming in the in the context of vaccination. Altogether, this work marks a notable advancement toward replacing PEG in LNP-based therapies and provides a clear path to optimizing POx-lipids for targeted vaccine and therapeutic applications."
"Pediatric tracheal reconstruction remains a major clinical challenge because of limited graft availability and the need for growth-adaptive materials. Current approaches, such as costal cartilage grafting and use of scaffold-based constructs, often suffer from complications including graft resorption, donor site morbidity, and poor integration. Here, we present scaffold-free cartilage grafts (chondro-plates) derived from expandable limb-bud mesenchymal cells generated from human leukocyte antigen-homozygous human induced pluripotent stem cells. These grafts are cryopreservable and maintain their hyaline cartilage phenotype after a brief pre-culture. In both rat and rabbit tracheal defect models, chondro-plates supported robust cartilage regeneration, epithelial reconstitution, and neovascularization. Importantly, in a pediatric-like growing rat model, chondro-plates preserved luminal patency and structural integrity, outperforming autologous costal cartilage. This study demonstrates a clinically viable, off-the-shelf strategy for tracheal reconstruction using scalable, immunocompatible, and growth-adaptive cartilage grafts."
"Efficient and accurate plasmonic biosensing in the field remains a significant challenge. Despite its potential to revolutionize point-of-care (PoC) diagnostics through its unparalleled sensitivity and precise molecular fingerprinting capabilities, adoption of traditional surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) in the field has not proven feasible yet. High production and material costs, complex fabrication methods, reliance on specialized equipment, and persistent issues with sensor stability and reproducibility continue to impede development for PoC use. Addressing these challenges, this study innovates a democratized and cost-effective fabrication kit that enables the production of SERS substrates using commonly available materials and straightforward electrochemistry techniques without compromising on sensitivity and reproducibility. Importantly, this method leverages commercially available bottled water and simple battery-powered fabrication, thereby eliminating reliance on a power grid and enabling the local production of biosensors in resource-restricted and conflict-affected areas. The cost of producing the fabrication kit is $39.54 with raw materials purchased at bulk retail prices, while the cost of consumables for fabricating each test is just 1.33{cents}. To ensure real-world feasibility, we conducted a comprehensive reproducibility analysis, where consistent plasmonic enhancement was observed across multiple production batches. Furthermore, we demonstrated their efficacy in two critical applications: the rapid detection of bacteria and pesticides. We detect trace levels of pesticides such as Thiram and Thiabendazole down to 0.1 ppm using a digital SERS approach. We also demonstrated the identification of bacteria isolated from culture, namely Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. We envision that this label-free, high-sensitivity substrate, when paired with portable Raman spectrometers, could open doors for a new era of field-deployable biosensing, paving the way for its adoption for a plethora of applications, from public health to food testing."
"Arrestin proteins bind active G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) through coordinated protein-protein, protein-phosphate, and protein-lipid interactions to attenuate G protein signaling and promote GPCR internalization and trafficking. While there are hundreds of diverse GPCRs, only two {beta}-arrestin isoforms ({beta}arrs) must recognize and engage this wide range of receptors with varied phosphorylation patterns. Traditional models suggest that {beta}arr activation requires displacement of its autoinhibitory C-tail by a phosphorylated GPCR C-terminus; however, this paradigm fails to explain how minimally phosphorylated GPCRs still complex with {beta}arrs. Using single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer imaging and hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, we observe basal dynamics in which the {beta}arr1 C-tail spontaneously releases from the N-domain, transiently adopting an active conformation that can facilitate binding of the phosphorylated GPCR C-terminus. We further demonstrate the importance of an intermediate state of {beta}arr1 arising from spontaneous C-tail release stabilized by the membrane phosphoinositide PI(4,5)P2. Both PI(4,5)P2 and mutations in the proximal or middle regions of the C-tail shift {beta}arr1 towards a partially released state, revealing an allosteric connection that informs a refined model for {beta}arr activation. In this model, membrane engagement conformationally primes {beta}arrs prior to receptor binding, thereby explaining how {beta}arrs are recruited by diverse GPCRs, even those with limited C-terminal phosphorylation."
"Translation is accompanied by rotation of the small and large ribosomal subunits relative to each other. Here, we use single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer between fluorophores introduced into ribosomal proteins uS15 and eL30 to follow intersubunit dynamics of Saccharomyces cerevisiae ribosomes. Similar to their bacterial counterparts, yeast ribosomes are observed to sample two predominant FRET states corresponding to the nonrotated (NR) and rotated (R) conformations. Our data yield further evidence that intersubunit rotation is coupled to tRNA transitions between classical and hybrid binding states. The elongation cycle, which comprises tRNA binding, peptide transfer, and mRNA-tRNA translocation, is accompanied by switching from NR to R and then back to the NR conformation. We find that during mRNA-tRNA translocation mediated by the joint action of fungal elongation factor 3 (eEF3) and universally conserved elongation factor 2 (eEF2), eEF3 facilitates the late step of translocation, which follows eEF2-induced reverse intersubunit rotation. Our uS15-eL30 smFRET assay provides the basis for investigating eukaryotic mechanisms of translation regulation including ribosome pausing, stalling, and frameshifting."
"Efficient catalysis by metalloproteins relies on precise spatial arrangement of metal ions and active-site residues. Family II inorganic pyrophosphatase (PPase) from Shewanella species features a trinuclear metal center and displays higher catalytic activity than binuclear counterparts. Here we elucidate its hydrolytic mechanism using X-ray crystal structure-based extended X-ray absorption fine structure (XCS-EXAFS), site-directed mutagenesis, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We identify a catalytic -oxo nucleophile, formed via proton transfer from a bridging -hydroxide to Asp14 and subsequent hydrogen-bond rearrangement to Asp72, as the key species in SN2-type hydrolysis. This conversion defines the rate-limiting step with an activation barrier of 15.5 kcal/mol. Molecular orbital analysis reveals that the trinuclear cluster promotes -oxo formation, aligns the nucleophile for attack, and stabilizes the transition state. The side-chain rotation of the conserved Asp14 is crucial for catalysis. Our results highlight how metalloenzymes exploit geometric and electronic tuning to achieve high reactivity through evolutionarily optimized architectures."
"The ""neck"" region of kinesin is a structurally conserved element critical for force generation, stepping directionality, and cargo transport along microtubules, yet its atomic-scale structure in a functional context remains unresolved. Here, we employ all-atom replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations to resolve a high-confidence conformation of the neck region in dimeric human kinesin-1 bound to a realistic microtubule lattice, and use this structure to simulate kinesins initial stepping motion. Our simulations reveal that the neck coiled-coil is oriented perpendicular to the microtubules axis and positioned near its surface--a conformation consistent with earlier proposals but lacking high-resolution validation. Importantly, simulations indicate that neck-microtubule interactions bias the stepping trajectory, directing the rear kinesin head to overtake the front head from the right (counterclockwise stepping). These findings establish a mechanism by which neck-microtubule interactions govern directional bias in kinesins initial step, offering new insight into the molecular basis of its motility."
"Conformational heterogeneity is integral to protein function - ranging from enzyme catalysis to signal transduction - and visualizing distinct conformational states requires experimental techniques capable of providing such structural information. One particularly powerful method, double electron-electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy, can provide a high-resolution, long-range ([~]15-80 [A]) probability distributions of distances between site-selected pairs of spin labels to resolve intra-protein distance parameters of unique protein conformations, as well as their respective likelihoods within a conformational ensemble. A current frontier in the field of DEER spectroscopy is utilizing this distance information in computational modeling to generate complete structural models of these multiple conformations. Although several methods have been developed for this purpose, modeling protein backbone structural rearrangements using multiple distance restraints remains challenging, due in part to the complexity provided by rotameric flexibility of the spin label side chain. Here, we overcome these challenges with ProGuide, a new framework for generating accurate structural models guided by DEER distance distribution information. Large conformational rearrangements are captured by performing iterative experimentally biased molecular dynamics simulations. In each iteration, spin-label rotameric heterogeneity is modeled using chiLife, and then C changes are calculated to capture distance-probability density present in the experimental DEER distributions and lacking from the modeled one. The resulting models of this process then go through a selection to generate the ensemble that best recapitulates the DEER data. We illustrate the power of this method using published DEER data from a study of biased agonism in the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R), a prototypical G protein coupled receptor (GPCR). The resulting AT1R models consist of both Gq- and {beta}-arrestin-biased conformations, including a completely novel {beta}-arrestin-biased conformation. These models reveal structural insights involving tertiary structural rearrangements as well as residue-level changes in crucial microswitch motifs. Taken together, the results demonstrate the power and flexibility of ProGuide to investigate conformational rearrangements of large, complex proteins using DEER-derived distance restraints."
"Many biological processes can be thought of as the result of an underlying dynamics in which the system repeatedly undergoes distinct and abortive trajectories with the dynamical process only ending when some specific process, purpose, structure or function is achieved. A classic example is the way in which microtubules attach to kinetochores as a prerequisite for chromosome segregation and cell division. In this example, the dynamics is characterized by apparently futile time histories in which microtubules repeatedly grow and shrink without chromosomal attachment. We hypothesize that for biological processes for which it is not the initial conditions that matter, but rather the final state, this kind of exploratory dynamics is biologys unique and necessary solution to achieving these functions with high fidelity. This kind of cause and effect relationship can be contrasted to examples from physics and chemistry where the initial conditions determine the outcome. In this paper, we examine the similarities of many biological processes that depend upon random trajectories starting from the initial state and the selection of subsets of these trajectories to achieve some desired functional final state. We begin by reviewing the long history of the principles of dynamics, first in the context of physics, and then in the context of the study of life. These ideas are then stacked up against the broad categories of biological phenomenology that exhibit exploratory dynamics. We then build on earlier work by making a quantitative examination of a succession of increasingly sophisticated models for exploratory dynamics, all of which share the common feature of being a series of repeated trials that ultimately end in a ""winning"" trajectory. We also explore the ways in which microscopic parameters can be tuned to alter exploratory dynamics as well as the energetic burden of performing such processes.

OutlookIt is a great privilege to take part in this special volume dedicated to the life and work of Prof. Erich Sackmann (1934-2024). For one of us (RP), at the time of making a switch from traditional condensed matter physics to a life engaged in the study of life, he went to a meeting near Munich which completely opened his eyes to the ways in which the approach of physics could be brought to bear on the study of the living. Sackmanns work was an inspiring presence at that meeting. One of the hallmarks of his work was a principled approach to dissecting biological processes over a range of scales and phenomena. One common thread to much of his work was that it acknowledged the dynamical character of living organisms. The present paper attempts to follow in the tradition of Sackmanns studies of dynamics by suggesting a new way of looking at many biological processes all through the unifying perspective of what we will call exploratory dynamics."
"Intrinsically disordered proteins that mediate the cellular transcriptional response to hypoxia play important roles in turning on and turning off oxygen stress genes. In particular, the feedback inhibitor CITED2 operates a unidirectional switch that efficiently terminates the hypoxic response by displacing the C-terminal activation domain of the hypoxia-inducible factor HIF-1 from its complex with the TAZ1 domain of the transcriptional coactivators CBP and p300. Unidirectionality of the switch arises from subtle allosteric conformational changes in TAZ1 and from differences in the strength of thermodynamic coupling between the TAZ1-binding motifs in the multivalent HIF-1 and CITED2 activation domains. To investigate the role of binding cooperativity, we mutated a linker sequence in the HIF-1 activation domain to enhance or reduce the thermodynamic coupling between its TAZ1-binding motifs. An efficient native-gel assay shows that certain linker mutations enhance the affinity of HIF-1 for TAZ1, and fluorescence anisotropy competition and NMR measurements show that these mutants can compete with CITED2 for TAZ1 more effectively than wild-type HIF-1. The wide range of mutants, which include insertion, deletion, replacement and scrambling of residues in the linker, provide insights into the molecular basis for the exquisite tuning of the hypoxic switch: the TAZ1 affinity and consequent CITED2 competition enhancement depends both on the flexibility of the linker sequence (particularly the presence of glycine residues) and the unfavorable electrostatic interactions of a highly conserved arginine side chain in the center of the linker with an electropositive surface of TAZ1."

"Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RUBISCO) is the main CO2-fixing enzyme on earth and entry point of carbon into the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle. Fueled by photosynthesis, C-assimilation by RUBISCO must be tightly controlled. RUBISCO regulation upon transition from light to darkness is not fully understood in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (Synechocystis). Synechocystis does not have a RUBISCO activase that regulates RUBISCO activity in vascular plants by removing intrinsic sugar phosphate inhibitors from its active site. Instead, the regulatory CP12 protein of Synechocystis inactivates glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH2) and phosphoribulokinase (PRK) during darkness. This mechanism indicates metabolic regulation of RUBISCO. We investigated C-assimilation in vivo at the transition to darkness by dynamic 13CO2 labeling experiments. We monitored RUBISCO activity by 13C-incorporation into 1-C position of 3PGA. Other than the wild type, the{Delta} cp12 mutant continued to assimilate 13CO2 into 3PGA in darkness. RUBISCO abundances and specific activities were not altered in{Delta} cp12 and upon light to dark transition. CP12 was required to shut down the CBB cycle during the night. Complementation of{Delta} cp12 by native CP12 ({Delta}cp12::cp12) and CP12 with mutated conserved cysteines in its GAPDH2- and PRK-binding domains ({Delta}cp12::cp12{Delta}Cys) showed that both native binding domains are required to fully inactivate the CBB cycle in the night. RuBP levels were highly elevated in{Delta} cp12 upon transition to darkness. Complementation with mutated and native CP12 variants gradually reduced RuBP to wild type levels and revealed highly significant correlation between RuBP concentration and the time-shifted 13C-uptake into 3PGA. We propose that RUBISCO activity in Synechocystis at day-night transition is regulated through depletion and blocked regeneration of RuBP. 13C-positional analyses of aspartate suggest regeneration of RuBP in{Delta} cp12 via dysregulated gluconeogenesis and the oxidative pentose phosphate path. We demonstrate that RUBISCO activity of Synechocystis is present throughout diurnal growth and depends on the availability of its substrate."
"Plants are exposed to multiple concurrent stresses under field conditions that can include a combination of biotic and abiotic factors. Drought stress and plant parasitic nematodes are among the most damaging stress factors limiting plant growth and production. Plants have developed complex and specific responses to combined biotic and abiotic stresses, which differ from their responses to individual stresses. Therefore, there is an imperative need to understand plant responses to multiple stresses as a central avenue for development of robust plants with the ability to sustain growth and crop production in times of global climate change. RNA-Seq analysis was performed on Arabidopsis plants to investigate the transcriptomic responses to infection with the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita and drought stress either individually or concurrently. Arabidopsis plants activated a unique suite of genes in response to the joint stress, which significantly differed from the response to either individual stress. Among these differentially expressed genes, Azelaic Acid Induced 1 (AZI1), small auxin upregulated RNA 71 (SAUR71), and Disease Related Nonspecific Lipid Transfer Protein 1 (DRN1) may play important roles in plant responses to concurrent drought stress and root-knot nematode infection. The expression of AZI1, which is involved in priming defences via systemic acquired resistance, was uniquely upregulated in Arabidopsis leaves in response to the combined stress. SAUR71, which is a member of the largest family of primary auxin response genes, was induced solely in response to combined stress. In contrast, the expression of DRN1, a member of the non-specific lipid-transfer protein family, was strongly suppressed in Arabidopsis roots by combined drought stress and nematode infection."
"Seed longevity, the seeds ability to stay viable over time, is an important trait in agriculture. Despite extensive research, seed longevity remains one of the fundamental topics in plant biology. Here, we discovered the novel role of carotenoid metabolites in prolonging seed lifespan. We found that phytoene synthase (PSY), the gene encoding a major rate-limiting enzyme in carotenoid biosynthesis, modulated seed storability in Arabidopsis under both natural and artificial aging conditions. Seeds from the PSY overexpression (OE) lines exhibited significantly enhanced lifespan with low levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), a major factor affecting longevity, whereas those from the psy mutants had decreased viability with high ROS levels. While lutein and {beta}-carotene were detected in seeds, only {beta}-carotene and its derived apocarotenoids, i.e. {beta}-cyclocitral and {beta}-ionone, were found to improve seed lifespan. Notably, the carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 1 and 4 (ccd1 ccd4) double mutant and PSY ccd1 ccd4 seeds showed significantly reduced seed longevity, indicating that {beta}-carotene cleavage is necessary for or it is apocarotenoids playing the role in preserving seed lifespan. Comparative proteomic analysis identified TIP2;2, an aquaporin protein, which showed differential abundances in seeds of PSY OE and psy mutant vs wild type. The mutant tip2;2 had reduced seed longevity, and its promoter was transactivated by apocarotenoids. Collectively, this study uncovers a novel role of apocarotenoids in protecting seed longevity and highlights the importance of seed carotenoid production in strengthening agriculture.

One Sentence SummaryPhytoene synthase, the gene encoding a major rate-limiting enzyme in carotenoid biosynthesis, modulates seed longevity via {beta}-carotene derived apocarotenoids and an aquaporin protein TIP2;2 identified is a new player that responds to apocarotenoid signaling and influences seed longevity."
"ABSTRACTPlants produce diverse and abundant natural products, critical for plant adaptation and human society. While tremendous diversification of plant natural product pathways is well documented, how the upstream primary metabolism evolved in coordination with the lineage-specific pathways remain poorly understood. Here we studied the evolution of aromatic amino acid (AAA) biosynthesis during the emergence of tyrosine-derived lignin pathway uniquely found in grasses and closely related Poales. Phylogeny-guided in vitro and in planta functional analyses were conducted on two key regulatory enzymes--3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate synthase (DHS) and arogenate dehydrogenase (TyrA)--catalyzing the first and last steps of AAA and tyrosine biosynthesis, respectively. Deregulated TyrAs were broadly present across Poales, with PACMAD grasses exhibiting stronger deregulation, suggesting that the active tyrosine biosynthesis likely emerged before, but were also selected upon, the evolution of tyrosine-lignin pathway. Conversely, DHS deregulation occurred more recently within BOP grasses after the emergence of tyrosine-lignin pathway, via multiple mutations that acted synergistically in the enzymes allosteric regulatory domain. The study highlights how the regulation of upstream primary metabolism is dynamically tuned both before and after the evolution of emerging natural product pathways. These findings underscore the importance of coordinating primary and secondary metabolism for efficient production of natural products in plants."
"Understanding the structure and function of proteins is crucial for students as it provides fundamental insights into one of the central building blocks of life. Yet, undergraduate students struggle to make sense of proteins and apply knowledge about why structure affects function. Here, we expand on an existing typology of common protein misconceptions (Robic, 2010). We recruited participants from a large, lecture-based non-major biochemistry course to participate in a series of assessments that allowed us to qualitatively examine their responses. We found that the common misconceptions included: protein stability based on orientation, confusions about the inherent dynamic properties of proteins, and protein structure related to function. We surmise that all three of these newly reported, nuanced misconceptions are the product of difficulties with visuospatial reasoning."
"Tauopathies are a group of neurodegenerative disorders caused by the misfolded microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT), leading to its abnormal accumulation and hyperphosphorylation, and resulting in neuronal dysfunction and death. Tauopathy patients also experience disruptions to circadian rhythms of behavior and sleep. The connection between tau pathology and circadian dysfunction is not well understood, especially regarding the role of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the brains central circadian pacemaker. Here, we conducted histological and functional analyses of the SCN in the PS19 (Prnp-huMAPT*P301S) mouse model of tauopathy. The SCN of PS19 mice had accumulation of phosphorylated tau as early as 2 months of age, and tau pathology was detected in both major neuronal subpopulations of the SCN: VIPergic (core) and AVPergic (shell) neurons. To assess SCN timing and entrainment properties, daily locomotor activity was monitored in PS19 and wild-type (WT) mice from 3 to 11 months-of-age. Activity profiles, rates of re-entrainment to changes in the light/dark cycle, and intrinsic circadian timing properties were unchanged in PS19 mice compared to age-matched WT mice. Finally, profiling circadian gene expression in tau fibril-seeded SCN explants from PS19 and WT mice did not reveal differences in network-level oscillator properties. Together, these findings suggest that tau pathology within the SCN is not sufficient to trigger marked disruptions of core circadian timing mechanisms in this tauopathy model. Further, these results raise the possibility that circadian disruptions in tauopathies arise from dysfunction in SCN-gated output pathways or downstream clock-gated circuits rather than the SCN oscillator itself."
"Neural circuitry depends on excitatory and inhibitory regulation of activity to yield functional outputs. However, examinations of synaptic vesicle recycling have focused heavily on excitatory synapses, leaving many questions unanswered for inhibitory synapse dynamics. Here we show that both excitatory and inhibitory cortical synapses contain depots of a protein essential for ultrafast endocytosis, Dynamin 1xA, at a region immediately next to the active zone where ultrafast endocytosis takes place. Using zap- and-freeze time-resolved electron microscopy in mouse acute cortical slices, we observe uncoated pits reminiscent of ultrafast endocytic intermediates appearing post-stimulus at putative inhibitory synapses. These findings suggest that excitatory and inhibitory synapses may perform similar modes of endocytosis."
"The sensorimotor system develops early in utero and supports the emergence of body representations critical for perception, action, and interaction with environment. While somatotopic protomaps are already developed in the primary somatosensory and motor cortices in late pregnancy, little is known about the anatomical substrates of this functional specialization. In this study, we aimed to decipher the microstructural properties of these regions in the developing brain. Using advanced diffusion MRI and post-processing tools, we parcellated the pre- and post-central gyri into microstructurally distinct clusters along the lateral-to-medial axis in full-term neonates, confirming the early differentiation within sensorimotor regions. These clusters were further analyzed in preterm infants scanned near birth and at term-equivalent age (TEA), compared with another group of full-term neonates. Applying a multivariate Mahalanobis distance approach, we quantified deviations in preterm cortical microstructure relative to the full-term reference. Preterm infants showed significant region- and position-specific deviations at both ages, though these were smaller at TEA, consistently with ongoing maturation during the pre-term period. Differences between the pre- and post-central gyri, and along the somatotopic axis, suggested differential vulnerability to prematurity. In particular, the motor regions appeared to be at a more advanced stage of maturation close to birth and less vulnerable at TEA than somatosensory regions. An opposite trend was observed for lateral positions related to mouth representation compared with intermediary and medial positions. These findings support the notion that early sensorimotor cortical specialization is microstructurally emergent during gestation and sensitive to atypical developmental context of preterm birth."
"The cerebral cortex operates in a state of restless activity, even in the absence of external stimuli. Collective neuronal activities, such as neural avalanches and synchronized oscillations, are also found under rest conditions, and these features have been suggested to support sensory processing, brain readiness for rapid responses, and computational efficiency. The rat barrel cortex and thalamus circuit, with its somatotopic organization for processing whisker movements, provides a powerful system to explore such interplay. To characterize these resting state circuits, we perform simultaneous multi-electrode recordings in rats barrel cortex and thalamus. During spontaneous activity, oscillations with frequencies centered around 11.5 Hz are detected concomitantly with slow oscillations below 4 Hz, as well as power-law distributed avalanches. The phase of the lower-frequency oscillation appears to modulate the higher-frequency amplitude, and it has a role in gating avalanche occurrences. We then record neural activity during controlled whisker movements to confirm that the 11.5 Hz barrel circuit active at rest is indeed the one involved in response to whisker stimulation. We finally show how a thalamic-driven firing-rate model can describe the entire phenomenology observed at resting state and predict the response of the barrel cortex to controlled whisker movement."
"Ovarian cancer immunotherapy remains a challenge based on the ""cold"" tumor microenvironment. Herein we present a rational design to create immunogenic nanoparticles as a multi-agent platform that promotes immune response in a mouse model of ovarian cancer. The hybrid lipid-silica nanosystem is capable of co-loading four types of cargo molecules including a model antigen, nucleic acid-based adjuvant Cytosine-p-linked to Guanine (CpG, TLR3/9 agonist), lipid-based adjuvant (MPLA, TLR4 agonist) integrated into the lipid coat, and optionally a small molecule drug, such as the chemotherapeutic agent oxaliplatin, a well-established treatment for ovarian cancer. The optimization of the nanoplatform in terms of lipid composition, functionalized silica dendritic core formation, and final charge, as well as their compatibility with the complex loading profile highlights an opportunity for enhanced survival of mice with advanced ovarian cancer compared to monotherapy. Furthermore, intraperitoneal administration led to preferential accumulation within tumor-burdened tissues with selective accumulation in myeloid cells. High myeloid cell cytotoxicity negated the benefits of oxaliplatin. The inclusion of CpG in the nanoparticle formulation enhanced the survival of mice with ovarian cancer. To interpret these outcomes and guide future design, we also developed a mathematical model of nanoparticle-driven immune activation, which quantified treatment efficacy and identified key parameters governing tumor response. The presented hybrid nanoparticle i tunable, enabling delivery of alternative molecules therefore, thereby highlighting a promising platform for the treatment of peritoneal cancers.

"Vascular malformations are congenital lesions caused by somatic and germline mutations that disrupt developmental signaling pathways. Capillary malformations (CMs) typically present as port-wine stains in the skin and can also affect ocular and cerebral tissues in Sturge Weber Syndrome (SWS), leading to aesthetic, ophthalmic, and neurological complications. CMs are caused by a somatic mutation in the GNAQ gene in endothelial cells, leading to a p.R183Q substitution in the Gq protein. The underlying mechanisms of Gq-R183Q-driven CMs formation remain unclear. To address this, we generated CRISPR/Cas9-engineered human dermal microvascular endothelial cells lacking endogenous Gq, whilst expressing the Gq-R183Q mutant instead. The Gq-R183Q mutation strongly impaired endothelial cell migration and angiogenic sprouting capacity compared to wild-type controls. Next, using SILAC-based quantitative proteomics, we investigated the Gq-R183Q-induced changes in the endothelial phosphoproteome. These analyses revealed prominent activation of the calcineurin-NFAT signaling pathway in Gq-R183Q-expressing endothelial cells, leading to dephosphorylation of NFAT1 and NFAT2 and the selective expression of their transcriptional target DSCR1.4. Immunofluorescence of patient-derived skin biopsies confirmed deregulation of NFAT1/2 and the expression of DSRC1 in endothelial cells, validating their potential importance in CMs. We further demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition of calcineurin with tacrolimus (FK506) could partially restore NFAT signaling in Gq-R183Q endothelial cells. Intriguingly, the genetic depletion of the NFAT target DSCR1 in Gq-R183Q cells fully restored calcineurin/NFAT signaling to normal levels, enabling proper endothelial migration and sprouting. In summary, we uncovered a calcineurin-NFAT-DSCR1.4 signal transduction axis that is driven by Gq-R183Q and established its importance for endothelial angiogenic properties. These findings highlight the calcineurin/NFAT signaling axis as a promising therapeutic target to restore endothelial function in CMs."
"Osteoactivin (GPNMB) is a transmembrane protein expressed in multiple cell types with known functions in muscle, bone, and neurons, but the role of GPNMB in chondrocytes and cartilage homeostasis remains unknown. Here we show GPNMB is expressed in human and mouse primary chondrocytes, and that its expression is increased in damaged human cartilage and under pro-inflammatory conditions. We report that recombinant GPNMB treatment inhibits the expression of Mmps, Adamts-4 and Il-6 following IL-1{beta}-stimulation in vitro. In vivo, GPNMB function was assessed in a post-traumatic osteoarthritis model, destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM). Transgenic animals lacking functional GPNMB protein (DBA/2J) developed severe cartilage damage and demonstrated significant increases in pro-inflammatory cytokine expression following DMM. To elucidate the mechanism of action, we demonstrate that GPNMB regulates the MAPK signaling pathway in primary murine chondrocytes. Taken together, our results identify a novel anti-inflammatory role for GPNMB in cartilage and chondrocytes and identify GPNMB as a potential therapeutic modality for inflammatory joint diseases."
"The G1 and G2 variants of the gene encoding Apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) increase risk for kidney disease and cardiometabolic traits. While previous studies have elucidated key mechanisms by which G1 and G2 APOL1 cause cellular inflammation and cytotoxicity, it remains unclear whether these mechanisms drive inflammation in G1 and G2 macrophages. In this study, we used mouse bone-marrow-derived macrophages and human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived macrophages to identify altered immune signaling and inflammatory activation caused by G1 and G2 APOL1. We demonstrated that G1 and G2 APOL1 increased lipid accumulation, pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, and inflammasome signaling; this inflammatory response was sustained when treated with anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-4 and IL-10. Additionally, in G1 and G2 macrophages we observed increased mitochondrial size and elongation, oxidative phosphorylation, and glycolysis. Finally, we used unbiased metabolite analysis to identify an accumulation of polyamine spermidine and the enrichment of the spermidine synthesis pathway in G1 and G2 macrophages. When treated with polyamine inhibitor -difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), lipid accumulation and inflammasome gene expression decreased in G1 and G2 macrophages. Together, these findings establish the pro-inflammatory effects of G1 and G2 APOL1 in macrophages and identify a novel pathway which ameliorates G1 and G2 effects on cellular inflammation."
"A growing number of studies shows that nuclear movement, positioning, and the mechanical constraints applied to the nucleus play important roles in cellular physiology and gene regulation. This process, known as nuclear mechanotransduction, is an emerging field of research, and its deregulation can lead to severe human pathologies. In this study, we examine the behavior of female and male nuclei during sexual reproduction in the model fungus Podospora anserina. After plasmogamy, the two types of nuclei do not immediately undergo karyogamy. Instead, once inside the trichogyne (the female-specific hyphae extending from the ascogonium) the male nuclei migrate over distances of up to several hundred micrometers from the trichogyne tip, where plasmogamy occurs, to the ascogonium at the center of the protoperithecium. Our study highlights the contrasting behaviors of the two nuclear types: female nuclei remain immobile and spherical, while male nuclei move rapidly and exhibit striking deformations and stretching. Trichogynes are branched and compartmentalized, consisting of articles separated by septa that communicate through the septal pores. We show that during their migration across these compartments, male nuclei undergo the most extreme movements, deformations, and speeds reported to date for nuclei in motion. We also investigated the role of the actin and microtubule (MT) cytoskeletons in male nuclei behavior. Both cytoskeletal networks are highly dynamic and abundant in trichogynes, particularly at septa. We demonstrate that while actin depolymerization does not impair male nuclei migration, MT disruption causes a complete arrest of both nuclear movement and stretching, indicating a critical role for MTs. Finally, we reveal that the MT network in trichogynes is highly polarized, offering new insights into how male nuclei navigate within branched trichogynes."
"Flaviviruses such as dengue and Zika viruses extensively remodel host cell membranes to create specialised replication organelles, but the molecular mechanisms governing lipid metabolism during infection remain poorly understood.

Through systematic screens of fatty acyl transferase enzymes (MBOAT and zDHHC families) and complementary approaches including CRISPR/Cas9 gene deletions, pharmacological inhibition, proteomics, and photo-crosslinkable cholesterol analogues, we identified Sterol O-acyltransferases 1 and 2 (SOAT1/SOAT2) as critical host dependency factors for flavivirus infection. SOAT1/2 activities were upregulated early during infection, coinciding with increased LD formation, which underwent transition to liquid crystalline phases. Genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of either enzyme resulted in a dramatic [~]100-fold reduction in viral production. Mechanistically, SOAT1/2 generate cholesteryl ester-enriched lipid droplets with fundamentally altered proteomes, enriched in fatty acid remodelling enzymes, Rab-GTPases, lipid transport proteins and sphingomyelinases. Photo-crosslinking experiments demonstrated direct interactions between LD-derived cholesterol and viral prM, capsid and NS1. SOAT1/2 deficiency resulted in defective, viral RNA-free replication organelles and complete absence of immature virions. Supporting the clinical relevance of viral lipid exploitation, analysis of dengue patients from a Sri Lankan cohort revealed that central obesity significantly increased the risk of severe dengue haemorrhagic fever, compared to lean patients.

This study establishes SOAT1/2 as essential host factors that enable flavivirus morphogenesis through specialised cholesteryl ester-enriched LDs, revealing a previously unrecognised virus-host interaction mechanism and identifying host lipid metabolism as a promising therapeutic target for combating flavivirus infections."
"Flaviviruses such as dengue and Zika viruses extensively remodel host cell membranes to create specialised replication organelles, but the molecular mechanisms governing lipid metabolism during infection remain poorly understood.

Through systematic screens of fatty acyl transferase enzymes (MBOAT and zDHHC families) and complementary approaches including CRISPR/Cas9 gene deletions, pharmacological inhibition, proteomics, and photo-crosslinkable cholesterol analogues, we identified Sterol O-acyltransferases 1 and 2 (SOAT1/SOAT2) as critical host dependency factors for flavivirus infection. SOAT1/2 activities were upregulated early during infection, coinciding with increased LD formation, which underwent transition to liquid crystalline phases. Genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of either enzyme resulted in a dramatic [~]100-fold reduction in viral production. Mechanistically, SOAT1/2 generate cholesteryl ester-enriched lipid droplets with fundamentally altered proteomes, enriched in fatty acid remodelling enzymes, Rab-GTPases, lipid transport proteins and sphingomyelinases. Photo-crosslinking experiments demonstrated direct interactions between LD-derived cholesterol and viral prM, capsid and NS1. SOAT1/2 deficiency resulted in defective, viral RNA-free replication organelles and complete absence of immature virions. Supporting the clinical relevance of viral lipid exploitation, analysis of dengue patients from a Sri Lankan cohort revealed that central obesity significantly increased the risk of severe dengue haemorrhagic fever, compared to lean patients.

This study establishes SOAT1/2 as essential host factors that enable flavivirus morphogenesis through specialised cholesteryl ester-enriched LDs, revealing a previously unrecognised virus-host interaction mechanism and identifying host lipid metabolism as a promising therapeutic target for combating flavivirus infections."
"Lysosomes break down macromolecules, clear cellular waste and recycle nutrients such as cystine. We describe a novel mechanism whereby JIP4 regulates lysosomal cystine storage by controlling the abundance of cystinosin (CTNS), the transporter responsible for lysosomal cystine efflux. To this end, JIP4, previously characterized as a motor adaptor and kinase signaling scaffold, suppresses TMEM55B-dependent ubiquitylation of CTNS. Loss of JIP4 reduces CTNS protein levels, leading to lysosomal cystine accumulation and lysosomal storage defects that phenocopy loss of CTNS in both human cells and the renal proximal tubules of JIP4 knockout mice. These phenotypes mirror cystinosis, the lysosomal storage disease caused by CTNS loss-of-function. Our findings thus reveal a fundamental process that controls the efflux of lysosomal cystine and has relevance to understanding human disease arising from JIP4 mutations."
"The transient upregulation of cellular senescence within wound tissues has been demonstrated to be an important biological process facilitating efficient tissue repair. Dysregulation of this transient wound-induced senescence-like response can result in impaired healing outcomes. Given the established age-related decline in tissue regenerative capacity, we hypothesized that alterations in this senescence response contribute to the delayed healing of cutaneous wounds in aged individuals. Our investigation demonstrated a significant delay in the closure of full-thickness dorsal skin wounds in aged mice compared to their young counterparts. Analysis of the wound microenvironment revealed a transient upregulation of senescence-associated markers (p16, p21, senescence-associated {beta}-galactosidase) and senescence-associated secretory phenotype factors in the wound tissue of young mice, a response that was markedly attenuated in aged mice. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of all cells isolated from day 6 wounds identified a distinct population of p16+/p21+/Ki67- senescent fibroblasts in young mice, characterized by a transcriptional signature indicative of pro-healing extracellular matrix production, a finding corroborated in human wound tissue from young donors. Crucially, in aged wounds, we observed a lower quantity of these senescent cells, a deficit compounded by a qualitative, age-dependent shift in their function, moving away from beneficial extracellular matrix remodeling towards a more detrimental pro-inflammatory state, which ultimately can contribute to the delayed wound healing."
"The embryonic development of the liver is initiated by the emergence of hepatoblasts, originating from the ventral foregut endoderm adjacent to the heart. Here, we identify and characterize a previously unrecognized population of early hepatoblasts at the ventroposterior part of the emerging liver bud, traced from Cdx2-positive endoderm progenitors, which we term primitive hepatoblasts. Mouse and human single-cell transcriptomics reveals the expression of both canonical hepatoblast markers TBX3, FGB, and KRT8/18 and primitive-specific mesenchymal markers ID3, VIM, and GATA4. Lineage tracing revealed the notable contribution up to 12.6% of LIV2+ hepatoblasts at E11.5 but diminishes in late fetal and postnatal development. Epigenetic and functional perturbation studies further uncover that primitive hepatoblast emergence is primed by WNT-suppression on RA-permissive CDX2+FOXA2+ progenitors. Furthermore, human pluripotent stem cell-derived primitive hepatoblast-like cells secrete pleiotrophin and midkine to amplify hepatoblast populations and develop epithelial-mesenchymal hybrid tissues in vivo. Our results provide a new framework for understanding lineage heterogeneity during early hepatogenesis and offer revised insights into strategies to model normal and abnormal liver development."
"Honeybees encounter low environmental doses of ethanol, primarily through fermenting nectar, which can have both beneficial and detrimental effects on their functioning. Yet, ethanol traces can also be detected in the crop of caged bees with no access to environmental food sources. This raises the possibility that endogenous ethanol accumulation could occur under restricted conditions, with microbial contributions as a potential mechanism. The crop microbiota, although less diverse than that in other gut segments, plays important roles in food fermentation and pathogen defense. We hypothesized that captivity-induced shifts in crop microbiota may facilitate fermentation, resulting in measurable ethanol. To test this, we compared the crop contents of naturally foraging hive bees and caged bees reared without access to the natural environment. Ethanol levels were low in both groups and did not differ significantly, but non-zero measurements were more frequently observed in caged bees. Microbial community structure differed strongly in - and {beta}-diversity. Caged bees showed reduced abundance of nectar-associated genera (e.g., Apilactobacillus) and an increase in genera that include known ethanol-producing strains, such as Gilliamella and Bifidobacterium. While we did not directly assess metabolic activity, our results suggest that captivity alters microbial communities in ways that may influence ethanol levels. This raises broader questions about how microbe-host interactions modulate host phenotypes under different environmental conditions."
"BackgroundSperm chromosomes are non-randomly organized in the cell nucleus, which plays an important role in the regulation of early embryo development. It is determined by the specific localisation of sperm chromosomal regions carrying genes with expression crucial at the first contact with ooplasm during fertilization. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine whether the application of selective methods providing high-quality spermatozoa with good motility and/or morphology, may increase the frequency of gametes with the specific positioning of chromosomes. For the first time we have used the sequential staining algorithm for consecutive analyses of the same individual sperm cells with a fixed position, what enables to achieve a full and detailed documentation at the single cell level.

MethodsSemen samples from 5 normozoospermic males were collected and processed for fractionation via swim up (to select viable and motile spermatozoa) or Percoll density gradient (90/47%; for good sperm motility and morphology). Sperm chromatin protamination was assessed by aniline blue (AB) staining, while DNA fragmentation by acridine orange (AO) (ssDNA fragmentation) or TUNEL assay (ssDNA and dsDNA fragmentation). Then, sequential staining and analyses of the same individual sperm cell with a fixed position on a slide were performed, in the following order: (i) fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for determination of positioning of chromosomal centromeres: 4, 7, 8, 9, 18, X and Y, with so-called: linear and radial estimations applied, followed by distance measurements between selected pairs of chromosomes; and (ii) immunofluorescent (IF) measurement of global sperm DNA methylation (5mC) and hydroxymethylation (5hmC) levels, what added additional data about epigenetic layer of the sperm chromosomes positioning.

ResultsOur study demonstrated that high-quality sperm selection methods significantly: (i) increased frequency of spermatozoa with good chromatin protamination (+[~]25%) and 5mC and 5hmC DNA levels (+[~]9.5%), and (ii) reduced rate of spermatozoa with ssDNA fragmentation (-[~]65%). Motile and morphologically normal spermatozoa showed distinct chromosome repositioning with sex chromosomes shifted to the nuclear periphery, a key chromosomal region of the initial interaction with the ooplasm during fertilization process. Evaluated autosomes revealed various patterns of repositioning.

Conclusions

Our findings underline the validity of methods used for selection of high-quality spermatozoa in assisted reproductive technologies (ART), also in the context of the sperm chromosomal topology and chromatin integrity, crucial at the first steps during fertilization."
"BackgroundRespiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) causes significant respiratory infections, particularly in young children and elderly adults. Genetic variations in the fusion (F) protein can reduce the efficacy of vaccination and monoclonal antibody treatments, emphasizing the need for genomic surveillance of this virus. Current pipelines for RSV genome assembly focus on sequence reconstruction but often lack features for detecting genotypes, clinically relevant mutations, or presenting results in formats that are suitable for clinical researchers.

MethodsWe developed a reference-based computational pipeline for comprehensive RSV genomic analysis, integrating quality control, reference mapping, consensus calling, phylogenetic analysis, and genotype assignment using cutting-edge bioinformatics tools. Its modular design, powered by Nextflows modern framework, ensures easy installation, scalability, and cross-platform compatibility.

ResultsRSVrecon processes raw FASTQ files into annotated variant reports and delivers results in multiple formats (CSV, PDF, HTML) tailored to diverse end users. A key innovation of RSVrecon is its integrated detection of clinically critical features, including genotype classification and F protein mutation calling, capabilities that are absent in most analytical pipelines. Benchmarking against existing pipelines using clinical datasets revealed that RSVrecon achieves comparable genomic assembly accuracy while excelling in three key dimensions: (1) expanded functional capabilities, (2) intuitive biological interpretation of the results, and (3) superior user experience and accessibility.

ConclusionBy seamlessly translating RSV genomic data into clinically meaningful information, RSVrecon empowers research breakthroughs, guides clinical care decisions, and strengthens surveillance systems. These features make RSVrecon a superior solution for RSV surveillance and research."
"Advances in spatial profiling have resulted in the generation of multi-omic atlases that span biological scales. In general, multiple workflows are required for image registration, coordinate registration, and spot deconvolution to integrate modalities. To improve the throughput of registration of multi-omic cohorts, we introduce PIVOT, a user-friendly and open-source interface for streamlined nonlinear registration. We demonstrate PIVOTs strengths through registration of three multi-omic datasets, and show comparison of its performance to existing workflows."
"BackgroundFiltering records using command line tools is a staple of Bioin-formatics. In analysis pipelines and in day-to-day research tools such as awk, grep, and cut are the workhorses of much of our data crunching. To date, there is no command line utility for performing index-free alignment-based filtering of records.

ResultsIsh is a classic and composable unix-style CLI tool. It takes a query and filters the input target records to only those that match the input query with a threshold alignment score, using a selectable alignment algorithm. The core alignment algorithms for Ish meet or exceed the performance of their reference implementations for both SIMD and GPU alignment, as measured by gigacell updates per second (GCUPs).

ConclusionsIsh fills a longstanding gap in Bioinformatics tooling by offering a CLI utility for index-free alignment-based record filtering. Additionally, it provides meaningfully improved versions of the classic striped local and semi-global full dynamic programming algorithms, along with a GPU-based semi-global alignment method."
"Gene expression analysis has long been fundamental for elucidating molecular pathways and gene- disease relationships, but traditional single-gene approaches cannot capture the coordinated regulatory networks underlying complex phenotypes; although unsupervised matrix factorization methods (e.g., PCA, NMF) reveal coexpression patterns, they lack the ability to incorporate prior biological knowledge and often struggle with interpretability and technical noise correction. Semi-supervised strategies such as PLIER have improved interpretability by integrating pathway annotations during latent variable extraction, yet the original PLIER implementation is prohibitively slow and memory-intensive, making it impractical for modern large-scale resources like ARCHS4 or recount3. Here, we introduce PLIERv2, which overcomes these constraints through a two-phase algorithmic design (an unsupervised ""PLIERbase"" initialization followed by a ""PLIERfull"" regression that incorporates priors via glmnet), rigorous internal cross-validation to tune regularization parameters for each latent variable, and efficient on-disk data handling using memory-mapped matrices from the bigstatsr package. Benchmarking on GTEx, recount2, and ARCHS4 demonstrates that PLIERv2 achieves 7x-41x speedups over PLIERv1, succeeds in modeling hundreds of thousands of samples that PLIERv1 cannot handle, and maintains or improves biological specificity of latent variables as shown by tissue-alignment and pathway enrichment analyses. By filling the gap in scalable, biologically informed latent variable extraction, PLIERv2 enables comprehensive analysis of modern transcriptomic compendia and paves the way for deeper insights into gene regulatory networks and downstream applications in translational genomics."
"A[Formula][s][t]rac[t]O_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSHIV-2 is a major threat to human health because of its rising global incidence. As a result, the development of effective immunostimulatory molecules for vaccine design against HIV-2 has garnered increasing interest.

ObjectiveThe main objective was to make a multi Targeting epitoptpic vaccine for HIV-2 envelope protein using immunoinformatic approaches.

MethodsSequence were retrieved from NCBI. B & T-cell epitopes were predicted with assessments of antigenicity, allergenicity, and cytokine-inducing potential. Physicochemical properties, docking studies, and codon optimization for expression was also performed using different software tools.

FindingsThe designed vaccine construct (477 amino acids, molecular weight of 54 kDa) showed a strong antigenicity with VaxiJen score of 0.7146 which was non-allergenic and non-toxic with favorable physicochemical parameters (Mw: [~]53 kDa; pI: 9.89; stable and soluble). The construct demonstrated broad population coverage for MHC-I (West Africa: 69.51%, Pakistan: 78%, Global: 82%) and MHC-II (Global: 99%). Out of 16 peptides analyzed, 7 were predicted as IL-10 inducers 2 as a strong IL-4 inducer, and 2 were IFN-{gamma} inducing epitopes. Structural validation confirmed high-quality folding (96% residues in favored regions; ERRAT score: 84.35). Docking results revealed a strong binding affinity to TLR2 (PDB ID: 2AOZ; energy: -1481.1 kcal/mol). MD simulation confirmed structural stability (RMSD [~]1.37 nm; Rg [~]3.65 nm). Immune simulation predicted robust humoral and cellular responses with sustained antibody production and cytokine activation. Codon optimization is given to a Codon Adaptation Index (CAI) of 0.628 with a guanine (G) and cytosine (C) nucleotides content of 65.48%, suitable for E. coli expression.

ConclusionThis vaccine construct is immunogenic, stable, and able to elicit both antibody-mediated immunity and cell-mediated immunity responses. Furthermore, In-vitro or In-Vivo Validations are recommended to verify its effectiveness

"The rapid expansion of genomic and biomedical data has paved the way for constructing complex disease networks, offering new insights into disease mechanisms and therapeutic target identification. Central to these networks are disease modules, which are constructed from seed genes that are prioritized based on their relevance to a given disease. Gene prioritization aims to rank genes based on their strength of association with a disease. Resources like DisGeNET, integrated within DISNET knowledge base, assigns a Gene-Disease Association (GDA) score that reflects the confidence in the association between a gene and a disease. This study investigates how both disease module sizes and GDA scores influence the statistical significance of these modules. By characterizing disease modules, filtering the data based on their GDA score thresholds, and analysing the relationship between their size, GDA score, and significance, potential cutoffs for robust module construction are estimated. Our findings suggest that disease modules filtered to include GDA scores above 0.3 and module sizes greater than 10 tend to be significant. These insights provide guidance for optimal gene prioritization and module selection, ultimately enhancing strategies for target identification and drug repurposing in network medicine."
"Single-particle tracking methods have emerged as a crucial tool for the characterization of dynamical and diffusive processes in a range of biological and synthetic systems. Here, we propose a simple and light-weight yet accurate method for the segmentation of multi-state Brownian trajectories based on an optimised Gaussian filtering of the displacement time series combined with an automated fitting to a Gaussian mixture model. We demonstrate our method on synthetic, 2-state Brownian trajectories and show that our method provides high levels of accuracy in terms of segmentation and the estimation of self-diffusion coefficients for reasonably well-separated values of the diffusion coefficients. Compared to methods based on deep learning or hidden Markov models our method imposes a much lower computational load, making it suitable for fast and accurate online processing of single-particle trajectories from microscopy images."
"PurposeTo extend the Running Energy Expenditure Estimation (RE3) model for predicting metabolic rates during uphill and downhill running as well as to enhance the Hoogkamer-Taboga-Kram (HTK) equation for estimating metabolic rates during level and uphill running.

MethodsWe combined running metabolic data from an original dataset (n=63) with individual subject data from 26 studies (n=424) and group mean data from 12 studies (n=187). Using this integrated dataset, we derived a new graded running term for the empirical RE3 model and updated the HTK equation coefficients for level and uphill running. We then compared the accuracy and precision of these new equations with the established American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) and Minetti et al. equations based on the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD).

ResultsAccuracy and precision of estimating level [M] were high for the Minetti et al. (RMSD, 1.44 W{middle dot}kg-1), HTK (1.30 W{middle dot}kg-1), and RE3 (1.27 W{middle dot}kg-1) equations but much worse for the ACSM equation (1.82 W{middle dot}kg-1). Agreement on uphill slopes was highest for the HTK (RMSD, 1.45 W{middle dot}kg-1) and RE3 (1.41 W{middle dot}kg-1) equations with less precision noted for the ACSM (2.17 W{middle dot}kg-1) and Minetti et al. (2.18 W{middle dot}kg-1) equations. When estimating [M] during downhill running, the RE3 equation performed marginally better (RMSD, 1.45 W{middle dot}kg-1) than the Minetti et al. equation (1.57 W{middle dot}kg-1).

ConclusionThe improved RE3 and HTK equations estimate metabolic rates during level and graded running with improved accuracy and precision. We provide a publicly available web-based metabolic rate calculator that simplifies estimation for researchers, practitioners, and runners alike."
"Biomedical systems inherently exhibit multi-scale dynamics, making accurate system identification particularly challenging due to the complexity of capturing a wide time scale spectrum. Traditional methods capable of addressing this issue rely on explicit equations, limiting their applicability in cases where only observational data are available. To overcome this limitation, we propose a data-driven framework that integrates the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) method, the multi scale analysis algorithm Computational Singular Perturbation (CSP) and neural networks (NNs). This framework allows the partition of the available dataset in subsets characterized by similar dynamics, so that system identification can proceed within these subsets without facing a wide time scale spectrum. Accordingly, when the full dataset does not allow SINDy to identify the proper model, CSP is employed for the generation of subsets of similar dynamics, which are then fed into SINDy. CSP requires the availability of the gradient of the vector field, which is estimated by the NNs. The framework is tested on the Michaelis-Menten model, for which various reduced models in analytic form exist at different parts of the phase space. It is demonstrated that the CSP-based data subsets allow SINDy to identify the proper reduced model in cases where the full dataset does not. In addition, it is demonstrated that the framework succeeds even in the cases where the available data set originates from stochastic versions of the Michaelis-Menten model. This framework is algorithmic, so system identification is not hindered by the dimensions of the dataset.

Author summaryBiomedical systems often evolve across multiple time scales, posing major challenges for constructing accurate models directly from data. Traditional model reduction techniques require explicit equations and thus cannot be applied when only observational data are available. To address this, we developed a data-driven framework that combines Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy), Computational Singular Perturbation (CSP) and neural networks (NNs). Our approach automatically partitions a dataset into subsets characterized by similar dynamics, allowing valid reduced models to be identified in each region. When SINDy fails to recover a global model from the full dataset, CSP -leveraging Jacobian estimates from NNs-successfully isolates dynamical regimes where SINDy can be applied locally. We validated this framework using the Michaelis-Menten biochemical model, which is known to admit multiple reduced models in different regions of the phase space. Our method consistently identified the appropriate reduced dynamics, even when the data originated from stochastic simulations. Because our approach is algorithmic and equation-free, it is scalable to high-dimensional systems and robust to noise, offering a promising solution for data-driven model discovery in complex biomedical systems."
"Background and AimsVisceral pain is a cardinal symptom of many disorders affecting the gut. Modulators of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) such as benzodiazepines may attenuate colonic pain but the specific contribution of peripheral GABAA receptors remains unclear as these agents have prominent central effects.

MethodsUsing medicinal chemistry optimization of the benzodiazepine scaffold, we developed a novel and potent benzodiazepine-based positive allosteric modulator (PAM) of GABAA receptors, Li633, with no significant central nervous system (CNS) penetration.

ResultsThe locomotor activity of rats placed in an open field was unchanged with Li633 at doses up to 30 mg/kg, confirming its lack of a CNS effect. LI-633 produced robust potentiation of GABA-induced inward current, with EC50 values ranging from 8 nM (5{beta}2{gamma}2) to 128 nM (3{beta}2{gamma}2). In vitro electrophysiological studies confirmed its ability to reduce excitability of human dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. LI-633 potentiated muscimol-induced GABAergic currents in rat DRG neurons in a dose-dependent manner, with an EC50 of 70.4 nM. In vivo, LI-633 significantly attenuated visceral hypersensitivity and pain behavior in a rat model of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and functional dyspepsia (FD). In the IBS model, administration of the drug also resulted in decreased excitability of colon-specific DRG neurons and significantly reduced the colonic afferent response to balloon distention as measured by recordings of neural activity in dorsal ganglia rootlets.

ConclusionsThese findings highlight the potential of targeting peripheral GABAA receptors for pain management in IBS and other disorders associated with visceral hypersensitivity."
"Plastic is considered an inert material with high durability and minimal to virtually no decomposition. However, when released into the environment, they can degrade into very small particles, forming micro- and nanoplastic particles (MNP). This systematic review and meta-analysis synthesized the evidence from controlled preclinical studies to investigate the neurological effects of MNPs in fish. Following a pre-registered protocol, we searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus for studies exposing fish to virgin MNPs under controlled conditions, reporting behavioral or neurochemical outcomes relevant to central nervous system function. Data were synthesized using a hierarchical random-effects model with robust variance estimation. Fifty-nine studies, comprising 723 comparisons across 13 behavioral and neurochemical outcomes, were included in the meta-analysis. The analysis accounted for correlated effect sizes within shared control groups; and nested identifiers for study, control group, and effect size. Results indicated high heterogeneity and no consistent effect of the MNP exposure on behavioral or neurochemical parameters, except for reduced traveled distance in sensory-motor assays. Meta-regression examined whether developmental stage, exposure duration, and MNP size or concentration moderate these effects. No significant moderators were identified, except for catalase activity, where longer exposure reduced enzyme activity in larvae. The findings should be interpreted with caution, as reporting quality was generally low, with key methodological details often omitted. Additionally, publication bias was found for several outcomes, and influential case analyses revealed that a few studies disproportionately affected the overall estimates. Further studies are needed to clarify the impact of MNPs on fish neurobiology and behavior."
"Childhood maltreatment (CM), encompassing abuse and neglect, affects over two-thirds of the general population and increases risk for stress-related psychopathology, including major depressive disorder (MDD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The extent to which neuroanatomical alterations in MDD and PTSD are attributable to CM, however, is uncertain. Here, we analyzed CM and 3D structural brain MRI data from 3,711 participants in the ENIGMA MDD and PTSD Working Groups (25 sites; 33.3{+/-}13.0 years; 59.9% female). Normative modeling estimated deviation z-scores for 14 subcortical volumes (SV), 68 cortical thickness (CT), and 68 surface area (SA) measures, capturing differences from population norms. Transdiagnostic associations between CM and brain deviation scores were evaluated within each sex and age cohort. In young adults (ages 18-35), abuse was associated with larger volumes in thalamus and pallidum, thinner isthmus cingulate and middle frontal regions, and thicker medial orbitofrontal cortex; there were no significant effects in pediatric ([&le;]18 years) participants. The strongest effects were observed in young female adults (|{beta}|=.07-.22, q<.05): greater abuse and neglect were correlated with smaller hippocampus and putamen volumes, thinner entorhinal cortex, and smaller SA in fusiform/inferior parietal regions, and with larger SA in orbitofrontal and occipital cortices. In males, abuse had widespread effects on CT and SA (|{beta}|=.1-.18, q<.05); effects for neglect were minimal. Our findings of age- and sex-specific instantiations of CM on brain morphometry highlight the importance of developmental context in understanding how adverse experiences shape neurobiological vulnerability to MDD and PTSD."
"BackgroundEarly psychosis (EP) is characterized by neurobiological changes, including alterations in resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC). We now understand that symptoms and neural changes may overlap across EP diagnostic categories. However, the relationship between RSFC patterns and transdiagnostic symptom dimensions remains poorly understood.

MethodsWe employed Partial Least Squares correlation to examine multivariate relationships between whole-brain RSFC and clinical symptoms in 124 EP patients (aged 16-35 years) diagnosed with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or a psychotic mood disorder. RSFC was computed among 216 cortical and subcortical regions. Clinical assessment included 41 symptom measures spanning positive, negative, general psychopathology, and manic dimensions.

ResultsAnalysis revealed one significant latent component (p<0.001) capturing 41.6% of the RSFC-symptom covariance. This component was characterized by increased between-network connectivity, particularly involving sensory-motor, default mode, and subcortical regions including the amygdala and thalamus. The associated symptom profile included cognitive rigidity and arousal dysregulation (stereotyped thinking, anxiety, and somatic concerns), rather than traditional positive or negative symptoms. This brain-behavior relationship was consistent across diagnoses and independent of medication and substance use. The clinical relevance was validated through significant correlations with standardized measures of hostility (r=0.23), negative affect (r=0.25), and perceived stress (r=0.22).

ConclusionsOur findings reveal a distinct transdiagnostic phenotype in EP characterized by cognitive inflexibility and arousal dysregulation that is associated with altered integration between sensory, default mode, and subcortical networks. This work suggests that specific patterns of network-level functional connectivity may relate to symptom dimensions that cut across conventional diagnostic boundaries, potentially informing more targeted therapeutic approaches."
"Nervous system assembly is guided by the actions of cell surface receptors. In Drosophila, members of the Beaten Path (Beat) and Sidestep (Side) protein families have been described as axon guidance receptor-cue pairs, in addition to roles in specifying synaptic connectivity in the optic lobe. To understand the molecular basis and specificity of Beat-Side interactions, we report here the first Beat-Side structure, Beat-Vc bound to Side-VI. The structure showed a binding topology similar to other neuronal immunoglobulin superfamily receptors, especially Nectins, SynCAMs, Dprs and DIPs, despite lack of established evolutionary relationships. Using a structure-based rational approach, we engineered and validated point mutations to break the binding between Beats and Sides. Using these mutant variants, we demonstrated in developing Drosophila larvae that the interaction between Beat-Ia and Side is required for establishing proper connectivity of motor neurons with muscles."
"BackgroundAmbient air pollution poses significant risks to brain health. Hippocampal structure and function are particularly vulnerable, yet the extent to which they are associated with air pollution in children remains unclear. We therefore conducted multi-pollutant mixture analyses to examine how air pollution influences hippocampal architecture and memory performance in late childhood.

MethodsWe used partial least squares correlation to explore cross-sectional associations between fifteen PM2.5 components, six PM2.5 source factors, NO2, and ozone exposures, and measures of hippocampal microstructure and volume in children aged 9-11 years (n = 7,940) We adjusted for demographic, socioeconomic, and neuroimaging confounds. We also tested whether air pollutants were associated with hippocampal-dependent list-learning memory performance to examine functional implications of air pollution exposure. Shared variance refers to the proportion of total covariance between variable sets captured by each latent dimension in the multivariate relationship.

FindingsIn the first latent dimension, greater exposure to organic carbon and ozone was associated with differential hippocampal diffusion (72% of shared variance), whereas the second latent dimension linked elemental carbon and iron to hippocampal diffusion (24% of shared variance). Source-based analyses identified biomass burning and traffic pollution as key contributors (61% and 32% variance, respectively). Volumetric analyses revealed higher copper and zinc exposure correlated with smaller hippocampal subregion volumes (left head, right body, tail; 77% variance), whereas lower nickel levels correlated with smaller right head volume (12% variance). Higher industrial and traffic pollutants were also associated with smaller hippocampal volumes (75% variance). We found two latent dimensions (67% and 23% variance, respectively) showing poorer learning, immediate recall, and mnemonic interference performance linked to higher calcium, elemental carbon, and zinc, and organic carbon, alongside lower copper exposure. Finally, hippocampal diffusion (higher free water/lower hindered extracellular diffusion; 83% variance) and smaller tail volumes (96% variance) were linked to poorer RAVLT recall.

InterpretationThese results underscore the complex relationship between air pollution exposure and hippocampal architecture and cautions that such structural changes may either presage or reflect subtle differences in neurocomputational mechanisms associated with learning and memory performance in children.

Research in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSUsing PubMed, we conducted a MeSH and text keyword search for air pollution (e.g., ""Air Pollution"" OR ""Air Pollutant"" OR ""Air Pollutants"" OR ""Particulate Matter"") and structural MRI (""magnetic resonance image"" OR ""magnetic resonance images"" OR ""magnetic resonance imaging"" OR ""MRI"") among children and adolescents (<24 years-old), published until January 15, 2025, without language restrictions. Existing studies primarily focused on single pollutants or total hippocampal volume across various populations (children, adults, animals), leaving significant knowledge gaps regarding the specific impacts of PM2.5 components and their sources on hippocampal structure during childhood. Previous research on hippocampal structure also generally lacked detailed exploration of hippocampal subregions and rarely employed advanced neuroimaging sensitive to microstructural changes. Existing evidence was inconsistent due to methodological differences and variations in pollutant types and exposure periods.

Added value of this studyThis study significantly advances our understanding by explicitly linking specific PM2.5 components and their source-specific mixtures to detailed hippocampal architecture differences in late childhood. Using advanced neuroimaging (restriction spectrum imaging and volumetric analyses), we identified precise microstructural and volumetric changes associated with exposure to organic carbon, metals, ozone, and pollutant sources such as biomass burning, traffic, industrial emissions, and agricultural pollution. Importantly, our findings also showed associations between PM2.5 components and episodic memory performance, highlighting the neurodevelopmental impacts of complex air pollutant mixtures for the life course. This evidence underscores the necessity of targeting source-specific air pollution (e.g., biomass burning, traffic, and industrial emissions) during critical developmental windows to safeguard lifelong cognitive health.

Implications of all the available evidenceFactors in childhood profoundly shape the trajectory of neurocognitive aging, including risks for dementia and other age-related diseases. Our results support the concept that early-life environmental exposures significantly influence brain health, including cognitive function, and emphasize that preventive strategies must begin early. Future longitudinal studies should therefore address how childhood air pollution exposures, with particular focus on which sources, influence subsequent cognitive trajectories, neurodegeneration, and overall brain health in adulthood and older age. This approach will provide critical insights for targeted interventions and policymaking aimed at reducing early-life environmental exposures and promoting healthy aging from childhood into adulthood."
"{gamma}{delta} T cells that produce IL-17 ({gamma}{delta}T17) play essential roles in barrier immunity, but the gene networks that install their functions are not well understood. We previously linked T cell receptor (TCR) signal strength to the proportional upregulation of Id3 during T cell development, which antagonizes the activity of HEB (encoded by Tcf12), and showed that HEB is required for {gamma}{delta}T17 development. To understand how HEB and Id3 regulate {gamma}{delta}T17 cell development, we conducted single cell RNA-sequencing on fetal thymic {gamma}{delta} T cells from Tcf12-deficient mice. {gamma}{delta} T cells lacking HEB exhibited profound alterations in the expression of the genes encoding the TCR{gamma} and TCR{delta} chains, accompanied by a decrease in expression of genes in the early {gamma}{delta} T cell specification network. Surprisingly, Id3 was among the most severely decreased genes in HEB-deficient {gamma}{delta} T cell precursors, suggesting a requirement for HEB in Id3 expression. Analysis of fetal thymic {gamma}{delta} T cells in Id3-deficient mice revealed that the TCR{gamma} and TCR{delta} repertoires were unaffected, and expression of early {gamma}{delta} T cell genes was unperturbed. However, later stage regulators of {gamma}{delta}T17 cell differentiation were decreased, and Id3-deficient {gamma}{delta} T cells were defective in IL-17 production. Therefore, our findings reveal an interlinked network in which HEB is initially required to upregulate Id3 expression, which in turn enables the later stages of {gamma}{delta}T17 cell development and functional programming.

One Sentence SummaryDuring {gamma}{delta} T cell development, the transcription factor HEB upregulates its antagonist Id3, which is required in turn for the maturation of pro-inflammatory {gamma}{delta} T cells."
"African swine fever virus (ASFV) poses a significant threat to pork production and wild pig populations worldwide. The study assessed the long-term fate and immunity of animals recovering from a moderately virulent ASFV infection, following the principles of a duration of immunity study for live vaccines. Pigs inoculated with the moderately virulent ASFV strain  Estonia14 largely developed mild clinical signs and only transient viremia. Six months after the initial inoculation and once fully recovered, all the animals were challenged with highly virulent ASFV  Armenia08. Only one of the previously exposed pigs exhibited mild clinical signs, while all control animals showed typical signs of acute, lethal ASF. Moreover, only a subset of pigs inoculated with the ASF strain  Estonia14 displayed temporary detectability of ASFV genomes following challenge infection. Virus isolation corroborated these findings, with low levels of infectious virus in organs of previously inoculated pigs (28 days post challenge). Furthermore, monitoring of IgM and IgG kinetics enabled the analysis of humoral responses. IgG levels were sustained over the study period and increased slightly upon challenge infection. Lastly, plasma analysis revealed elevated complement factor C3a levels post inoculation and challenge in the recovered pigs, directly correlating with challenge virus presence. In contrast, both C3a and C5a levels were increased in the control group. It could be shown that complement system activation was mediated by the lectin pathway, possibly by interaction of mannose-binding lectins and ASFV particles. This study suggests that protective immunity following recovery can last at least six months. No cases of persistent or chronic disease were observed in convalescent pigs. These findings have implications for both vaccine development and assessment, as well as for disease control strategies including surveillance actions."
"Gut microbial communities are shaped by the physicochemical gradients and compartmentalization along the gastrointestinal tract. Whether spatially variable selection is strong enough to promote lasting genetic divergence within microbial species subject to migration and clonal expansion remains unclear. We performed a metagenomic population-genetic analysis of roe deer microbiota across metabolically and structurally distinct gut compartments. Remarkably, 10 of 20 prevalent bacterial species exhibited clear signatures of genetic local adaptation, despite the homogenizing effects of frequent migration. Nutrient availability and environmental stability emerged as primary drivers of selection, with horizontal gene transfer as a key mechanism enabling local adaptation. Our findings demonstrate that a comprehensive understanding of ecological and evolutionary dynamics in the gut necessitates considering fine-scale genetic variation within species."
"AbstractWild Malus species harbor untapped genetic diversity to advance apple breeding, particularly for disease resistance and stress tolerance. However, existing marker panels, developed mainly using Malus domestica accessions, introduce ascertainment bias and limit detecting rare variants in wild species. We developed and validated a medium-density and cost-effective pan-generic 3K apple DArTag panel optimized to capture genome-wide variation across the Malus genus. The panel was constructed using conserved, syntenic, and collinear genomic blocks identified within the core genome of 13 Malus accessions for cross-species transferability. The panel was validated across three bi-parental mapping populations totaling 593 progeny. Across these populations, 2,461-3,234 SNP markers were polymorphic and 1,482-2,620 were informative. Each population contained over 900 multiallelic micro-haplotype loci, with several hundred loci exhibiting three or four distinct haplotypes. Markers were uniformly distributed across all 17 chromosomes, each containing between 60- 230 informative SNPs. The panel was further evaluated on 174 diverse germplasm accessions from 20 Malus species. It exhibited strong cross-species transferability, exceptionally low rates of missing data (<0.5%), and clear genetic differentiation between wild and domesticated accessions. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified a major locus on chromosome 4 significantly linked to fruit length, weight, and width in addition to trait-specific associations on chromosomes 1, 6, 9, and 11. The cost-effectiveness of genotyping per sample (<$15), combined with these results, underscore the panels broad utility for quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping in bi- parental and diverse populations, marker-assisted selection in the breeding programs, and genetic diversity analysis across the Malus genus."
"Ansells mole-rat (Fukomys anselli) is an African rodent known for its subterranean lifestyle and unique phenotypic traits, including extreme longevity, magnetoreception, and a cooperative breeding social structure. Efforts to dissect the genetic architecture of these traits and to decipher their phylogenetic relationships within the broader African mole-rat family would greatly benefit from a reference-grade genome. Here, we report a first genome assembly of a male Ansells mole-rat. By combining Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) long-reads and Illumina short-reads with Hi-C data, we generated a chromosome level assembly with a total length of 2.27 Gb, 412 scaffolds and a scaffold N50 of 72.4 Mb. We identified 99.54% of expected genes and annotated 29,094 transcripts using RNA sequencing data. This high-quality de novo genome of Fukomys anselli lays the foundation for dissecting the genetic and evolutionary basis of its extraordinary traits and resolving African mole-rat phylogeny.

ARTICLE SUMMARYBekavac, Coimbra, and Busa et al. assemble a de novo genome of a male Fukomys anselli individual. They use short-read and long-read whole genome sequencing and Hi-C sequencing to achieve chromosome-level contiguity, and annotate the genome using RNA-seq from nine diverse tissues. This high-quality genome enables exploration of the genetic basis of Ansells mole-rats remarkable traits, including longevity, hypoxia tolerance, and magnetoreception. It also allows for comprehensive analysis of the currently-contested phylogenetic relationships within the mole-rat family."
"CD4+ T cells play a pivotal role in adaptive immunity, recognizing peptide antigens presented by MHC II molecules during infections and tumor development. Identifying immunodominant MHC II epitopess is essential for understanding CD4+ T cell responses; however, current methods such as mass spectrometry, suffer from low sensitivity and throughput, while computational algorithms show variable accuracy. To overcome these challenges, we developed EliteMHCII, a high-throughput immunopeptidome profiling platform that identifies antigen-derived MHC II epitopes and measures peptide binding affinity across 24 globally common MHC II alleles. Using EliteMHCII, we assessed the immunodominant epitopes of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein. Validation in vaccinated individuals and humanized mouse models revealed a strong correlation between high-affinity peptides and robust CD4+ T cell responses, while low-affinity peptides failed to elicit responses. Therefore, our immunopeptidome profiling platform, EliteMHCII, serves as a rapid, high throughput, feasible platform for CD4+ T cell epitope discovery at a global populational level in the context of infectious diseases and cancer immunotherapy."
"KMT2A-rearranged B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (KMT2Ar B-ALL) exhibits significant heterogeneity in age of onset, developmental origins, and clinical outcomes. The interplay of individual factors influencing early treatment response within this high-risk molecular subtype remains poorly elucidated. To identify determinants of early treatment response to induction chemotherapy, we analysed 465 KMT2Ar B-ALL cases spanning a wide age range (1 month to 89 years) by integrating transcriptomic and genomic profiling with functional drug response and measurable residual disease (MRD) kinetics. We observed a strong inverse correlation between MRD clearance with advancing age (p=2.1E-04), proximity to early B-cell-precursor developmental state (low maturity score, p=1.3E-03) and AFF1 as fusion partner (p=7.0E-04). A combined model confirmed the predominate impact of both maturity and KMT2A fusion partner on MRD response, supporting the concept that the cells developmental state defines therapy response. Gene expression analysis identified cellular traits that relate to MRD response (e.g. chromatin organization, immune modulation and proliferation). This gene expression classifier grouped cases by MRD response but also by ex-vivo induction drug sensitivity. Notably, good responders to ex-vivo induction drugs were characterized by a higher maturity score (p=1.8E-03), whereas for less mature KMT2Ar B-ALL cases response profiles suggested higher Venetoclax sensitivity. This study provides an integrative framework of the biological determinants of treatment response and possible therapeutic implications in KMT2Ar B-ALL.

"Proper regulation of excitation and inhibition (E/I balance) is essential for maintaining stable neural circuit function and flexible behavior. Disruptions of E/I balance have been implicated in a variety of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, despite advances in connectomics and molecular neuroscience, how localized disruptions in E/I balance within cortical laminar architectures contribute to behavioral abnormalities remains to be elucidated. Here, we developed a standardized analysis pipeline that combines depth-aligned synaptic mapping, perspective and logarithmic transformations, and multivariate behavioral profiling. Applying this approach to a prenatal valproic acid (VPA) exposure model of ASD, we identified depth-specific disruptions of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic organization within the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), alongside impairments in social behavior. Principal component analysis (PCA) integrating synaptic and behavioral parameters revealed convergent abnormalities that robustly distinguished VPA-exposed mice from wild-type (WT) controls. Furthermore, although still at an exploratory stage, our findings demonstrate that the robustness of this pipeline enables both the identification of resilient individuals and the quantification of intervention effects. Together, our findings establish a new cross-level analytical framework linking synaptic organization to organismal behavior and provide insights into circuit-level mechanisms underlying ASD-related phenotypes."
"Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a known risk factor for Alzheimers disease and related neurodegenerative diseases. Sleep disturbances and epileptiform abnormalities can appear after TBI and may contribute to the development of neuropathology. In this study, we characterized sleep, epileptiform activity, and neuropathology after repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (rmTBI) in a mouse model of Alzheimers disease. We used the Closed Head Impact Model of Engineered Rotational Acceleration (CHIMERA) to deliver rmTBI or sham (control) treatment to 6-month-old APP/PS1 mice (n=19). One month post-injury, we implanted electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyographic (EMG) electrodes, recorded for 72 hours, and then collected brain tissue and blood plasma. Our assessment of sleep architecture showed that time spent in vigilance state was not affected by the rmTBI one month post-injury; however, power spectra analysis showed a statistically significant shift towards higher frequencies in the rmTBI group during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Epileptiform activity did not differ between sham and rmTBI. Compared to sham controls, the rmTBI group showed higher neurofilament light (NF-L), but not glial-fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in blood plasma and no change in amyloid pathology. These results indicate sustained neurological injury in the APP/PS1 mice one month after rmTBI without affecting amyloid deposition in the brain. Our study suggests that rmTBI can induce neural injury without causing enduring sleep disruption, seizures, and exacerbation of amyloidosis in the APP/PS1 mouse model."
"Recent advancements in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) have revolutionized structural biology, yet persistent workflow fragmentation between data acquisition, reconstruction, and modeling limits its full potential. This paper presents SMART, the first fully integrated cryo-EM platform unifying three critical AI-driven modules: DataSmart (automated data collection), CryoSmart (3D reconstruction), and ModelSmart (end-to-end atomic modeling). The platform embeds more than 10 distinct AI algorithms across its workflow, achieving unprecedented automation levels. These advancements not only lower the expertise barrier for cryo-EM adoption but also establish a new paradigm for AI-empowered structural biology, with broad implications for high-throughput drug discovery. This protocol provides a comprehensive delineation of the operational procedures for the SMART platform. As an example, this protocol enabled the determination of the 2.1 [A] resolution structure of TRPML1, a Ca2+-permeable, nonselective, six-transmembrane tetrameric cation channel found in late endosomes and lysosomes (LELs) of mammalian cells. This integrated workflow enables users, including those with minimal cryo-EM experience, to efficiently complete the entire pipeline from data collection to atomic model building."
"Mutational signature analysis has greatly enhanced our understanding of the mutagenic processes found in cancer and normal tissues. As part of a recent study, we analyzed 802 treatment-naive, microsatellite-stable colorectal cancers (CRC) and identified a de novo signature, SBS_D, which was conservatively decomposed into SBS18, a signature associated with reactive oxygen species. Here, we re-evaluate this decomposition and provide evidence that SBS_D represents a distinct mutational process from that of SBS18.

Through an independent analysis of 2,616 whole-genome sequenced microsatellite-stable CRCs across three distinct cohorts, we demonstrate that SBS_D is consistently present at a similar prevalence, suggesting that this signature may have been previously overlooked. Using a naive decomposition approach, we demonstrate that the pattern of SBS_D better aligns with signatures previously associated with deficiencies in DNA polymerase delta (POLD1) proofreading and mismatch repair. However, multiple lines of evidence, including the absence of pathogenic mutations in the exonuclease domain of POLD1 or in mismatch repair-associated genes, indicate that SBS_D is not driven by canonical defects in these DNA repair pathways.

Overall, this study identifies a previously unrecognized mutational signature in microsatellite-stable CRC and proposes that its etiology may be linked to DNA repair infidelity emerging late in tumor development in samples without canonical defects in DNA repair pathways."
"Heritable non-genetic phenotypic variation--broadly, epigenetics--can potentially influence evolutionary outcomes as direct targets of selection or through interactions with genetic variation. While their evolutionary benefits in generating phenotypic diversity in changing environments is well-characterized, there has been relatively little consideration of how the joint influence of epigenetic changes and mutations would affect traversal of multi-peak adaptive landscapes. Here, we discover general principles for how epigenetics, by generating an epigenetic quasispecies (clusters of semi-stable phenotypes mapped to a single genotype), tends to improve adaptive outcomes of an asexual population on rugged fitness landscapes even without environmental change. In particular, rapid epigenetic changes can sometimes smooth out suboptimal fitness peaks through incorporating fitness contributions of epimutations, allowing access to better adaptive outcomes. Remarkably, the average impact of epigenetics is more strongly influenced by an approximate balance between switching rates rather than the absolute rate at which those switches occur. These findings demonstrate that epigenetic changes can be influential even without having strong heritability and have a striking, yet generally invisible, beneficial role in shaping a populations adaptive trajectory.

Significance StatementSelection can act upon individuals with epigenetic differences, but it is unclear how much long-term effect this can have on evolutionary trajectories if the epigenetic changes only last a limited number of generations. When the environment changes or more than one functionality is needed simultaneously, it is apparent how bet hedging or division of labour can be advantageous, but what about in a single, constant environment? Here, we find that epigenetics, by allowing individuals rapid yet heritable access to multiple alternate phenotypes, can change the outcome of genetic evolution and has the tendency to remove local fitness peaks and allow adaptation to find higher optima. As such, epigenetics, despite being transient, can profoundly affect adaptive trajectories."
"The fields of evolutionary biology, molecular ecology, genetics, and taxonomy have been profoundly influenced by studies of variation in mitochondrial DNA. Here I propose a hypothesis that will likely contribute to a full understanding of commonly observed differences in patterns of variation in mitochondrial DNA versus phenotypic traits and nuclear autosomal DNA. The Driving W Hypothesis applies to the many taxonomic groups (e.g., birds, butterflies and moths; most snakes; some amphibians, fish, and plants) in which females are heterogametic (i.e., have ZW sex chromosomes). If a W chromosome undergoes a mutation that gives it a transmission advantage in getting into the one egg produced by female meiosis, the driving W chromosome can spread rapidly through a population, carrying along the particular mitochondrial genome that happens to be associated with the driving W. Simulations show that W drivers spread much more rapidly than equivalent-strength Z or autosomal drivers, and that autosomal suppressors of W drive spread at a vastly lower rate. I summarize the logic and evidence in support of the seven components of this hypothesis and conclude that the driving W hypothesis has tremendous potential to explain observations of low within-population mitochondrial diversity as well as cases of ""mitochondrial capture"" between species."
"Identifying features that interact to trigger disease, while accounting for heterogeneity across diverse populations, is essential for the development of precision and targeted medicine. Despite the availability of vast and complex health-related datasets, most existing works focus on identifying disease-associated features at the population level or within a few subpopulations, often overlooking individual-level heterogeneity within these groups. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that utilizes localized test statistics to identify disease-associated features tailored to individual profiles. Our method leverages the recently developed knockoffs methodology to control the noise level of the selection set so that the results are replicable. Moreover, it allows for the discovery of hidden heterogeneous effects within the data, as demonstrated in an application to single-cell RNA sequencing data for Alzheimers disease. By aggregating localized feature selection results, our framework also enables powerful population-level feature selection. Our framework provides a powerful tool for exploratory studies of precision medicine, offering the potential to generate novel hypotheses for confirmatory biological experiments."
"We propose crossing multi-parent recombinant-inbred-lines (RILs) to a common tester and measuring allele specific gene expression in the offspring. With a few RIL x Tester crosses, genetic variation in the regulation of gene expression between RIL alleles can be identified. Testing whether allelic imbalance between two RIL x Tester crosses is equal, is a test of cis or trans depending on the RIL alleles compared. We demonstrate this approach in a long-read RNA-seq experiment in female abdominal tissue at two time points in Drosophila melanogaster. Among the 40% of all loci that show evidence of genetic variation in cis, trans effects due to the environment are detectable in 31% of loci and trans effects due to genetic background are detectable in 19% of loci with little overlap in sources of trans variation. The loci identified in this study are associated with loci previously reported to exhibit genetic variation in gene expression in a range of tissues and large population samples, suggesting that there is standing variation for genetic regulation of gene expression suggesting a potential source of cryptic genetic variation by which pleiotropic effects respond to changes in the environment. For loci in a QTL for thermotolerance, previously shown to differ in expression based on temperature; eleven of these loci had evidence for regulation of gene expression regardless of the environment, including Cpr67B, a cuticular protein. This study provides a blueprint for efficiently identifying alleles in multi-parent populations that contribute to regulatory variation in gene expression."
"Olfactory impairment is a hallmark of early Alzheimers disease (AD), but the underlying mechanisms connecting sensory decline to genetic and environmental risk factors remain unclear. Our integrative analysis combines ethologically relevant olfactory behavior assays, high-resolution diffusion MRI connectomics, and blood transcriptomics in a large cohort of humanized APOE mice stratified by APOE genotype (APOE2, APOE3, APOE4), age, sex, high-fat diet, and immune background (HN).

Behaviorally, APOE4 mice exhibited accelerated deficits in odor salience, novelty detection, and memory, especially when exposed to a high-fat diet, whereas APOE2 mice showed resilience (ANOVA: APOE x HN, F(2,1669)=77.25, p<0.001, eta squared effect size = 0.08). Notably, age and diet exerted compounding effects, with older and HFD-fed mice displaying reduced odor-guided exploration (diet x age: F(1,1669)=16.04, p<0.001, eta squared effect size = 0.01). Memory analyses revealed robust genotype- and age-dependent impairments: at 24- and 48-hour delays, recognition indices were significantly lower in APOE4 mice compared to APOE2 (long-term memory: APOE x HN, F(2,395)=5.6, p=0.004).

Elastic Net-regularized multi-set canonical correlation analysis (MCCA) linked behavior to brain network substrates, revealing subnetworks whose connectivity explained up to 24 percent of behavioral variance (sum of canonical correlations: 1.27, 95% CI [1.18, 1.85], p<0.0001). High-weighted connections between the ventral orbital cortex, somatosensory cortex, and cerebellar-brainstem pathways were identified as critical nodes for risk or compensation.

Integrative blood transcriptomics revealed eigengene modules strongly correlated with imaging changes in olfactory-memory circuits (for example, eigengene 2 vs. subiculum diffusivity: r = -0.5, p < 1e-30, explaining up to 24 percent of variance). Gene ontology analysis pinpointed shared pathways in synaptic signaling, translation, and metabolic regulation across brain and blood. Notably, glutamatergic and synaptic pathways were enriched among genes linking peripheral and central compartments.

Collectively, these results demonstrate that olfactory behavior, quantitatively shaped by genotype, age, diet, and immune status, serves as a sensitive and translatable early biomarker of Alzheimers disease risk. Our systems-level approach identifies specific brain networks and peripheral molecular signatures underlying sensory-cognitive vulnerability, providing a robust framework for early detection and targeted intervention in AD."
"Parkinsons disease (PD) pathogenic mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are associated with endolysosomal dysfunction across cell types, and carriers of LRRK2 mutations variably present with phosphorylated tau and -synuclein deposits in post-mortem analysis. LRRK2 mutations increase the phosphorylation of Rab substrates including Rab12. Rab12 is expressed in neuronal and non-neuronal cells with localization to membranes in the endolysosomal compartment. Under lysosomal stress, LRRK2 interaction with Rab12 upregulates LRRK2 kinase activity. In this study, using a recently developed monoclonal antibody directed to the LRRK2-mediated phosphorylation site on Rab12 at amino acid Ser106 (pS106-Rab12), we test whether aberrant LRRK2 phosphorylation is associated with tau and/or -synuclein pathology across clinically distinct neurodegenerative diseases. Analysis of brain tissue lysates and immunohistochemistry of pathology-susceptible brain regions demonstrate that pS106-Rab12 levels are increased in Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), Alzheimers disease (AD), and PD, and in LRRK2 mutation carriers. In early pathological stages, phosphorylated Rab12 localizes to granulovacuolar degeneration bodies (GVBs), which are thought to be active lysosomal-like structures, in neurons. pS106-Rab12-positive GVBs accumulate with pathological tau across brain tissues in DLB, AD, and PD, and in LRRK2 mutation carriers. In a mouse model of tauopathy, pS106-Rab12 localizes to GVBs during early tau deposition in an age-dependent manner. While GVBs are largely absent in neurons with mature protein pathology, subsets of both tau and -synuclein inclusions appear to incorporate pS106-Rab12 at later pathological stages. Finally, pS106-Rab12 labels GVBs in neurons and shows widespread co-pathology with tau inclusions in primary tauopathies including Picks disease, progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration. These results implicate LRRK2 kinase activity and Rab phosphorylation in endolysosomal dysfunction in both tau and -synuclein-associated neurodegenerative diseases."
"BACKGROUNDThe observation that diabetic patients always under tight-glycemic control consistently show better cardiovascular disease outcomes compared to patients who transition to tight-glycemic control after prior conventional glycemic control lead to the concept of metabolic memory. Mechanisms such as epigenetics possibly mediate the lasting metabolic memory effects, our understanding of the underlying mechanisms remains limited. Increased cardiac protein posttranslational O-linked {beta}-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) modification is implicated in cardiac remodeling observed in diabetes, and our previous work shows chronically elevated cardiomyocyte O-GlcNAc causes adverse cardiac changes. Therefore, the current study hypothesized that transiently increased cardiomyocyte O-GlcNAcylation leads to exacerbated adverse cardiac remodeling after subsequent pressure-overload.

METHODS AND RESULTSUsing our previously described inducible cardiomyocyte specific, dominant-negative O-GlcNAcase (dnOGAh) mouse and single transgenic littermate controls (Con), we induced O-GlcNAc levels for 2wk (ON), followed by a 2wk washout (OFF); mice then underwent transverse-aortic constriction (TAC) or Sham surgery. We observed the expected cardiac remodeling in TAC groups, including decreased cardiac function, and increased hypertrophy and fibrosis. Moreover, these pathologic measures were exacerbated in the ON/OFF-TAC vs. Con-TAC mice; additionally, transcriptomic analysis of LV-tissue from each experimental group showed pathways which not only supported our fibrosis, hypertrophy and functional results of exacerbated cardiac remodeling, but also, revealed potential novel molecular pathways underlying this pathologic remodeling.

CONCLUSIONSWe observed exacerbated cardiac pathology between ON/OFF-TAC vs. Con-TAC groups supporting the concept of ""O-GlcNAc memory"" as a component of metabolic memory. Moreover, transcriptomic analysis provides insight into potential molecular pathways underpinning this metabolic/O-GlcNAc memory such as Ccn2/CTGF-driven fibrosis, and/or Nox4-driven oxidative stress.

"BackgroundStature, a factor that helps in personal identification, can be estimated using measurements of various body parts. This study measured the length and breadth of hands and the height of the participants, aiming to estimate the stature from the dimensions of the hands.

MethodsIn this descriptive cross-sectional study, 195 medical students aged 18 to 24 were enrolled, and it was carried out from 3rd November 2023 to 14th April 2024. Measurement of stature was taken by stadiometer, and hand length and breadth were taken by Vernier calliper.

ResultsMean stature was higher in males (170.24{+/-}5.79 cm) as compared to females (159.01{+/-}7.261 cm). Mean length and breadth of both right and left hands were also found to be higher in males (Right hand length = 18.48{+/-}1.00 cm, Left hand length = 18.57{+/-}1.01 cm, Right hand breadth = 8.36{+/-}4.78 cm, and Left hand breadth = 8.26{+/-}5.03 cm) as compared with females (Right hand length = 16.861{+/-}0.96 cm, Left hand length = 16.897{+/-}0.95 cm, Right hand breadth = 7.31{+/-}0.58 cm, and Left hand breadth = 7.23{+/-}0.58 cm). The model summary of the multiple linear regression analysis deduced that R is .805, which indicates that there is a strong positive correlation between stature and hand dimensions with an Standard Error of Estimates of 5.083 cm and R2 of 0.648.

ConclusionThis study was done on medical students, and it generated regression equations for estimation of stature by taking into account hand length and hand breadth. There was a positive correlation between hand dimensions and stature estimation. Similar studies can be done in the future, taking a larger population size and participants from various age groups to see if there is an influence of age factor in stature estimation."

"Short-range association fibers (SAFs) are critical for cortical communications but are often underestimated in conventional resolution diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) since they locate within a [~]1.5mm thin layer of superficial white matter. With the emergence of high-resolution diffusion imaging techniques, this study timely evaluated the effects of image spatial resolution on SAF reconstruction using simulation data and multi-resolution (2, 1.5, and 0.96 mm iso.) empirical data acquired on the same 20 healthy subjects using the gSlider sequence and 20 widely used tractography approaches. Resolution effects were qualitatively assessed through model fitting and tractography results and quantitatively evaluated using global and regional short-range connectivity strength (SCS). It is found that lower resolution systematically reduces SCS across all methods in a spatially varying manner. Moreover, tractography methods exhibit significant differences in resolution sensitivity, with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) based single-tissue single-fiber tractography showing greater vulnerability than constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD)-based multi-tissue multi-fiber tractography. Probabilistic tracking with anatomical constraints (ACT) and filtering (SIFT) improves robustness. Finally, up-sampling data to nominally higher resolution partially mitigates resolution-induced degradation and improves SAF reconstruction accuracy, particularly for DTI tractography. Based on these findings, higher resolution and multi-shell imaging is recommended if possible. For a given dataset, data up-sampling and DTI-based probabilistic tracking with ACT is recommended for single-shell low b-value data. CSD-based probabilistic tracking with ACT and SIFT is recommended for single-shell higher b-value data and multi-shell data. In summary, this study systematically and quantitatively evaluated resolution effects on SAF reconstruction and structural connectivity estimation and provided practical guidelines for more accurate mapping of SAFs. These advances hold promises to improve the characterization of healthy and diseased human brains in a wide range of neuroscientific and clinical applications."
"Short-range association fibers (SAFs) are critical for cortical communications but are often underestimated in conventional resolution diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) since they locate within a [~]1.5mm thin layer of superficial white matter. With the emergence of high-resolution diffusion imaging techniques, this study timely evaluated the effects of image spatial resolution on SAF reconstruction using simulation data and multi-resolution (2, 1.5, and 0.96 mm iso.) empirical data acquired on the same 20 healthy subjects using the gSlider sequence and 20 widely used tractography approaches. Resolution effects were qualitatively assessed through model fitting and tractography results and quantitatively evaluated using global and regional short-range connectivity strength (SCS). It is found that lower resolution systematically reduces SCS across all methods in a spatially varying manner. Moreover, tractography methods exhibit significant differences in resolution sensitivity, with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) based single-tissue single-fiber tractography showing greater vulnerability than constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD)-based multi-tissue multi-fiber tractography. Probabilistic tracking with anatomical constraints (ACT) and filtering (SIFT) improves robustness. Finally, up-sampling data to nominally higher resolution partially mitigates resolution-induced degradation and improves SAF reconstruction accuracy, particularly for DTI tractography. Based on these findings, higher resolution and multi-shell imaging is recommended if possible. For a given dataset, data up-sampling and DTI-based probabilistic tracking with ACT is recommended for single-shell low b-value data. CSD-based probabilistic tracking with ACT and SIFT is recommended for single-shell higher b-value data and multi-shell data. In summary, this study systematically and quantitatively evaluated resolution effects on SAF reconstruction and structural connectivity estimation and provided practical guidelines for more accurate mapping of SAFs. These advances hold promises to improve the characterization of healthy and diseased human brains in a wide range of neuroscientific and clinical applications."
"Polymeric hydrogels are valuable platforms for determining how specific mechanical properties of native tissue extracellular matrix (ECM) regulate cell function. Recent research has focused on incorporating viscous and elastic properties into hydrogels to investigate cellular responses to time-dependent mechanical properties of the ECM. However, a critical aspect often overlooked is that cells continuously remodel their microenvironment in hydrogels, such as by the deposition of newly secreted (nascent) ECM. While this nascent ECM has been demonstrated to play a vital role in transmitting mechanical signals across various biological contexts, the mechanisms by which it regulates cellular function in response to time-dependent mechanical properties remain poorly understood. In this study, we developed an interpenetrating polymer network that enables independent control of viscous and elastic hydrogel properties. We show that cells cultured on high-viscosity hydrogels deposit increased nascent ECM which also correlates with enhanced hydrogel remodeling. Interestingly, higher nascent ECM deposition on high-viscosity hydrogels was decoupled from intracellular contractility. These results establish a relationship between hydrogel viscosity and nascent ECM deposition that may extend to diverse cell types and offer new insights into cell-hydrogel interactions."
"Antibody-based therapeutics encompass diverse modalities for targeting tumor cells. Among these, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) and extracellular targeted protein degradation (eTPD) specifically depend on efficient lysosomal trafficking for activity. However, many tumor antigens exhibit poor internalization, limiting ADC effectiveness. To address this, we developed low-density lipoprotein receptor-targeting chimeras (LIPTACs), leveraging the constitutive endocytic and recycling activity of the LDLR to enhance lysosomal delivery. LIPTACs enable efficient and selective degradation of diverse extracellular membrane proteins. Additionally, by coupling LIPTACs with cytotoxic payloads to generate degrader-drug conjugates, we can achieve superior intracellular delivery and enhanced cytotoxicity compared to conventional ADCs. The dual modality addresses key challenges of inadequate internalization in conventional ADCs and cytotoxic potency for current eTPD strategies. Our findings demonstrate that LDLR-mediated trafficking can enhance eTPD and ADCs, providing a hybrid blueprint for developing next-generation antibody therapeutics with broader utility and improved efficacy in cancer treatment."
"INTRODUCTIONRobust plasma-based biomarkers to distinguish Lewy body disease (LBD) and Alzheimers disease (AD) are currently lacking. We applied track-etch magnetic nanopore (TENPO) sorting for enrichment of brain-derived extracellular vesicle (EV) signatures as potential biomarkers to address this gap.

METHODSWe analyzed plasma from 137 autopsy-confirmed patients [30 LBD, 31 AD, 30 AD/LBD, 19 AD with amygdala Lewy bodies (AD/ALB), and 27 controls], sequencing miRNAs from TENPO-isolated GluR2-positive (neuron-enriched) and GLAST-positive (astrocyte-enriched) EVs, and measuring plasma proteins (A{beta}40, A{beta}42, tau, p-Tau181, p-Tau231) via SIMOA.

RESULTSWe identified 16 GluR2+, 8 GLAST+, and 4 protein biomarkers with differential expression (false discovery rate-corrected P value < .1) between LBD and AD. A multimodal 15-feature panel classified LBD versus AD with 10-fold cross-validated accuracy = 0.95 and area under the curve (AUC) = 0.96.

DISCUSSIONBrain-derived EVs offer accurate and accessible miRNA biomarkers for the differential diagnosis of LBD and AD."
"Tuberculosis kills millions worldwide. Drug-resistance demands exploring new targets against this illness. Methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MetRS) is a crucial target in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) that participates in initiation and elongation of translation and represents a protein of evolutionary interest. To elucidate the structure-function relationships of MetRS, we performed detailed sequence analyses and molecular dynamics simulations of Mtb MetRS in the substrate- bound (methionine and ATP) and intermediate (methionyl-AMP) states, for both the wild-type and three single-mutant forms (H21A, K54A, and E130A). Eight systems (two wild-type and six mutants) were simulated for 24 microseconds. Differential dynamics and binding effects of the substrate versus intermediate states were identified, along with the molecular reasons for the loss of activity in mutants. The wild-type substrate state was more stable than the intermediate state. In contrast, the mutants were more unstable in the substrate state, but incorporated stability into the intermediate state protein. These findings suggest that methionyl-AMP, being a reaction intermediate, exhibits a short residence time at the proteins active site, while the substrate state shows a longer residence time of methionine and ATP. The increased instability of mutants in the substrate state indicates disruption of the pyrophosphate-ATP exchange by altering substrate- protein interactions. Once the intermediate is formed, the mutations have minimal or no effect. These observations are consistent with experimental data. In brief, our study finds the molecular basis for the distinct substrate and intermediate recognition by Mtb MetRS and establishes a mechanism for loss of activity in the mutants."
"RationaleChimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies have shown remarkable success in treating hematological cancers and are increasingly demonstrating potential for solid tumors. CRISPR-based genome editing offers a promising approach to enhance the potency and safety of CAR-T cells. However, several challenges persist, including inefficient tumor homing and treatment-related toxicities in normal tissues, which continue to hinder widespread adoption. Advanced imaging technologies, including bioluminescence imaging (BLI) and positron emission tomography (PET), provide real-time insights into CAR-T cell distribution and activity in vivo, both in preclinical models and in patients. Here, we developed Trackable Reporter Adaptable CRISPR-Edited CAR (tRACE-CAR) T cells, a modular system for site-specific integration of CARs and imaging reporters.

MethodsThe luciferase reporter AkaLuciferase (AkaLuc) or the human sodium iodide symporter (NIS) were cloned downstream of the CAR in adeno-associated virus (AAV) donors for BLI or PET tracking, respectively. CARs with imaging reporters were knocked into the TRAC locus of primary human T cells via CRISPR editing and AAV transduction. Editing efficiency was evaluated by flow cytometry and junction PCR. In vitro cytotoxicity was assessed by BLI using firefly luciferase (Fluc)-expressing cancer cells co-cultured with CAR-T cells at varying effector-to-target ratios. In vivo, BLI and PET imaging assessed CAR-AkaLuc and CAR-NIS T cell expansion and trafficking in Nod-SCID-gamma mice bearing xenograft tumors.

ResultsT cell receptor (TCR) knockout efficiency exceeded 85%, with CAR expression observed in 70-80% of cells, depending on the reporter used. Reporter-engineered CAR-T cells retained functionality in vitro and exhibited significant cytotoxicity against target cancer cells, outperforming naive T cells. In vivo, AkaLuc BLI and 18F-tetrafluoroborate PET enabled non-invasive tracking of viable CAR-T cells. Notably, the route of administration (intravenous, peritumoral, or intraperitoneal) significantly influenced the distribution of CAR-T cells and their therapeutic effectiveness.

ConclusiontRACE-CAR enabled precise optical and PET tracking of CAR-T cells in models of B cell leukemia and ovarian cancer, allowing dynamic, non-invasive monitoring of cell distribution in both tumors and off-target tissues. This imaging platform could lead to more personalized, effective CRISPR-edited CAR cell therapies."
"PurposeMelittin is the main peptide component of melittin venom, with anti-allergic, anti-inflammatory, anti-arthritis, anti-cancer, and neuroprotective effects. Melittin has been confirmed to have anti-inflammatory effects in immune and liver cells and is widely used in treating arthritis and rheumatic diseases. At the same time, related studies have shown that melittin can enhance the expression of muscle differentiation related factors in mice. However, whether the melittin can improve the expression of stem cells into muscle differentiation and use it to treat Skeletal muscle atrophy, it has not yet been clarified.As ""seed cells,"" stem cells have been widely concerned in the field of regenerative medicine research, such as embryonic stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells, etc., among which adipose mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) have excellent application potential in the treatment of Skeletal muscle atrophy because of their quantitative advantages, easy access, and inherent good differentiation potential and self-renewal ability. To investigate whether melittin can stimulate ADSCs MYOGenic differentiation and whether combined with ADSCs can treat Skeletal muscle atrophy.

MethodsO_LIFour concentration ranges of melittin were set, namely Group A (20 mg/L, 40 mg/L, 80 mg/L, 160 mg/L, 320 mg/L), Group B (2 mg/L, 4 mg/L, 8 mg/L, 16 mg/L, 32 mg/L), Group C (0.2 mg/L, 0.4 mg/L, 0.8 mg/L, 1.6 mg/L, 3.2 mg/L), and Group D (0.02 mg/L, 0.04 mg/L, 0.08 mg/L, 0.16 mg/L, 0.32 mg/L), Intervention of adipose stem cells with different concentrations of melittin for 48 hours, followed by measurement of relative cell viability using the CCK-8 method.
C_LIO_LIMelittin after 48 hours of intervention with ADSCs, Western blot was used to detect the expression levels of MYOGenic differentiation related factors.
C_LIO_LIThe control group (C), melittin group (M), dexamethasone group (D), and Dexamethasone+Melittin group (D+M) were set separately. After 12 hours of intervention with dexamethasone (10umol/L), the ADSCs were added with melittin for 48 hours. Western blot was used to detect MYOGenic differentiation related factors MYOGenic(MYOG), MYF5, MYOD, MYH4 p38 and p-p38 protein. In order to observe the process of melittin repairing cell atrophy, detected MYOD and MYOG using immunofluorescence.
C_LIO_LIRandomly divided into control group (C), damage group (T), stem cell therapy group (SC), melittin combined with ADSCs therapy group (SC+M). Group C does not do any treatment. Group T, SC, and SC+M set up a mouse shoulder sleeve injury model, all from the left gang of the rats, and the suture is marked with surgical sutures. On the first day of surgery, The SC group of the muscle injecting ADSCs(1x106)in the SC group, and the ADSCs after the melittin intervention of the SC+M mouse is repeatedly treated every seven days. On the left, the tendon is extracted, and the muscles are extracted to perform related tissue-related testing such as Su Mu Jing-Yi Hong dyed (H&E dyed), immunohistochemistry, muscle fiber weight and diameter.

ResultsO_LICCK-8 Experiment shows that the suitable concentration of Melittin has no significant toxic effect on ADSCs.
C_LIO_LIWestern blot experiment shows that the appropriate concentration of Melittin can enhance the expression of muscle differentiation related factors in ADSCs.
C_LIO_LIWestern blot and immunofluorescence staining results show that the expression related factors of the D+M group are better than that of group D, and the expression related factors of forming muscle differentiation in group M is also better than group C.
C_LIO_LIMelittin can promote ADSCs muscle differentiation through the p38-MAPK signaling pathway.
C_LIO_LIAnimal experiments have shown that the expression related factors of the SC+M treatment groups muscle differentiation related factors is significantly higher than that of the SC therapy group, and the expression related factors of the two groups of rats of SC+M and SC groups are better than the T group Rat. Organic research has confirmed that rats who have been treated with ADSCs treated with melittin have significantly improved in muscle weight, muscle fiber diameter, and muscle fiber cross-sectional area. At the same time, the result of immunohistochemicals shows that the expression of MYOD and MYOG in the SC+M group is better than the SC group.
C_LI

ConclusionThe results of this study indicate that melittin can promote MYOGenic differentiation of ADSCs and increase the expression of MYOGenic differentiation related factors in atrophic ADSCs.Secondly, melittin can activate the p38-MAPK signaling pathway and promote the MYOGenic differentiation of ADSCs. Stem cells treated with melittin intervention can improve the recovery of muscle mass, muscle fiber diameter, and muscle fiber cross-sectional area in rats with skeletal muscle injury compared to rats treated with stem cells alone. Therefore, the above results provide insights into MYOGenic differentiation and may provide a potential alternative strategy for related diseases such as skeletal muscle atrophy."
"BackgroundStreptococcus anginosus, part of the Streptococcus anginosus group (SAG), is a human commensal increasingly recognized as an opportunistic pathogen responsible for abscesses formation and infections, also invasive ones. Despite its growing clinical importance, the genetic determinants of its pathogenicity remain poorly understood.

ObjectivesThis study aimed to identify essential genes in S. anginosus 980/01, a bloodstream isolate, under optimal laboratory conditions using a transposon mutagenesis combined with Transposon-Directed Insertion Site Sequencing (TraDIS).

MethodsA mutant library was generated using the ISS1 transposon delivered via the thermosensitive plasmid pGh9:ISS1. Following transposition, insertions were mapped using Illumina sequencing and analyzed. Essential genes were identified based on the absence of insertions and statistical filtering.

ResultsThe library exhibited 98% genome saturation with over 130,000 unique insertion sites. Among 1,825 genes, 348 (19.1%) were essential, 1,446 non-essential, and 30 non-conclusive. Comparative analyses were performed with S. pyogenes MGAS5005 and S. agalactiae A909. Similarly to the latter, essential genes were enriched in functions related to translation, transcription, and cell wall biosynthesis. However, 40 genes uniquely essential to S. anginosus 980/01 were identified, suggesting unique survival strategies in S. anginosus.

ConclusionsThis study presents the first genome-wide identification of essential genes for S. anginosus 980/01, highlighting conserved and unique essential genes. These findings provide a basis for understanding its pathogenic potential and for identifying novel antimicrobial targets."
"The live-attenuated measles vaccine (LAMV) protects against measles in a safe, efficacious and durable manner. However, the mechanism by which LAMV is attenuated is not well understood, contributing to the increased vaccine hesitancy that has caused a worldwide resurgence of measles. Here, we provide a molecular model of attenuation that implicates increased host innate immune responses and increased LAMV susceptibility to those responses. Our study leverages both in vitro and in vivo models of infection to find that acute induction of innate immunity in immune cells is the critical determinant of LAMV attenuation. We show that LAMV, in contrast to pathogenic wild type measles virus (MeV), causes a strong IFN response in primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, which restricts viral replication and spread in a post-entry manner. LAMV can enter, transcribe viral mRNA and translate viral proteins in immune cells, but is not able to form infectious particles and spread from cell to cell. Specifically, we find that mutations conserved across LAMV strains in the P/V/C and H genes are responsible for the induction of IFN and the restriction of infectious virus production. In PBMC cultures and in rhesus macaques, LAMV infection also results in the acute induction of proinflammatory cytokines that likely play a role in the immunogenicity of the vaccine. Overall, our study provides a virological and immunological framework for LAMV attenuation which can be leveraged in repurposing the LAMV backbone and in future vaccine design."
"Glycosylation of proteins can impact their folding, stability, trafficking and enzymatic activity. Human Gb3/CD77 synthase (1,4-galactosyltransferase, A4galt) has two occupied N-glycosylation sites. Previously, we demonstrated that the activity of recombinant enzyme relies on its N-glycosylation. In this study, we produced soluble recombinant catalytic domain of human Gb3/CD77 synthase in two expression hosts known for different glycosylation pattern: Trichoplusia ni insect cells (High Five) and human embryonic kidney cells (EXPI293F). The High Five cells generate short oligomannose structures, while the EXPI293F cells synthesize complex type glycans. We evaluated the activity of High Five-derived and EXPI293F-derived enzymes, characterized the structures of their N-glycans and showed that High Five cells provide a higher amount and activity of the enzyme. Moreover, we used the EXPI293F cells to evaluate the N-and C-terminal location of the 6xHis-tag and found that only the N-terminally tagged EXPI293F-derived enzyme demonstrated activity. In contrast, the enzyme produced in High Five cells was active despite carrying a C-terminal tag. These findings highlight the role of glycosylation pattern and tag position in the activity of human recombinant glycosyltransferase produced in different hosts.

Highlights- Active recombinant Gb3/CD77 synthase was obtained in High Five and EXPI293F cells.
- High Five cells provided higher recombinant Gb3/CD77 synthase yield than EXPI293F.
- Glycosylation pattern of recombinant Gb3/CD77 synthase was host specific.
- Activity of EXPI293F-derived enzyme depended on 6xHis-tag localization."
"Multi-omics analyses of severe COVID-19 cases are crucial in deciphering the complex interplay between genetic and epigenetic factors. Here, we present an analysis of Expression Quantitative Trait Methylation (eQTM) to investigate the complex interplay of methylation and gene expression pattern during the acute phase of severe COVID-19. We identified 16 differentially expressed genes and 30 nearby differentially methylated CpG sites. Six key genes--SRXN1, FURIN, IL18RAP, FOXO3, GCNT4, and FKBP5--were either up-regulated or down-regulated near hypomethylated CpG sites. These genes are associated with viral infiltration, immune activation, lung damage, and oxidative stress-related multi-organ failure, which are the hallmarks of severe COVID-19. Interestingly, during the recovery phase, methylation and gene expression levels returned to baseline, underscoring the rapid and reversible nature of these molecular changes. These findings provide insight into the dynamics of epigenetic and transcriptomic shifts according to the infectious stage, supporting potential prognostic and therapeutic approaches for severe COVID-19."
"Xenorhabdus griffiniae is a bacterium that lives inside the intestine of the entomopathogenic nematode Steinernema hermaphroditum and partners with the nematode to infect and kill insect larvae in soil. The construction of gene circuits, like reporters, in X. griffiniae would provide tools to study and better understand the symbiotic relationship it has with its host. However, because X. griffiniae is not a model organism, information about gene circuit construction in X. griffiniae is limited. We develop and characterize a DNA part library similar to the CIDAR MoClo extension library for E. coli to allow more efficient construction of genetic circuits in X. griffiniae. TurboRFP expressing strains with different constitutive Anderson promoters and different ribosome binding sites (RBS) were constructed to quantify promoter and RBS strengths in X. griffiniae. Furthermore, two fluorescent proteins sfGFP and sfYFP, as well as the bioluminescent luxCDABE operon were added to the part library and successfully expressed in X. griffiniae. We then used the characterized parts to build and characterize IPTG inducible constructs."
"Antibiotic resistance and expression of virulence factors can impact the outcome of infection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Pathogenesis is often modelled using the P. aeruginosa PAO1 reference strain but laboratory lineages vary in the sequence and activity of MexT, a global regulator impacting virulence, biofilm formation and ciprofloxacin resistance. We defined the impact of active versus inactive MexT in PAO1 and observed global transcriptomic changes affecting the expression of 900 genes. Phenotyping revealed altered metabolism, antibiotic resistance and virulence - resulting in striking variation across a  single model organism. We propose that antibiotic-resistance, introduced during work with the original PAO1 strain, has caused plasticity in mexT that accounts for variation across lineages. To test this, we introduced antibiotic resistance into clinical P. aeruginosa isolates and observed downstream mutations in mexT when selective pressure was removed, supporting the proposed evolutionary pathway. Overall, we have demonstrated the transcriptomic basis of MexT as a phenotypic switch in PAO1 and implicated antibiotic resistance as a cause of downstream changes in mexT in P. aeruginosa. Furthermore, MexS/MexT-regulated efflux is implicated in the antibiotic stress response and virulence, helping identify the mechanisms for rapid phenotypic switching through mexT and confirming that PAO1 is a very different organism compared to most isolates. Improved understanding of the regulatory changes linked to antibiotic resistance is particularly relevant to P. aeruginosa where cycles of antibiotic treatment are common."
"Prenatal exposure to Zika virus (ZIKV) results in a spectrum of outcomes, ranging from severe birth defects and early childhood developmental delays to no apparent deficits. However, the mechanisms underlying these outcomes, particularly in the context of different maternal infection conditions, remain poorly defined. In this study, we employed a translational rhesus macaque model of prenatal ZIKV infection to evaluate longitudinal visual and auditory development from 1 to 12 months of age and characterize neurodevelopmental outcomes at 12 months. Pregnant macaques, either flavivirus-naive or with prior dengue virus (DENV) exposure, were inoculated in the first trimester ([~]30 or 45 gestational days) with an Asian or African lineage of ZIKV or received a saline injection as controls. Maternal plasma viremia duration, viral RNA burden at the maternal-fetal interface, and neutralizing antibody titers did not differ between inoculation cohorts or controls. At 12 months, ZIKV-exposed infants demonstrated altered maternal attachment behaviors and reduced inhibition when approaching sensory stimuli compared to controls. Visual pathway function, assessed by electrophysiology, was significantly impaired at 3 months but normalized by 12 months. Hearing loss was more common among ZIKV-exposed infants, although not statistically significant. Developmental outcomes were associated with prenatal ZIKV exposure itself, independent of viremia duration, neutralizing antibody titer, viral lineage, or maternal DENV immunity, and were not mediated by visual impairment or hearing loss. These findings highlight that any prenatal ZIKV exposure can disrupt early neurobehavioral development and visual function, underscoring the need for prevention strategies focused on maternal infection and early intervention."
"Viral host range is an important aspect of both viral biology but also the pragmatic issue of producing viral stocks for experimentation. Host range is important both in terms of the species a virus can infect (taxonomy), and the types of host cells the virus can infect (tropism). Nudiviruses are large DNA viruses that infect several arthropods and are generally poorly studied. Several nudiviruses infect Drosophila species including the Drosophila innubila Nudivirus (DiNV). We aimed to identify cell lines that support the replication of DiNV both for the sake of understanding host range, and to develop a system for large scale production of the virus for infection. We utilized cell lines from the focal host, D. innubila, as well as available cell lines from D. virilis and D. melanogaster and inoculated with both a wild-collected pool of ""naive"" virus and a D. innubila cell culture-adapted isolate. We found that virus from wild caught flies infected cells from the 3 cell lines and replicate its genome, but the passage 1 fluids from these infections were unable to reinfect upon introduction to new cells. In contrast, a cell culture-adapted strain of DiNV infected the same Drosophila cells (though relatively poorly in D. melanogaster cells) and produced infectious progeny that infected new cells. Thus, our cell culture-adapted virus developed the ability to infect broadly and produce infectious virions."
"In eukaryotes, regulation of mRNA translation initiation greatly impacts gene expression, and is critical for cellular stress responses. DDX3X is a ubiquitous DEAD-box RNA helicase whose precise role in 5  UTR scanning and start codon decoding in non-stressed and stressed cells is still elusive. Here we show that DDX3X engages with thousands of mRNAs as part of the eIF4F-mediated 48S scanning complex, simultaneously acting to promote or suppress translation of select mRNAs in non-stressed conditions, and switches this regulation in opposite directions in acute ER stress. We find distinct DDX3X binding patterns of differentially regulated mRNAs, which lead us to identify N4-acetylation of cytidines surrounding the start codon as an accompanying feature of mRNAs subject to DDX3X-mediated selective dual regulation. Our findings illuminate the role of DDX3X in stress response and highlight a novel connection between an RNA helicase and a post-transcriptional modification in regulating mRNA translation."
"Background and AimsThe sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter, encoded by SLC5A6, mediates cellular uptake of the vitamins, biotin and pantothenic acid, both of which are essential cofactors for energy metabolism. Here, we report two families with SLC5A6 mutations presenting with early-onset dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). To investigate the link between vitamin deficiency and DCM, we generated a novel cardiac-specific Slc5a6 knockout (Slc5a6cKO) mouse model and tested the therapeutic potential of vitamin supplementation.

MethodsCardiac function in Slc5a6cKO mice was assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and ECG measurements. Histological, biochemical, and proteomic analyses were conducted to identify structural and metabolic changes. The impact of dietary biotin and pantothenic acid supplementation on disease progression was evaluated.

ResultsSlc5a6cKO mice developed progressive cardiac dysfunction, manifesting as DCM with cardiac dilation, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, fibrosis, impaired Coenzyme A synthesis, and metabolic imbalance, culminating in premature death by 26 weeks. Proteomic analysis revealed early mitochondrial metabolic disruption and extracellular matrix protein upregulation at 8 weeks, preceding overt cardiac dysfunction. Strikingly, vitamin supplementation from preconception onwards, prevented the cardiac phenotype, preserving cardiac structure, function, morphology and survival. This parallels the clinical outcome in one patient who received early vitamin treatment, compared to another who required a heart transplant following delayed vitamin treatment.

ConclusionsThis study establishes a direct link between SLC5A6-mediated vitamin transport, mitochondrial function, and cardiac health. It highlights how vitamin deficiency contributes to DCM pathogenesis and supports early vitamin supplementation as a potential therapeutic strategy for metabolic cardiomyopathies.

Translational perspectiveThis study highlights the therapeutic potential of vitamin supplementation in treating dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) caused by mitochondrial abnormalities. Using a cardiac-specific Slc5a6 knockout mouse model, we demonstrated that deficiencies in key vitamins, biotin and pantothenic acid, impair mitochondrial energy metabolism, leading to DCM progression. Remarkably, vitamin supplementation preserved cardiac function, morphology, and survival, suggesting that restoring vitamin levels could be a promising therapeutic strategy for DCM and other cardiomyopathies linked to metabolic deficiencies. These findings could inform newborn screening programmes and clinical approaches for treating mitochondrial-related cardiac diseases by targeting specific vitamin deficiencies.

Key QuestionWhat is the underlying molecular cause of early-onset dilated cardiomyopathy in patients with SLC5A6 mutations, and can insights from a cardiac-specific knockout mouse model reveal potential metabolic mechanisms and therapeutic strategies involving vitamin supplementation?

Key FindingCardiac-specific deletion of Slc5a6 in mice caused early mitochondrial dysfunction, metabolic derangement, and progressive dilated cardiomyopathy. Strikingly, early and continuous supplementation with biotin and pantothenic acid completely preserved cardiac structure, function, and survival, paralleling successful outcomes in patients treated early.

Take Home MessageThis study establishes a mechanistic link between SLC5A6 mutations, vitamin deficiency and mitochondrial abnormalities as a cause of dilated cardiomyopathy. Early vitamin supplementation prevents disease onset, highlighting the potential of targeted vitamin therapy in metabolic cardiomyopathies.

"The parasitic protozoan Trypanosoma brucei has a single mitochondrial nucleoid, anchored to the basal body of the flagellum via the tripartite attachment complex (TAC). The detergent-insoluble TAC is essential for mitochondrial genome segregation during cytokinesis. The TAC assembles de novo in a directed way from the probasal body towards the kDNA. However, the OM TAC module which is composed of five subunits, has previously been suspected to follow more complicated assembly pathways. Here, we identified four detergent-soluble OM TAC module subcomplexes that we assign to two classes. One class contains an oligomeric TAC40 complex that according to AlphaFold contains 6-8 subunits, as well as two subcomplexes of different sizes comprising TAC40, TAC42, and TAC60. The second class consists of a single complex composed of TAC65 and pATOM36. We show that the two subcomplex classes form independently and accumulate upon impairment of TAC assembly. The expression of an N-terminally truncated TAC60 variant causes the accumulation of the larger TAC40/TAC42/TAC60 complex and blocks completion of OM TAC module assembly. This suggests the following assembly pathway: i) TAC40 oligomerizes, ii) TAC42 and TAC60 bind the TAC40 oligomer forming two discrete larger intermediates, where iii) the larger subcomplex merges with the pATOM36/TAC65 subcomplex subsequently forming the OM TAC module.

Author summaryMitochondria are essential for nearly all eukaryotes. This requires proper segregation of the organelles and their genomes to the daughter cells during cell division. For Trypanosomes and its relatives this represents a unique challenge because they have only a single highly compacted mitochondrial nucleoid, containing the bipartite mitochondrial genome, known as the kDNA. To ensure faithful segregation, kDNA replication is tightly coordinated with the nuclear cell cycle and the kDNA is physically connected to the flagellar basal body via the tripartite attachment complex (TAC), which spans both mitochondrial membranes. The TAC consists of at least nine subunits and its biogenesis arguably implies the most extreme lateral sorting event known for any mitochondrion. Five subunits, four integral and one peripheral outer membrane protein, make up the outer TAC module. Using blue native PAGE and RNAi analyses we have identified four soluble subcomplexes that likely represent assembly intermediates of the outer membrane TAC module. These results suggest that the outer membrane TAC module is assembled following a branched pathway that includes an unusual a ring-like intermediate of 6-8 subunits of a trypanosomatid-specific VDAC-like beta-barrel protein."
"This study reports the discovery and characterization of novel CRBN molecular glues that selectively induce the proteasomal degradation of the hematopoietic-specific signaling protein VAV1, a key target in hematological malignancies and autoimmune diseases. Utilizing unbiased global proteomics, we identified phenyl-glutarimide derivatives NGT-201-12, as effective VAV1 degraders, with its C-terminal SH3 domain (SH32) being crucial for this interaction. A significant finding is the elucidation of a non-canonical RT-loop degron (RDxS motif, residues 796-799) within VAV1 SH32, distinct from previously characterized G-loop degrons. This discovery, supported by advanced computational modeling using the YDS-GlueFold platform and validated by site-directed mutagenesis, highlights versatility of CRBN in recognizing diverse neosubstrate motifs."
"There is a critical gap in the development of new therapeutic platforms designed to treat gynecologic and obstetric diseases. Compared to systemic drug delivery, vaginal drug administration of nanoparticle formulations limits off-target side effects while increasing therapeutic concentration in target tissues, showing promise for clinical translation. However, these formulations suffer from limited scalability, high-cost reagents, and long optimization timelines. Recent work highlights the potential of bacterial extracellular vesicles (bEVs) as a low-cost, tunable platform for therapeutic applications. Here, we evaluate bEVs as a therapeutic carrier for vaginal drug delivery. We demonstrate the loading of the model protein moxNeonGreen into Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 bEVs. By optimizing growth parameters, we increase protein loading into bEVs. We evaluate the effect of bEVs on the vaginal microenvironment, and observe no negative impact on vaginal epithelial cells, endocervical cells, or vaginal bacteria in vitro. Additionally, we observe the retention of bEVs in the murine female reproductive tract for more than six hours. This study provides a framework for using genetically engineered bEVs to rapidly generate customizable therapies for a range of gynecologic and obstetric conditions, addressing longstanding challenges in womens health therapeutics.

"Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a hematologic malignancy primarily driven by the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene. While tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as imatinib, have transformed CML management, many patients still experience adverse side effects and therapy resistance. This study investigated the potential of RXFP1 (relaxin family peptide receptor 1) as a diagnostic biomarker for CML, leveraging bioinformatics, statistical analysis, and artificial intelligence (AI)-based modeling. Using the GSE97562 gene expression dataset, which consists of 40 human bone marrow samples, we identified RXFP1 as the top-ranked gene in a random forest model trained to differentiate CML samples from normal samples. The gene exhibited statistically significant overexpression in CML (p < 0.0001), with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 1.0, indicating perfect classification capability. Notably, RXFP1 retained its expression profile even after imatinib treatment, suggesting its independence from BCR-ABL signaling and making it a promising candidate for disease monitoring regardless of therapeutic status.

To facilitate nonprogrammatic analysis and reproducibility, a GUI tool was developed using Python, which integrates statistical tests, visual plots (ROC, box plots, Mann-Whitney curve), and a text-to-speech reporting system. Manual validation further confirmed RXFP1s discriminatory power, with zero expression overlapping between CML and normal samples across all experimental subgroups. This research is also driven by a personal motivation: the authors wife is a CML patient undergoing TKI treatment and experiencing side effects. This study emerged from the authors desire to find a safer and more precise diagnostic pathway.

These findings suggest that RXFP1 is a robust and treatment-independent molecular biomarker for CML, laying a foundation for larger studies and therapeutic exploration. This study also demonstrates the potential of integrated AI tools in accelerating biomarker discovery and empowering independent researchers to contribute to precision medicine."
"We present a Monte Carlo framework for simulating the nucleation of biomolecular condensates in the grand canonical ensemble, which overcomes the limitations of fixed particle number and allows direct control of the dilute-phase concentration. Our approach combines conformation sampling with bias-enhanced cluster size sampling, enabling accurate sampling of individual cluster sizes in various conformations. Our method resolves nucleation free energy surfaces and is capable of capturing both classical and nonclassical nucleation mechanisms. We validated our method by reproducing structural properties of disordered proteins across a diverse benchmark set and by applying it to study nucleation in two phase-separating proteins, FUS-LC and NDDX4, using both HPS and MPIPI coarse-grained force fields. While both proteins exhibit classical nucleation behavior under the HPS model, only FUS-LC remains classical with MPIPI. In contrast, NDDX4 shows a distinctly nonclassical nucleation pathway under MPIPI, characterized by a metastable intermediate state near the cluster size of 53 protein chains. Morphological analysis reveals that clusters up to this point are compact and spherical, whereas larger clusters adopt a nonspherical, two-lobed geometry indicative of frustrated coalescence. These findings underscore the critical role of sequence composition and force field parameterization in shaping nucleation pathways and demonstrate the utility of our framework for uncovering complex, mechanism-rich free energy landscapes in biomolecular condensation."
"Wound repair involves complex cellular interactions to induce efficient healing. Skin resident {gamma}{delta} T cells regulate keratinocyte function and inflammatory responses in wound healing through the secretion of growth factors and cytokines. Some of these cytokines are involved in the neuroimmune axis, so we aimed to ascertain if {gamma}{delta} T cells and neurons exhibit crosstalk during wound repair. We identified a prevalent NPY1R+ peripheral neuron subset in the skin. {gamma}{delta} T cells interact with NPY1R+ neurons in the epidermis and dermis of both nonwounded and wounded murine skin. To determine the impact of the {gamma}{delta} TCR on NPY1R+ neuron interactions in wound healing, we compared epidermal T cell-neuron interactions in TCR{delta}-/- mice during wound repair. We found a decrease in interactions between epidermal {beta} T cells and NPY1R+ neurons in TCR{delta}-/- mice, suggesting {gamma}{delta} T cells communicate with NPY1R+ neurons more frequently than {beta} T cells in the epidermis, regardless of wound repair. In contrast, dermal T cell-neuron interactions in wildtype and TCR{delta}-/- mice during wound repair were similar between {beta} T cells and {gamma}{delta} T cells, suggesting both T cell types mediate communications with neurons in the dermis. In obese mice there are fewer NPY1R+ neurons and diminished neuron-T cell interactions indicative of neuropathy. Together these findings elucidate a neuroimmune crosstalk during wound repair that becomes disrupted in obesity."
"O_LIMarine heat waves (MHW) are extreme climate events characterized by elevated ocean temperatures lasting from days to months and spanning thousands of kilometers. Recent predictions show an increment in MHW frequency, duration and intensity worldwide along with climate change. Nevertheless, little is known about MHW impacts on marine microbial life and, specifically, on algal blooms. Recent studies in yeast and green algae suggested that thermotolerance is mediated by metacaspases (MC), cysteine proteases, structurally similar to caspases known to mediate programmed cell death.
C_LIO_LIInitially we created a heatwave model of 72-hours that exposes the model diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum to elevated temperature with a recovery phase that enables to capture the mechanisms underpinning such acclimation. We generated triple knock-out mutants of the PtMCA genes and identified a vital role for MC in heat-stress acclimation.
C_LIO_LIPtMCA triple mutants exhibited increased sensitivity to the heatwave treatment, which induced cell death that peaked days after returning to initial temperatures. We further revealed that heatwave treatment induced accumulation of reactive oxygen species and the PtMCA mutants were hypersensitive to oxidative stress as compared to WT cells.
C_LIO_LIWe propose that metacaspases have a pivotal role in diatoms acclimation to elevated temperatures a trait vital for algal survival considering climate change.

"Poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors are standard of care treatment for cancers with homologous-recombination deficiencies. Yet, as tumors develop resistance, complementary strategies are emerging, including targeting microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ). Given that PARP1 is widely described as a key promoter of MMEJ, one would expect PARP inhibition to suppress MMEJ--potentially making MMEJ inhibition redundant. MMEJ was originally described as a backup pathway, with seminal work linking PARP1 to MMEJ conducted in NHEJ-deficient cells, where MMEJ can be reactivated in G1. However, we now appreciate that MMEJ is a mitotic repair mechanism, but the function of PARP1 in this context remains unclear. Here, we systematically explore the effect that PARP/PARPi have on MMEJ activity in cells with intact NHEJ. Surprisingly, PARP inhibition leads to elevated Pol{theta}-dependent MMEJ levels at ISceI-mediated DSBs, which we find is due to PARP1s regulation of competing pathways at these breaks. Importantly, we show that PARP is dispensable for MMEJ at double-ended DSBs and is expendable for repair of DSBs during mitosis. Altogether, this data shifts the understanding of PARPs role in MMEJ and DNA repair pathway choice. Moreover, we believe this data further strengthens a rationale for PARPi/MMEJi combinatorial drug treatment in HR-deficient cancers."
"Gene drive technology may be a valuable tool for addressing several contemporary challenges, including combating disease vectors, conserving biodiversity, and controlling agricultural pests. Homing gene drives spread through a population by copying themselves onto the homologous chromosome in the germline of heterozygous individuals. However, it is possible that resistance will evolve against homing gene drives, especially if the goal is to suppress or eliminate a pest population so that resistance alleles have a large selective advantage over the gene drive. Resistance can result from a simple mutation at the drives target site, which is found in many studies but can potentially be avoided by improving drive design. However, a more complex polygenic type of resistance could also evolve through selection on standing genetic variation that affects the efficiency of the spread of the gene drive. In this study, we test an efficient homing gene drive in genetically diverse lines of Drosophila melanogaster, collected from across Europe by the DrosEU Consortium. We find that the gene drive shows considerable variability in homing efficiency, but that none of this variability can be ascribed to heritable genetic effects. Selection for complex resistance is thus unlikely and will be inefficient, probably still giving a gene drive enough time to fixate in the population. However, although our tested gene drive targets a highly conserved haploinsufficient gene with two gRNAs, we find simple resistance alleles in viable offspring. Half of these are the product of end-joining repair instead of homing and may still carry heavy fitness costs. However, the other half are the result of partial homing events. These alleles indicate that resistance could likely evolve against this gene drive in a simple, non-polygenic way. Therefore, more effective strategies may be required to address simple resistance mutations, whereas complex resistance may be unlikely to pose a substantial barrier to the employment of at least certain types of gene drive."
"AlphaFold2 and AlphaFold3 have revolutionized protein structure prediction by enabling high-accuracy tertiary structure predictions for most single-chain proteins. However, obtaining high-quality predictions for some hard protein targets with shallow or noisy multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) and complicated multi-domain architectures remains challenging. Here, we present MULTICOM4, an integrative protein structure prediction system that uses diverse MSA generation, large-scale model sampling, and an ensemble model quality assessment (QA) strategy of combining individual QA methods to improve model generation and ranking of AlphaFold2 and AlphaFold3. In the 16th Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP16), our predictors built on MULTICOM4 ranked among the top performers out of 120 predictors in tertiary structure prediction and outperformed a standard AlphaFold3 predictor. The average TM-score of our best performing predictor MULTCOMs top-1 prediction for 84 CASP16 domain is 0.902. It achieved high accuracy (TM-score > 0.9) for 73.8% of the 84 domains and correct fold predictions (TM-score > 0.5) for 97.6% domains in terms of top-1 prediction. In terms of best-of-top-5 prediction, it predicted correct folds for all the domains. The results show that MSA engineering through the use of different protein sequence databases, alignment tools, and domain segmentation as well as extensive model sampling are the key to generate accurate and correct structural models. Additionally, using multiple complementary QA methods and model clustering can improve the robustness and reliability of model ranking."
"Transfer RNA genes (tDNAs) are essential genomic elements that safeguard translational fidelity. Using the T2T version of the human genome we have mapped the position of human tDNAs and analyzed their individual transcriptional activities. Then we have characterized, at single base resolution, the impact of somatic mutations in human tDNAs and its relationship to the transcriptional status of each gene. We confirm that tDNAs are hotspots for somatic mutagenesis, and show that they display mutational loads that are directly proportional to their transcription rates. Highly transcribed tDNAs in tumors or healthy tissues accumulate mutations at rates up to nine-fold higher than highly transcribed protein-coding genes. Mutational loads at tDNAs are tumor-specific, and increase with patient age. Mutations at structurally conserved tRNA positions appear to be under negative selection. Strikingly, anticodon nucleotides crucial for decoding frequently acquire somatic mutations, readily generating chimeric tRNAs species capable of systematically introducing amino acid substitutions across the proteome. Our results reveal a previously unrecognized source of somatic heterogeneity in human cancer and aging tissues that may directly impact upon translation efficiency and fidelity, and cause cell-specific proteostasis degeneration."
"Botrytis cinerea is recognized as one of the most harmful fungal diseases affecting grapevine (Vitis vinifera), directly impacting grape yield and wine quality. Identifying new genes involved in the interaction between V. vinifera and B. cinerea appears to be the most promising strategy for enhancing grapevine resistance to this pathogen in future breeding programs. During pathogen infection, plasma membrane-localized pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) are involved in the perception of conserved microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs). Among PRRs, members of the LysM receptor-like kinase family are well known to mediate recognition of fungal MAMPs to induce the plant immune signaling pathway. Interestingly, a novel member of this receptor family, named VvLYK6, was identified in grapevine as the most upregulated during a Botrytis cinerea infection.

Aiming to understand the role of VvLYK6 in plant immunity, we carried out an overexpression study in Arabidopsis thaliana and in grapevine cell suspension. The overexpression of VvLYK6 resulted in a reduction of chitin oligomer-induced MAPKs activation, expression of defense-related genes, a reduced callose deposition and an increased plant susceptibility to three fungal pathogens. At the opposite, the CRISPR-Cas9-mediated vvlyk6 knock-out lines generated in V. vinifera induce the phytoalexin-related stilbene pathway at the basal level.

Based on our findings, we concluded that VvLYK6 negatively regulates the chitin-triggered immune responses in V. vinifera, suggesting its potential involvement as a susceptibility gene during fungal infections."
"M. tuberculosis, an intracellular pathogen, thrives in a specialized membrane-bound vacuole, the phagosome with acidic pH and limited access to nutrients. To survive and replicate within human host, M. tuberculosis must adapt and fulfil its nutritional requirements. To understand how the bacillus captures nutrients from its host, we studied mycobacterial acquisition of host-derived amino acids, the preferred nitrogen sources. We discovered that PhoP, a key determinant of mycobacterial adaptation to phagosomal acidification, controls expression of AnsP1 and AnsP2 to facilitate acquisition of host aspartate and asparagine, respectively. Thus, macrophage-infected WT-H37Rv showed a significantly higher level of intra-bacterial Asn compared to the phoP-KO mutant and a complemented mutant could restore Asn level to that of WT-H37Rv. Under acidic conditions, elevated DNA binding of PhoP within the promoters lead to direct activation of ansP1 and ansP2. Consistently, phoP-KO is unable to utilize Asn under acidic condition, and over-expression of ansP1 or ansP2 restored intracellular growth defect of the mutant. These findings uncover the regulatory network allowing utilization of organic nitrogen sources by the pathogen during infection.

Author summaryHuman Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, remains a global public health burden claiming [~]1.25 million deaths in 2023. To investigate how the bacillus captures nitrogen sources from its host, we studied acquisition of host amino acids aspartate (Asp) and asparagine (Asn) by the tubercle bacilli. We show that PhoP, a key determinant of mycobacterial adaptation to phagosomal acidification, controls expression of Asp and Asn transporters to facilitate acquisition of host amino acids by the pathogen. A mutant lacking phoP is unable to utilize Asn under acidic conditions, whereas over-expression of ansP1 and/or ansP2 restored growth defect of the phoP-KO in vitro and in macrophages. Together, these findings uncover the transcriptional landscape allowing utilization of organic nitrogen sources by the tubercle bacilli during infection."
"BackgroundAutosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is caused by mutations affecting polycystin-1 (PC1) or -2 (PC2). The existence of a  cilia-dependent cyst activation (CDCA) pathway has been identified by demonstrating that structurally intact primary cilia are crucial for cyst growth following loss of polycystins. We previously used translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) RNA-Seq on pre- cystic mouse kidneys to determine the translatome that meet the criteria for CDCA and identified Glis2 as an early effector of polycystin signaling. Here, we investigate the potential role of Glis3 in ADPKD, which, while not transcriptionally altered, encodes a cilia-localized transcription factor belonging to the same family of genes as Glis2.

MethodsWe used live cell confocal imaging to study the subcellular localization of Glis3 in the presence or absence of Pkd1. We used Glis3 conditional knockout mice to investigate the genetic interaction between Glis3 and Pkd1. Changes in gene expression and chromatin accessibility were assessed by RNA-Seq and ATAC-Seq on an allelic series of Glis3 and Pkd1 kidney selective inactivation models at 7-weeks age to evaluate the function of Glis3.

ResultsThe ciliary localization of Glis3 is not affected by Pkd1 mutation status. Kidney selective Glis3 by itself does not affect kidney structure or function, but dual inactivation of Glis3 and Pkd1 significantly worsen polycystic kidney disease. Integration of transcriptomic profiling and chromatin accessibility assays suggested that kidney tubule specific Glis3 inactivation results in dysregulated fatty acid metabolism and circadian.

ConclusionsGlis3 is a primary cilium localized transcription factor that genetically interacts with Pkd1 and modifies kidney epithelial cell metabolism and circadian function."
"Stress and anxiety are well-known modulators of both physiological and pathological itch. Acute stress suppresses itch, while chronic stress exacerbates it. These effects are mediated by neural circuits within the brain, though the precise mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigate the role of neurons in the stress-sensitive lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) in modulating itch. Using neural activity-dependent genetic labeling and chemogenetic tools, we selectively engaged a population of LHA neurons (LHAstress-TRAP neurons) responsive to stress. Transient stimulation of these neurons induced anxiety-like behaviors, conditioned place aversion, and suppressed acute (chloroquine-induced) and chronic (psoriatic) itch. Conversely, the inhibition of the LHAstress-TRAP neurons enhanced acute and chronic itch. Interestingly, LHAstress-TRAP neurons did not respond to acute itch stimuli, but their activity was temporally correlated with scratching episodes in mice with psoriasis. Ex vivo whole-cell patch-clamp recordings revealed that these neurons exhibit heightened excitability in psoriatic animals. Anterograde viral tracing demonstrated that LHAstress-TRAP neurons project to brainstem regions implicated in itch modulation, including the periaqueductal gray (PAG), rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM), and lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPBN). Furthermore, chemogenetic activation and optogenetic silencing of LHAstress-TRAP axon terminals revealed that bidirectional modulation of itch is primarily mediated through projections to the PAG. Together, these findings identify a previously unrecognized central mechanism by which stress modulates itch, centered on a specific population of LHA neurons and their downstream brainstem targets."
"GluN2A-containing NMDA receptors, encoded by the GRIN2A gene, are critical components of excitatory synaptic transmission and are essential for proper brain development and function. Dysregulation of NMDA receptor activity is strongly implicated in the pathophysiology of epilepsy. While excessive GluN2A-mediated signalling can lead to hyperexcitability and seizure generation, loss-of-function mutations in GRIN2A, which result in reduced GluN2A expression, have also been identified in patients with various forms of epilepsy, including focal epilepsies and epileptic encephalopathies. This paradox highlights the complexity of NMDA receptor contributions to network excitability and suggests that both gain- and loss-of-function mutations can be pathogenic. However, the mechanisms through which reduced GluN2A expression influences seizure susceptibility remains unclear.

In this study, we examined the impact of reduced and absence of GluN2A on seizure-like activity using in vitro model system. Hippocampal slices were prepared from wild-type littermate controls (Grin2a+/+), heterozygous (Grin2a+/-) and homozygous (Grin2a-/-) transgenic rats and subjected to pro-convulsant conditions to elicit epileptiform-like events. Specifically, we employed three well established in vitro epilepsy models: (i) 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), (ii) zero-magnesium with elevated potassium (0Mg{superscript 2}/5K), and (iii) high-potassium (high-K+). Local field potentials were recorded from the CA1 pyramidal layer to quantify interictal and seizure-like activity, by measuring latency to onset, event frequency, and duration. Spectral analyses were also conducted to assess alterations in network dynamics.

Our findings reveal that reduced GluN2A expression alters the susceptibility of hippocampal circuits to seizure-like activity in a model-dependent manner. In the 4-AP model, Grin2a-/- slices exhibited a significantly lower frequency of interictal events and a delayed onset of seizure-like activity relative to both wild-type and heterozygous slices. In the 0Mg{superscript 2}/5K model, both Grin2a+/- and Grin2a-/- slices displayed reduced seizure susceptibility compared to wild-type. Finally, in the high-K model, Grin2a-/- slices showed a reduced incidence of seizure-like events compared to wild-type controls when extracellular potassium concentration was increased to 7.5 mM, although this effect was less apparent at higher concentrations (9.5 mM).

These results suggest that partial or complete loss of GluN2A-containing NMDA receptors reduces the propensity of hippocampal networks to develop epileptiform activity, potentially by altering intrinsic or synaptic excitability. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into how GRIN2A loss-of-function variants may contribute to epilepsy and highlight the need to consider developmental and circuit-level compensations when interpreting the impact of GluN2A disruption."
"Diversity exists throughout biology, playing an important role in maintaining robustness and stability. The same is true of the brain, as has become increasingly apparent in recent years with the accumulation of datasets of unparalleled resolution. These datasets show widespread neural heterogeneity, spanning cells, circuits and system dynamics, marking it as an unavoidable component of the brains composition. Recent experiments found declines in heterogeneity amongst neurons may accompany pathological states. While heterogeneity has been linked to stability, robustness and increased computational potential, the loss of biophysical diversity was found conducive to the onset of seizure-like activity, suggesting an important functional role. Despite this, how changes in heterogeneity arise remains unknown. Oftentimes considered a static metaparameter resulting from solely genetic disposition, heterogeneity is, in fact, a highly dynamic property of biological networks arising from various sources. Here, we consider this through the lens of intrinsic plasticity, the activity-dependent modulation of neuron biophysical properties, which we propose allows the degree of biophysical diversity to fluctuate in time. Using a network of Poisson neurons endowed with intrinsic plasticity, we combine analytical and numerical approaches to measure the effect of input statistics on the excitability of individual cells, and how this translates into changes in network heterogeneity at the population scale. Our results indicate that, through intrinsic plasticity, diversity in synaptic inputs promotes heterogeneity in cell-to-cell excitability due to changes in the statistics of presynaptic firing rates, and network topology. In contrast, whenever the statistics of synaptic input between cells were too similar, intrinsic plasticity promoted the decline in heterogeneity. Further, we show that changes in heterogeneity can coexist with degeneracy in the firing rate between neurons. Taken together, understanding how input statistics affect neuronal network heterogeneity may provide key insights into brain function resilience and the manipulability of neural diversity through intrinsic plasticity.

Author summaryContemporary research has identified widespread within-cell-type diversity in the brain, manifest through variations in biophysical features such as neuronal excitability.

Computational and mathematical techniques have previously been leveraged to show this cell-to-cell biophysical diversity to be important to the persistence of brain function over time. Less clear has been how heterogeneity is regulated through time. Here we propose a homeostatic model for modulation of neuronal excitability. We demonstrate the ability of this model to capture the malleability of network heterogeneity as a function of the input statistics."
"During development, cells must interpret extracellular signals with speed and accuracy. While morphogen gradients pattern tissues, how cells respond to dynamic morphogens remains unclear. Here, we investigate how dorsal patterning in the Drosophila embryo is specified by a rapidly evolving BMP gradient. Using a live reporter of BMP pathway activity and nascent transcription reporters, we find that gene expression is best predicted by time integration of BMP signaling, rather than instantaneous levels. However, in sog mutant embryos with broad BMP activity, integration alone fails to predict gene expression outside the normal domain. We show that the transcription factor Zen lowers the signaling threshold required for activation, enabling integration to drive rapid transcriptional responses even at low BMP levels. Together, these results suggest that cells interpret dynamic morphogen signals through the combined action of temporal integration and spatial competence, providing a framework for robust pattern formation on fast developmental timescales."
"Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a pivotal tool in modern diagnostics and research, yet image reconstruction is often used by clinicians and researchers as a black box. In this work, we introduce Monalisa, an open-source, user-friendly MATLAB framework designed to simplify the MRI reconstruction process. Monalisa decomposes the reconstruction pipeline into clear modular steps, including raw data reading with flexible file-type abstraction, trajectory computation, density compensation, advanced coil sensitivity mapping, and tailored binning strategies through its ""mitosius"" preprocessing stage. The framework supports a suite of reconstruction methods, including iterative-SENSE (also named CG-SENSE), GeneRalized Autocalibrating Partial Parallel Acquisition (GRAPPA) reconstructions, and Compressed Sensing (CS) supporting both spatial and temporal regularization using l1 and l2 techniques, accommodating both Cartesian and non-Cartesian acquisitions. Benchmark experiments comparing Monalisa with established frameworks such as Berkeley Advanced Reconstruction Toolbox (BART) on simulated 2D radial acquisitions demonstrate competitive performance, with trade-offs observed between Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) and l2 error metrics. In some bench-mark reconstructions, Monalisa produced images with fewer visible artifacts than BART, although these differences were not always reflected in SSIM or l2 distance metrics. By providing comprehensive documentation and modular design, Monalisa serves not only as a powerful tool for research and clinical imaging but also as an educational platform to facilitate innovation in MRI reconstruction."
"Proteins play indispensable roles in cellular function, acting as both structural components and catalysts for essential biological processes. Their proper folding into three-dimensional structures is critical for functionality. To ensure correct folding, proteins interact with chaperones and folding catalysts such as Protein Disulfide Isomerases (PDIs), which assist in the formation and rearrangement of disulfide bonds that stabilize proteins by linking cysteine residues. PDIs are part of the thioredoxin (TRX) superfamily and are characterized by a conserved CXXC motif that contributes to their redox potential. They exhibit isomerase and oxidoreductase activities, that enable them to rearrange and form new disulfide bonds. PDI family members in sorghum (SbPDI) present a broad and largely unexplored diversity in domain order, structure, and architecture between or even within species. To shed light on this diversity, we identified and characterized PDI family members in sorghum in silico to explore their domain architecture, three-dimensional structure and functionality.

Author summaryIn this work, we explore how genomic and molecular tools can improve our understanding of the function and diversity of the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) family in plants, using sorghum as a model and humans as a reference. By analysing domain architecture and predicted structures across the PDI family, we lay the groundwork for future studies investigating their roles in plant development and stress responses, including through targeted gene editing approaches. Although PDIs have been widely studied in humans, their structural and functional diversity in plants remains largely unexplored. With this study, I aim to help close this knowledge gap and highlight the structural differences of PDIs in plants."
"Cytokinesis is the final step of cell division, resulting in the physical separation of the two daughter cells. Despite its fundamental importance in cell biology, biologists currently lack automatic tools for large-scale profiling of cytokinesis dynamics. In particular, the timing of the first microtubule cut in the intercellular bridge connecting the daughter cells is crucial, as it marks a critical step preceding abscission. Here, we introduce Cut-Detector, an open-source tool for the automatic analysis of late cytokinesis timing from time-lapse microscopy movies. Cut-Detector employs an AI approach to carry out the multiple tasks required to monitor cytokinesis: cell segmentation and tracking, detection of cell division events, localization of the intercellular bridge, and detection of the microtubule cuts. Cut-Detector will facilitate large-scale analyses to uncover new cytokinetic genes, a task that would be impractical without automation."
"Glioblastoma (GBM) displays pronounced intratumoral heterogeneity, posing significant challenges to understanding its biology and developing effective treatments. Using spatial multi-omics, in vivo functional assays, and systems-level analysis, we delineate the diverse metabolic and immune architecture of GBM. We identify a lipid-dependent lineage of treatment-resistant persister cells (TRPCs) that engage tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in a spatially organized, metabolically specialized crosstalk. TRPCs co-opt CCR2, CSF1R, CD163+ TAMs for lipid scavenging and acquisition, promoting a pro-tumorigenic and immunosuppressive microenvironment. This cooperative axis is critically dependent on lipid chaperones like FABPs, whose targeting disrupts TAM recruitment, remodels immune composition, and suppresses tumor growth. Retrospective clinical analyses reveal that elevated TRPC-associated transcriptome may serve as stratification criteria to identify patients benefiting from lipid-lowering therapies like statins. Our findings uncover a targetable immunometabolic circuit between TRPCs and TAMs and support the development of precision therapies that disrupt lipid-fueled tumor-immune cooperation in GBM.

In briefTreatment-resistant persister cells (TRPCs) in glioblastoma spatially engage TAMs to facilitate lipid transfer, thereby sustaining tumor growth and promoting immune evasion. Targeting this TRPC-TAM metabolic axis reprograms the immunosuppressive microenvironment and improves therapeutic outcomes, revealing a clinically actionable metabolic vulnerability with potential for precision immune-metabolic interventions in GBM.

"Transcriptional dysregulation has emerged as a critical driver of melanoma progression, yet the molecular mechanisms governing this process and their potential as therapeutic targets remain inadequately characterized. Here, we identify FRA1 as a potent and actionable driver of melanoma metastasis. FRA1 enhanced both the initial seeding and subsequent outgrowth of metastatic lesions. Comprehensive multi-omics integration revealed transcriptional target genes of FRA1, with AXL, CDK6, and FSCN1 exhibiting increased expression in melanoma metastasis and a significant correlation with poor patient outcomes. Silencing AXL, CDK6, or FSCN1 abrogated FRA1-mediated invasion in vitro and reduced metastatic colonization. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of CDK6 and FSCN1, and to a lesser extent AXL, suppressed melanoma metastasis and prolonged overall survival. The expression of FRA1 and its target genes correlates with shortened survival across multiple cancer types, highlighting the broader clinical relevance of this pathway. This study unveils an actionable FRA1-mediated transcriptional network that drives cancer progression and metastasis, offering potential avenues for therapeutic interventions.

SIGNIFICANCEFRA1 promotes melanoma metastasis by enhancing the expression of AXL, CDK6, and FSCN1 and this transcriptional network is associated with poor survival across several cancer types. Targeting these FRA1 effectors suppresses metastasis and extends survival, offering a therapeutic strategy for metastatic melanoma and potentially other aggressive cancers."
"Embryo implantation is accompanied by the naive-to-primed pluripotency transition in epiblast cells, making them receptive to external differentiation signals. In addition to this developmental program switch, implantation suggests that an anabolic boost is required for this process, as the embryo-uterine connection begins supplying the requisite nutrients. In this study, we show that the DNA-binding protein Pcbp1 plays a key role in intensifying amino acid metabolism during the priming of pluripotent stem cells. Knockout of the Pcbp1 gene leads to embryo growth arrest a few days after implantation. By modeling the naive-to-primed pluripotency transition in vitro, we observe reduced proliferation and induction of apoptosis in cells deficient for Pcbp1. Using multi-omics approaches, we uncover a crucial role for Pcbp1 in driving a transcriptional burst of numerous genes involved in the import and the de novo synthesis of essential and conditionally essential amino acids. Pcbp1 deficiency is consequently associated with a slowdown in protein biosynthesis, explaining the early lethal phenotype of knockout embryos. Our findings thus uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying anabolic changes during the naive-to-primed pluripotency transition and highlight the essential role of Pcbp1 in this process, also pointing to its functions in highly proliferative cells.

"Mapping chromatin quantitative trait loci (cQTLs) is crucial for elucidating the regulatory mechanisms governing gene expression and complex traits. However, current cQTL mapping methods suffer from limited detection power, particularly at existing sample sizes, and are constrained by peak-calling accuracy. To address these limitations, we present CACTI, a novel method that improves cQTL mapping by leveraging correlations between neighboring regulatory elements. Across diverse histone marks (H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K27ac, H3K27me3 and H3K36me3) and cell types, CACTI identifies 51%-255% more cQTL signals compared to conventional single-peak-based approaches. Using CACTI, we generate a comprehensive cQTL map for the five histone marks across multiple cell types and perform colocalization analyses with GWAS loci from 44 complex traits. CACTI cQTLs colocalize with 6%-47% of GWAS loci, which is on average 15%-424% more than the standard cQTL mapping method across different marks. 24%-75% of colocalized GWAS loci show no colocalization with eQTLs. This underscores CACTIs unique ability to uncover regulatory mechanisms that would otherwise remain undetected by eQTL analysis alone, significantly improving the functional interpretation of GWAS findings."
"Studies on glycans of glycoproteins are hampered by the lack of standards that reflect the wide diversity in structure typically observed. To this end we have exploited a large library of N-glycan standards comprised of a unique collection of 226 N-glycans including oligomannose, hybrid, and complex-type. We generated a method employing porous graphitized carbon (PGC) and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (PGC-LC-MS), which can provide a high degree of resolution of underivatized N-glycan structures. Chromatogram libraries arising from these studies include retention time data, diagnostic fragments, and validated structural assignments, providing a robust platform for both targeted and discovery-based glycomics. We refer to this as an N-glycopedia, the first type of resource in which researchers can compare this collective data to N-glycans under study and overcome the limitations of only having compositional data and predicted structures. The technology is easily expandable to include additional N-glycans as new standards become available."
"We introduce a novel hybrid machine learning (ML) framework to predict the radius of gyration and other conformational properties of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). Our model integrates sequence information with physical features derived from a coarse-grained (CG) model validated by experimental data. Specifically, we combine hidden states from sequence-based models with 23 physical features projected into a shared latent space, and apply an attention mechanism that assigns weights to each residue to highlight the most informative regions of the sequence. This attention-guided fusion significantly improves predictive accuracy across multiple metrics, including MAPE and MSE, while also enhancing confidence in the predictions. We trained and evaluated our models on Brownian dynamics (BD) simulation results for approximately 7,000 IDPs from the MobiDB database (each with > 99% disorder score). We find that sequence-based models consistently outperform feature-only models, with the GRU achieving the best performance among sequence-only approaches. Moreover, combining sequence and feature information further improves accuracy across all architectures, with the hybrid biGRU model delivering the best overall predictive performance. SHAP analysis reveals the relative importance of physical features, offering model explainability and guiding feature selection. Notably, using a small number of top features often reduces model complexity and improves generalization. Furthermore an integrated gradient analysis reveals that apart from the length of the IDPs, the three parameters (SCD, SHD, and f *) play key role in ML predictions. Our framework provides a fast, interpretable, and scalable tool for predicting IDP behavior, enabling efficient initial screening prior to costly molecular simulations."
"Biomolecular condensates formed through liquid-liquid phase separation are increasingly recognized as critical regulators of genome organization and gene expression. While the role of proteins in driving phase separation is well-established, how DNA modulates the structure and dynamics of protein-DNA condensates remains less well understood. Here, we employ a minimalist coarse-grained model to investigate the interplay between homotypic protein-protein and heterotypic protein-DNA interactions in governing condensate formation, composition, and internal dynamics. Our simulations reveal that DNA chain length and flexibility critically influence condensate morphology, leading to the emergence of multiphasic and core-shell organizations under strong heterotypic interactions. We find that DNA recruitment into the condensate significantly alters protein mobility, giving rise to differential dynamics of proteins within the condensate. By analyzing the distribution profiles of protein displacements, we identify up to five distinct diffusion modes, including proteins bound to DNA, confined within the dense phase, or freely diffusing. These results provide a mechanistic framework for interpreting spatially heterogeneous protein dynamics observed in chromatin condensates and emphasize the direct role of DNA in tuning condensate properties. Our findings provide new insights into how biophysical parameters may control the functional architecture of protein-DNA condensates in biological systems.

"Vaults are some of the largest ribonucleoprotein complexes known, and are highly conserved across eukaryotes, but both their function and key details of their architecture remain unclear. While high-resolution structures of the vault shell are available, the architecture and symmetry of the cap at either end of the vault has remained unresolved. Here we present a 2.25 [A] cryo-EM structure of the vault cap, revealing an unexpected 13-fold symmetric arrangement that contrasts with the 39-fold symmetry of the vault body, with each repeating module of the cap formed by an asymmetric homotrimer of adjacent subunits, in which two C-termini remain in the vault interior, and one projects into the cytosol. The center of the cap features an unusual architecture reminiscent of the Stomatin, Flotillin and HflK/C (SPFH) superfamily, consisting of two concentric beta barrels surrounded by an interwoven two-layer stack of alpha-helices, with the innermost barrel forming a 15 [A] aperture connecting the interior of the vault with the cytosol. The vault cap features a positively charged exterior and a negatively charged interior surface, with implications for binding partner recruitment and putative binding of the vault particle to microtubules and lipid rafts. These findings uncover a new facet of vault particle architecture, and have implications for engineering and design of modified vault particles for therapeutic delivery, as well as providing new opportunities for interrogating the functional roles of the vault particle in biological systems."

"Succinate Receptor 1 (SUCNR1) is a key metabolite sensing GPCR activated by high local succinate concentrations through Gi and Gq signaling pathways. By combining AlphaFold-based modeling, Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics simulations (72s in total), receptor mutagenesis, and signaling assays, we here investigate the spontaneous and G-protein binding-associated activation mechanism of SUCNR1. Our molecular simulations predict that, in the absence of G protein or ligand, human SUCNR1 (hSUCNR1), in contrast to murine SUCNR1 (mSUCNR1), adopts canonical active- like conformations in its intracellular domains and undergoes critical conformational changes in its extracellular domain. This finding is consistent with our signaling-assay results showing that hSUCNR1, unlike mSUCNR1, displays a high degree of constitutive signaling. When complexed with either Gi or Gq, both h- and mSUCNR1 adopt highly energetically favorable conformations in the extracellular domain, characterized by the unlocking of extracellular loop 2b (ECL2b) and an expanded ligand entry pathway. Interestingly, the simulations reveal that helix 5 of Gq binds less firmly to the TM3/6 cleft of mSUCNR1, resulting in an unstable extracellular domain of the Gq- mSUCNR1 complex, which however can be stabilized by agonist binding. This result is supported by our BRET assays, which show that, in contrast to hSUCNR1, mSUCNR1 fails to recruit mini-Gq to the cell surface in the absence of an agonist. Furthermore, the signaling effects of key receptor residues at G-protein binding site and within ECL2b, as predicted by our simulations, were confirmed by mutagenesis assays. Overall, our integrative approach demonstrates that hSUCNR1 can spontaneously adopt all key conformations associated with receptor activation, and that G protein binding further primes the extracellular receptor domain for agonist binding, which in turn stabilizes the active complex."
"Associations between feather mosses and cyanobacteria are crucial sources of new biologically available nitrogen (N) in arctic and subarctic ecosystems. The physiology of both mosses and cyanobacteria is strongly influenced by environmental factors such as temperature and moisture, which directly affect N2 fixation rates. These associations may be threatened by climate change, since it leads to warmer and drier conditions in polar regions. In this study, we investigated the N2-fixing microbial communities associated with two common feather mosses across a precipitation gradient in the subarctic tundra, followed by a temperature and moisture experiment. Using acetylene reduction assays, nifH gene sequencing and qPCR, we evaluated how shifts in temperature and moisture influence nitrogenase activity and N2-fixing community structure. Our results showed that N2 fixation was highest in sites with greater precipitation and increased with both temperature and moisture. Cyanobacteria dominated N2-fixing communities, but currently unclassified bacteria also seemed to play a significant role, particularly at high temperatures. The number of cyanobacterial nifH copies tended to decrease with temperature, while the relative abundance of unclassified bacteria increased. These findings suggest that the N2-fixing activity, abundance and diversity of cyanobacteria associated with feather mosses in the subarctic will decline under warmer and drier conditions, potentially leading to a shift in the composition of feather moss-associated microbial communities in a warmer Arctic, with potential consequences for N input into the ecosystem."
"The molecular interactions that underpin all cellular functions depend on molecular motion within three-dimensional environments. Large depth-of-field single-molecule localization microscopy (3D-SMLM) methods facilitate these measurements, but their increased optical complexity and bespoke post-processing pipelines can sacrifice important cellular context. Here we combine single-molecule light-field microscopy (SMLFM) with widefield Fourier light-field microscopy for correlative volumetric organelle imaging. The instantaneous acquisition of subcellular volumes improves the sensitivity of molecular organization and diffusion measurements through the rejection of non-specific localizations. We first demonstrate our approach by measuring the molecular organization of a nuclear-localized HaloTag protein relative to cell nuclei. Next, we characterize the molecular diffusion of the soluble protein, calreticulin, in the context of 1-antitrypsin deficiency, which revealed an increase in heterogeneous motion within endoplasmic reticulum inclusions."
"Mechanistic insight into biophysical perturbations caused by pathogenic missense mutations is highly valuable information for the rational design of therapeutics. For hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, multiple pathogenic mutations in the N-terminal domain of BRCA1 have been reported in patients. How exactly these mutations disrupt the catalytic activity of BRCA1, and thereby lead to oncogenesis, is unknown. Here, we posit that the mechanism of pathogenesis is tied to how binding of BARD1 activates BRCA1 for E3 ligase activity. We use atomistic molecular dynamics simulations and Markov state modeling to uncover how BARD1 selects for active conformational states of BRCA1. We show that the helix bundle, where BARD1 binds, is allosterically coupled to the E2 interface. Furthermore, we show that BARD1 selects for conformational states that are pre-organized for E3 activity. Lastly, we show that pathogenic mutations allosterically destabilize active states, whereas hyperactive mutations constitutively increase their likelihood. These results provide a concrete strategy supported by mechanistic insight for the design of restorative small molecules targeting BRCA1."
"Defining quantitative biochemical mechanisms of microtubule dynamics and regulation is a current challenge. Stu2/XMAP215-family polymerases use tubulin-binding TOG domains to catalyze microtubule growth, but how polymerase activity results from the number and tubulin-binding properties of TOGs is not understood. We tested whether an enzyme-like biochemical model for the unrelated actin polymerase Ena/VASP could be applied to quantitatively relate Stu2 microtubule polymerase activity to the number of its TOGs and the rate constants governing their interactions with tubulin. Stu2 activity displayed enzyme-like characteristics consistent with the biochemical model: Stu2 stimulated microtubule growth rates with hyperbolic dependence on tubulin concentration, and the amount of Stu2 on the microtubule end did not vary with tubulin concentration (microtubule growth rate). Complementary measurements of TOG:tubulin binding revealed high affinity (10 nM) and slow dissociation (0.03 s-1). The polymerase and binding measurements can be unified within the biochemical model: Stu2 operates with high efficiency, acting as a tubulin-shuttling antenna on the microtubule end that is primarily limited by the rate of tubulin:TOG association. Our work thus provides a quantitative biochemical mechanism for TOG-based polymerases. That unrelated microtubule and actin polymerases use the same enzyme-like mechanism provides an example of convergent evolution in the cytoskeleton."
"Mitochondria adapt their structure through fusion and fission, yet how their morphology and cristae architecture alter as cells differentiate remains unclear. The human placenta is an ideal model for studying mitochondrial diversity within a single tissue. As epithelial trophoblast cells of the placenta differentiate, their accompanying mitochondria morphologically and functionally transform. We used array tomography to characterise mitochondrial volume and network complexity. Cryo-electron tomography revealed two distinct subpopulations of mitochondria within progenitor cytotrophoblasts, and a singular, homogeneous population in the differentiated syncytiotrophoblast. We showcased the 3D topology of individual cristae through a standardised metric of ""curvedness"". Proteomic analysis of isolated mitochondria identified reduced dynamics proteins and cristae organisation complexes, accompanied by subunit variations within the electron transport chain, ATP synthase, and altered supercomplex abundance. This study highlights the advantages of combining multimodal imaging with mechanistic insights, to elucidate the process of mitochondrial morphology and cristae architecture remodelling as cells differentiate."
"Hedgehog (Hh) signaling is essential for embryonic development and tissue homeostasis in several organisms. However, Caenorhabditis elegans lacks canonical Hh signaling due to the absence of key components, such as smoothened (SMO) and Hh ligands. Despite this, C. elegans retains Patched homologs, ptc-1 and ptc-3, which have specialized independent functions. Although ptc-1 is predominantly expressed in the gonads and ptc-3 in somatic tissues, we demonstrate that both genes are required to maintain germ cell populations and proper actin cytoskeletal architecture in the progenitor zone of the germline. Disruption of actin-encoding genes impairs germ cell cycle progression and reduces germ cell numbers, indicating that cytoskeletal integrity is critical for maintaining the germline. Furthermore, defects observed upon loss of Patched function are linked to disruptions in cholesterol metabolism. We show that the phenotypes observed in the gonads due to the loss of Patched function can be rescued by modulating dietary cholesterol. Together, our findings reveal a role for Patched receptors in regulating germline architecture and germ cell development through cholesterol-sensitive functions, offering insights into how metabolic cues influence the organization of complex tissues."

"Mechanical coupling and chemical communication between cardiomyocytes are facilitated through a specialized adhesive structure known as the intercalated disc (ICD). The ICD is essential for heart organization and contraction. Yet, the network of adhesion, adaptor, and signaling proteins that form the ICD remains poorly defined. Here, we combined proximity labeling and quantitative mass spectrometry to identify proteins associated with the desmosomal cadherin, Desmoglein 2 (DSG2), in cultured neonatal cardiomyocytes. We identified over 300 proteins in the DSG2 interactome; half of which are shared with the N-cadherin (CDH2) interactome in cardiomyocytes. Proteins unique to DSG2 include the gap junction protein connexin 43 and the plakin family of cytolinker proteins. Comparison of the cardiomyocyte DSG2 interactome with the interactomes of desmosomal proteins from epithelia revealed only a small number of shared proteins. In cardiomyocytes, plakoglobin (JUP) and plakophilin 2 (PKP2) were the most abundant shared proteins between the DSG2 and CDH2 interactomes. PKP2 is a dynamic protein whose membrane recruitment in cardiomyocytes is tension-dependent. Our analysis of the DSG2 interactome provides a critical new dimension to the proteomic atlas of the essential molecular complexes required for cardiomyocyte adhesion."
"Acute binge-like third-trimester-equivalent alcohol exposure (TTAE) causes apoptosic neurodegeneration in brain regions necessary for spatial learning and memory, such as the anterior thalamus (AT), which encodes context-relevant information, including head direction. While we are beginning to understand the behavioral consequences of this exposure, the neural correlates of spatial cognition deficits are underexplored. Thus, we recorded a mixture of neurons from the AT and surrounding brain regions in mice with TTAE while they freely moved within a controlled environment. To model acute binge-like TTAE, C57BL/6J mice received 2 injections of 2.5 g/kg alcohol (or saline) on post-natal day (PND) 7. Subjects were then left undisturbed until the day of surgery as adults (>PND 60), when they were implanted with silicon or multi-wire arrays. Mice were placed in a circular 40 cm diameter arena under dim red light with 2 LED cues on the walls that rotated on a pseudo-random basis while electrophysiological data was recorded. Following data preprocessing, spike and waveform features were extracted from each putative single spiking unit. These features were reduced utilizing uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP). Following dimensionality reduction, we used agglomerative hierarchical clustering to find populations of neurons with similar features. Following this, we compared each feature based on treatment and found the features most important to disambiguate TTAEs impact on neural activity. TTAE was associated with decreases in mean firing rate, peak firing rate, rebound index, and tail decay constant, increases in alpha, peak to trough time, and repolarization time, and bidirectional differences as a function of neuronal subtype in burst index and rebound index. This suggests that TTAE produces long-lasting and fundamental differences in spiking features that can be observed in vivo and are amenable to intervention. Together, this dataset provides further clarifying criteria that can be utilized to diagnose and treat FASD."
"Background and PurposeRare but serious adverse events (AEs) associated with mRNA-lipid nanoparticle (LNP) COVID-19 vaccines, such as Comirnaty and Spikevax, include acute and chronic inflammatory reactions, the mechanisms of which remain poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate these effects using a porcine model.

Experimental ApproachNaive and anti-PEG antibody-sensitized pigs were intravenously injected with Comirnaty. Acute anaphylactic responses were assessed through hemodynamic monitoring, hematological changes, and plasma inflammatory markers. Multiorgan inflammatory effects were evaluated by qPCR detection of spike protein (SP) mRNA uptake and inflammatory cytokine gene expression in seven organs over 6 hours. Histopathology and immunohistochemistry were also performed.

Key ResultsSevere cardiopulmonary distress developed within minutes of repeated i.v. injections of Comirnaty. qPCR revealed predominant SP mRNA accumulation in liver and PBMCs, with spleen, kidney, lymph nodes, heart, and brain also affected in 40-90% of animals. Repetitive PBMC transfection showed reversible mRNA peaks at 15 minutes, followed by rapid decay. Expression of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1RA, CXCL10, TNF-, CCL2) paralleled mRNA uptake, suggesting a causal relationship. Cytokine profiles varied by organ (e.g. IL- 1RA in kidney, CCL2 in PBMCs). Histologic abnormalities and SP immunopositivity were noted in kidney, heart, and brain. Booster injections replicated PBMC transfection kinetics observed at first dose.

Conclusions and ImplicationsThis porcine model reveals systemic anaphylactic reactivity and multiorgan SP mRNA transfection following i.v. injection of mRNA-LNPs, resulting in organ-specific inflammatory responses. These findings provide mechanistic insights into the rare vaccine- related AEs and may support future efforts to improve the safety of the mRNA-LNP platform technology."
"During natural vision, people make saccades to efficiently sample visual information from complex scenes. However, a substantial body of evidence has shown impaired visual information processing around the time of a saccade. It remains unclear how saccades affect the processing of high-level visual attributes - such as semantic category information - which are essential for navigating dynamic environments and supporting complex behavioral goals. Here, we investigated whether/how the processing of semantic category information in naturalistic scenes is altered immediately after a saccade. Through both human behavioral and neuroimaging studies, we compared semantic category judgments (Experiments 1A and 1B) and neural representations (Experiment 2) for scene images presented at different time points following saccadic eye movements. In the behavioral experiments, we found a robust reduction in scene categorization accuracy when the scene image was presented within 50 ms after saccade completion. In the neuroimaging experiment, we examined neural correlates of semantic category information in the visual system using fMRI multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA). We found that scene category representations embedded in the neural activity patterns of the parahippocampal place area (PPA) were degraded for images presented with a short (0-100 ms) compared to a long post-saccadic delay (400-600 ms), despite no corresponding reduction in overall activation levels. Together, these findings reveal that post-saccadic disruption extends beyond basic visual features to high-level visual attributes of naturalistic scenes, highlighting a limitation of visual information processing in the short post-saccadic period before executing the next saccade.

Significance StatementDespite the seamless visual experience across saccadic eye movements, visual information processing is substantially impaired around the time of a saccade. While prior research has documented peri-saccadic disruptions in perception tasks involving basic visual features, it remains unclear whether impairments extend to high-level visual attributes in natural scenes (e.g., semantic category) that are essential for everyday behavior. Using complementary behavioral and neuroimaging approaches, we show that the processing of semantic category information is disrupted when a scene image is presented immediately after a saccade. These findings highlight a fundamental tradeoff in natural scene perception: while saccades serve a functional benefit by projecting relevant information onto the retinal region with the highest acuity, they can also incur brief consequences for perception."
"The neuropeptides arginine vasopressin (AVP) and oxytocin (OXT) are closely related. As neurohormones, AVP and OXT are mainly produced in magnocellular neurons (MCNs) located in the hypothalamus. Development of both neuron types requires coordinated expression of transcription factors OTP, SIM1, ARNT2 and POU3F2. However, the exact transcription factors involved in the diferential diferentiation of the AVP and OXT lineages are yet unknown. We used a publicly available single-cell RNA-sequencing dataset of the developing mouse hypothalamus to identify gene regulatory networks linked to AVP and OXT neuronal diferentiation. We identified RORA, EBF3, FOXP1, FOXP2, and BCL11B as transcription factors with possible relevance for Avp and Oxt MCN divergence. We then modeled developmental gene expression dynamics using computational cell fate mapping. This revealed enrichment of EBF3 and BCL11B in the Avp lineage, while FOXP1 and FOXP2 are enriched in the Oxt lineage. Next, in silico analysis of Avp and Oxt promoters found predicted binding sites for FOXP1 and FOXP2 in the Oxt promoter, suggesting a role in Oxt MCN diferentiation. Finally, we validated the role of one candidate (FOXP1) with a heterozygous knockout mouse line. Compared to wild-type littermates, we find decreased AVP and OXT neuron abundance, with OXT neurons disproportionally afected."
"AbstractBasal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs) densely innervate auditory cortex (ACtx), conveying signals linked to internal brain states and external sensory cues. Several studies have shown that acetylcholine (ACh) rapidly modifies local cortical circuits via nicotinic ACh receptors (nAChRs) on layer 1 (L1) inhibitory neurons. BFCN terminals are also abundant in L6, though the mechanisms and functional consequences of cholinergic modulation in deeper cortical layers has received less attention. Here, we performed multi-plex in situ labeling across cortical layers and cell types and found that L6 pyramidal neurons (L6-PNs) were highly enriched in diverse nAChR subunit and muscarinic ACh receptor (mAChR) transcripts. In vivo optogenetic activation of BFCN axons revealed persistent modulation of regular spiking (RS) units in L2-6 but a rapid phasic activation only in L6. In acute slices, optogenetic activation of BFCN axons elicited fast excitatory post-synaptic potentials via nAChRs in L6-PNs, comparable to responses in L1-INs, and slower inhibitory responses mediated by mAChRs. These findings identify L1 inhibitory neurons and L6 excitatory neurons as two hubs that mediate BFCN modulation of cortical circuits. Transcriptional, synaptic, and local circuit connectivity differences between L1 and L6 hubs may allow BFCN inputs to shape perception and plasticity on distinct timescales."
"Automaticity in decoding print is crucial for fluent reading. This process relies on associative memories between letters and speech sounds (LSS) that are overlearned through years of reading practice. While previous neuroimaging studies have identified neural correlates of LSS integration across different stages of reading development, the specific neural signatures underlying automatic LSS integration remain unclear. In the present study, we aimed to isolate neural components specifically associated with automatic LSS integration in literate adults. To this end, we developed an artificial script training paradigm in which adult native Finnish speakers were taught to associate unfamiliar foreign letters with familiar Finnish speech sounds. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG), we directly compared the audiovisual processing of newly learned and overlearned LSS associations within the same task, one day after training. Event-related fields (ERFs) and multivariate decoding revealed largely shared neural circuits of audiovisual integration for both types of LSS associations, as evidenced by multisensory interaction and congruency effects. Interestingly, the processing of congruent overlearned audiovisual associations uniquely recruited brain activity in the left parietal cortex during the 235-475 ms time window. Furthermore, temporal generalization analysis of the congruency effects revealed that while both newly learned and overlearned audiovisual associations engaged common neural mechanisms, the newly learned associations were processed systematically more slowly by a few hundred milliseconds. Our study identified the spatiotemporal neural signatures underlying automatized LSS processing, offering insights into neural markers that may help identify levels of reading proficiency."

"Neural crest induction begins early during neural plate formation, requiring precise transcriptional control to activate lineage-specific enhancers. Here, we demonstrate that SALL4, a transcription factor strongly expressed in cranial neural crest cells (CNCCs) and associated with syndromes featuring craniofacial anomalies, plays a critical role in this early regulatory process. Using a SALL4-haploinsufficient human iPSC model that recapitulates clinical haploinsufficiency, we show that the SALL4A isoform directly interacts with the BAF complex subunit DPF2 through its zinc-finger-3 domain. This interaction enables SALL4-mediated recruitment of BAF to CNCC-specific enhancers during early neural plate stages. Without functional SALL4, BAF fails to load at chromatin, leaving CNCC enhancers inaccessible despite normal neuroectodermal progression. Consequently, cells cannot undergo proper CNCC induction and specification due to persistent enhancer repression. Our findings reveal SALL4 as an essential regulator of BAF-dependent enhancer activation during early neural crest development, providing molecular insights into SALL4-associated craniofacial anomalies."

"Cis-regulatory elements (CREs), such as enhancers and promoters, control gene expression by binding regulatory proteins. In contrast to their bacterial counterparts, eukaryotic CREs typically bind transcription factors with short recognition motifs across multiple functional yet often weak binding sites. The evolutionary origin of this genetic architecture remains unclear. Here we study adaptive evolution of entire CREs under selection for controllable gene expression. In a biophysical toy model that recapitulates the essential non-linearities of eukaryotic regulation, a regulatory phenotype requires a gene to be active when its CRE binds cognate TFs, yet inactive in the presence of noncognate TFs that can cause deleterious crosstalk. We explore CRE evolutionary outcomes utilizing ""optimize-to-adapt"" approach suggested by the theory presented in a companion paper. In this approach, CRE evolution is simulated explicitly at the sequence level, while the parameters of the biophysical model itself - i.e., the properties of the replicated genotype-phenotype map - are numerically optimized for evolvability of CREs. In the optimal regime, selection navigates the tradeoff between slowly evolving strong and long binding sites (which guarantee low crosstalk), and rapidly evolving multiple short and weak binding sites (which necessitate diffuse selection against too much noncognate binding across the entire CRE). When we further explore various scenarios for cooperative regulation, we find that the optimal regime predicts a diversity of strong and weak, yet always short, binding sites and favors ""synergistic activation"" of transcription, as reported empirically for eukaryotes. These results showcase how information theory can link evolutionary dynamics with biophysical constraints to rationalize - and possibly even predict - optimal regulatory architectures."
"Evolution of gene regulatory sequences is shaped by their genotype-phenotype (GP) map, but this map itself can evolve via changes in the molecular machinery that reads out the regulatory sequences. Using population genetics theory, we derive an optimality principle, implying that the evolved GP maps will associate fit phenotypes with larger numbers of possible genotypes. Mathematically, this builds on analogies between population genetics and statistical physics, as well as optimal coding in information theory. The results are particularly interesting in the context of transcriptional regulation, where optimal values of certain parameters that determine the gene regulatory architecture can be derived even without a complete knowledge of the molecular mechanisms involved. We illustrate the theory using a simplified model of transcription factor (TF) binding to cis-regulatory elements (CREs): the fraction of possible CREs across the entire genotype space that bind a given TF evolves to match the fraction of CREs under selection to bind that TF. Similar ""frequency matching"" results are expected to emerge generically, because selection implicitly optimizes the entire regulatory architecture that determines the ""replicated GP map"" for all CREs, while it simultaneously adapts towards individually fit CREs on that GP map. We discuss the subtleties and limitations of the theory related to biophysical constraints and the need for mutational robustness. Lastly, our theory suggests a possible mathematical definition for evolvability with predictive power that can be tested in evolutionary simulations and, ultimately, in comparative genetics studies."
"BackgroundImmunotherapies achieved remarkable success in adult cancers, yet their efficacy in pediatric brain and solid tumors remains limited. Insights into the unique immune landscape of pediatric tumors are crucial to improve immunotherapies for pediatric patients.

MethodsWe performed a systematic search for studies reporting immunohistochemistry (IHC), single-cell- or single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (sc/snSeq) data on the immune landscape of pediatric tumors. For IHC studies, data on macrophages, T cells, T helper cells, regulatory T cells, NK cells and B cells were extracted. For sc/snSeq studies, cell cluster counts were extracted. 47 IHC studies and 26 sc/snSeq studies were included in the analysis.

ResultsOur integrative in-depth analysis of 73 studies covered 35 unique pediatric tumor types with 17 tumor types analyzed by IHC, 4 by sc/snSeq, and 14 by both techniques. Regardless of variability in analysis methods, both IHC and sc/snSeq showed that peripheral nerve tumors and soft tissue sarcomas had relatively immune-infiltrated, T cell-rich tumor microenvironments (TME). Brain tumors exhibited a macrophage/microglia-rich, NK cell- infiltrated and T cell-depleted TME. Sc/snSeq data confirmed these observations, showing a macrophage/microglia-rich brain TME. Compared to adult tumors, (CD8+) T cell infiltration and macrophage infiltration was low for all pediatric tumor types. Integrated IHC and sc/snSeq data were visualized in interactive heatmaps, publicly available on R2 as a comprehensive atlas [https://hgserver1.amc.nl/cgi-bin/r2/main.cgi?option=imi2_targetmap_v1; map Immune_landscape_mm2(by patient)_v4].

ConclusionWe provide a comprehensive, integrated overview of the immune landscape of pediatric brain and solid tumors. These insights can aid the development and selection of immunotherapeutic strategies for specific pediatric cancers, tailored to their unique immune characteristics."
"To date only four of nine shark orders have nuclear reference genomes, despite next-generation sequencing advances. Particularly for threatened shark species, there is a lack of reliable genomes which are crucial in facilitating research and conservation applications. We assembled the first nuclear reference genome of the endangered grey reef shark (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos) using long-read PacBio HiFi and Omni-C sequencing to reach chromosome-level contiguity (36 pseudo chromosomes; 2.9 Gbp) and high completeness (94% complete BUSCOs). BRAKER3 annotated 16,522 protein-coding genes after masking repetitive elements which accounted for 59% of the genome. We identified potential X and Y sex chromosomes on pseudo chromosomes 36 and 57, respectively. The quality and completeness of the draft genome of C. amblyrhynchos suggest that it has the potential to facilitate comprehensive comparative genomics, enabling researchers to investigate genetic variations and adaptations specific to this population and will help advance conservation genetic applications.

Significance StatementStemming from an ancient vertebrate lineage, sharks present an interesting evolutionary study system. A third of shark species face extinction, yet critical genomic resources necessary for research and conservation remain scarce. To address this gap, we assembled and annotated the first chromosome-level nuclear reference genome of the threatened grey reef shark (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos) at high completeness. This genome will help advance studies in evolution, phylogenetics, adaptation, and conservation, offering insights not only for this species but for wider elasmobranch and vertebrate research."
"In previous research, sperm whale codas (structured series of clicks used for communication) have been shown to resemble human vowels acoustically. Based on the number of formants, two different coda quality categories have been described: a-codas and i-codas. In the present paper, we demonstrate that sperm whale codas not only resemble human vowels acoustically, but also pattern like them across several dimensions. First, traditional count- and timing-based coda types interact with coda ""vowel"" quality (a vs. i). Second, a-codas are generally longer than i-codas. Third, the duration of i-codas has a bimodal distribution, showing a contrast between short i-codas and long[i] -codas. Fourth, the baseline coda length differs across whales. And fifth, edge clicks mismatching their coda often match an adjacent coda, a phenomenon that resembles human coarticulation. All five properties have close parallels in the phonetics and phonology of human languages. Sperm whale coda vocalizations thus represent one of the closest parallels to human phonology of any known animal communication system.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTSperm whales communicate using series of clicks known as codas. The codas acoustically resemble human vowels. In addition, they pattern in ways similar to human sound systems. For example, different coda types are correlated with particular click qualities, and their durations are intentionally controlled. This shows that sperm whale vocalizations are highly complex and likely constitute one of the most sophisticated communication systems in the animal kingdom. By studying it, we may be able to gain a broader understanding of animal intelligence and social behaviors, determine the impact of human activities on whale habitat, develop strategies to protect whales from threats such as noise pollution and ship traffic, and advance legislation which facilitates that protection."
"Shotgun metagenomics enables comprehensive analysis of microbial communities by classifying sequencing reads directly from environmental samples, yet interpreting the resulting taxonomic classification reports-- especially those generated by tools like Kraken2--remains a challenge due to their hierarchical, text-based format. Existing visualization tools such as Krona and Pavian either rely on web infrastructure or provide limited interactivity and flexibility for comparative analysis. To address this gap, we developed TaxonReportViewer (TRV), an open-source, cross-platform software with a graphical user interface that facilitates the exploration, comparison, and visualization of Kraken2 classification outputs. Implemented in Python 3, TRV includes a robust parser capable of accurately reconstructing taxonomic hierarchies even from inconsistently formatted reports. The tool offers dynamic search and filtering of taxa, exportable abundance matrices, one-click generation of comparative bar charts and heatmaps, and direct links to the NCBI Taxonomy database. TRV supports analysis of multiple samples in parallel, allowing users to identify taxonomic patterns across conditions without requiring programming skills. Its visualization features enable immediate recognition of taxon-specific abundance shifts and clustering of samples by taxonomic profile. Tested on a range of Kraken2 reports, TRV demonstrated consistent performance, rapid search capabilities, and accurate representation of lineage structures. It operates efficiently on standard consumer hardware and requires no installation beyond Python, ensuring accessibility for researchers in diverse computational environments. TaxonReportViewer fills a critical niche between raw taxonomic classification and biological interpretation, empowering researchers to derive meaningful insights from complex metagenomic datasets with ease."
"Gastric ulcers are due to an imbalance between the protective factors like mucus and bicarbonate and offensive factors like gastric hydrochloric acid, infection and pepsin, on the other hand and medicines like ibuprofen. Despite the available conventional therapy, the mortality rate due to gastric ulcers across the globe is 11% with a range of 3-23%. Capsicum frutescens (C. frutescens) fruit which is consumed in most communities as a spice has a number of pharmacological benefits which include being an anti-ulcer, antimicrobial, anti-diabetic and anticancer activity, among other uses. This study was therefore carried out to determine the effect of the ethanol fruit extract of Capsicum frutescens on the gastric acid production determinants in ibuprofen induced gastric ulcers in Wistar rats.

Fifteen male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to five groups of three rats each. Group one (control) received normal saline, Other groups received ibuprofen for five days followed by normal saline, or misoprostolR, or Capsicum frutescens (107.5mg/kg body weight) for fourteen days. Ulcer index, H+/K+ ATPase enzyme activity, gastrin secretion and parietal cell histology were determined.

Oral administration of Ibuprofen induced gastric ulcers. Capsicum frutescens reduced the ulcer index. The H+/K+ ATPase enzyme activity was significantly decreased (p < 0.01) as well as concentration of gastrin (p < 0.01) and significant (p < 0.01) decrease in the mean number of parietal cells.

It is concluded that Capsicum frutescens has a therapeutic property for ulcer healing and does this through reduction of; H+/K+ ATPase enzyme activity, gastrin release and number of parietal cells in the stomach."
"Antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) is essential for mitigating antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in animal health but implementing national initiatives is challenging due to diverse influencing factors and the need for context-specific approaches. An Animal AMS Practice Group, comprised of individuals with lived experience overseeing AMS in various animal health contexts was engaged, and through an experience-based co-design approach created a comprehensive AMS Framework that captures progress and supports tangible improvements in AMS practices in each context. The Framework supported a cross-sectoral pilot assessment that helped users identify progress, areas for improvement, and contextualise antimicrobial usage and AMR data, while also motivating further AMS efforts. Despite common barriers to sharing sensitive data, participants willingly shared AMS results for benchmarking and publication. The process demonstrated that co-design coupled with peer learning and expert support are essential to ensuring AMS tools are utilised in practice. Several participants incorporated the Framework into routine practice, with some using it to drive sector-level AMS action. The resulting Framework offers an adaptable, scalable entry point for AMS efforts and a platform for setting meaningful improvement goals. It supports broader opportunities for national-level AMS assessments and strategy development.

Impact StatementThis research offers a practical, scalable approach to improving AMS in animal health. By embedding behaviour change into the project through an experience-based co-design process, rather than expecting it to occur afterward, veterinarians, animal managers, and other frontline professionals defined what good AMS looks like in their context and identified achievable actions to improve daily practices that aligned across diverse animal health settings.

The resulting AMS Framework provides a clear, accessible starting point for those overseeing daily AMS activities to benchmark practices, set meaningful goals, and track progress, while also informing national-level prioritisation and decision-making. This user-led model demonstrates that when AMS tools are co-developed with those who will use them and users are empowered to shape the projects design and outputs, the resulting tools are more likely to be adopted, shared, and sustained."
"Farmer field schools (FFSs) are transformative, participatory approaches to adult agricultural education that effectively promote farmers learning and capacity building and empower farming communities with practical knowledge. Here, we present a case study of FFS in the Katete district, Eastern province of Zambia, focused on good pigeon pea agronomic practices and the value chain. Three FFSs were established, focusing on a variety of trials, bio-pesticides, and a pigeon pea-specific rhizobial inoculant. Extreme weather conditions, an underdeveloped pigeon pea seed value chain, and a poor seed system hindered the implementation of the FFSs. To strengthen the pigeon pea seed value chain, a seed dehuller is now available to farmers. Our results highlight the importance of the design, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of the FFSs. Pigeon pea FFSs will support crop and food diversification, improve soil fertility and sustainable agriculture, and may increase household income."
"Visual search, the act of locating a target among distractors, is a fundamental cognitive behavior and a core paradigm for studying visual attention. While its behavioral properties are well characterized in humans and non-human primates, the underlying neural mechanisms remain largely unspecified. To address this gap, we developed a biologically aligned neural network model trained to perform visual search directly from pixels in natural scenes. This model exhibits strong generalization to novel scenes and objects, produces human-like scanpaths, and replicates previously known behavioral biases in humans. By analyzing the models internal representations, we found that it naturally develops a retinocentric cue-similarity map and prospective fixation signals-features that closely resemble neural activity in the primate fronto-parietal network. Beyond reproducing known behavior and neural signatures, the model makes testable predictions about the geometry and dynamics of internal representations underpinning cue-driven prioritization, fixation preferences, their perspective memories, and prospective plans. These findings offer a computational framework for understanding visual search and a roadmap for future neurophysiological and behavioral studies."
"Glucocorticoids play a crucial role in the stress response and in the regulation of circadian function, as well as cognitive, cardiovascular, metabolic and immunological processes. While synthetic glucocorticoids (sGC) are widely used in treating inflammatory disorders, their impact on cognitive functions, which include memory deficits and dysregulation of mood, remains less understood. Here, we demonstrate that chronic treatment with the sGC methylprednisolone (MPL) dysregulates the synaptic proteome and impairs cognitive function in the perirhinal cortex, a region critical for recognition memory and visual perception. Further, we show that synaptic structure and plasticity are altered by MPL treatment, highlighting the mechanisms through which sGCs disrupt mnemonic processing. These results may have broad implications for understanding the cognitive side effects of widely used sGC treatments."
"The relationship between motor intention and initiation of voluntary movement remains a fundamental topic in neuroscience, originating from the B. Libet seminal framework introduced in 1983. Libets paradigm significantly influenced discussions on intentionality, motor control, and free will. However, methodological critiques continue to challenge its interpretations, specifically the accuracy and validity of the  urge to move phenomenon. One understudied factor in this debate is the potential influence of interoceptive signals--particularly cardiac activity--in shaping the experience of motor intention and movement initiation.

In our study, we addressed this gap by examining whether cardiac signals modulate participants experience of the  urge to move, using behavioural and electrophysiological measures in 34 healthy human participants performing Libets task. Crucially, when participants were asked to report the perceived  urge to move, their button press timings were predominantly aligned with the diastolic phase of the cardiac cycle, indicating cardiac modulation of motor intention perception. However, analysing heart evoked potential (HEP) amplitudes as a measure of cardiac input perception, we observed no differences in HEP amplitudes associated with changes in introspective demands during the task in both source and sensor spaces.

Our results suggest that implicit perception of cardiac signals biases subjective experience of voluntary action initiation, independent from cortical interoceptive markers. These findings have implications for models of motor preparation, intentionality and the bodily basis of voluntary action, challenging conventional interpretations of motor intention and informing debates on volition and interoception.

Significance StatementOur study provides evidence that implicit perception of cardiac signals influences the subjective experience of motor intention--the  urge to move in Libets experiment. We demonstrate, for the first time, that when reporting  urge to move, participants tended to initiate voluntary movements during the diastolic phase of the cardiac cycle. These findings challenge traditional views on factors affecting motor initiation, suggesting relevance of interoceptive processing. By highlighting the role of cardiac input in experiencing motor intention, our findings impact existing debates on volition, agency and free will, further underscoring the importance of integrating bodily signals into these theoretical frameworks."
"-synuclein is a pre-synaptic protein1,2 implicated in synucleinopathies like Parkinsons disease and Dementia with Lewy Bodies, where it accumulates in intracellular aggregates termed Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites3. Recent studies have reported that -synuclein undergoes phase separation to form biomolecular condensates both in vitro and in mammalian cells4-7. -synuclein condensates are thought to contribute to disease through progressive aggregation5,8,9. Here we show that specific PD-associated -synuclein variants fail to form biomolecular condensates. We demonstrate that only two -synuclein variants associated with familial disease, E46K and E83Q, enhance condensate formation in vitro and in cells. However, variants including A30G, G51D, and A53E fail to form or have reduced levels of condensate formation in cells. The same phenotypes are reflected in the budding yeast model showing differential inclusion formation. In iPSC-derived neurons, the propensity of -synuclein variants to undergo VAMP2-mediated phase separation reflects the level of synaptic enrichment. We show that the intrinsic propensity of -synuclein to form condensates and the ability to bind lipid membranes are important to mediate condensate formation in cells. Our results emphasize that -synuclein pathology follows divergent pathways, with both increased and decreased condensate formation contributing to disease. This study establishes biomolecular condensates as a key intermediate in -synuclein dysfunction, providing a novel foundation for translational research."
"Spinal motoneurons are the final output of spinal circuits that engage skeletal muscles to generate motor behaviors. Many motoneurons exhibit bistable behavior, alternating between a quiescent resting state and a self-sustained firing mode. This bistability is traditionally attributed to plateau potentials, which are driven by persistent inward currents. This intrinsic property is important for normal movement control, but can become dysregulated, causing motor control deficits, like spasticity. Here, we use a conductance-based single-compartment model to investigate the ionic conductances underlying the bistable behaviour of motoneurons. Our simulations demonstrate that the motoneuron bistability and how its emergence is regulated mainly depends on the interplay between several intrinsic ionic mechanisms. In particular, the calcium-activated nonspecific cation current (ICAN), which is amplified by ICaL and calcium-induced calcium release (CICR), primarily drives the plateau potential to sustain bistability. Additional modulation is provided by the persistent sodium current (INaP) and the calcium-dependent potassium current (IKCa). This study provides a mechanistic model of motoneuron bistability, offering insights into its disruption in pathological conditions and setting the stage for future research and therapeutic development."
"Bacteria use gene regulation to dynamically adapt to changes in their environment, including resistance to stress and the occupation of new niches. Gene expression is known to vary within a species pangenome, but the extent to which these changes could be explained by genetic variants in cis non-coding regions has so far been poorly investigated. Statistical genetics offers a hypothesis-free approach to this problem, as opposed to mechanistic models, which can be used only for reference isolates that are not representative of the whole species. In this study, we assembled two genomic and transcriptomic datasets for Escherichia coli (N=117) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (N=413) and identified associations between genetic variants in cis non-coding regions and recorded gene expression variation. We identified at least one associated variant in up to 39% of the tested genes in both species. We partly validated the associations in-silico and in-vitro for E. coli, reinforcing the difficulty of identifying a single mechanism generating gene expression diversity. We then investigated the relevance of non-coding variants in explaining the variability in antimicrobial resistance in both species using two additional publicly available datasets, identifying a large number of these variants across antimicrobial compounds. This work confirms the role of genetic variation in often overlooked regions of bacterial genomes in influencing molecular and clinically relevant phenotypes."
"Ascomycetous yeasts belong to Saccharomycotina and Taphrinomycotina, with about 1,200 described species distributed worldwide. More than 300 ascomycetous yeast species have been reported from China, which indicates that China possesses a hotspot with high yeast diversity. However, our knowledge of yeast diversity and distribution remains limited, and this area needs to be explored in depth. Here we describe 77 new ascomycetous yeast species with 195 isolates obtained over the past two decades during the continuous yeast diversity surveys in China, based on the phylogenetic analyses of the sequences of D1/D2 domains of the large subunit (LSU) and the internal transcribed spacer region including the 5.8S rDNA (ITS) of the nuclear ribosomal DNA (rDNA). The average nucleotide identity (ANI) analysis was used to delimitate closely related species with low sequence heterogeneity in the ITS and D1/D2 regions. Seventy-five of these new species belong to 35 genera in the Saccharaomycotina, while the other two are distributed in Taphrina of the Taphrinomycotina. In addition, we propose two new genera, namely Gaboromyces gen. nov. and Yurkovozyma gen. nov."
"In gram-negative bacteria, the outer membrane (OM) acts in conjunction with the peptidoglycan (PG) cell wall as a barrier against physical, osmotic, and toxic environmental stresses including antibiotics. SanA, an inner membrane protein in Escherichia coli K-12, is required for vancomycin resistance at high temperatures (>42 {degrees}C) and we have previously demonstrated that SanA impacts sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) resistance during stationary phase reached from carbon limitation. However, its function remains unknown. Here, we show that {Delta}sanA has a synthetic genetic interaction with {Delta}wecA, a mutation increasing the availability of the isoprenoid carrier for PG biosynthesis. Specifically, the {Delta}sanA {Delta}wecA strain demonstrated heightened SDS EDTA sensitivity, Rcs stress response activation, and increased cell length. Further investigation tied the SDS EDTA sensitivity to increased Lipid II available for PG synthesis. Spontaneous suppressor mutants of this phenotype harbored point mutations in prc which encodes tail specific protease or ftsI which encodes the cell division DD-transpeptidase, a target of Prc. Given Prcs role in FtsI maturation, we focused on the ftsI mutations and determined these mutations caused a partial loss of function in FtsI, with at least one of these mutations also increasing FtsW activity. Moreover, we found that other mutations which reduce septal PG synthesis, but not divisome assembly, also suppressed the SDS EDTA sensitivity. Together, these findings demonstrates that, in the absence of SanA, increased Lipid II availability perturbs the balance between FtsI and FtsW function leading to increased OM permeability.

IMPORTANCEThe gram-negative cell envelope is a barrier that protects the cell from environmental stress and the synthesis of each layer of this envelope needs to be carefully coordinated throughout growth and division. Here, we investigated the function of a protein in Escherichia coli K-12, SanA, that affects envelope permeability in conditions of cellular stress, including nutrient limitation and growth at high temperature. We found SanA is important for envelope permeability when higher levels of the precursor for peptidoglycan cell wall synthesis are expected, and that the permeability is linked to an imbalance in septal peptidoglycan synthesis during cell division. Overall, our results show that excess availability of substrate for septal peptidoglycan synthesis can impede proper septum synthesis leading to envelope permeability and that SanA modulates the substrate availability to maintain the envelope permeability barrier."
"Biogas is a renewable energy source with great potential, but its production is frequently hindered by process disturbances, of which a high ammonia concentration is one common cause. It is desirable that such disturbances are found as early as possible, and metagenomics data has the potential to improve this detection. This study compares functional and taxonomic aspects of metagenomics data, hypothesizing that functional data will perform better for detecting ammonia disturbances. The hypothesis was tested by metagenomic sequencing of samples from three independent studies, which followed lab-scale reactors during ammonia disturbances. The resulting sequences were used to predict protein-coding genes, which were functionally and taxonomically annotated. The read counts of these features were fitted to disturbance states and ammonia concentrations of reactor samples using regularized regression, which allowed filtering out irrelevant features even when the number of features was much larger than the number of samples. Taxonomic data had similar or better performance in detecting ammonia disturbances and in fitting ammonia concentrations, both when analyzing separate studies as well as when analyzing the combined data of the studies. Our hypothesis that functional metagenomics would outperform taxonomic metagenomics was therefore not supported.

"The uncultured WOR-3 phylum is widely distributed in anaerobic environments, including hot springs, marine ecosystems, and hydrothermal vents, yet its ecological roles and metabolic capabilities remain poorly understood. In this study, we analyzed 180 medium- to high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), including 59 newly reconstructed from environmental samples and 121 retrieved from the Genome Taxonomy Database (GTDB). Phylogenetic analyses resolved the WOR-3 lineage into four subgroups (subgroup 1-4). Metabolic reconstruction revealed significant divergence of the carbon, sulfur, nitrogen and hydrogen metabolism pathways among the different subgroups. Subgroup 1 was characterized by fermentative metabolism involving formate and ethanol, and uniquely exhibited potential for carbon fixation via Calvin cycle, as indicated by the presence of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) gene. Notably, WOR-3 RuBisCO is phylogenetically affiliated with archaeal form III, although the carbon fixation pathway follows the canonical bacterial Calvin cycle--a feature of potential evolutionary significance. Subgroup 3 exhibits metabolic versatility, including genes for dissimilatory sulfate reduction, sulfur oxidation, partial denitrification, and fatty acid degradation. In addition, all subgroups harbored key components of hydrogen metabolism, including widespread NiFe hydrogenases and Rnf complexes, supporting H2-dependent electron transfer and energy conservation under anaerobic conditions. Featuring near-universal presence of complexes I and II and frequent occurrence of terminal oxidases (cydAB and coxABC)--suggests a facultative anaerobic lifestyle. Collectively, this study expands the genomic framework for the WOR-3 phylum and provides novel insights into the metabolic versatility and ecological functions of this previously uncharacterized lineage in biogeochemical cycles of carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur.

IMPORTANCEThe WOR-3 phylum represents a widespread but poorly understood bacterial lineage inhabiting diverse anaerobic/microaerobic environments. By integrating 180 metagenome-assembled genomes, including 59 newly reconstructed, this study provides the most comprehensive genomic framework to date for WOR-3. Phylogenomic and metabolic analyses revealed four distinct subgroups with divergent capacities for carbon, sulfur, and nitrogen metabolism. Notably, subgroup 1 encodes a complete Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle featuring an archaeal-type form III RuBisCO, suggesting an unusual evolutionary trajectory for carbon fixation in this lineage. Subgroup 3 exhibits versatile metabolic potential, including dissimilatory sulfur metabolism, partial denitrification, and fatty acid degradation, highlighting its possible roles in multiple biogeochemical processes. The widespread presence of hydrogenases and respiratory complexes across all subgroups supports energy conservation under anaerobic or microaerobic conditions. These findings not only expand the taxonomic and functional landscape of the WOR-3 phylum but also offer key insights into its ecological roles in global element cycling."
"Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) is the primary cause of urinary tract infections (UTI). To establish an infection, UPEC must evade infiltrating neutrophils and their antimicrobial neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). In this study, we identify a previously uncharacterized two-gene regulatory system within the pathogenicity island PAIUTI89II, which we named DanRI (Defense against neutrophil Regulator and Inhibitor). DanRI is induced by nucleosomes present in NETs and enables UPEC to suppress neutrophil responses by attenuating reactive oxygen species production and NET formation. Mechanistically, DanI functions as an antagonist to the transcriptional regulator DanR, thereby modulating key bacterial processes, including metabolic processes, flagellar biosynthesis, and stress response pathways. DanRI is required for UPEC fitness and long-term persistence in a mouse model of UTI. Taken together, our findings reveal DanRI as a novel regulatory system that promotes UPEC pathogenesis through immune evasion.

"Mammals regulate the localization, composition, and activity of their native microbiota at colonization sites. Lectins residing at these sites influence microbial populations, but their individual functions are often unclear. Intelectins are found in chordates at mucosal barriers, but their functions are not well characterized. We found that mouse intelectin-2 (mItln2) and human intelectin-2 (hItln2) engage and crosslink mucins via carbohydrate recognition. Moreover, both lectins recognize microbes within native microbial communities, including gram-positive and gram-negative isolates from the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. This ability to engage mammalian and microbial glycans arises from calcium-coordinated binding of carbohydrate residues within mucus and microbial surfaces. Microbes, but not human cells, bound by mItln2 or hItln2, suffer a loss of viability. These findings underscore the crucial antimicrobial role of mammalian intelectin-2 in mucosal defense, where it plays offensive (microbial killing) and defensive (mucus crosslinking) roles in regulating microbial colonization."
"AbstractMicrobial rhodopsins are light-sensitive proteins vital to various phototrophic and sensory processes in microorganisms. Xanthorhodopsins, with their dual chromophore system involving retinal and carotenoids, have been predominantly studied in the extreme halophilic bacterium Salinibacter ruber and in the primitive thylakoid-less cyanobacterium Gloeobacter violaceus, where they facilitate light- driven outward proton pumping and enhanced light-harvesting. However, their distribution, binding specificity, and ecological significance in cyanobacteria remain poorly understood. Here we report widespread xanthorhodopsin genes in cyanobacterial genomes and characterize a protein from an Antarctic filamentous cyanobacterium that uniquely binds hydroxylated lutein. Through bioinformatics, spectroscopic, functional and structural assays analyses, we determine the properties and ecological role of this cyanobacterial xanthorhodopsin. Our findings highlight xanthorhodopsins role in modulating light-harvesting efficiency in cyanobacteria, particularly in extreme environments. The lutein binding and associated structural changes likely provide selective advantages for adapting to polar light conditions, contributing to cyanobacterial survival in harsh habitats."
"To form a dormant spore, Bacillus subtilis and related endospore-forming bacteria divide asymmetrically to generate daughter cells of unequal size, the smaller of which becomes the spore. The transmembrane protein SpoIIE repositions the cell division machinery and controls cytokinesis during sporulation, but the molecular basis for the precise placement of the asymmetrical division site to the quarter cell point is unknown. Here, we applied live-cell fluorescence microscopy techniques to reveal that SpoIIE localizes with the treadmilling components of the cell division machinery. We found that SpoIIE opposes the inhibitory activity of the MinCD complex, which prevents assembly of Z-rings near the cell poles. Cells expressing a variant of SpoIIE with its transmembrane region replaced by an unrelated transmembrane anchor assembled condensed Z-rings that were unable to initiate constriction. This reveals a new function of SpoIIE and a possible checkpoint licensing cytokinesis downstream of Z-ring condensation. Potentially explaining the role of SpoIIE in cytokinesis, we demonstrated that SpoIIEs transmembrane region interacts with DivIB, an enigmatic structural component of the cell wall synthesis complex required for cytokinesis during sporulation. Finally, we found that FtsZ filaments are unusually short during sporulation, which requires the transmembrane domain of SpoIIE. Together, these results demonstrate that SpoIIE sequentially influences polar divisome assembly at distinct steps to drive asymmetric cell division."
"AbstractsSalmonella is an intracellular pathogen that resides within a vacuole, which protects it from cytosolic host defenses at the expense of limited nutrient access. Glucose serves as a critical carbon source supporting Salmonellas intracellular replication. However, the molecular mechanisms driving glucose enhancement and the pathways by which cytosolic glucose becomes accessible to intravacuolar Salmonella remain poorly understood. Here, we elucidate a sophisticated three-pronged strategy through which Salmonella hijacks GLUT1 to co-opt host glucose metabolism for pathogenic advantage. Firstly, Salmonella infection upregulates the glucose transporter GLUT1 by activating the MAPK signaling cascade, enhancing host glucose uptake, and accelerating glycolytic flux. Secondly, Salmonella redirects GLUT1 to the bacterial vacuolar membrane to establish a glucose-import conduit that facilitates bacterial acquisition of cytosolic glucose. Thirdly, K29-linked ubiquitination modifications on bacterial vacuolar membranes are a previously unrecognized regulatory mechanism that potentiates GLUT1 transporter activity. Inhibition of GLUT1 potentiates Salmonella-triggered innate immune responses and attenuates bacterial virulence in vitro (RAW264.7 macrophages) and in vivo (murine infection model). Collectively, these findings delineate a novel paradigm of metabolic hijacking, wherein Salmonella systematically rewires host glucose metabolic networks to support intracellular proliferation, providing new insights into host-directed antimicrobial interventions."
"YTH domain-containing family (YTHDF1/2/3) recognizes m6A modified mRNAs and regulates their stability, translation and function. We found loss of Ythdf3 in mice caused cardiac hypotrophy, myopathy, and intellectual abnormalities, resembling the clinical features of a rare inherited X-linked disorder Danon disease (DD). Mechanistically, this was attributable to the compromised mRNA decay of sex-determining region Y (SRY)-box 9 (Sox9), mediated by YTHDF3 m6A reader function. Targeted therapy with AAV-shRNA against Sox9 ameliorated fibrosis, increased neuron number, and significantly improved heart and brain function in Ythdf3-/- mice. Our data reveal that loss of murine Ythdf3 recapitulates systemic DD-like features, attributable to impaired Sox9 decay, and highlight a novel therapeutic target for DD."
"The use of insecticides and antimalarial drugs has been crucial in reducing the mortality and morbidity associated with malaria. However, since 2015, several challenges, including the development of resistance to these insecticides and treatments and changes in mosquito behaviour, have hindered the progress in fighting the disease. As a result, there is a pressing need for new tools to control malaria, including the potential use of genetically modified mosquitoes (GMMs) in the field. Various genetic strategies for vector control are currently being explored, ranging from self-sustaining GMMs with unrestricted geographic and temporal spread to self-limiting alternatives. Here, we propose a self-limiting gene drive strategy called Male Drive Female Sterile (MDFS) targeting Anopheles gambiae, a major malaria vector. The MDFS genetic construct causes dominant sterility in females, while transgenic males remain fertile, allowing them to transmit the female sterility trait at super-Mendelian rates. Laboratory studies have shown that repeated releases of MDFS can lead to the elimination of caged mosquito populations. Based on these findings, modelling suggests that MDFS could be a highly effective and self-limiting strategy for suppressing wild malaria mosquito populations."
"Bacterial transcription initiation is a tightly regulated process that canonically relies on sequence-specific promoter recognition by dedicated sigma ({sigma}) factors, leading to functional DNA engagement by RNA polymerase (RNAP)1. Although the seven {sigma} factors in E. coli have been extensively characterized2, Bacteroidetes species encode dozens of specialized, extracytoplasmic function {sigma} factors ({sigma}E) whose precise roles are unknown, pointing to additional layers of regulatory potential3. Here we uncover an unprecedented mechanism of RNA-guided gene activation involving the coordinated action of {sigma}E factor in complex with nuclease-dead Cas12f (dCas12f). We screened a large set of genetically-linked dCas12f and {sigma}E homologs in E. coli using RIP-seq and ChIP-seq experiments, revealing systems that exhibited robust guide RNA enrichment and DNA target binding with a minimal 5'-G target-adjacent motif (TAM). Recruitment of {sigma}E was dependent on dCas12f and guide RNA (gRNA), suggesting direct protein-protein interactions, and co-expression experiments demonstrated that the dCas12f-gRNA-{sigma}E ternary complex was competent for programmable recruitment of the RNAP holoenzyme. Remarkably, dCas12f-RNA-{sigma}E complexes drove potent gene expression in the absence of any requisite promoter motifs, with de novo transcription start sites defined exclusively by the relative distance from the dCas12f-mediated R-loop. Our findings highlight a new paradigm of RNA-guided transcription (RGT) that embodies natural features reminiscent of CRISPRa technology developed by humans4,5."
"APOBEC3A is a cytidine deaminase that plays a crucial role in innate immunity; however, it can also drive oncogenesis when dysregulated. While its DNA editing activity is well-studied, the impact of APOBEC3A on RNA has only recently gained attention. Previous studies revealed that APOBEC3A deaminates mRNA stem-loop structures, however, its activity on other RNA classes remains unexplored. Given its likely evolutionary origin from tRNA adenosine deaminases and the prevalence of stem-loop structures in tRNA, we investigated APOBEC3As activity on tRNAs. We found that in vitro APOBEC3A efficiently deaminates a large spectrum of tRNA isoacceptors, primarily at anticodon positions. To assess whether the editing sites identified in vitro can be detected in tumor tissues, we analyzed data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. We identified six editing sites present in numerous patient samples. Our results point to a possible impact of APOBEC3A on tRNA decoding capacity, with potential relevance to mistranslation and cancer development."
"Acute and repetitive lung epithelial injury can lead to irreversible and even progressive pulmonary fibrosis; Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal disease and quintessential example of this phenomenon. The composition of epithelial cells in human pulmonary fibrosis - irrespective of disease etiology - is marked by the presence of Aberrant Basaloid cells: an abnormal cell phenotype with pro-fibrotic and senescent features, localized to the surface of fibrotic lesions. Despite their relevance to human pulmonary fibrosis, the exotic molecular profile of Aberrant Basaloid cells has obscured their etiology, preventing insights into how or why these cells emerge with fibrosis. Here we identify cellular intermediaries between Aberrant Basaloid and normal alveolar epithelial cells in human IPF tissue. We track the emergence of Aberrant Basaloid cells from alveolar epithelial cells ex vivo and uncover a role for similar cells in epithelial regeneration under normal conditions. Lastly, we characterize the epigenetic changes that distinguish Aberrant Basaloid cells from their progenitors and identify hallmarks of AP-1 injury memory retention. This study elucidates the phenomenon of maladaptive epithelial plasticity and regeneration in pulmonary fibrosis and re-contextualizes therapeutic strategies for epithelial dysfunction."
"Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are utilized by the ribosome to decode the nucleic acid alphabet. tRNA structure, stability, aminoacylation efficiency, and decoding efficacy are governed by their extensive post-transcriptional modifications. In most studies, individual tRNAs are generated using in vitro transcription, which produces tRNAs devoid of these critical site-specific modifications, negatively affecting translation yields and fidelity. To address this, we have developed a purification method which couples tRNA overexpression to DNA hybridization-based purification. Using this approach, we produced native tRNAs from E. coli in high yield and purity while retaining their complement of native post-transcriptional modifications and translational activity. We extend this technique to the purification of [Formula] and [Formula], tRNAs of critical importance for genetic code expansion. We confirmed that both [Formula] and [Formula] contain native E. coli post-transcriptional modifications and provide the first complete modification profiles of each. Moreover, we found that in vivo-generated [Formula] significantly outperforms its in vitro-generated counterpart in amber codon suppression in cell-free translation reactions. Finally, we purified an engineered variant of E. coli [Formula], extending our studies to synthetic tRNAs. We present a flexible method which generates modified tRNAs in high yield and purity, addressing a critical and persistent challenge in RNA biochemistry. This toolkit enables future structural and cell-free studies through scalable access to native and engineered tRNAs, advancing the broader field of translation and synthetic biology."
"RNA-guided proteins have emerged as critical transcriptional regulators in both natural and engineered biological systems by modulating RNA polymerase (RNAP) and its associated factors1-5. In bacteria, diverse clades of repurposed TnpB and CRISPR-associated proteins repress gene expression by blocking transcription initiation or elongation, enabling non-canonical modes of regulatory control and adaptive immunity1,6,7. Intriguingly, a distinct class of nuclease-dead Cas12f homologs (dCas12f) instead activates gene expression through its association with unique extracytoplasmic function sigma factors ({sigma}E) 8, though the molecular basis has remained elusive. Here we reveal a novel mode of RNA-guided transcription initiation by determining cryo-electron microscopy structures of the dCas12f-{sigma}E system from Flagellimonas taeanensis. We captured multiple conformational and compositional states, including the DNA-bound dCas12f-{sigma}E-RNAP holoenzyme complex, revealing how RNA-guided DNA binding leads to {sigma}E-RNAP recruitment and nascent mRNA synthesis at a precisely defined distance downstream of the R-loop. Rather than following the classical paradigm of {sigma}E-dependent promoter recognition, these studies show that recognition of the -35 element is largely supplanted by CRISPR-Cas targeting, while the melted -10 element is stabilized through unusual stacking interactions rather than insertion into the typical recognition pocket. Collectively, this work provides high-resolution insights into an unexpected mechanism of RNA-guided transcription, expanding our understanding of bacterial gene regulation and opening new avenues for programmable transcriptional control."

"BackgroundIn the course of diffusion, water molecules experience varying values for the relaxation-time properties of the underlying tissue, a factor that has not been accounted for in diffusion MRI (dMRI) modeling.

PurposeWith the aim of mining the dMRI signal for information about the spatial variations in the tissue relaxation-time properties, we derive a new mathematical relationship between the diffusion signal and the spatial gradient of the image, which enables the estimation of the latter from the former.

Study TypeRetrospective and prospective.

PopulationHuman brain dMRI images: 617 healthy subjects from the public Human Connectome Project (HCP) Young Adults database, as well as 10 healthy volunteers and 1 ex vivo image scanned at our Center with stimulated-echo (STE) diffusion encoding and a long diffusion time of 1 second (which we will make publicly available).

Field Strength/Sequence3T, standard spin-echo and STE dMRI.

AssessmentWe validated our hypothesized relationship by evaluating the accuracy of the image spatial gradient estimated from the diffusion signal. Specifically, we compared it to the gold-standard spatial gradient approximated through finite difference, assessing the acute angle between the estimated and gold-standard gradient orientations. We furthermore measured the effects of the confounding factor of ""fiber continuity"".

Statistical TestsWe used two-tailed t-tests (=0.05) to compare the mean/median of the abovementioned acute angle across subjects to its null-hypothesis value (57.3{degrees}/60{degrees}), hypothesizing that it would be significantly smaller.

ResultsWe found the image gradient estimated from our diffusion model to be significantly related to that estimated via finite difference. The abovementioned acute angle had a mean/median of 51.3{degrees}/51.8{degrees} for the HCP and 53.0{degrees}/54.5{degrees} for our STE dataset, which were significantly smaller than those predicted by chance (p = 0 and p < 10-10, respectively). The results of fiber continuity showed an effect that was stronger than but non-overlapping with our hypothesized effect.

Data ConclusionOur results support our hypothesized relationship between within-voxel dMRI signal and image gradient, with an effect that was not explainable by the confounding factor of fiber continuity."
"Kinetic models mechanistically link enzyme levels, metabolite concentrations, and allosteric regulation to metabolic reaction fluxes. This coupling allows for the quantitative elucidation of the dynamics of the evolution of metabolite concentrations and metabolic fluxes as a function of time. So far, most large-scale kinetic model parameterizations are carried out using mostly steady-state flux measurements supplemented with metabolomics and/or proteomics data when available. Even though the parameterized kinetic model can trace a temporal evolution of the system, lack of anchoring to temporal data reduces confidence in the dynamics predictions. Notably, the simulation of enzymatic cascade reactions requires the full description of the dynamics of the system as a steady-state is not applicable given that all measured metabolite concentrations vary with time. Here we describe how kinetic parameters fitted to the dynamics of single-enzyme assays remain accurate for the simulation of multi-enzyme cell-free systems. Herein, we demonstrate two extensions for the Kinetic Estimation Tool Capturing Heterogeneous datasets Using Pyomo (KETCHUP) software tool for parameterizing a kinetic model of the cell-free kinetics of formate dehydrogenase (FDH) and 2,3-butanediol dehydrogenase (BDH) through the use of time-course data across various initial conditions. An implemented extension of KETCHUP allowing for the reconciliation of measurement time-lag errors present in datasets was used to parameterize multiple datasets. By combining the kinetic parameters identified by the FDH and BDH assays, accurate simulation of the binary FDH-BDH system was achieved. KETCHUP can be accessed at https://github.com/maranasgroup/KETCHUP.

Author SummaryMetabolic engineering of microorganisms offers a sustainable and renewable alternative for industrial scale production of commodity chemicals. Large-scale metabolic stoichiometric models enable means to elucidate an organisms physiological behavior towards both environment and genetic perturbations and predict optimal interventions to maximize production. Kinetic models extend stoichiometric models capabilities in characterizing metabolic phenotypes by mathematically linking enzyme catalyzed reactions in metabolic networks as functions of metabolite concentrations, enzyme levels, and allosteric regulations. Although these kinetic descriptions improve predictive accuracy and strain design, the lack of enzyme information, raw experimental data, and high computational cost preclude the construction and parameterization of detailed large-scale kinetic models. Here, we introduce an extension of KETCHUP, an open-source semi-automatic kinetic construction and parameterization tool that utilizes steady-state data as a pilot for the parameterization of single-enzyme cell-free time-course data. We show that this tool offers comparable performance to existing tools during parameterization of single enzymes and successful recapitulation of metabolite profiles for a two-enzyme system when simulating a kinetic model with parameters from the two single-enzymes. This study showcases a high throughput pipeline that can be integrated into our framework for larger scaled networks."
"Human pluripotent stem cell-derived kidney organoids replicate embryonic nephrogenesis in a 3D-culture system. Recent advances suggest that refining the culture environment to replicate spatiotemporal cues present during embryonic organogenesis improves patterning. Here, this paradigm was applied to FGF signalling, a key regulator of embryonic nephron progenitor maintenance, nephrogenesis and ureteric branching. Both FGF8b and FGF10 signalling is sufficient to support nephrogenesis, with each having distinct effects on nephron patterning. FGF10 enhanced the initial WT1+ mesenchymal population, leading to proximally biased nephrons, while FGF8b biased toward early distal patterning, leading to the formation of cells with connecting segment identity. The addition of both FGF8b and FGF10 together had an additive effect, leading to a balance of proximal and distal patterning. This differential patterning was retained in tissue transplanted under the murine renal capsule, with FGF8b-treated organoids displaying increased distal/connecting segments. These findings highlight plasticity during organoid nephrogenesis that can be modulated by FGF signalling and identify an approach to refine nephrogenesis toward key cell types."

"Optical Pooled Screening (OPS) enables precise measurement of pooled genetic libraries in single, highly multiplexed microscopy experiments,1-4 linking image-based phenotypes to genotypes at genome-scale. However, no method has combined large-scale OPS with multi-generational time-lapse imaging, which is especially important for studying single-cell dynamics and physiology in microbes. Here we develop MARLIN, a technique for multigenerational time-lapse OPS in a microfluidic device and leverage it to map live-cell imaging data to genetic perturbations in a [~]130,000-strain mismatch-CRISPRi library targeting all essential genes in E. coli. The resulting dataset comprises nearly a hundred million cell cycles and 1.6 billion cells, representing an average of 33 different knockdowns per gene, and provides quantitative measures of morphology and growth for each essential gene with respect to dose. We clustered our multidimensional time-lapse phenotypes to reveal exceptional correlations across co-functional genes, allowing us to systematically discover roles for essential genes of unknown function, as well as implicate RNase E as required for replication initiation. Further, we assayed dose-dependent correlations between growth and cell size for single genes, demonstrating shared regulation of size with ribosome synthesis, while also identifying limitations in existing growth control models. We reconcile these models with our data by positing SpoT as a sensor of translation elongation, which we validate through several lines of genetic and biochemical evidence. Finally, we show that a simple proteome-allocation model - where (p)ppGpp-control only passively limits division protein synthesis - explains all our size-growth scaling behaviors while also quantitatively linking cell size to ribosome abundance. Looking forward, we anticipate that MARLIN will be an essential tool for high-throughput genotype to phenotype mapping in microbes."
"Prior functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) studies examining the neural correlates of retrieval success and precision have reported inconsistent results. Here, we examined the neural correlates of success and precision in a test of memory for spatial location. The present study extended prior findings by employing an experimental design that minimized temporal overlap between mnemonic and visuomotor processing. At study, participants viewed a series of object images, each placed at a randomly selected location on an imaginary circle. At test, studied images were intermixed with new images and presented to the participants. The requirement was to make a covert recognition memory judgment to each image and to attempt to recall its studied location, guessing if necessary. A cue signaling the requirement to make a location memory judgment was presented 4 seconds after image onset. Memory precision was quantified as the angular difference between the studied location and the location selected by the participant. In an analysis that combined the data from the present study and a closely similar prior study, we replicated prior reports that fMRI BOLD activity in the left angular gyrus (AG) and the hippocampus tracks memory precision on a trial-wise basis. Linear mixed effects modeling indicated that the activity in the two regions explained independent sources of variability in these judgments. In addition, multivoxel pattern similarity analysis revealed robust evidence for an item-level reinstatement effect (as indexed by encoding-retrieval overlap) in the left AG that was restricted to items associated with high precision judgments. These findings suggest that the hippocampus and the left AG play non-redundant roles in the retrieval and behavioral expression of high precision episodic memories."
"Oxytocin receptors (OTR) within the extended amygdala and nucleus accumbens have been implicated in modulating social behaviors, particularly following stress. The effects of OTR could be mediated by modulating the activity of pre-synaptic axon terminals or via post-synaptic neurons or glia. Using a viral-mediated CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system in California mice (Peromyscus californicus), we selectively knocked down OTR in the anteromedial bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) or the nucleus accumbens (NAc) to examine their roles modulating social approach and vigilance behaviors. Knockdown of OTR in the BNST attenuated stress-induced decreases of social approach and increases of social vigilance behaviors in adult female California mice, similar to prior pharmacological studies. These effects were more prominent in the large arena social interaction where mice could control proximity to a social target with a barrier (wire cage). In a small arena interaction test where focal mice freely interacted with target mice, effects of BNST OTR knockdown were muted. This suggests that within the BNST OTR are more important for modulating behavioral responses to more distal stimuli versus more proximal social contexts. In mice with OTR knockdown in the NAc, few behavioral changes were observed which is consistent with previous findings of the importance of presynaptic OTR, which were unaffected by our gene editing strategy, driving social approach behaviors in the NAc. Interestingly, BNST OTR knockdown increased exploratory behavior toward a non-social stimulus after stress, pointing to a potentially broader role for BNST OTR function. Our findings highlight the region- and context-specific functions of OTR in social behavior and the advantages of using a selective gene-editing tool to dissect the neural circuits that influence social and stress-related responses."
"In daily life, living beings encounter a continuous stream of mixed information, which has to be disentangled by the brain to form proper representations. Using computational modeling, we demonstrate that the interplay between dendritic calcium-mediated action potentials (dCaAPs) with synaptic plasticity and rewiring can enable single neurons to successfully perform this complex task. Compared to other types of dendritic spikes, dCaAPs exhibit a high triggering threshold, large, but graded spike amplitude, with lower amplitudes for stronger synaptic inputs. We show that these properties enable neurons to successfully learn to represent discrete items from a continuous input stream by facilitating the clustering of synapses with temporally correlated presynaptic activities onto the same dendritic branch. In comparison to NMDA spikes, dendrites generating dCaAPs can form representations of individual items more efficiently, independent of the temporal order of their presentation during learning -- whether randomly, sequentially, as part of a random stream of simultaneously shown input items, or even as items with shared properties. Thus, our results provide further evidence about the critical role of dCaAPs for the computational capabilities of single neurons."
"Multiciliated cells (MCCs) are essential for generating directional fluid flow across specialized epithelia in various vertebrate organs. MCC differentiation involves a unique, tightly regulated program characterized by massive centriole amplification, independently of DNA replication. Although much is known about the transcriptional control of MCC development, insights into proteome dynamics have been limited due to the lack of suitable models. In this study, we report the generation of a stable inducible MCC line, derived from Xenopus laevis A6 kidney epithelial cells. Upon induction of the MCC master regulator Multicilin (MCI), most A6-MCI cells synchronously differentiate into mature MCCs in 48 hours. Using this novel resource, custom antibodies and super-resolution imaging, we characterized Xenopus deuterosomes, the platforms that allow massive centriole synthesis in vertebrate MCCs. We performed a detailed proteomic profiling throughout MCC differentiation, and uncovered previously uncharacterized regulators. Notably, we highlight a critical role for CDK7 in MCC differentiation in both Xenopus and human systems. Our work provides a valuable resource for mechanistic studies of MCC biology and opens avenues to identify novel therapeutic targets for motile ciliopathies."
"Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) analysis of molecular data has identified genetic variants associated with traits such as gene expression, and colocalization of these functional QTL with GWAS risk loci has offered insights into the genetic basis of human disease. We employed gene expression (RNA-seq) and chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq) obtained from human primary fibroblasts to investigate quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in cohorts ascertained for bipolar disorder of European (n=150) and Latin American (n=96) ancestries. Leveraging data from three countries of origin (The Netherlands, Colombia, Costa Rica) within our cohort, we characterized differences among individuals at the SNP, gene, and accessible-chromatin levels to compute ancestry-specific expression (e)QTLs and chromatin-accessibility (ca)QTLs. Across ancestries, we observed R{superscript 2} [&ge;] 0.93 for eQTL effect sizes and R{superscript 2} [&ge;] 0.95 for caQTLs, indicating a high degree of concordance. Integrating chromatin data with expression and genotype information enabled precise fine-mapping of eQTLs, yielding 203 high-confidence (posterior probability > 90 %) regulatory pathways. In downstream analyses, transcriptome-wide (TWAS) and chromatin-wide (CWAS) association studies with brain- and skin-related GWAS identified 36 TWAS-significant genes and 77 CWAS-significant open chromatin regions. These findings underscore the shared genetic regulatory mechanisms across European and Latin American ancestries, while demonstrating that ancestry-specific reference panels enhance the accuracy of TWAS and CWAS in diverse populations."
"Genome-wide single-cell and spatial long-read approaches have gained traction, but mostly lack single-cell resolution - and yield limited read lengths. Here, we introduce spatial ISOform sequencing (Spl-ISO-Seq), which reveals exons and polyadenylation sites from long reads with near-single-cell resolution. Spl-ISO-Seq selects long cDNAs and doubles to triples read lengths compared to standard preparations. Adding a highly specific software tool (Spl-ISOquant) and comparing human post-mortem pre-puberty samples of the visual cortex (8-11 years) to post-puberty samples (16-19 years), we find that cortical layers harbor stronger splicing and poly(A)-site regulation than the adjacent white matter, with enrichment of multiple protein-domain types. For oligodendrocytes however, developmental splicing changes are stronger in white matter. Among cortical layers, layer 4 has the most developmental changes in alternative-exon inclusion in excitatory neurons and in poly(A) sites. We also find many repeat elements, especially ERV1 long terminal repeats downstream of developmentally-regulated layer 4 exons. Overall, alternative splicing changes are linked to synapses - specifically at the post-synapse. Age-linked splicing changes in layers 1-3 and 4 are associated with autism spectrum disorder but not with schizophrenia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Alzheimers disease. These results root developmental splicing changes during puberty and the resulting protein changes in specific layers and cell types. More generally, our new technologies enable new observations for any complex tissue."
"Disrupted cholesterol metabolism is increasingly recognised as a contributing factor in neurodegeneration; however, the specific effects of key brain-derived cholesterol metabolites, 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24S-HC) and 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-HC), remain poorly understood. Using human iPSC-derived i3 cortical neurons, we demonstrate that both 24S-HC and 27-HC significantly impair neuronal calcium signalling by elevating resting calcium levels, reducing spike amplitude, and disrupting network synchrony. These functional deficits are accompanied by widespread organelle dysfunction. Both oxysterols induce mitochondrial fragmentation, decrease spare respiratory capacity, and impair lysosomal degradation. Notably, 27-HC uniquely triggers lysosomal swelling and membrane permeabilisation. Additional signs of cellular stress, including axonal swellings and elevated endoplasmic reticulum calcium levels, were also observed. Furthermore, both 24S-HC and 27-HC were found to directly interact with alpha-synuclein (aSyn), promoting its accumulation in cellular models. In contrast, cholesterol itself had minimal impact, highlighting the distinct toxicity of its hydroxylated metabolites. Together, these findings reveal a mechanistic link between oxysterol accumulation and neuronal dysfunction, supporting the hypothesis that elevated levels of 24S-HC and 27-HC, commonly observed in Parkinsons and Alzheimers disease, may actively drive neurodegenerative processes. Targeting oxysterol metabolism may therefore represent a promising therapeutic avenue for intervention in neurodegenerative disorders."
"Oxytocin (OT) is a neuropeptide implicated in complex social behaviors including trust and attachment, yet the neural mechanisms underlying its effects remain unclear. OT is thought to modulate behavior by enhancing the salience of social cues and attenuating prediction error (PE) processing, the discrepancy between expected and actual outcomes that drives learning. Since both salience coding and PE processing involve dopamine (DA) neurons as well, the current study investigated the putative interdependence between OT and DA in social safety learning using the social transmission of food preference (STFP) paradigm. STFP is based on the observation that mice (observers) display neophobia toward novel food, but develop a preference for it after a conspecific demonstrator signals its safety. We interpreted STFP acquisition as a functional parallel to human trust-based learning and found that OT enhanced learning in a trust acquisition condition, but only when DA signaling was intact. In a trust violation condition, where demonstrated food was later paired with lithium chloride (LiCl)-induced food aversion, both OT and DA depletion blocked learning, resulting in retained preference for demonstrated food, but not when OT was administered under DA depletion. These findings reveal a functional interaction between the OT and DA systems to modulate social safety learning, which may have important implications for OTs potential in treating disorders involving DA dysfunction."
"Discrimination of sensory stimuli is fundamentally constrained by the information encoded in neuronal responses. In the barn owl, interaural time difference (ITD) serves as a primary cue for azimuthal sound localization and is represented topographically in the midbrain auditory space map in the external nucleus of the inferior colliculus (ICx). While prior studies have demonstrated a correspondence between spatial tuning and behavioral acuity, it remains unclear how changes in sensory reliability influence this relationship. Here, we examined how behavioral and neuronal ITD discrimination thresholds vary with binaural correlation (BC), which manipulates ITD cue reliability. Using the pupil dilation response (PDR) as a behavioral metric in head-fixed owls, we found that ITD just-noticeable-differences increased exponentially as BC decreased. In contrast, the widths of ICx ITD tuning curves increased more modestly, indicating that tuning resolution alone does not account for behavioral discrimination performance. By computing the Fisher information from ICx neuronal responses, we showed that the average neuronal discriminability predicts behavioral thresholds across BC levels. A habituation-based model incorporating BC-dependent changes in tuning width, firing rate, and response variability successfully accounted for both direction and ITD discrimination. These findings support a model in which perceptual acuity is governed by the combined influence of neuronal tuning and variability and provide a unified framework for understanding how midbrain auditory representations underlie adaptive spatial hearing."
"Motor adaptation--the process of correcting movement errors through feedback and practice--is a fundamental human capacity that keeps our actions well-calibrated amid changes in the environment and the body. However, how training context--specifically, the configuration of targets in the workspace--shapes how we learn and what we learn during motor adaptation remains unknown. To investigate this, we conducted two reaching experiments in which participants experienced a visuomotor gain perturbation, with feedback scaled to 1.3x (Exp 1) or 0.7x (Exp 2) the actual movement distance. In both experiments, participants were assigned to either the Extent Group, which trained with targets of varying amplitudes in a single direction, or the Angular Group, which trained with targets of equal amplitude in different directions. We found marked differences in how the two groups learned: the Angular Group learned more implicitly than the Extent Group, as evidenced by larger post-perturbation aftereffects when participants were instructed to forgo re-aiming strategies. Just as striking were the differences in what the two groups learned: the Angular Group learned a translation rule, which generalized to new directions but not amplitudes, while the Extent Group learned the imposed gain rule, which generalized to new amplitudes but not directions. Together, these findings underscore the importance of training context in determining how and what we learn."
"Chronic neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration are critical but unresolved drivers of disability accumulation in progressive multiple sclerosis (MS). Chronic active white matter lesions (CAL), identifiable radiologically as paramagnetic rim lesions (PRL), indicate progression-relevant chronic neuroinflammation. Using single-cell transcriptomics (scRNAseq) and T-cell receptor sequencing (scTCR-seq), we profiled cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood immune cells of 34 radiologically characterized adults with MS (17 untreated, 6 treated with B-cell-depletion) and 5 healthy controls. Coupled with proteomics, we found PRL-associated enrichment of interferon (IFN) signaling and upregulation of TCR signaling in CSF and blood. This was accompanied by clonal expansion of CD8+ T effector memory (TEM) cells, with the highly expanded clonal cells exhibiting T helper type 1 (TH1) and cytotoxic profiles. Validating the cytotoxic immune profile in blood using flow cytometry, we identified a cellular correlate of PRL exhibiting features of CD8+ TEMRA cells. Despite B-cell depletion, PRL-associated neuroinflammation, driven by myeloid activation and CD8+ T-cell cytotoxicity, persisted. Serum and CSF proteomic networks showed PRL-pertinent signatures, including networks unaffected by B-cell depletion. Using in silico perturbation, we nominated therapeutic targets, including MYD88, TNF, MYC, TYK2, JAK2, and BTK, for alleviating chronic neuroinflammation in MS. Our findings highlight mechanisms of chronic neuroinflammation in MS and point to potential biomarkers for monitoring disease progression."
"Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is the leading infectious killer and infects one quarter of the global population. During infection, Mtb evade host immune responses via secreted effector proteins that interfere with, modulate, and protect from potent antibacterial responses. One such class of mycobacterial effector proteins are the PE/PPE proteins, a huge family of proteins encoded by an impressive 10% of the Mtb genome. Because some PE/PPEs have demonstrated roles in immune regulation and host cell interaction, and because of the sheer number of PE/PPEs in pathogenic mycobacteria ([~]170-200+ members depending on the species), they are thought to contribute to Mtb virulence and pathogenesis. However, the cellular functions of Mtbs 169 PE/PPE proteins have yet to be comprehensively characterized, at least in part because of their high GC content and large regions of extremely repetitive regions found both in DNA and amino acid sequences. One member of this family, PE5, is likely critical for mycobacterial pathogenesis, but its cellular and molecular functions, particularly within a host cell, are unexplored. We investigated the molecular functions of PE5 using affinity purification coupled mass spectrometry (AP-MS) and identified an interaction with the CRL2 complex, a host E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. PE5 interacts with CRL2 through its C-terminal Gly-Gly motif, which is bound by the CRL2 substrate receptor, KLHDC2. PE5 does not get ubiquitinated, but it is degraded upon being bound by KLHDC2. Interestingly, binding to PE5 increases the autoubiquitination of KLHDC2, but this autoubiquitination does not interfere with KLHDC2s ability to degrade known substrates or the ability of CRL2 to degrade substrates bound by other substrate receptors. Therefore, while PE5 binds to CRL2-KLHDC2 and does not get ubiquitinated itself, it does not appear to impede CRL2 activity. This study identifies a novel interaction between PE5 and a host ubiquitin ligase pathway, and it raises new questions about how PE5s interaction with the host modulates cell biology to promote Mtb virulence. Furthermore, it implicates CRL2 complexes in mediating cell-intrinsic host response to Mtb infection, a novel function for this ubiquitin ligase complex. Our results expand our understanding of how PE/PPEs may target innate immune responses and contribute to our knowledge of how uncharacterized PE/PPEs contribute to Mtbs virulence."
"Precise DNA replication is critical to the maintenance of genome stability, and the DNA replication machinery is a focal point of many current and upcoming chemotherapeutics. TrAEL-seq is a robust method for profiling DNA replication genome-wide that works in unsynchronised cells and does not require treatment with drugs or nucleotide analogues. Here, we provide an updated method for TrAEL-seq including multiplexing of up to 6 samples that dramatically improves sample quality and throughput, and we validate TrAEL-seq in multiple mammalian cell lines. The updated protocol is straightforward and robust yet provides excellent resolution comparable to OK-seq in mammalian cell samples. High resolution replication profiles can be obtained across large panels of samples and in dynamic systems, for example during the progressive onset of oncogene induced senescence. In addition to mapping zones where replication initiates and terminates, TrAEL-seq is sensitive to replication fork speed, revealing effects of both transcription and proximity to replication Initiation Zones on fork progression. Although forks move more slowly through transcribed regions, this does not have a significant impact on the broader dynamics of replication fork progression, which is dominated by rapid fork movement in long replication regions (>1Mb). Short and long replication regions are not intrinsically different, and instead replication forks accelerate across the first [~]1 Mb of travel such that forks progress faster in the middle of regions lying between widely spaced Initiation Zones. We propose that this is a natural consequence of fewer replication forks being active later in S phase when these distal regions are replicated and there being less competition for replication factors."
"Dormant replication origins help ensure complete genome duplication when replication forks stall, yet how these origins are activated remains poorly understood. Here, we identify a novel regulatory mechanism by which cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activity controls the abundance and chromatin recruitment of the origin firing factors TRESLIN and MTBP to promote dormant origin activation. Inhibition of WEE1 kinase during S phase increases CDK activity, which blocks the PCNA-dependent degradation of TRESLIN and enhances its chromatin association along with MTBP. This increased loading is required for elevated helicase recruitment and DNA synthesis under CDK-hyperactive conditions. These effects are reversed by CDK inhibition and depend on both TRESLIN and MTBP. We define a conserved sequence within TRESLIN required for its CDK-sensitive degradation. Significantly, the recruitment of TRESLIN-MTBP and loading of helicase exceed levels observed in unperturbed S phase, supporting a model in which dormant origin firing is actively upregulated through CDK-mediated stabilization of the initiation machinery. These findings uncover a new control point in replication origin usage with implications for genome stability and therapeutic kinase inhibition."
"The evolution of mitochondrial respiration has been implicated in the remarkable adaptations of bats, including powered flight, longevity and viral tolerance. However, the mechanisms coordinating mitochondrial respiration with lipid metabolism--a critical energy source for flight--remain poorly understood. Here, we discovered that complex I inhibition triggered iron overload into bat mitochondria, inducing a burst of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This iron translocation relied on the VDAC-MCU axis and mitochondrial membrane potential. Intriguingly, disrupting VDAC oligomerization enhanced iron uptake in a complex I-dependent manner. Mitochondrial iron translocation perturbed fatty acid oxidation and upregulated linoleic acid species, which promoted the reversible accumulation of lipid droplets, suggesting metabolic plasticity crucial for bat energetics. Our findings establish complex I as a pivotal regulatory hub that directly couples respiratory efficiency to lipid metabolism by governing mitochondrial iron levels. This mechanism may represent a key evolutionary adaptation supporting the unique metabolic demands of bat physiology.

HIGHLIGHTSComplex I inhibition induces unique mitochondrial ROS burst in bat cells.
Mitochondrial iron overload is the primary trigger of complex I-linked ROS burst.

"PurposeTo investigate whether KRT6A or KRT17 label self-renewing stem cells (SCs) in adult Meibomian gland (MG) and palpebral conjunctiva (PC) homeostasis and explore the mechanisms that regulate their expression in these tissues.

MethodsKRT6A and KRT17 expression in adult mouse MG and PC was examined by single nucleus RNA sequencing and immunofluorescence (IF). Bromodeoxyuridine pulse-chase assays were conducted to assess the turnover rate of PC progenitor cells. Lineage tracing experiments were performed using Krt6a-CreERT2and Krt17-CreERT2 mice carrying Rosa26RnTnG or Rosa26RmTmG reporter. As Hedgehog (Hh) signaling, the histone deacetylase HDAC3, and the transcription factor KLF4, regulate KRT6A and KRT17 in other contexts, IF was conducted to assess the in vivo effects of overexpression of the Hh pathway activator GLI2{Delta}N, and inducible epithelial deletion of Hdac3 or Klf4, on KRT6A and KRT17 expression in the MG and PC.

ResultsKRT6A and KRT17 are primarily expressed in the MG central duct and ductules. KRT6A also shows robust expression in PC. MG and PC epithelial progenitor cells turn over within 14 days. Lineage tracing indicated that Krt17 labels self-renewing SCs in the MG whereas Krt6a labels SCs in the PC. GLI2{Delta}N overexpression induced ectopic KRT17 expression in MG acini and PC but did not affect KRT6A expression in either MG or PC. Hdac3 deficiency caused expanded expression of KRT6A and KRT17 in MG acini and ectopic KRT17 expression in PC. Klf4 deletion resulted in ectopic KRT17 expression in PC but did not influence KRT6A expression in MG or PC.

ConclusionsKrt6a- and Krt17-expressing cells contribute to adult PC and MG homeostasis, respectively. KRT17 expression is enhanced by GLI2{Delta}N, and suppressed by HDAC3 and KLF4, whereas KRT6A expression is controlled only by HDAC3."
"Proliferation and vasoconstriction of the intimal smooth muscle layer of the pulmonary artery are pathogenic characteristics of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Altered mitochondrial function, i.e. glycolysis, ROS generation and fission, are known potentiators of vascular remodeling. However, most current therapeutic interventions fail to effectively address the proliferation of the pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCSs) lining the pulmonary vasculature and highlight the importance of identifying novel pathways to target for intervention. The Sphk1/S1P/S1P2 signaling axis is upregulated in PAH patients and is known to induce PASMC proliferation during hypoxia-mediated pulmonary hypertension (HPH). Interestingly, Sphk1 modulates mitochondrial function in that it regulates dynamics, cell growth and survival and in C. elegans, it induces activation of the unfolded protein response (UPRmt). We aimed to investigate if the Sphk1/S1P/S1P2 signaling axis promotes vascular remodeling in PAH via activation of the UPRmt. PASMCs isolated from IPAH patients were subjected to RNAseq analysis. The effect of Sphk1 or S1P was interrogated in hPASMC cell lines and the HPH model was used to assess the effect of the UPRmt on PAH pathogenesis. RNAseq analysis revealed that pathways involved in mitochondrial respiration were among the top 20 most significantly regulated pathways. Furthermore, ATF-5, the transcription factor that mediates the UPRmt was significantly upregulated. In hPASMCs, Sphk1/S1P lead to decreased respiration, increased glycolysis, fission, ROS and UPRmt activation. Pharmacological inhibition of the UPRmt mediator, mtHSP70, mitigated the Sphk1 induced increase in hPASMC proliferation. Furthermore, mtHSP70 inhibition was protective in hypoxia-mediated pulmonary hypertension (HPH) as we observed a decrease in right ventricular systolic pressure, right ventricular hypertrophy and vascular remodeling. These data suggest that the UPRmt promotes vascular remodeling in PAH and may present a novel pathway to target for pharmaceutical intervention."
"YIPF5 is a small ER-membrane protein implicated in ER-Golgi transport. Mutations in YIPF5 cause MEDS2 (microcephaly with simplified gyral pattern, epilepsy, and neonatal diabetes syndrome), a fatal disorder manifesting in early childhood. We demonstrate that YIPF5 is involved in ER export of a subset of proteins, including cargoes of the ER-export receptor SURF4, with which it directly interacts. In YIPF5 knockout cells, we observe a shift in the cell surface and secretome composition, marked by reduced neuronal adhesion molecules and increased secretion of ER chaperones influencing cell migration. YIPF5 depletion enhances cell migration in a wound-healing assay and alters SURF4 localization, causing elongated ERGIC53- and Rab1-positive tubules from COPII-labeled ER exit sites. Kinetic analysis suggests that YIPF5 negatively regulates SURF4-mediated ER export. In utero knockdown of Yipf5 in embryonic mouse brains induces premature neuronal migration and abnormal neuronal morphology. These findings suggest that YIPF5 and SURF4 coordinate ER export, and disruption may underlie cortical development defects leading to microcephaly."
"The cellular response to lysosomal damage involves fine-tuned mechanisms of membrane repair, lysosome regeneration and lysophagy, but how these different processes are coordinated is not fully understood. Here we show in human cells that the deubiquitinating enzyme ATXN3 helps restore integrity of the lysosomal system after damage by targeting K48-K63-linked branched ubiquitin chains on regenerating lysosomes. We find that ATXN3 translocates to lysosomes after different types of damage and there colocalizes with its partner, VCP/p97. ATXN3 recruitment occurs late after the initial repair of a subset of lysosomes and after phagophore formation on terminally damaged lysosomes. Of note, inactivation of ATXN3 by induced degradation, depletion or knock-out impairs clearance of damaged lysosomes and full restoration of lysosomal capacity. Mechanistically, ATXN3, along with VCP/p97, turns over K48-K63-branched ubiquitin conjugates on LAMP1-positive, phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate-decorated compartments that are not yet fully re-acidified indicating involvement in lysosome regeneration. Our findings identify a key role of ATXN3 in restoring lysosomal function after lysosomal membrane damage and uncover K48-K63-branched ubiquitin chain-regulated regeneration as a critical element of the lysosomal damage stress response."
"Gram-negative bacteria are intrinsically resistant to many antibiotics in part due to the asymmetric architecture and barrier function of their outer membrane (OM). To establish proper lipid asymmetry, cells need to ensure an intricate balance of constituent OM components, especially lipids. In this regard, the conserved, trans-envelope Tol-Pal complex plays a primary role in maintaining OM lipid homeostasis, thus OM integrity, possibly via retrograde phospholipid transport. However, mechanistic details for this process are unknown, owing to the lack of evidence for direct lipid binding. In this study, we discover that the periplasmic protein TolB, a key component of the Tol-Pal system, associates directly with membranes in vitro, via specific interactions with cardiolipin (CL). Using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, we identify a CL-binding site on TolB; a single amino acid mutation at this site abolishes in vitro membrane interaction, consequently impairing cellular Tol-Pal function in maintaining OM homeostasis in Escherichia coli. Curiously, we find that the functional requirement for TolB-CL interactions can be bypassed in cells lacking CL, suggesting compensatory effects through other lipids. Our findings reveal a previously unappreciated lipid-binding role for TolB, and provide novel insights into how the Tol-Pal complex may facilitate phospholipid transport across the cell envelope. Our work will inform future strategies towards developing new antibiotics against Gram-negative bacteria.

SignificanceThe integrity of a biological membrane enables the definition of cellular boundaries, and of life. In Gram-negative bacteria, the outer membrane presents a formidable barrier against antibiotics, making it a key contributor to intrinsic antimicrobial resistance. While the Tol-Pal complex is known to ensure outer membrane stability and lipid homeostasis, its precise mechanism remains elusive. This study reveals a direct lipid-binding role for TolB, a periplasmic component of the complex, and identifies cardiolipin as a critical interacting partner. Our work establishes a novel dimension of Tol-Pal function in outer membrane lipid homeostasis and transport, opening new avenues for targeting envelope maintenance systems in Gram-negative pathogens."
"High-quality metadata is essential for downstream AI applications, yet metadata curation remains a persistent bottleneck in biomedical research. The core challenge lies in balancing quality and scalability. Manual curation delivers high quality, reliable annotations but is time-intensive and non-scalable; automated approaches, including those based on natural language processing, can scale but often fall short in accuracy and completeness. This tradeoff is particularly severe in public datasets, where metadata is frequently distributed across multiple sources for a single dataset. A notable example includes multi-omics datasets available on GEO and similar public repositories, which are often accompanied by associated publications. These supplementary sources can be leveraged to substantially enhance metadata quality, thereby supporting downstream applications such as classifier model development or the identification of biologically relevant cohorts, etc.

We present a first-in-class multi-agent AI system that bridges the gap, achieving both high quality and scalability in metadata curation. Built on large-language models (LLMs), our system orchestrates a set of specialized agents that collaboratively extract, normalize, and infer critical metadata fields such as tissue, disease, cell line, sampling site, demographics, and experimental context from GEO entries, associated publications. A central orchestrator agent delegates tasks such as data retrieval, document parsing, ontology mapping, and context inference to expert sub-agents, enabling scalable, end-to-end automation.

Applied to GEO data sets, a notoriously difficult metadata domain, our system achieves a 93% recall on average across 23 key fields (all original terms, normalized terms, and corresponding ontology ids) that include information about disease, tissue, treatment, donor-related information, outperforming existing automated baselines and approaches expert level quality. We also present a system that can easily scale to curate hundreds of metadata fields of interest with similar precision. This work demonstrates that an LLM-based multi-agent architecture can overcome traditional trade-offs in metadata curation, enabling both precision and scale, and offers a promising path forward for curating large public biomedical repositories for downstream AI applications."
"Proper identification of start codons is critical for accurate annotation of open reading frames (ORFs) and prediction of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) targets. We demonstrate that reference transcriptomes annotations frequently select the longest ORF rather than the authentic start codon, leading to incorrect assessment of NMD features. Our revised ORF annotations significantly improve NMD target identification, and prevents computational hallucinations in protein databases."
"Complex I is the largest enzyme of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation system. It is composed of core subunits that are conserved across bacteria and eukaryotes and accessory subunits that are lineage-specific. Consequently, the assembly of complex I likely requires lineage-specific assembly machineries. Complex I assembly has been mainly studied in mammals. It follows a modular pathway in which modules are assembled independently and then associated together to form the mature complex. Here, we identify and characterize PAF1 as an assembly factor for the membrane arm of complex I in plants. We show that this protein plays a role in stabilizing a module of the membrane arm prior to its association with the rest of the complex. PAF1 was likely present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor and has been lost in mammals in which the assembly of the membrane arm involves assembly factors not conserved in plants. Altogether, we provide molecular evidence that the assembly of the membrane arm of complex I can be performed by two different machineries."
"Hsp90 is a dimeric molecular chaperone essential for the folding, stabilization, activation, and maturation of hundreds of client proteins, which are critical for cellular function. Co-chaperones, such as Aha1, play a key role in regulating the ATP-dependent Hsp90 client activation cycle by modulating Hsp90s ATPase activity and controlling progression through the cycle. Two highly conserved motifs in Aha1--the NxNNWHW and RKxK motifs--are known to regulate specific aspects of the Hsp90 ATPase cycle. In this study, we demonstrate that the K60 residue within the RKxK motif facilitates the structural organization of the NxNNWHW motif prior to ATP hydrolysis. Mutation of the K60 residue partially impairs the in vivo functionality of yeast Aha1. Additionally, we reveal that each individual residue within the NxNNWHW motif modulates the ATPase rate and apparent affinity for ATP of Hsp90. These findings provide new insights into how conserved regions of Aha-type co-chaperones influence Hsp90 kinetics and its regulation of client protein folding."
"MotivationDe novo gene emergence refers to the process by which new genes arise from mutations in previously non-coding genomic regions. Prior to becoming fixed in a species, newly expressed open reading frames (neORFs) undergo significant turnover within their species of origin. Investigating these early stages of de novo gene emergence is essential for understanding the mechanisms that enable gene formation from scratch. No software currently exists that can identify and characterise novel, unannotated open reading frames from a transcriptome, and analyse their mutations and fixation patterns within or across species.

ResultsTo address this gap, we introduce DESwoMAN (De novo Emergence Study With Outgroup MutAtioNs), a software tool designed to: (1) detect neORFs in transcriptomes, (2) filter neORFs with no homology to outgroup genes, and (3) search for syntenic sequences homologous to neORFs in outgroup genomes (and optionally transcriptomes) and analyse mutations in coding features between these sequences. We applied DESwoMAN with two different strategies to three setups, using twice human and once fruit fly as query species. Our results highlight the tools capabilities and demonstrate its potential for elucidating the early stages of de novo gene emergence.

Availability and ImplementationDESwoMAN is available at https://github.com/ AnnaGrBio/DESWOMAN. It is implemented in Python3 and comes with a docker image on Docker-Hub for easy installation and execution including all (non-Python) dependencies."
"Metabolic syndrome (MetS), constituted by obesity, hyperglycemia, hypertension, and dyslipidemia, is a growing public health concern due to its associated risk with cardiovascular and other metabolic disorders. Early-stage detection and prevention of MetS are key factors in an effective management strategy. Thus, the current study aimed to develop a risk score for MetS progression based on features pertaining to its pathophysiology, that can facilitate early detection and treatment strategies. A multivariate logistic regression model was developed using a representative feature from MetS pathophysiological pathways of inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and hepatic dysregulation. The model was built on NHANES dataset and validated in Chinese and Indian datasets. The model performance evaluated using ROC resulted in an AUC of 0.81 in training and 0.87 and 0.79 for Chinese and Indian validation datasets, respectively. In conclusion, a MetS predictive model built on three MetS pathophysiological determinants was developed and validated in distinct datasets.

HighlightsO_LIA MetS prediction model, trained on NHANES data, is validated with two datasets of varied ethnicity.
C_LIO_LIThe three parameter model, independent of MetS diagnostic criteria, is reflective of inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and hepatic dysregulation.

"Lowering the levels of HTT transcripts has been a major focus of therapeutic development for Huntingtons disease (HD), but which transcript should be lowered? HD is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in exon 1 of the HTT gene, and the rate of somatic expansion of this CAG repeat throughout life is now known to drive the age of onset and rate of disease progression. As the CAG repeat expands, the extent to which the HTT mRNA is alternatively processed to generate the HTT1a transcript and highly aggregation-prone and pathogenic HTT1a protein increases. Several HTT-lowering modalities have entered clinical trials that either target both HTT and HTT1a together, or full-length HTT alone. We have developed siRNAs that target the Htt1a mouse transcript (634/486) and used these, together with a potent Htt-targeting siRNA (10150) to compare the efficacy of lowering either full-length Htt or Htt1a. zQ175 and wild-type mice were treated with 10150 or 634/486 alongside control groups at 2 months of age with treatment to 6 or 10 months, or at 6 months with treatment to 10 months. The siRNA potency and durability were most effective in the hippocampus. Whilst both strategies showed benefits, despite the greater potency of 10150, targeting Htt1a was more effective at delaying HTT aggregation and transcriptional dysregulation than targeting full-length Htt. These data support HTT-lowering strategies that are designed to target the HTT1a transcript, either alone, or together with lowering full-length HTT.

One Sentence SummaryLowering HTT1a transcript levels delays the onset of molecular and neuropathological phenotypes in a knock-in mouse model of Huntingtons disease."
"In Parkinsons disease and other synucleinopathies, -synuclein (-Syn) misfolds and forms Ser129- phosphorylated aggregates (pSyn129). The factors controlling this process are largely unknown. Here, we used arrayed CRISPR-mediated gene activation and ablation to discover new pSyn129 modulators. Using quadruple-guide RNAs (qgRNAs) and Cas9, or an inactive Cas9 version fused to a synthetic transactivator, we ablated 2304 and activated 2428 human genes related to mitochondrial, trafficking and motility function in HEK293 cells. After exposure of cells to -Syn fibrils, pSyn129 signals were recorded by high-throughput fluorescent microscopy and aggregates were identified by image analysis. We found that pSyn129 was increased by activating the mitochondrial protein OXR1, which decreased ATP levels and altered the mitochondrial membrane potential. Instead, pSyn129 was reduced by ablation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated protein EMC4, which enhanced ER-driven autophagic flux and lysosomal clearance. OXR1 activation preferentially modulated cellular reactions to fibrils derived from multiple system atrophy (MSA) patients, whereas EMC4 ablation broadly reduced pSyn129 across diverse -Syn polymorphs. These findings were confirmed in human iPSC-derived cortical and dopaminergic neurons, where OXR1 preferentially promoted somatic aggregation and EMC4 reduced both somatic and neuritic aggregates. These results uncover previously unrecognized roles for OXR1 and EMC4 in -Syn aggregation, thereby broadening our mechanistic understanding of synucleinopathies."
"Tauopathies are neurodegenerative diseases marked by pathological tau aggregation. While disease-specific folds of insoluble tau filaments have been established, it remains unclear whether the smaller, earlier species also differ across tauopathies. Here, we characterise these small tau aggregates from post-mortem brain of individuals with Alzheimers disease (AD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal degeneration, Picks disease, and healthy controls. Using two complementary single-molecule assays, we confirm that small tau aggregates vary in abundance, morphology, and post-translational modifications. AD features specific long, fibrillar-shaped aggregates enriched in phospho-epitopes, while PSP aggregates are shorter, round, and selectively phosphorylated at serine-356, a site we identify as correlating with markers of inflammation and apoptosis. Aggregate properties co-vary with cellular stress signatures and align with disease-specific seeding profiles, suggesting distinct pathological mechanisms. These findings suggest that small tau aggregates are not a shared intermediate, but instead encode disease-specific mechanisms, with potential as both biomarkers and therapeutic targets.

Key pointsSmall tau aggregates show disease-specific signatures across tauopathies, differing in abundance, morphology, and post-translational modifications.

Tau aggregates in AD show enhanced phosphorylation density and structural heterogeneity, including a distinct population of long fibrillar species detectable in the soluble fraction.

Alzheimers disease is characterised by specific long, fibrillar-shaped tau aggregates enriched in disease-relevant phospho-epitopes.

PSP features round pSer356-positive aggregates that correlate with apoptotic and inflammatory markers, suggesting a distinct mechanism of toxicity.

Isoform-specific biosensor assays reveal divergent seeding behaviour: CBD shows strong 4R seeding, while PSP lacks seeding activity.

Features of small aggregates co-vary with distinct patterns of gliosis and cell stress, suggesting disease-specific mechanisms of tau-mediated toxicity."
"Recent discoveries of aerobic methanotrophs in non-seep carbonate-rich environments in the deep sea suggest that these organisms may persist as part of the rare biosphere. Recovering rare, active methanotrophs through targeted culturing is essential for understanding their persistence under the oligotrophic non-seep conditions, and for uncovering their genomic adaptations related to the survival in energy-limited ecosystems. In our study, using metagenomic analysis of enrichment cultures from the Alpha Crucis Carbonate Ridge, we discovered Methylotuvimicrobium crucis sp. nov., a novel methanotroph representing the rare biosphere in native sediments. Phylogenomic analysis revealed <95% ANI to described species, with genomic evidence of deep-sea specialization including: (1) stress adaptation through cold-shock proteins (CspA) and DNA repair systems (UvrD/LexA), (2) metabolic versatility via complete methane oxidation (pmoABC), nitrogen fixation (nifHDK), and sulfur cycling (sox/sqr) pathways, and (3) niche partitioning through biofilm formation (GGDEF/EAL) and heavy metal resistance (CopZ/CzcD). Comparative genomics identified a 1,234-gene deep-sea core shared with M. sp. wino1, enriched in mobile elements (TnpA, prophages) suggesting horizontal gene transfer drives adaptation. While undetected in situ amplicon surveys, M. crucis exhibited rapid enrichment under methane availability, demonstrating its role as a latent methane filter. These findings contribute for the understanding of the ecological significance of aerobic methanotrophs in deep-sea systems, revealing how rare microbial taxa with genomic plasticity have the potential to influence biogeochemical cycling in deep carbonate-rich environments."
"Observing the activity patterns of large neural populations throughout the brain is essential for understanding neural functions. However, capturing neural interactions across widely distributed brain regions, including both superficial and deep cortical layers, remains challenging with existing microscopy technologies. Here, we introduce a state-of-the-art two-photon microscopy system capable of single-cell resolution imaging across an ultra-large field of view (FOV) exceeding 50 mm{superscript 2}, enabling deep in vivo imaging. To demonstrate its capabilities, we conducted a series of experiments under multiple imaging conditions, successfully visualizing brain structures and neuronal activities spanning a wide spatial range (> 7 mm) from superficial layers to depth reaching up to 900 m in the mouse brain. This versatile imaging platform overcomes traditional spatial constraints, providing a powerful tool for comprehensive exploration of neuronal circuitry over extensive spatial scales with cellular resolution."

"This study provides a comprehensive ultrastructural analysis of the pharyngeal sensory system in Drosophila melanogaster larvae, focusing on the four major pharyngeal sense organs: the ventral pharyngeal sensilla (VPS), dorsal pharyngeal sensilla (DPS), dorsal pharyngeal organ (DPO), and posterior pharyngeal sensilla (PPS). Our analysis revealed 15 sensilla across these organs, comprising four mechanosensory, nine chemosensory, and two dual-function sensilla. We identified 35 Type I neurons (six mechanosensory and 29 chemosensory) and six Type II neurons with putative chemosensory functions. Additional sensory structures, including papilla sensilla and chordotonal organs in the cephalopharyngeal region, were characterized. This detailed mapping and classification of pharyngeal sensory structures completes their structural characterization and provides a foundation for future anatomical and functional studies of sensory perception in insects. This work represents a significant step towards a complete analysis of the larval sensory system, providing new opportunities for investigating how an organism processes sensory information to navigate and interact with its environment."

With the increasing resistance to existing antimalarials, there is an increasing demand in the continuous search for novel therapeutic targets and strategies. Glycogen synthase kinase (pfGSK{beta}) is a key enzyme involved in metabolic processes such as glycogen synthase phosphorylation, cell differentiation and cell proliferation of the malaria parasite. An attempt to exploit this enzyme as a potential target for drug repurposing was investigated. The insilico method investigated in this research work involved the use of Python coding to mine data from the CHEMBL database for possible GSK3{beta} inhibitors. The data mining using Python coding returned 53 potential molecules ranked according to their 1C50 value. The in silico analysis of these compounds using molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations showed that three new molecules, labelled S20 -CHEMBL ID 1910196 (4-[5-(6- hydroxy-1H-indol-2-yl)pyridin-3-yl]benzonitrile), S39- CHEMBL ID 2321945- (2-(7-bromo- 2-hydroxy-1H-indol-3-yl)-3-oxoindole-6-carboxylic acid) and S56-CHEMBL ID 2321951 (methyl 2-(2-hydroxy-1H-indol-3-yl)-3-nitroso-1H-indole-5-carboxylate), are potential molecules that can be used to inhibit pfGSK3{beta}, of all these three molecules compound S56 were found to behave better insilico than S1- (3,6-diamino-4-(2-chlorophenyl)thieno[2,3- b]pyridine-2,5-dicarbonitrile)-the co-crystallised ligand in pfGSK3{beta} which was used as a control for the insilico drug repurposing research because it has already been tested to inhibit pfGSK3{beta}, Finally, Protox III-an online webserver tool for insilico toxicity study was used to give the potential toxicity of the molecules, this will serve as a tool to guide further research in toxicity of the repurposed molecules. In conclusion, we have been able to propose that three new drug molecules, S39, S20 and S56, have the potential of being repurposed for the treatment of Malaria infection."
"Cells in metabolically active tissues with high biosynthetic and secretory demands often use robust stress-responsive mechanisms to maintain endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis. Coordinating such robust stress response mechanisms requires intercellular communication and coordination. Such modalities of intercellular communication have been relatively understudied in the context of stress tolerance. Here, we use the Drosophila melanogaster third instar fat body to demonstrate that adipocytes communicate with each other through intercellular bridges called ring canals to buffer endoplasmic reticulum stress. The fat body supports the exponential growth from embryo to late larval stage over a short period of time through its energy storage and secretory functions, enduring a high basal level of ER stress in the process. We discovered that individual cells in the fat body are paired to one neighboring cell through ring canals. We further demonstrate that ring canals mediate rapid and highly specific intercellular cargo and organellar trafficking, and allow the transport of cytoplasmic, ER-bound and Golgi vesicular proteins. Disrupting fat body ring canals resulted in higher levels of ER stress response markers, aberrant cell size, as well as increased cell lethality in response to exogenous stress. We also find that animals with disrupted fat body ring canals display an overall delay in larval development, likely due to reduced secretion of larval serum proteins from the fat body. In sum, our work reveals a novel feature of intercellular communication in adipose tissue that serves to buffer ER stress across cells which is required for both homeostatic secretory function and maintaining tissue viability under exogenous stress."
"Protein tyrosine kinases activate signaling pathways by catalyzing the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in their substrates. Mounting evidence suggests that, in addition to recognizing phosphorylated tyrosine (pTyr) residues through specific phosphobinding modules, many protein kinases selectively recognize pTyr directly adjacent to the tyrosine residue they phosphorylate and catalyze the formation of twin pTyr-pTyr sites. Here, we demonstrate the importance of this phosphopriming-driven twin pTyr signaling in promoting cell cycle progression through the cell cycle-inhibitory protein p27Kip1. We identify, structurally resolve, and tune two distinct molecular determinants driving the selective recognition of pTyr directly N- and C-terminal to the target phospho-acceptor tyrosine site. We further show structural and biochemical conservation in this recognition, and identify cancer-associated alterations to these determinants that are unable to recognize phosphoprimed substrates. Finally, using an in vivo mouse model of leukemia we show that Bcr-Abl mutants unable to recognize phosphoprimed substrates paradoxically result in enhanced tumor development and progression. These data indicate that Bcr-Abl, like other proto-oncogenes such as Ras or Myc, engages both pro- and anti-oncogenic programs - but in the case of Bcr-Abl, this is accomplished through a mechanism involving traditional and phosphoprimed substrate recognition."
"Solid tumors remain difficult to treat via conventional and novel therapeutic strategies. Immunotherapies such as chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy have been remarkably effective in treating hematological cancers, but their efficacy is limited in solid tumors. Recently, CAR macrophages (CAR-Ms) have emerged as a promising solid tumor immunotherapy, primarily for their intrinsic tumor infiltration and effector functions. However, CAR-Ms are engineered using viral transduction, which is associated with aberrant immunogenicity and toxicity. To overcome these challenges, we developed a bioinspired oxidized lipid nanoparticle (LNP) platform for mRNA-based engineering of human CAR-Ms. A library of 24 ionizable lipids was synthesized, formulated into LNPs, and screened for delivery to human macrophages. The composition of the top LNP was subsequently optimized using an orthogonal design of experiments (DoE) and physicochemical properties, such as size and mRNA encapsulation, were tuned via optimization of microfluidic mixing parameters, yielding a particle that significantly outperformed a gold standard C12-200 LNP. Utilizing small molecule and antibody inhibitors, we demonstrate that uptake of optimized LNPs into macrophages is driven by apolipoprotein E (ApoE) independent macropinocytosis, which is further supported by potent extrahepatic spleen tropism upon intravenous administration to mice. Lastly, we demonstrate the translatability of this LNP platform and utilize it to engineer functional primary human HER2-CAR-Ms ex vivo with potent antigen-specific tumor killing, validated in an ex vivo co-culture with ovarian cancer cells. This bioinspired oxidized LNP platform can potentially be utilized to engineer a range of human CAR-M immunotherapies to treat various types of solid tumors."
"Musculoskeletal disorders, particularly those affecting the shoulder, are a significant health concern, especially in aging populations. Nevertheless, the initiating factors of joint degeneration remain poorly understood. Research has primarily focused on age-related changes in individual musculoskeletal tissues, with limited investigation into the complex interactions between tissues. Recent studies on interorgan communication between musculoskeletal tissues and other organs have gained attention, but local interactions within the shoulder remain underexplored. This study aims to investigate age- and sex-related differences in bone-tendon-muscle (BTM) crosstalk, hypothesizing that these interactions vary by age and sex, with older and female tissues exhibiting a reduced secretory phenotype. Using novel in vitro monoculture and co- cultures of explanted whole tissues, we assessed inflammatory responses across bone, tendon, and muscle from young and aged male and female C57BL/6J mice. Our results demonstrate significant age- and sex-dependent differences in cytokine secretion, with aged males and females showing altered inflammatory profiles. We observed a general increase in pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion in monocultures, with aging amplifying this response. Tissue co-cultures revealed that crosstalk between bone and tendon was primarily mediated through secreted factors, while muscle-tendon communication required physical proximity or contact, suggesting a distinct mode of interaction between these tissues. Sex differences were evident in both the individual tissue responses and in the patterns of inter-tissue communication. Importantly, our findings suggest that tendon plays a crucial role in mediating inter-tissue communication, with aging disrupting this crosstalk. However, these sex differences diminished with aging, indicating that the age-related decline in tissue-specific signaling may override sex-based distinctions."
"KCNA1 encodes the -subunit of the voltage-gated potassium channel KV1.1. Mutations in KV1.1s pore domain result in developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE), where early life seizures and a culprit lesion synergistically disrupt neurodevelopmental trajectories, resulting in intellectual disability that often presents with disturbances in sleep, sociability and sensory processing. Abnormalities in the subcellular localization of Kv1.1, via mutations in/autoantibodies against LGI1 and CNTNAP2, also give rise to syndromes of epilepsy and neuropsychiatric impairment. Mice with deletions of Kcna1(""-/-"") display spontaneous seizures at 2-3 weeks of age and premature mortality. In this study, we applied instrumented home-cage monitoring to examine how aberrations in KCNA1 expression may result in pervasive alterations in spontaneous behavior. Compared to wildtype, Kcna1-/- mice displayed a robust multifaceted behavioral syndrome featuring marked nocturnal hyperactivity, insomnia, reduced sheltering, fragmented feeding/drinking rhythms, sensory over-responsivity and diminished wheel-running. In identical recordings, Kcna1+/- mice only displayed increased sheltering, Lgi1+/- mice displayed mild insomnia and Cntnap2-/- mice showed home-cage hypoactivity. Kcna1 loss in parvalbumin-positive interneurons (Pv-Cre) resulted in a subtle phenocopy, with mild insomnia accompanied by reduced sheltering behavior, while similar deletions in forebrain pyramidal neurons (Emx1-Cre) or dopaminergic neurons (DAT-Cre) were asymptomatic. Adult-onset conditional deletions of Kcna1 also produced only mild insomnia 6 weeks later. To survey the molecular landscape in Kcna1-/- mice, we conducted a mass spectrometry proteomic analysis of dissected hippocampal tissue (a predominant seizure onset zone and where astrogliosis is observed). This revealed significant upregulations in BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) and the immediate early transcription factor EGR3 (early growth response-3), which is necessary for the induction of BDNF following electroconvulsive seizures. Heterozygous or homozygous deletions of Egr3 in Kcna1-/- mice resulted in significant survival prolongation, a partial neurobehavioral rescue, and a significant improvement in the frequency of spontaneous seizures and spreading depolarization events. These clinical improvements were associated with an amelioration of BDNF induction, hippocampal astrogliosis and proteomic disturbances. Together, these data illustrate how an ion channel that governs excitability at millisecond scales also shapes the spatiotemporal structure of spontaneous behavior at meso- or macroscopic time scales. Our results provide a model and a set of precision endpoints to understand how ictal and interictal features of DEE may be ameliorated by inhibiting the long-term downstream transcriptional alterations imparted by early life seizures."
"A genital tract pathogenicity-attenuated Chlamydia muridarum mutant, named intrOv, is being developed into an oral vaccine against C. trachomatis infection in the genital tract. Although wild-type C. muridarum persists in the mouse large intestine for long periods, intrOv is cleared by the group 3 innate lymphoid cells that produce IFN{gamma} (IFN{gamma}+ILC3s). The current study aims to reveal the mechanism by which intrOv induces IFN{gamma}+ILC3s for its own clearance from the large intestine. IntrOv-induced IL-23 and IL-23 signaling were required for the clearance of intrOv from the large intestine. The intrOv clearance depended on dendritic cells, as depletion of CD11c+ cells reduced both IL-23 and IFN-{gamma}, resulting in the growth of intrOv. Deletion of MyD88 from dendritic cells, but not phagocytes or epithelial cells, rescued the growth of intrOv, indicating a critical role of MyD88 signaling in dendritic cells. Furthermore, TLR2/4 signaling is also essential for inhibiting intrOv, as the deficiency in TLR2/4 fully rescues the growth of intrOv. Both the TLR and MyD88 signaling must be in the same dendritic cells to inhibit intrOv, as the growth of intrOv in the MyD88- or TLR2/4-deficient mice was blocked by only wild-type bone marrow-derived dendritic cells but not dendritic cells deficient in either MyD88 or TLR2/4. Thus, we have demonstrated a dendritic cell-intrinsic TLR/MyD88/IL-23 pathway for recruiting effectors to clear intrOv from the large intestine. The information may help further improve the efficacy and safety of intrOv and guide the design of future mucosal vaccines."
"Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy 1 (EDMD1) arises from mutations in EMD. Most EDMD1 patients lack detectable emerin expression. They experience symptoms such as skeletal muscle wasting, joint contractures, and cardiac conduction defects. Currently, physicians rely on treating patient symptoms, without addressing the underlying cause - lack of functional emerin protein. Thus, there is a need for therapeutic approaches that restore emerin protein expression to improve patient outcomes. One way would be to deliver emerin mRNA or protein directly to affected tissues to restore tissue homeostasis. Here, we evaluated the utility of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) to deliver emerin mRNA to diseased cells. LNPs have been studied for decades and have recently been used clinically for vaccination and treatment of myriad of diseases. Here, we show treatment of emerin-null myogenic progenitors with LNPs encapsulating emerin mRNA causes robust emerin protein expression that persists for at least 4 days. Treatment of differentiating emerin-null myogenic progenitors with 2.5 pg/cell emerin LNPs significantly improved their differentiation. Toxicity profiling of emerin mRNA LNP (EMD-LNP) dosing shows little toxicity at the effective dose. These data support the potential use of EMD-LNPs as a viable treatment option and establishes its utility for studying EDMD pathology."
"Acyl carrier proteins (ACPs) are dynamic, structurally-conserved -helical proteins central to many primary and secondary metabolic processes. Whilst prior engineering efforts have focused on strategic mutagenesis and ""helix swaps"", much of the ACP sequence design space remains underexplored. Here, we create diverse variants of the archetypal ACP subclass - AcpP - using a bespoke sequence-generating algorithm (ALGO-CP), which utilises a combined evolutionary and physicochemical design approach. Using ALGO-CP, we generated two soluble candidates - ALGO-055 and ALGO-059 - that can undergo full post-translational modification from apo[-&gt;]holo[-&gt;]acyl forms in vitro, using recombinant modifying enzymes. Building on these successful designs, we further adapted ALGO-CP to produce several chimeras, two of which - chALGO-012 and chALGO-024 - also exhibit full modifiability. Despite in silico predictions of ACP-like helicity, we reveal that these proteins lack the canonical -helical fold of an ACP, whilst remaining soluble and readily modifiable. Of note, both ALGO-055 and ALGO-059 harbour several rare amino acid variations across their sequences, whilst preserving many important acidic ""hotspots"" involved in key protein-protein interactions. By testing the limits of the AcpP design space, our findings suggest that some key aspects of ACP behaviour - specifically, post-translational modification - can be retained independently of the canonical structure. This work establishes a foundation for probing ACP sequence diversity through a hybrid computational-experimental approach.

"Schistosomiasis is a major neglected tropical disease that lacks an effective vaccine and faces increasing challenges from praziquantel resistance, underscoring the urgent need for novel therapeutics. Target-based drug discovery (TBDD) is a powerful strategy for drug development. In this study, we utilized AlphaFold to predict the structures of target proteins from Schistosoma mansoni and Schistosoma japonicum, followed by virtual molecular screening to identify potential inhibitors. Among 202 potential therapeutic targets, we identified 37 proteins with high-accuracy structural predictions suitable for molecular docking with 14,600 compounds. This screening yielded 268 candidate compounds, which were further evaluated in vitro for activity against both adult and juvenile S. mansoni and S. japonicum. Seven compounds exhibited strong anti-schistosomal activity, with HY-B2171A (Carubicin hydrochloride, CH) emerging as the most potent. CH was predicted to target the splicing factor U2AF65, and knockdown of its coding gene Smp_019690 resulted in a phenotype similar to CH treatment. RNA sequencing revealed that both CH treatment and Smp_019690 RNAi disrupted splicing events in the parasites. Further studies demonstrated that CH impairs parasite viability by inhibiting U2AF65 function in mRNA splicing regulation. By integrating RNAi-based target identification with structure-based virtual screening, alongside in vitro phenotypic and molecular analyses of compound-treated schistosomes, our study provides a comprehensive framework for anti-schistosomal drug discovery and identifies promising candidates for further preclinical development.

Author SummarySchistosomiasis is a debilitating disease caused by parasitic worms and affects over 230 million people worldwide. For decades, control of the disease has relied on a single drug, praziquantel, which is less effective against juvenile parasites and increasingly threatened by the risk of drug resistance. To accelerate the discovery of new treatments, we integrated advanced computational tools with molecular validation. Using AlphaFold-predicted structures of 37 key schistosome proteins, we performed large-scale virtual screening to identify promising drug candidates. Over 200 compounds were prioritized for phenotypic screening on two major human-infective schistosome species, leading to the discovery of seven with potent anti-parasitic activity. Among them, Carubicin hydrochloride showed strong efficacy by targeting a critical splicing factor, U2AF65. Inhibiting this protein--either chemically or through gene silencing-- disrupted parasite movement, suppressed cell proliferation, and altered splicing events. Our work highlights the power of integrating AI-based protein modeling with phenotypic and mechanistic validation to accelerate drug discovery for neglected tropical diseases like schistosomiasis."
"During pathogen attack, plants recruit beneficial microbes in a ""cry for help"" to mitigate disease development. Simultaneously, pathogens secrete effectors to promote host colonization through various mechanisms, including targeted host microbiota manipulation. Here, we characterize the Av2 effector of the vascular wilt fungus Verticillium dahliae as a suppressor of the cry for help. Inspired by in silico antimicrobial activity prediction, we investigated the antimicrobial activity of Av2 in vitro. Furthermore, its role in V. dahliae virulence was assessed through microbiota sequencing of inoculated plants, microbial co-cultivation assays, and inoculations in a gnotobiotic plant cultivation system. We show that Av2 inhibits bacterial growth, and acts as a virulence factor during host colonization. Microbiota sequencing revealed involvement of Av2 in suppression of Pseudomonas spp. recruitment upon plant inoculation with V. dahliae, suggesting that Av2 suppresses the cry for help. We show that several Pseudomonas spp. are antagonistic to V. dahliae and sensitive to Av2 treatment. We conclude that V. dahliae secretes Av2 to supress the cry for help by inhibiting the recruitment of antagonistic Pseudomonas spp. to pave the way for successful plant invasion."
"Microbial communities, complex ecological networks crucial for human and planetary health, remain poorly understood in terms of the quantitative principles governing their composition, assembly, and function. Dynamic modeling using ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is a powerful framework for understanding and predicting microbiome behaviors. However, developing reliable ODE models is severely hampered by their nonlinear nature and the presence of significant challenges, particularly critical issues related to identifiability.

Here, we address the identification problem in dynamic microbial community models by proposing an integrated methodology to tackle key challenges. Focusing on nonlinear ODE-based models, we examine four critical pitfalls: identifiability issues (structural and practical), unstable dynamics (potentially leading to numerical blow-up), underfitting (convergence to suboptimal solutions), and overfitting (fitting noise rather than signal). These pitfalls yield unreliable parameter estimates, unrealistic model behavior, and poor generalization. Our study presents a comprehensive workflow incorporating structural and practical identifiability analysis, robust global optimization for calibration, stability checks, and rigorous predictive power assessment. The methodologys effectiveness and versatility in mitigating these pitfalls are demonstrated through case studies of increasing complexity, paving the way for more reliable and mechanistically insightful models of microbial communities.

"Melanopsin-expressing intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) play a critical role in regulating physiological and behavioral responses to light. However, little is known about how melanopsin and ipRGC signals are shaped by the statistical properties of real-world environments. Here, we analyzed statistics of melanopsin, ipRGC codification of extrinsic and intrinsic photoresponses, and luminance using hyperspectral images of natural and human-made scenes under daylight illumination. The statistics were obtained simulating receptive fields from current knowledge about ipRGCs anatomy and physiology. Our findings reveal that human-made environments exhibit significantly higher melanopsin, luminance, and ipRGC excitations compared to natural environments. In natural scenes, luminance contrasts were higher than melanopsin and ipRGC contrasts across most of the range. Melanopsin contrast was largely independent of excitation, and was significantly reduced for larger receptive fields. Differences between ipRGC codification models suggest an interaction between input weighting and environmental structure. These results indicate that modifications of natural regularities by human-made environments could affect ipRGC-driven physiology in everyday life."
"Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a major cause of respiratory infections, particularly among vulnerable populations, yet effective therapeutics remain unavailable. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) offer a promising approach for both treatment and prevention. Here, we describe the discovery and characterization of 4F11, a highly potent and broadly neutralizing mAb with demonstrated in vitro and in vivo efficacy against HMPV. Using cryo-electron microscopy, we defined a unique mechanism of binding HMPV employed by 4F11, which distinguishes it from previously characterized RSV and HMPV mAbs. 4F11 targets an epitope located at the apex of the prefusion F protein (site O) with a 1:1 stoichiometry, distinct from the 3:1 stoichiometry observed with other HMPV site O antibodies. Unlike other site O antibodies, which penetrate the glycan shield between Asn57 and Asn172, 4F11 binds vertically and directly interacts with the Asn172 glycan, representing a unique glycan-dependent mode of recognition. In vitro, 4F11 displayed high potency and broad neutralization across diverse HMPV strains. It also showed a low propensity for resistance development, with only a single escape mutation (K179E) identified, a mutation not found in any published HMPV sequence to date. Viruses rescued with the K179E escape mutation had significantly decreased fitness in vitro compared to wild-type virus. In a hamster challenge model, 4F11 significantly reduced viral loads in both the lungs and nasal turbinates. These findings highlight 4F11 as a promising candidate for therapeutic development, particularly for immunocompromised individuals and other high-risk groups."

"The influenza virus neuraminidase (NA) is a promising target for next-generation influenza vaccines but standardized protocols for NA-based serological assays are lacking. Previous studies have demonstrated discordant results from haemagglutination inhibition and live virus microneutralization assays when comparing matched serum and plasma samples. It is therefore important to consider is the choice of serum or plasma samples in assays measuring influenza virus NA-specific antibodies. Here, we compared antibody titres against influenza A and B virus NAs in matched serum and different types of plasma using an enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA) and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We observed good correlations between titres determined in serum and different types of plasma. However, there was variable and often poor agreement in the nominal titre values obtained from serum and different kinds of plasma in both ELLA and ELISA, with plasma samples often resulting in lower titres compared to serum samples. We also found differences in NA-specific responses to seasonal influenza vaccination assessed in serum versus plasma. Overall, our data demonstrate discrepancies between NA-specific antibody measurements in serum and plasma. We recommend the consistent use of serum as an important part of standardising NA-based serological assays."
"The kynurenine pathway of tryptophan degradation has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and infectious diseases. A key branchpoint in this pathway is production of the metabolite 3-hydroxy-kynurenine (3-HK) by the enzyme kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (Kmo). We have previously reported that administration of exogenous 3-HK promotes survival of zebrafish larvae to Salmonella Typhimurium infection by restricting bacterial expansion via a systemic mechanism that targets kainate sensitive glutamate receptor (KAR) ion channels and that the endogenous production of 3-HK by Kmo is required for defense against systemic Salmonella infection. Here we show that endogenous 3-HK promotes lysosomal acidification to contribute to macrophage microbicidal activity, with its absence leading to increased host susceptibility to infection. Further, 3-HK promotes lysosomal acidification in a KAR-dependent manner. We thus reveal a novel link between KARs and macrophage lysosomal acidification, and a novel mechanism by which 3-HK promotes control of bacterial infection.

Author SummaryStandard therapy for bacterial infections involves antibiotics to clear pathogens. However, the host immune system can also efficiently eliminate bacteria. We have recently shown that a metabolite of the kynurenine metabolic pathway, 3-hydroxy-kynurenine (3-HK), plays a role in the innate immune response to bacterial infection. Here, we show that the kynurenine pathway promotes macrophage clearance of intracellular bacteria by increasing lysosomal acidification of engulfed bacteria and that 3-HK does so by antagonizing kainate receptors. Together, this adds to our understanding of how multiple biological systems, including metabolic and immune pathways, interact to boost defense against bacteria."
"Freshwater ecosystems are under increasing pressure from pollution, habitat degradation, and climate change, highlighting the need for reliable biomonitoring approaches to assess ecosystem health and identify the causes of biodiversity and ecosystem service loss. Characterisation of freshwater microbiomes has the potential to be an important tool for understanding freshwater ecology, ecosystem health and ecosystem function. High-throughput sequencing technologies, such as Illumina short-read and Pacific Biosciences long-read sequencing, are widely used for microbial community analysis. However, the relative performance of these approaches for monitoring freshwater microbiomes has not been well explored. In this study, we compared the performance of long- and short-read sequencing approaches to assess archaeal and bacterial diversity in 42 river biofilm samples across seven distinct river sites in England by targeting the 16S ribosomal RNA gene.

Our findings demonstrated that longer reads generated by PacBio sequencing provide a higher taxonomic resolution, enabling the classification of taxa that remained unassigned in the short-read Illumina datasets. This enhanced resolution is particularly beneficial for biodiversity assessments because it improves species-level identification, which is crucial for ecological monitoring. Despite this, both sequencing methods produced comparable bacterial community structures regarding taxon relative abundance, suggesting that the sequencing approach does not profoundly affect the comparative assessment of community composition. However, while Illumina offers higher throughput and cost efficiency, PacBios ability to resolve complex microbial communities highlights its potential for studies requiring precise taxonomic identification."
"Proper heme biosynthesis is essential for numerous cellular functions across nearly all life forms. In humans, dysregulated heme metabolism is linked to multiple blood diseases, neurodegeneration, cardiovascular disease, and metabolic disorders. Erythroid heme production begins with the rate-limiting enzyme Aminolevulinic Acid Synthase (ALAS2) in the mitochondrion. Although prior studies discuss the regulation of ALAS2 in the nucleus and cytoplasm, its modulation as a mature mitochondrial matrix enzyme remains poorly understood. We report that heme binds mature human ALAS2 with high affinity, acting as a reversible mixed inhibitor that reduces enzymatic activity. Structure-based modeling reveals two flexible regions of ALAS2 interact with heme, locking the enzyme in an inactive conformation and occluding the active site. Our work reveals a negative feedback mechanism for heme synthesis, offering insights into the spatial regulation of ALAS2 and the maturation of the essential heme cofactor."
"Glucocorticoid receptor (GR) activity and maturation are closely regulated by Hsp90 co-chaperones such as FKBP51, FKBP52 and p23. These co-chaperones bind to and regulate the GR, but their mutual interplay, the details of the interactions between them and their temporal dynamics are still unclear.

Here we utilized UV-inducible crosslinking in living cells to map the interaction site of p23 and the GR, as well as p23 and FKBP51 at a single residue resolution. Surprisingly, we detected a novel multi-co-chaperone complex consisting of the GR, p23, FKBP51 and Hsp90, where both FKBP51 and p23 bind to the GR simultaneously. In this complex, FKBP51, but not the close homolog FKBP52, stabilizes the GR-p23 interaction. This is mediated in part by direct contacts between the FK1 domain of FKBP51 and the C-terminus of p23. Our findings refine the state of GR prior to activation, add a new layer of GR regulation by chaperones, provide evidence for the functional differences between FKBP51 and FKBP52, and underscore the power of photocrosslinking to functionally probe protein-protein contacts inside living cells.

"Deinococcus radiodurans is a highly radiation-resistant extremophile with potential for biomanufacturing and bioremediation in harsh environments, including extraterrestrial settings. However, genetic engineering in this organism has been constrained by limited genetic tools. Here, we establish a comprehensive genetic toolkit for D. radiodurans that enables tunable gene regulation with genome-engineering tools. We have standardized a library of 36 constitutive promoter sequences sourced from the native D. radiodurans genome and from synthetic sources, spanning 45-fold range gene expression in the context of plasmids. We have also identified 136 variants of ribosome binding sites (RBS), variants using a high-throughput screen for precise translational control across a 963-fold range of expression when used in our plasmid-based system. Additionally, we have developed a codon-optimizer script that we leverage to improve the function of four fluorescent proteins in D. radiodurans. Next, we characterized 9 small molecule-inducible promoter systems, and identified four key inducible promoter systems that achieve between 3-fold and 12-fold signal amplification, as well as titratability across induction concentrations in D. radiodurans. To engineer the D. radiodurans genome, we present a novel method for gene integrations, compatible with de novo sequences, up to 3kB in length, doing so with 87% efficiency. Lastly, we repurpose the RNA-directed nuclease, TnpB, as a novel post-transcriptional tool for programmable gene repression analogous to CRISPRi-based systems, and this tool can achieve up to 70% repression of its target. Collectively, this toolkit provides modular, standardized components for both plasmid engineering and chromosomal engineering in D. radiodurans to improve its genetic tractability and to facilitate its deployment.

"Carbonic anhydrase accelerates the hydration of carbon dioxide (CO2) and is an attractive biocatalyst for carbon capture and utilization processes. Acinetobacter sp. Tol 5 shows high adhesiveness to materials due to its cell surface protein AtaA. Previously, we developed a method for immobilizing bacteria using AtaA and demonstrated its application to gas-phase bioproduction. In this study, we aimed to develop Tol 5 cells expressing carbonic anhydrase and to evaluate CO2 conversion ability as a whole-cell biocatalyst. A codon-optimized carbonic anhydrase from Sulfurihydrogenibium yellowstonense (SyCA) was first produced in the cytoplasm. Western blotting confirmed expression, but the Wilbur-Anderson unit assay showed little carbonic anhydrase activity as a whole-cell biocatalyst. To enhance activity, we fused six signal peptides (SPs) to SyCA for periplasmic expression: PelB and TorA from Escherichia coli, the Sec-type SP of Tol 5 outer-membrane protein Omp38, and three putative Tat-type SPs from Tol 5. All constructs except the one fused to the SP of PelB produced SyCA protein. The Omp38-SP fused SyCA was correctly processed to the expected molecular size and exhibited increased whole-cell carbonic anhydrase activity, whereas other SPs were not processed and showed smaller activities. These results show that periplasmic expression of SyCA with a suitable SP is important for efficient CO2 hydration in Tol 5. The integration of the adhesive properties of Tol 5 with engineered periplasmic expression of SyCA will lead to a simple platform for whole-cell biocatalysts in gas-phase carbon capture and utilization applications."

"The continued effective control of retroviral infection will no doubt require the development of new clinical interventions targeting underexploited areas of retroviral biology such as genome selection and virion assembly. In our previous work, we demonstrated that both the Gag-psi ({Psi}) interaction and genomic RNA (gRNA) dimerization each uniquely contribute to the formation, morphology, and stability of RSV Gag-viral RNA (vRNA) biomolecular condensates (BMCs). The present work builds upon those observations, utilizing atomic force microscopy (AFM) and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) to elucidate the nanoscale morphology, resistance to mechanical deformation, and constituent diffusivity of RSV Gag-vRNA BMCs. These approaches revealed a novel role for gRNA dimerization in nanoscale condensate architecture and mechanical stability that aids in our understanding of why gRNA dimerization is so critical for efficient packaging of the retroviral genome. Further biophysical characterization of RSV Gag-gRNA BMCs therefore possesses great potential to reveal novel avenues for therapeutic intervention."
"Tryptophan is an essential amino acid required not only for protein biosynthesis but also for the production of several physiologically important metabolites, including serotonin, kynurenine, and nicotinamide. Although dietary tryptophan is associated with various health benefits, excessive intake can result in adverse physiological effects. The specific tryptophan-derived metabolites responsible for such toxicity, however, remain incompletely characterized. Here, we investigate the mechanisms underlying tryptophan-induced toxicity in Caenorhabditis elegans. We observe that tryptophan concentrations of 1 mM or higher are highly toxic to C. elegans, blocking egg hatching. Notably, supplementation with various sugars alleviates this toxicity. Genetic analyses reveal that host tryptophan metabolism is dispensable for the observed effects. Instead, bacterial metabolism, particularly the conversion of tryptophan to indole, is essential for mediating toxicity. Bacterial strains deficient in indole production abolished tryptophan-induced toxicity, and all sugars that conferred protection also suppressed bacterial indole synthesis. These findings demonstrate that tryptophan toxicity in C. elegans is primarily mediated by microbial metabolism and underscore the pivotal role of host-microbiota interactions in shaping the physiological consequences of dietary amino acid intake."

"Amino acids play critical roles in the activation and function of lymphocytes. Here we show that the non-essential amino acid, asparagine, is essential for optimal activation and proliferation of CD4+ T cells. We demonstrate that asparagine depletion at different time points after CD4+ T cell activation reduces mitochondrial membrane potential and function. Furthermore, asparagine depletion at specific time points during CD4+ T cell differentiation reduces cytokine production in multiple CD4+ T cell subsets. In an adoptive transfer model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), myelin oligodendrocyte-specific pathogenic T helper 17 cells differentiated under Asn-deficient conditions exhibited reduced encephalitogenic potential and attenuated EAE severity. In a model of EAE induced by active immunization, therapeutic depletion of extracellular Asn significantly reduced disease severity. These results identify asparagine as a key metabolic regulator of the pathogenicity of autoreactive CD4+ T cells and suggest that targeting asparagine metabolism may be a novel therapeutic strategy for autoimmunity."
"It is estimated that in excess of 10 million people around the globe are affected by severe asthma and fungal sensitisation (SAFS) or allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), severe asthma endotypes driven by hypersensitivity to environmentally ubiquitous fungal pathogens, primarily Aspergillus fumigatus. Here, we sought to define the immunological pathways underlying these allergic fungal airway diseases. To do so, we exploit the chronic exposure repeat challenge model using live A. fumigatus conidia to systematically define the key immunological pathways driving airway inflammation in allergic fungal airway disease. In response to daily intranasal challenge, we observed increased absolute numbers of neutrophils and eosinophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), characteristic of human allergic fungal airway disease, with significant depletion of the alveolar macrophage population. Transcriptomic analysis of BALF cells identified increased expression of IL-1 family cytokines and receptors including IL-1{beta}, IL-1RL1, IL-1R2 and the IL-18 binding protein. Complementary proteomic analysis of BALF revealed increased levels of cell death related proteins calprotectin and IL-1 Receptor Accessory Protein (IL-1RAP). Targeting IL-1RAP, using knockout mice, led to selective reduction in eosinophilia, IL-5 and IL-13 in the airways without impairment of fungal killing. This study identifies a role for IL-1RAP in the generation of eosinophilia independent of neutrophil influx and highlights its potential as a novel immunotherapeutic target for the treatment of allergic fungal airway disease.

Author SummaryAllergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is a form of lung disease primarily affecting those with asthma or cystic fibrosis induced by the ubiquitous pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus. Understanding the immunological mechanisms contributing to this airway disease is important for the development of novel treatments to improve quality of life and preserve lung function. In this study, we show that an Aspergillus fumigatus repeat challenge model phenocopies immunological features of allergic fungal airway disease and is hallmarked by increased IL-1 family signalling. We identify the IL-1RAP as a contributor to eosinophilia and the release of Type 2 cytokines during allergic fungal airway disease. This work represents major step in describing the molecular mechanisms of airway eosinophilia in response to fungal exposure and lays the groundwork for further dissection of inflammatory pathways to target with immunotherapeutic approaches."
"Measles virus (MeV) is a highly contagious pathogen capable of infecting immune cells and thereby causing immunosuppression and immune amnesia. A live-attenuated MeV vaccine is highly efficacious and has been safely administered for over 60 years. However, a detailed mechanistic understanding of the mode of its attenuation remains elusive. Here, we determined the molecular mechanisms underlying MeV vaccine attenuation in primary human immune cells. Enhanced infection of innate immune cells resulting in uncontrolled viral RNA synthesis and reduced ability to evade host antiviral responses induced a strong type-I interferon signature that arrested replication of the vaccine strain. In contrast, the wild type virus replicated slowly but steadily, avoiding detection by innate immunity."
"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) involves progressive muscle degeneration associated with calcium dysregulation, but the mechanisms linking extracellular matrix (ECM) integrity to calcium homeostasis remain unclear. We investigated whether MUA- 3, a fibrillin-related ECM protein in Caenorhabditis elegans, contributes to calcium regulation in dystrophic muscle. Using fluorescent calcium imaging in transgenic worms expressing muscle-specific GCaMP2, we found that downregulating mua-3 selectively elevated resting calcium levels in healthy muscle but had no effect in dystrophic (dys-1) muscle, suggesting impaired MUA-3 function in dystrophy. Despite altered calcium dynamics, mua-3 downregulation did not affect locomotor function. In human dystrophic myoblasts, we observed significantly elevated sarcoplasmic calcium levels concurrent with substantial downregulation of fibrillin genes FBN1/FBN2. These findings demonstrate that fibrillin-related proteins regulate calcium homeostasis across species, suggesting that ECM integrity directly contributes to cellular calcium control in muscle. This work identifies a conserved mechanism linking extracellular matrix stability to intracellular calcium regulation and suggests that targeting ECM-calcium coupling may offer new therapeutic approaches for muscular dystrophy."
"Age-related retinopathy, primarily comprising age-related macular degeneration (AMD), is a major cause of irreversible blindness in the elderly population worldwide. Although its precise mechanisms remain incompletely understood, autophagy deficiency in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells has been associated with AMD in patients; however, the regulatory pathways involved are not fully elucidated. In this study, we report that deficiency in the Dapl1 gene inhibits RPE cell autophagy and leads to age-dependent retinal pathologies in mice.

Specifically, 18-month-old Dapl1-/- mice manifest age-related retinal dysfunction and structural abnormities, including increased retinal stress, photoreceptor/RPE cell damage, lipid aggregates and microglial activation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that autophagy is impaired in the RPE cells of Dapl1-/- mice, while overexpression of DAPL1 in RPE cells enhances autophagy activity. Mechanistically, we elucidate that DAPL1 suppresses the expression of E2F1 and c-MYC, which consequently downregulates mTOR and upregulates ATG16 and Beclin1 expression via DAPK1 in RPE cells, thereby promoting autophagy. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that DAPL1 acts as a novel regulator of autophagy in RPE cells, and its deficiency increases susceptibility to age-dependent retinal pathologies in mice."
"Single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has revolutionized structural biology by enabling high-resolution determination of macromolecular structures. However, the field faces challenges in data management, processing workflow integration, and software extensibility. We present Magellon, an innovative cryo-EM software platform that addresses these challenges through a modern microservices architecture. Magellon consists of an extensible backend with a web-based front end that we call Magellon Viewer. Together, these combine high-performance computing capabilities with an intuitive user interface, enabling researchers to efficiently process and analyze cryo-EM data. The platforms distinguishing features include a plugin-based architecture, distributed processing capabilities, comprehensive monitoring systems, and a novel approach to data organization and visualization. A key philosophy of the approach is that the Magellon backend provides a platform that uses robust industry-standard libraries to orchestrate computational tasks while offering users and developers flexibility in selecting the computational resources for performing calculations. Magellon represents a significant advancement in cryo-EM software infrastructure, offering flexibility, scalability, and extensibility while maintaining ease of use."
"A small percentage of the general population reports almost constant humming or pulsing low-frequency sound percepts (LFSPs) while others in their vicinity, such as family members, often do not perceive these sounds. The origin of these LFSPs remains to be elucidated and may or may not be related to external sound sources. The underlying causes of these perceptions could also be subjective and belong to the tinnitus family, especially in cases where no external sound source sufficiently explaining the LFSP can be found. The present study puts forth two hypotheses to explain the phenomenon, based on both subjective and objective auditory phenomena: an unusually high auditory sensitivity to low-frequency sound, and hearing ones own low-frequency spontaneous otoacoustic emissions (SOAEs), sounds actively produced by the inner ear as a normal, physiological by-product of cochlear amplification. The present study employed high-resolution, low-frequency hearing threshold measurements and SOAE measurements in 28 individuals with LFSPs, and in control groups devoid of LFSPs. LFSP complainants self-reported hearing a LFSP at a median frequency of 50 Hz obtained with a frequency-matching procedure. With a few clear exceptions, complainants most often did not present unusually sensitive low-frequency hearing thresholds. Furthermore, hearing threshold fine structure was comparable to the control group. In addition, no SOAEs in the low-frequency range could be measured. Based on our results, while cases of hearing physical external sound sources are not ruled out, we suggest that a subjective tinnitus-like phenomenon in the low-frequency range is often the reason behind hearing these LFSPs."
"Tinnitus is the perception of sounds without external stimuli, affecting 10%-15% of the general population and up to 25% of individuals over 70 years of age. While traditionally viewed as an auditory phenomenon, growing evidence highlights the role of the central nervous system in its pathophysiology. One of the proposed mechanisms, the ""gating hypothesis"" of tinnitus, suggests an alteration in the modulation of sensory activity by the frontostriatal network. Although structural changes in frontal areas support this idea, gray matter differences in subcortical regions--such as the auditory pathway and basal ganglia-- remain poorly understood. Here, we examined subcortical structures and auditory function in older adults with mild presbycusis from the ANDES cohort, including 51 tinnitus patients and 40 age-matched controls. We analyzed brain volume via structural magnetic resonance imaging and subcortical auditory functionality via auditory brainstem responses (ABRs). We found non-significant differences in age, hearing loss, cognitive performance, and ABR amplitudes between the groups. Notably, tinnitus patients presented a significant increase in the volume of basal ganglia structures (striatum and pallidum) but not in auditory areas. These findings reinforce the role of the basal ganglia in age-related tinnitus pathophysiology."
"Recent advances in electron microscopy and computer vision have enabled the mapping of complete wiring diagrams--called connectomes--of brain regions and even entire brains. The emergence of these increasingly large-scale connectomic datasets have intensified the need for efficient and accurate neuronal cell type identification. Traditional approaches rely on labor-intensive analyses of molecular, anatomical, and physiological features. As a step toward fully automated neuronal cell type classification, we present NTAC (Neuronal Type Assignment from Connectivity) -- a method for grouping neurons into cell types based solely on synaptic connectivity. Our approach is grounded in the hypothesis that synaptic connectivity is key to determining neuronal cell types (Seung 2012), and our results provide the strongest evidence to date supporting its validity.

NTAC comes in two flavors: a semi-supervised variant that requires some of the neurons to be labeled, and an unsupervised variant that requires no labels at all. The first can be naturally formalized as a learning problem on graphs: given labels for a subset of neurons, use connectivity to label the rest. We present a simple and fast algorithm that achieves over 95% accuracy on the flys visual system starting with just 2% of neurons labeled, within minutes on a standard PC. In contrast, morphology based parallel achieves lower accuracy even on smaller datasets and with significantly more labels.

Formalizing the problem as a fully unsupervised learning task is more challenging. To address this, we introduce a novel computational problem, approximate equitable partitioning, and design an efficient heuristic for it, using the semi-supervised algorithm as a subroutine. Remarkably, the unsupervised method achieves [~]70% accuracy on the flys visual system, drastically outperforming its morphology based parallel and providing concrete evidence that synaptic connectivity alone can reveal cell types.

Both variants of NTAC are evaluated on multiple state of the art connectomes including optic lobes, central brain and nerve cord of adult fruit flies."
"Neural circuits consist of neurons that differ not only in their neurotransmitter identities but also in the types and subcellular localization of neurotransmitter receptors (NRs) they express. This receptor diversity enables distinct responses to the same neurotransmitter, highlighting the need to understand NR distribution and function to fully interpret circuit logic. Here, we focus on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), the primary mediators of fast excitatory transmission in the Drosophila central nervous system (CNS). Functional nAChRs are pentamers assembled from a pool of 10 subunits (1-7, {beta}1-{beta}3), yet their in vivo expression and function remain poorly defined.

We used T2A-Gal4 lines and endogenous protein tagging to examine nAChR expression in larval motor neurons (MNs) and identified eight subunits (1-3, 5-7, {beta}1, {beta}2) expressed in these cells. MN-specific knockdown of individual subunits caused distinct locomotor defects, indicating their functional importance. Co-localization analysis revealed some subunit pairs are frequently co-expressed at the same synapses, while others localize to distinct subcellular domains. Supporting this, double knockdown of co-localized subunits did not worsen locomotor phenotypes compared to single knockdowns, whereas knockdown of non-co-localized subunit pairs produced additive defects.

These results suggest that different nAChR subtypes are strategically positioned in discrete synaptic domains within single MNs, where they serve non-redundant roles. Our findings provide new insight into the spatial organization and functional diversity of nAChRs in motor circuits that drive locomotion.

Significance StatementMotor circuits rely on precise neurotransmitter signaling, yet the diversity and subcellular organization of neurotransmitter receptors remain poorly understood. Using Drosophila larvae, we show that motor neurons express multiple nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunits, which localize to distinct synaptic domains and play non-redundant roles in locomotion. These findings reveal a previously underappreciated level of receptor compartmentalization within single neurons and demonstrate that spatially organized nAChRs are essential for coordinated movement. By integrating genetic, imaging, and behavioral approaches, our work provides a new framework for understanding how receptor diversity shapes motor output and highlights the importance of mapping receptor localization to decode circuit function in both health and disease."
"The present study investigated whether adaptive suppression mechanisms can be applied to stimuli with a history of threat association. In the experiment, a threat-conditioning task was first used to associate one of two colors--green or cyan--with an electric shock, thereby establishing conditions of threat-history and no-threat-history. Subsequently, in a visual search task, 30 participants reported the orientation of the line inside the target diamond while occasionally being either undistracted or distracted by threat-history or no-threat-history distractors, which appeared across various spatial locations. The results showed that distractors appearing at high-probability locations were effectively suppressed, with suppression being stronger for threat-history distractors than for no-threat-history distractors. These findings indicate that threat history may facilitate visual search through an adaptive attentional suppression mechanism."
"Selecting a suitable animal model is crucial in understanding infectious diseases and developing vaccines. Here, we developed a receptor-binding domain -based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine with mouse Fc an immunopotentiator in a mink model. Four different variations of the vaccine were tested in groups of 30-31 American mink and followed for IgG and neutralizing antibodies (nAb) up to 27 weeks. Subcutaneous version induced a strong IgG and nAb response within two weeks and was still detectable at 27 weeks. Intranasal version also caused a detectable, although weaker, immune response. A simultaneously given subcutaneous vaccine against virus enteritis, botulism and hemorrhagic pneumonia potentially caused a lower SARS-CoV-2 antibody response, highlighting the need for further studies on co-effects of vaccines. In virus challenge with Alpha variant (B.1.1.7), vaccinated mink had a stronger antibody response than unvaccinated mink. Despite not preventing the infection, vaccinated mink had milder clinical signs and less virus in saliva. Another challenge of unvaccinated mink with Omicron variant showed similar results to alpha (BA.1) variant. Virus RNA was detected in the brain of unvaccinated mink but not vaccinated mink by in situ hybridization, indicating a suitability of mink to study neurological effects of SARS-CoV-2 and potentially long COVID as well.

Author summaryFinding a good animal model is very important in studying infectious diseases and their treatment. The recent SARS-CoV2 pandemic highlighted this dilemma. We have developed an animal model based on mink due to their close match to humans in the symptomology of this disease. Such model will enable the study of relative susceptibility, transmission, tissue tropism, complex pathogenesis and long COVID, as well as prophylaxis and vaccines. This model will also help reduce the use of primates in this research.

We have further developed a new vaccine for SARS-CoV2 based on the receptor binding domain of the S-protein with an inbuilt immune-enhancer. This vaccine underwent extensive testing in mink to determine response, long term protection, and safety. The vaccine was found to provide excellent titers of neutralizing antibodies with wide range in target variants. It also reduced the severity and duration of visible symptoms in the animals significantly. We propose this vaccine candidate for further study and future commercialization."
"Bacterial pathogens commonly become drug resistant via horizontal acquisition of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs), which are often encoded on mobile genetic elements (MGEs). Although bacterial defence systems are typically considered barriers to horizontal gene transfer (HGT), previous studies revealed that bacteria with more restriction-modification (RM) systems (the most abundant bacterial defences) frequently carry more MGEs. It was suggested that this counterintuitive relationship might result from stronger selection for RM systems when exposure to costly MGEs increases. Here, we test this hypothesis using a combination of modelling and bioinformatics analysis of >40,000 bacterial genomes to better understand how eco-evolutionary feedbacks between selection for RM and acquisition of MGEs shape bacterial genome evolution. Our model predicts negative associations between HGT and RM, but only if RM diversity is high. By contrast, at low RM diversity, eco-evolutionary feedbacks drive the emergence of positive associations between HGT and RM. Consistent with these predictions, we identified negative relationships between acquired ARG counts and RM counts across species but positive relationships within individual species. Collectively, our work helps to understand how RM systems shape patterns of HGT of ARGs, which may offer opportunities for targeted surveillance of strains at higher risk of horizontally acquiring novel drug resistance alleles.

Significance statementPrevious research shows positive associations between bacterial restriction-modification (RM) systems and mobile genes, despite RM being well-evidenced as a barrier to mobile gene acquisition. Eco-evolutionary feedbacks have been hypothesised to drive this; higher HGT exposure will select for greater RM investment, while still leading to increased mobile gene acquisition. By formalising this hypothesis into a mathematical model and analysing bacterial genomes, we reveal novel insights into how the relationship between RM and mobile antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) depends on ecological variables. This study illustrates that to better comprehend how defence systems regulate gene transfer in natural communities, it is essential to consider both their mechanisms and the complex eco-evolutionary dynamics at play."
"O_LIA critical consequence of joining social groups is the possibility of social transmission of information from conspecifics related to novel behaviours or resources. Mathematical models of spreading have been developed leading to several established methods of inferring whether information spreads via social or individual learning. Network-based diffusion analysis (NBDA) has emerged as a leading frequentist framework for inferring and quantifying social transmission, particularly in non-human animal populations.
C_LIO_LINBDA has been extended several times to account for multiple diffusions, multiple networks, individual-level variables, and complex transmission functions. Bayesian implementations of NBDA were introduced in two prior studies. However, there is not yet a user-friendly package to implement a Bayesian NBDA, and the approach has seen limited usage by other researchers.
C_LIO_LIHere, we present a unified framework for performing Bayesian analysis of social transmission using NBDA-type models, implemented in the widely used Stan programming language. We provide a user-friendly R package ""STbayes"" (ST: social transmission) for other researchers to easily use this framework. STbayes accepts user-formatted data, but can also import data directly from the existing NBDA R package. Based on the data users provide, STbayes automatically generates multi-network, multi-diffusion models that allow for individual covariates that may influence transmission, as well as individual-level varying (random) effects.
C_LIO_LIUsing simulated data, we demonstrate that this model can accurately differentiate the relative contribution of individual and social learning in the spread of information through networked populations. We illustrate how incorporating upstream uncertainty about the relationships between individuals in the social group can improve model fit. We show that our framework can be used to infer complex transmission rules and describe a new parameterization of frequency-dependent transmission that is more numerically stable than prior parameterizations. Finally, we introduce support for dynamic transmission weights and a ""high-resolution"" data mode, which allows users to make use of fine-scale data collected by contemporary automated tracking methods. These extensions increase the set of contexts that this type of model may be used for.

"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections remain a public health concern worldwide. Viral antigen triggered innate immune response leads to induction of interferons (IFNs) and interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) including ADAR1 p150 isoform, which edits adenosine (A) residues within double stranded RNAs in both the virus and the host. Such RNA editing mediated by ADARs plays a crucial role in innate immune responses during viral infections through modulation of host-virus interactions. Additionally, ADAR editing acts post-transcriptionally, and serves as a mechanism of dynamic regulation of transcriptome and proteome diversity. While evidence points to changes in ADAR editing during infection, we do not know whether editing targets change over the course of the infection. Here, we explored temporal changes in ADAR expression and editing patterns, across three distinct stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, we examined whether infection-triggered dysregulation in ADAR editing persists or returns to pre-infection states post-viral clearance. We addressed this question by analyzing publicly available whole blood RNA sequencing samples from forty-five, age-matched individuals. The individuals selected had no documented comorbidities, developed mild COVID-19, and were sampled across three distinct stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection: pre-, mid-, and post-infection. Our results demonstrate dynamic changes in ADAR expression and editing across the three stages. We further identified unique editing sites resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection, across all three stages of infection, within genes involved in immune response pathways. Noteworthy, genes within neutrophil degranulation pathway appear to be edited, suggesting they may play a role in inflammation and sequelae observed post-SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our results demonstrate a consistent trend of elevated ADAR expression and reduced overall ADAR editing within each individual mid-infection. Subsequently, in some post-infection samples ADAR expression returns to approximately pre-infection levels, while in others it remains dysregulated. These differences may be contributing to heterogeneity in disease outcomes seen in individuals post-SARS-CoV-2 infection."
"BackgroundLong COVID-19 often manifests as persistent cognitive impairments, commonly referred to as brain fog, with poorly understood biological mechanisms. Previous studies highlighted neuroinflammation and blood-brain barrier disruption. Here, we identify distinct biomarkers and dysregulated pathways, with a focus on cardiovascular and neurovascular involvement.

MethodsWe analyzed public RNA-sequencing data (GEO: GSE251849) comparing long COVID-19 patients with brain fog, long COVID-19 patients without cognitive symptoms, convalescent patients, and healthy controls. Differential gene expression, principal component analysis, and pathway enrichment analyses were performed using DESeq2, KEGG, GO, and Enrichr tools.

ResultsOur analysis revealed a distinct gene expression profile in patients with brain fog, identifying exclusive biomarkers such as NRCAM, GRIN2C, NOS2, and EDNRB. Pathway analysis revealed significant dysregulation in cardiovascular, calcium signaling, and relaxin signaling pathways, suggesting novel biological mechanisms that contribute to cognitive impairment. These findings expand beyond neuroinflammation and highlight potential cardiovascular involvement in long COVID-related cognitive dysfunction.

ConclusionOur study reveals novel transcriptomic signatures that highlight cardiovascular and neurovascular dysregulation, providing promising diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Future research should validate these findings and investigate therapeutic interventions addressing these unique pathways."
"In this report, we evaluate eye-movements during reading. There is a huge literature on this topic, but our report is not focused on the typical questions raised in this literature and our task design is very atypical for an eye-movement/reading study. While most reading studies evaluate mental processes during reading, the only mental process we evaluate is fatigue. While most reading studies use stimuli presented in the middle of the screen, our poem sections are presented in 24 lines of text that span the top to the bottom of the display. While most multi-line reading studies use a very large interline spacing, our interline spacing is more typical of text reading in newspapers, magazines and books. We report on changes in the characteristics of fixations as a function of time-on-task (TOT). We determine the start and end of reading for each subject/session and divide this reading time into 10 equal length (number of samples) periods (referred to as epochs). We looked for changes in fixation characteristics across epochs. We emphasize our results for horizontal position because these changes were monotonic and interpretable. For horizontal position signals, we found that the mean intersample distances in fixations increases, the rate of changes of fixation position decreases and the total fixation width increases as a function of epoch. We interpret our results to mean that, as reading progresses, it becomes more difficult to hold the eye still. Early in reading, the total fixation width is lower, the mean intersample distance is lower and there are frequent adjustments (i.e., changes in direction) to keep the eye well focused on the target word. As time progresses, it becomes more and more difficult to hold the eye perfectly steady, so fixations become wider and mean intersample distance increases."
"Neuronal size has often been used to explain the ""superiority"" of the human brain. By deriving the Shannon entropy of different statistical distributions, we show that the entropy of different distributions is solely accounted for by the variance of the distribution. We use total dendritic length of neurons from different species as an example to show that entropy computed from TDL distributions has nothing to do with the absolute size of neurons, but the increased variance seen in the larger neurons."
"Genetic resistance is an important mitigation strategy in commercial tomato cultivation against leaf mold disease caused by the fungal pathogen Fulvia fulva. In recent years, the widely deployed Cf-9 resistance locus has been overcome, which has prompted breeders to deploy the novel resistance locus Cf-6. However, Cf-6-mediated resistance has already been overcome in several locations worldwide. To date, the identity of Cf-6, as well as the gene encoding the matching Avr6 effector from F. fulva have remained unknown. Here, we report the identification of Avr6 using a comparative genomics strategy. Whole genome sequencing of Cf-6-breaking F. fulva strains revealed that the gene coding for the known secreted effector Ecp5 is either deleted or mutated in these strains. Ecp5 was subsequently confirmed to be Avr6 through potato virus X-mediated expression in Cf-6 tomato plants, as well as by gene knockout and complementation experiments. Using the Avr6-triggered hypersensitive response as a marker for disease resistance, we mapped the Cf-6 locus to the short arm of chromosome 12 in tomato. In addition to identifying Avr6 and setting the foundation for cloning of Cf-6, this work highlights the urgent need for more research into durable gene-for-gene resistance in tomato against F. fulva."
"Methanol, the simplest alcohol, has long been recognized as a key energy and carbon source for soil and plant-associated bacteria and fungi, and is increasingly recognized as an important substrate for marine bacteria. Lanthanide-dependent methanol dehydrogenases (encoded by the gene xoxF) are now recognized as the key catalysts for methylotrophy in many environments, yet the identity of the most transcriptionally active methylotrophs (""Clade X"") has remained elusive. Here we show that ""Clade X"" methylotrophs belong to the deep-branching alphaproteobacterial order TMED127, which we propose be renamed  Methylaecorales;  methyl for  methylotrophic metabolism and  aecor for  ocean surface, as these bacteria are most transcriptionally active near the sea surface. TMED127/Methylaecorales have small, streamlined genomes ([~]1.5 Mb) and appear to be obligate methylotrophs that use the serine cycle for carbon assimilation. TMED127/Methylaecorales showed a diel pattern of xoxF5 and glucose dehydrogenase (gdh) transcription, peaking in the late afternoon, in oligotrophic surface water of the Sargasso Sea. Several other highly transcribed genes of unknown function had no homologs outside of TMED127/Methylaecorales genomes. Our findings illuminate an overlooked marine methylotrophic bacterium and predict a diel cycle of methanol production in surface seawater by an unknown pathway.

ImportanceMethanol metabolism is increasingly recognized as an important process in the marine carbon cycle, yet the identity and metabolism of the microorganisms mediating methylotrophy in the open ocean have remained unknown. This study reveals that bacteria in the TMED127 order of Alphaproteobacteria, proposed new name of ""Methylaecorales"", abundantly transcribe the key gene for lanthanide-dependent methylotrophy in oligotrophic surface waters of the worlds oceans. TMED127/Methylaecorales likely require methanol as a carbon and energy source, and display a diel pattern of transcription of key genes for methylotrophy that peaks in the late afternoon. These findings motivate future studies on the mechanisms of methanol production in surface seawater."
"This study evaluated potency of antifungals against the rare emerging yeast causing VVC under the influence of acid pH (4.5). The antifungal susceptibility was evaluated by CLSI-M27A4 for 25 isolates represented 11 rare yeast species recovered from VVC patients. Among 11 yeast species (25 isolates), Clavispora lusitaniae (n=9) was the most common species, followed by Cyberlindnera fabianii (n=4), Kodamaea ohmeri, Candida metapsilosis and Candida bracarensis (n=2, respectively), Pichia norvegensis, Kluyveromyces marxianus, Diutina rugosa, Tricholoma matsutake, Candida nivariensis and Candida africana (n=1, respectively). The antifungal agents most affected by a lower pH were terconazole (4-fold higher, MIC >0.5-8mg/L) to all 11 yeast species; followed by amphotericin B (3-fold higher, MIC >2mg/L) to 9 species except K. ohmeri and D. rugose; nystatin (2-fold higher, MIC >2 - 4 mg/L) to 9 species except C. nivariensis and C.africana; micafungin (2-fold higher, MIC >0.125 - 1 mg/L) to 8 species except C. metapsilosis, D. rugosa and Tricholoma matsutake by acid pH, respectively. 5-flucytosine was not affected by pH to all tested yeast species, and maintained activity at low PH.

The rare yeast species tested shared high MICs of terconazole, amphotericin B, nystatin at pH4.5 compared with those at pH7.0. The in vitro antifungal susceptibility at pH 7.0 did not consistently predict the activity of antifungals against those rare yeast species at vaginal acidic pH. Further investigations assessing the clinical utility of antifungal susceptibility testing should take these findings into consideration."
"The primary source of carbon is one of the most fundamental questions regarding the development of microbial communities in serpentinite-hosted systems. The hydration of ultramafic rock to serpentinites generates hydrogen and creates hyper-alkaline conditions that deplete the environment of dissolved inorganic carbon. Metagenomic studies suggest that serpentinite-hosted microbial communities depend on the local redissolution of bicarbonate as well as on small organic molecules produced by abiotic reactions associated with serpentinization. To test these hypotheses, microbial consortia collected from the Prony Bay hydrothermal field were grown under anoxic conditions in hydrogen-fed bioreactors using bicarbonate, formate, acetate, or glycine as the sole carbon source. In contrast to glycine, the other three carbon substrates allowed the growth of microbial consortia characterized by significant enrichment of individual taxa. Surprisingly, these taxa were dominated by microbial genera characterized as aerobic rather than anaerobic as expected. We propose that an intricate feedback loop between autotrophic and heterotrophic foundation species facilitates the establishment of serpentinite-hosted shallow subsurface ecosystems. Bicarbonate-fixing Meiothermus and Hydrogenophaga, as well as formate-fixing Meiothermus, Thioalkalimicrobium, and possibly a novel genotype of Roseibaca might produce organic compounds for heterotrophs at the first trophic level. In addition, the base of the trophic network may include heterotrophic Roseibaca, Acetoanaerobium, and Meiothermus species producing CO2 from acetate for a more diverse community of autotrophs. The cultivated archaeal community is expected to recycle CH4 and CO2 between Methanomicrobiales and Methanosarcinales with putative Woesearchaeales symbionts."
"Natural genetic code expansion is a phenomenon wherein an additional amino acid is encoded by a stop codon. These non-standard amino acids are beneficial as they facilitate novel biochemical reactions. However, code expansion leads to ambiguity at the recoded stop codon, which can either be read through or terminated. Pyrrolysine (Pyl) is encoded by the amber codon (TAG/UAG) and is widespread in archaea, where it is required for methylamine-mediated methanogenesis, an environmentally important metabolism. Mechanisms to conditionally suppress the amber stop codon for Pyl installation during protein synthesis have not been identified. Using the model methanogen, Methanosarcina acetivorans, we demonstrate that Pyl-encoding archaea maintain an ambiguous genetic code wherein UAG encodes dual meaning as stop and Pyl. Our data suggest that expression of Pyl biosynthesis and incorporation genes is tuned to the cellular demand for Pyl, which allows these archaea to navigate ambiguous stop decoding in response to environmental cues."

"A novel chemoheterotrophic psychrophilic bacterium, designated as strain I4T was isolated form a permanent snowfield in Washington State, USA. Growth is extremely slow, regardless of temperate (tested between 4{degrees}-25{degrees} C) but was had marginal optimal growth at 8.5{degrees} C. I4T was determined to be able to utilize 102 of the 190 tested carbon sources, 70 or the 95 tested nitrogen sources, 34 or the 59 tested phosphorous sources, and 10 of the 35 tested sulfur sources. I4T was seen to grow from pH 5.0-5.5 but could grow as low as 4.5 pH and as high as 9.5 pH with specific amendments. The genome of I4T was sequenced and it is approximate 4.0 Mb and has a G + C content of 66.2 mol%. Phylogenomic analyses using two independent methods places I4T within the genus Sphingomonas with S. sanguinis being its closest relative. On the basis of its genomic, physiological, and morphological properties, I4T (=ATCC TSD-357T= NCIMB 15472T) is proposed as the type strain of a novel species, Sphingomonas nivalis sp. nov."
"Interferon (IFN) and inflammation are the key early defence mechanisms that combat pathogen infection. The cytosolic DNA sensor cGAS activates immune signaling via the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) protein. Emerging evidence suggests crosstalk between innate immune DNA and RNA sensing, implicating a role of STING protein in RNA virus infection. This study characterizes STING in the context of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), an RNA virus of the flaviviridae family. We observe that activation of type I IFN through MAVS is essential for cGAS and STING activation. Knockdown, null mutant and inhibitor studies confirmed that STING restricts JEV replication independently of IFN{beta} signaling and autophagy. Transcriptomic analysis of STINGgt/gt bone-marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) showed enhanced IFN response, but reduced activation of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Phosphorylated STING was recruited on the virus replication complex (RC), marked by the non-structural protein NS1, subsequently triggering the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome on the RC. STING proton channel activity was essential for NLRP3 inflammasome activation, IL-1{beta} production, and activation of pyroptotic cell death markers. Stinggt/gt mice, showed higher viremia, earlier disease onset, reduced survival, and decreased brain inflammation. These findings establish STING as a key regulator of JEV-induced inflammation and antiviral defence."
"I derive a novel stochastic equation for the evolution of the additive genetic variance-covariance matrix G in response to mutation, selection, drift, and fluctuating population size. Common wisdom holds that G should respond to drift only as a scaled reduction. In contrast, I find that drift causes drastic and predictable shifts in the orientation of G by driving genetic correlations to their extremes. Biologically, this is a consequence of linkage build-up introduced by drift. I compare these theoretical results to empirical observations based on experiments conducted by Phillips et. al. (2001). Additionally, to derive the model of G-matrix evolution, I developed a novel synthetic framework for modelling ecological and evolutionary dynamics of populations carrying multivariate traits. By striking a balance between genetic detail and analytical tractability, and by minimizing requisite technical background, this framework is optimized for deriving new models across a wide range of topics in population biology. Foundations of the framework are formalized by the theory of measure-valued processes, but application of the framework only requires multivariate calculus, and heuristics are presented in the main text for making additional calculations involving stochastic processes. Collectively, this work establishes a powerful framework enabling efficient formal analysis of integrated population processes across evolution and ecology, and its potential for making new discoveries is illustrated by novel findings on fundamental aspects of G-matrix evolution."
"Cyanobacteria optimize light harvesting for photosynthesis using large, soluble antenna systems called phycobilisomes (PBS). These megacomplexes, composed of spectrally distinct phycobiliproteins and linker proteins, allow efficient energy transfer to reaction centers of the photosystems. While PBS structures from many cyanobacteria have been resolved in recent years, the PBS of Gloeobacter violaceus--a phylogenetically ancient, thylakoid-less cyanobacterium--remains poorly characterized. Here, we present the cryo-EM structure of the G. violaceus PBS, a >10-MDa complex with a unique architecture consisting in 516 polypeptide chains totaling nearly 90,000 residues and harboring over 860 bilin chromophores. Unlike canonical PBS with radiating rods, the Gloeobacter PBS features diverging, conformationally flexible rod bundles formed by stacked phycoerythrin (PE) and phycocyanin (PC) hexamers. These rods emerge from a pentacylindrical allophycocyanin (APC) core, which is encircled by additional PC hexamers--a structural feature atypical for other cyanobacteria. We identify the role of the two Gloeobacter-specific multidomain linker proteins, Glr1262 and Glr2806, as critical stabilizers of this bundle-shaped architecture. Structural analysis suggests these linkers mediate rod-core interactions while permitting rod mobility, potentially balancing light capture and photoprotection. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the lateral cylinders of the APC core create alternative energy transfer pathways from the rods to the terminal emitters, ensuring robust excitation delivery under varying light conditions. This redundancy may represent an evolutionary adaptation to Gloeobacters unique physiology. Our findings provide the high-resolution structural insight into Gloeobacter PBS, revealing divergent adaptations in early-branching cyanobacteria. The structure advances understanding of PBS diversity and evolution, offering a framework for bioengineering light-harvesting systems in synthetic biology and biotechnological applications."
"Serine proteases are known to play a major role in the haemotoxic actions of viper venom, but compared with those from other vipers, the serine proteases of puff adder venoms have not been extensively characterised. To address this, we isolated, identified and characterised the bioactivity of the serine proteases within the venom of the Nigerian puff adder which we had previously shown to be especially rich in this class of toxin. Two distinct groups were identified, each with different protein substrate specificities. Both had similar molecular weights of 52-62 kDa, with 4-6 N-glycans, but one group consisted of trypsin-like acidic SVSPs and the other were chymotrypsin-like basic SVSPs. Each acted differently on fibrinogen: the acidic SVSPs showed thrombin-like alpha/beta-fibrinogenase activity, whereas the basic forms were shown to be alpha-fibrinogenases. The acidic SVSPs possess gelatinase activity - a novel activity for SVSPs and the first example of an SVSP acting on proteins other than those of the haemostatic system. Analysis of the transcripts of both sets of SVSPs revealed structural details of the substrate-binding sites that supported the experimental findings. The activity and sequences of the basic SVSPs show that they are very like the alpha-fibrinogenase ML-AF of M. lebetina, which until now was considered to be a unique SVSP. Thus, this basic SVSP and the acidic SVSP with its gelatinase activity can be considered to be atypical viper serine proteases. The gelatinase activity of the acidic SVSPs was found to vary geographically and this, alongside the regional variation in the SVMP activities that we observed previous study, is discussed with reference to the potential implications on pathology of envenoming and the development of therapeutic interventions."

"Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), a leading non-viral nucleic acid delivery platform, are assembled with a heterogeneous payload distribution. This uneven therapeutic payload distribution can be critical parameters influencing delivery efficiency, therapeutic efficacy, and inflammatory side effects, limitations that become especially acute in prolonged gene therapies. Here, we integrate coarse-grained molecular dynamics and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations with single-particle characterization via cylindrical illumination confocal spectroscopy (CICS) and machine learning analysis to understand, step-by-step, the formation of RNA-loaded LNPs and the origins of the payload variability. We find that the balance between RNA diffusion kinetics and lipid self-assembly dynamics is the dominant driver of payload heterogeneity. Leveraging this mechanistic insight, we show that (i) finely controlled turbulent mixing minimizes payload variance and increases the uniformity of RNA distribution without altering LNP size, and (ii) systematic adjustment of salt concentration and PEG-lipid content tunes RNA loading in a volume-dependent manner. Together, these results elucidate the self-assembly landscape of LNPs and provide actionable design principles for crafting more uniform, potent, and safer LNP-based nucleic acid therapies."
"Dendritic cells (DCs) are among the most potent antigen-presenting cells, playing a pivotal role in initiating adaptive immune responses. The STING (Stimulator of Interferon Genes) pathway, a key cytosolic DNA-sensing mechanism, has emerged as a powerful modulator of type I interferon production and CD8+ T cell activation. In this study, we aimed to generate and functionally mature bone marrow-derived DCs in vitro by optimizing cytokine conditions and incorporating STING pathway stimulation. Immature DCs were differentiated from murine bone marrow using various concentrations of GM-CSF and IL-4, and characterized by the expression of surface markers CD11c, CD80, and MHC-II. Maturation was induced using a STING agonist, followed by co-culture with naive CD8+ T cells isolated from mouse spleens via Magnetic Activated Cell Sorting (MACS). STING-activated DCs exhibited enhanced surface marker expression and significantly promoted CD8+ T cell proliferation. Our findings demonstrate that combining optimized cytokine-driven differentiation with STING activation significantly improves DC immunogenicity, offering a promising platform for the development of DC-based cancer immunotherapies.

"Doxorubicin is first-line chemotherapy for soft tissue sarcoma; however, the development of drug resistance limits its efficacy. The purpose of the present study was to select very-high doxorubicin-resistant (VHDR) HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells, determine cross-resistance to second-line chemotherapy drugs, determine maintenance of sensitivity to recombinant methioninase (r-METase) alone and in combination with doxorubicin, and measure the level of c-MYC expression. VHDR-HT1080 cells were generated by cultivating HT-1080 cells in a series of step-wise progressively higher concentrations of doxorubicin, ranging from 8 nM to 15 {micro}M, an 1875-fold increase, over a five-month period. The WST-8 reagent was used to assess cell viability. Four groups of in vitro drug-sensitivity tests were conducted, which involved both parental HT1080 and VHDR-HT1080 cells: 1) doxorubicin alone; 2) rMETase alone; 3) a combination of doxorubicin and rMETase; and 4) untreated control. The cross-resistance of VHDR-HT1080 cells to eribulin, trabectedin, gemcitabine and docetaxel was determined. The c-MYC levels in HT1080 and VHDR-HT1080 cells were measured using Western blotting. Doxorubicin had an IC50 of 3.3 {micro}M against HT1080 cells and 38.2 {micro}M against VHDR-HT1080 cells an 11.6-fold increase. The rMETase IC50 value for HT1080 was 0.75 U/ml and 0.59 U/ml for VHDR-HT1080. rMETase sensitized VHDR-HT1080 cells to doxorubicin. VHDR-HT1080 cells were cross-resistant to trabectedin 8.9-fold and cross-resistant to eribulin 1.87-fold compared to parental HT1080 cells. c-MYC expression was 8.4 times higher in VHDR-HT1080 cells compared to HT-1080 cells. The present results suggest rMETase may be used as a future clinical strategy to overcome super-doxorubicin resistance in soft tissue sarcoma."
"Humans undergoing mechanical vibration of frequency ranging from mHz to a few kHz in daily life. Human body contains about 60% of water. Blood is one of the most important body fluids and RBC are functional constituents of blood. RBC, due to their deformable nature, can undergo physical deformation or membrane damage under the influence of external mechanical vibrations over extended periods. In the present work, we studied in vitro the effect of sinusoidal mechanical vibration of 2 mm amplitude and frequency ranging from 5 to 100 Hz for 10 min duration. Physicochemical properties of controlled and mechanically vibrated RBC were examined using UV-visible, Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR), Raman spectroscopy, and morphology was examined by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Results showed that mechanical vibrations affect oxygenation level at the Q band (543 nm and 578 nm), and variation in transmission intensity is observed in the Amide region. RBC showed a change in morphology, where the elongation index increases along with vibration frequency. Current findings are useful to various stages of blood management and supply chain like collection, storage, transportation, handling, and donation.

Key pointsO_LIEffect of mechanical vibration on RBC highlights the importance of blood transportation and handling related issues.

"TNT (2,4,6-trinitrotoluene) from unexploded ordinances is a common environmental pollutant near munitions factories, military training sites, and areas of armed conflict. As physical and chemical approaches for TNT remediation are costly and difficult to scale, in situ bioremediation is an attractive alternative. TNT is a phytoaccumulative pollutant. Herbivores engineered to detoxify TNT are a potentially cost-effective platform to bioremediate large areas of contaminated sites while grazing or browsing. As a first step towards engineering herbivores with metabolic capabilities for TNT degradation, we engineered the animal genetic model, Drosophila melanogaster, to screen a library of microbial nitroreductases that can catalyse the initial degradation steps required for TNT degradation. We find strong, cofactor-dependent activity in fly lysates engineered to express NsfA from Escherichia coli, and NsfI from Enterobacter cloacae."
"PurposeSpectral editing is the most common MRS approach for noninvasive in vivo measurement of low-concentration, strongly overlapped metabolites in the brain, such as {gamma}-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutathione (GSH). Multi-metabolite editing methods, including HERMES and HERCULES, have recently been introduced, where multiple J-coupled metabolites can be edited in a single acquisition without increasing total scan time. Yet little is known regarding the reliability of these methods. This study assessed the test-retest reliability of HERMES and HERCULES, where volume localization was achieved using either PRESS or sLASER.

MethodsSixteen healthy adult volunteers were scanned twice in two separate sessions. Single-voxel edited MRS data were acquired in the medial parietal lobe using the following sequences: (1) HERMES-PRESS; (2) HERMES-sLASER; (3) HERCULES-PRESS; (4) HERCULES-sLASER. Spectra were processed and metabolites were quantified using the Osprey software. Data quality metrics and reliability statistics were estimated for all four acquisitions.

ResultsHERMES-sLASER demonstrated lower within-subjects coefficients of variation (CVws) for GSH, glutamine (Gln), and glutamate (Glu) + Gln (Glx), suggesting improved reliability compared to HERMES-PRESS. However, GABA + co-edited macromolecules (GABA+) and Glu showed higher CVws for HERMES-sLASER. HERCULES-sLASER produced better reliability than HERCULES-PRESS for GABA+, GSH, Glu, Gln, Glx, aspartate (Asp), and lactate (Lac). N-acetylaspartate (NAA) and N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG) showed higher CVws for HERCULES-sLASER. These findings suggest that sLASER may be more advantageous than PRESS for volume localization in simultaneous multi-metabolite editing.

ConclusionUsing sLASER yielded better test-retest reliability for most metabolites than using PRESS for volume localization for HERMES and HERCULES."
"1HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) presents a fundamental paradox: Patients maintain cognitive function during acute infection despite intense inflammatory responses and cytokine storms. Through computational modeling of quantum coherence in neural microtubules during HIV-induced neuroinflammation, we discovered that Fibonacci scaled microtubular architectures maintain quantum coherence up to 104-fold longer than regular structures through geometric optimization. This protection mechanism operates through resonant coupling in the golden ratio ({phi} = 1.618), achieving 74.4% efficiency in preserving quantum information. Using five complementary computational models validated against recent experimental quantum data, we demonstrate: (1) power law decay (exponent  = - 1.015) in Fibonacci structures versus near-exponential collapse ( = - 10.102) in regular grids; (2) quantum sanctuary formation at t = 0.6 time units creating coherence-preserving boundaries; (3) precise mathematical optimization at{phi} = 1.618033988749895; (4) temperature resilience maintaining function during HIV-associated fever; (5) strong correlations with clinical neuroimaging (r = 0.74- 0.82, p < 0.001). Monte Carlo analysis (n = 50) confirmed the probability 100% of sanctuary formation during acute inflammation above 38.5 {degrees} C. These findings resolve the cognitive paradox of HAND by revealing how geometric structure enables preservation of quantum information despite extreme perturbation, suggesting novel therapeutic targets and establishing new principles for quantum biology and bioinspired quantum technologies.

2 Author summaryDuring acute HIV infection, the brain experiences an inflammation severe enough to cause confusion and cognitive failure, yet patients think clearly. This paradox has puzzled clinicians for decades. Using computational models of quantum processes in brain cells, we discovered that nature employs an elegant solution: proteins called microtubules, when arranged in Fibonacci spirals, preserve quantum information 10,000 times longer than regular arrangements. This geometric protection operates precisely at the golden ratio (1.618), the same mathematical constant found in nautilus shells and sunflower spirals. Our findings reveal that the brain maintains function during inflammatory storms by creating quantum ""sanctuaries,"" protected regions where information processing continues despite the surrounding chaos. This discovery not only solves a medical mystery but unveils a fundamental principle: life does not merely endure quantum disruption, but transforms geometric beauty into computational resilience. Although computational, we provide novel, testable theories demonstrating that in the battle to preserve human cognition from the ravages of a tiny retrovirus, nature draws from the quantum realm."
"Hippocampal activity supports memory and many other brain functions. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) guided by hippocampal functional connectivity (FC) shows promise in improving memory, but direct neural evidence of its capacity to engage and modulate hippocampal activity is lacking. Here we combined TMS with intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) in 8 neurosurgical patients and with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 79 neurologically healthy participants. We identified that (1) single-pulse TMS to individualized parietal cortex guided by hippocampal-FC preferentially evoked distinct temporal and spectral activity patterns in the hippocampus, (2) variability in TMS-evoked hippocampal responses related to individual differences in parietal-hippocampus FC strength, and (3) repetitive TMS to hippocampal-FC-guided parietal cortex selectively suppressed hippocampal theta oscillations. These findings provide multimodal causal neural evidence and important mechanistic insights supporting the development of personalized neuromodulation strategies aimed at improving hippocampus-dependent functions."
"O_LIRecent technical advances have significantly enhanced the value of museum specimens for molecular research, with metagenomic and metabarcoding approaches expanding further the utility of museum collections. However, given the finite number of specimens, there is a critical need to move past destructive DNA extraction approaches and to explore non-destructive techniques.
C_LIO_LIIn this study, we evaluated the feasibility of extracting historical fish eDNA from the ethanol preservative used to store Antarctic museum specimens. We compared a variety of extraction methods - centrifugation, evaporation, filtration, and precipitation - using ten replicate samples per treatment for statistical analyses. To assess potential differences in preservative-derived eDNA recovery across different filter-feeding taxonomic groups, we included a Bryozoa and two Porifera, i.e., Demospongiae and Hexactinellida.
C_LIO_LIComparative analyses with tissue biopsies revealed that the total genomic DNA was significantly reduced for non-destructive approaches. However, 10 ml ethanol filtration performed equal to, or in some instances, outperformed tissue biopsies when investigating the historical eDNA of Antarctic fish using a 16S rRNA metabarcoding approach, both for the number of species detected (-diversity) and community characterisation ({beta}-diversity).
C_LIO_LIOur findings demonstrate the potential of ethanol preservative as a valuable, non-destructive source of historical fish eDNA from museum-stored filter-feeding specimens. These results highlight the viability of non-destructive sampling for molecular research on museum collections, preserving specimen integrity while enabling biodiversity assessments.

"The state of exploitation of the brown shrimp, Penaeus californiensis, fishery in the northeastern region of the Gulf of California was evaluated using landed catch and fishing efforts from 2010 to 2020. The annual catchability coefficient, , was estimated through the Leslie model; the monthly biomass, , was estimated from the catch per unit effort;  via the relationship  = /; and through a biomass accumulation model throughout the fishing season, an approach to the biomass corresponding to the carrying capacity, {infty},, was obtained. The harvest rate, , for each month and year was obtained and the annual maximum sustainable yield, , derived as , = 0.50, which represents the target biological reference point, . The decrease in population abundance allows for estimates of the recruitment rate, , at the beginning of the fishing season and the survival rate, , at the end of the fishing season, which represent the remaining reproductive population. From these estimates, a limit biological reference point was computed, described as [Formula], which corresponds to the population replacement level. With these estimates, the Kobe diagram was constructed, in which the biological reference points  and , were incorporated. The diagnosis of the state of exploitation indicates, considering a precautionary criterion regarding recruitment, that the fishery has been operating at acceptable levels of sustainability, near the maximum production capacity."
"The encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) IRES and other Type 2 IRESs comprise domains H-L and specifically interact with eIF4G/eIF4A through their essential JK domain. However, the JK domain is not sufficient for IRES function, which also requires the preceding domain I of unknown function. To identify interactions that drive ribosomal recruitment of eIF4G/eIF4A-bound Type 2 IRESs, we determined the cryo-EM structure of 48S initiation complexes formed on the EMCV IRES. It revealed that the apical domain I cloverleaf contacts ribosomal proteins uS13 and uS19 via its Id subdomain and that the essential GNRA tetraloop in subdomain Ic interacts directly with the T{psi}C domain of initiator tRNA. Functional assays supported the exceptional role of these interactions for initiation on this IRES. The strong conservation of primary and secondary structures of the apex of domain I among Type 2 IRESs suggests that the reported interactions are a common essential feature of them all."
"Cas1 and Cas2 are the hallmark proteins of prokaryotic adaptive immunity. However, these two proteins are often fused to other proteins and the functional association of these fusions often remain poorly understood. Here we purify Cas1 and the Cas2/3 fusion protein from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We determine multiple structures of the Cas1-2/3 complex at distinct stages of CRISPR adaptation. Collectively, these structures reveal a prominent, positively charged channel on one face of the integration complex that captures short fragments of foreign DNA. Foreign DNA binding triggers conformational changes in Cas2/3 that expose new DNA binding surfaces necessary for homing the DNA-bound integrase to specific CRISPR loci. The length of the foreign DNA substrate determines if Cas1-2/3 docks completely onto the CRISPR repeat to successfully catalyze two sequential transesterification reactions required for integration. Taken together, these structures clarify how the Cas1-2/3 proteins orchestrate foreign DNA capture, site-specific delivery, and integration of new DNA into the bacterial genome.

"Archival samples provide a unique source of DNA, offering the potential to extend the temporal scale of genetic studies by decades to centuries. Fish hard structures, such as otoliths and scales, serve as records for fish collected during fisheries monitoring across a large spatiotemporal scale. Operculum bones are a type of fish hard structure that, although less commonly collected, have been utilized in genetic studies. However, the usefulness of archived operculum bones to provide high quality whole genome sequence information has not been thoroughly evaluated. Here, we applied a commercially available extraction protocol, with minor adjustments, to isolate genomic DNA from operculum bones of Eurasian perch collected up to 47 years ago, followed by standard short-read whole genome sequencing. By comparing the metrics of DNA and whole genome sequencing data of bones with contemporary muscle samples, we demonstrate that the application of a simple extraction protocol on boiled archival fish operculum bones yields high quality genomic information that is comparable to fresh tissue, highlighting the role of archival operculum bones as an overlooked repository of valuable genomic information."
"RNase L is an endonuclease that responds to infections by cleaving most host- and pathogen-derived single-stranded RNAs. This widespread RNA cleavage can lead to death of the infected cell via the ribotoxic stress response (RSR). An ongoing challenge is to understand how RNase Ls endonuclease activity triggers cell death to benefit the host. To address this question, we used nanopore-based long-read sequencing to show that 3 mRNA fragments in the cell were not fully degraded after RNase L activation and that these fragments were translated by ribosomes. We further asked whether ribosomes on mRNA fragments stall when they reach 3 ends created by RNase L. We used ribosome profiling to capture footprints protected by these ribosomes, which can be identified by their short length (15-18 nt). We found that RNase L activation increased the number of stalled ribosomes at RNase L cleavage sites. Loss of the ribosome rescue factor PELO increased the number of short footprints derived from stalled ribosomes and augmented the RSR. Our work therefore establishes a role for fragmented mRNA in causing ribosome stalling that promotes innate immunity via the RSR.

"Predicting expression profiles from RNA-seq experiments provides a powerful approach for universal sequence-based variant effect prediction, enabling researchers to score variants that affect total gene expression and relative isoform abundances. These models can be repurposed for new prediction tasks through transfer learning. However, current base models train primarily on bulk RNA-seq profiles derived from tissues and cell lines, overlooking the wealth of single-cell 3-seq data that captures cell type-specific gene regulation. Here, we extend the capabilities of our recently developed Borzoi model by training on single-cell 3-seq expression profiles from the Tabula Sapiens, Tabula Muris, and the Adult Brain Atlas, aggregated by cell type. This new model, Borzoi Prime, enables accurate variant interpretation across diverse cells, spanning erythrocytes to microglia. Training on 3-seq profiles improves the models ability to predict cell- and tissue-specific alternative polyadenylation, even in the original bulk RNA-seq data. Through UTR-wide mutagenesis experiments of alternatively polyadenylated genes, we highlight determinants of cell type-specific 3 UTR regulation learned by the model. This cell type-resolved approach opens new possibilities for understanding genetic variant effects via multiple layers of regulation in specific cellular contexts."
"Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) continues to be poorly understood at the molecular level. While previous studies have identified gene expression signatures unique to HFpEF, genes associated with clinical decompensation have not been determined. Here, we performed exploratory analysis of myocardial RNA-seq data to identify genes associated with event-free survival in HFpEF. We analyzed previously published RNA sequencing data of right ventricular septal endomyocardial biopsies from HFpEF patients (n=41) with paired clinical, echocardiographic, and outcome data (including mortality and heart failure hospitalizations). We constructed random survival forests with forward stepwise regularization (the ""variable hunting"" method) to determine genes associated with time to first event using a combined end-point of heart failure hospitalization or all-cause death. Selection of candidate forest variables was tested with both random and weighted sampling methods. We identified 33 genes that are predictive of survival in HFpEF. This set includes genes previously implicated in heart failure, including ADAMTSL2, ADRB1, BMP6, and METRNL. Survival forests constructed using these genes outperform those constructed from clinical and hemodynamic parameters alone (out-of-bag C-index 0.894 vs 0.545). Moreover, in survival forests constructed from both gene data and hemodynamic measurements, individual survival genes consistently showed higher variable importance than clinical/hemodynamic parameters. Our study shows that random survival forests identify myocardial gene signatures that may better model HFpEF prognosis than clinical measurements. Further studies are warranted to validate findings in independent cohorts."
"5-Hydroxymethyl-2-deoxycytidine (5hmdC) is an important epigenetic marker involved in gene regulation and DNA demethylation. It has potential use as a biomarker for cancer and other diseases due to its significant depletion in various cancers and disease models. This research aimed to develop a reliable and efficient method for generating 5hmdC-containing DNA, addressing limitations in existing techniques. We created a Tet3 stalling mutant that converts 5-methyl-2'-deoxycytidine (5mdC) into a mixture of 5hmdC and 5-formyl-2'-deoxycytidine (5fdC), followed by a reduction step to convert 5fdC to 5hmdC, ensuring a pure 5hmdC state within the CpG context. This method can convert any PCR product, synthetic oligos, and entire genomes into 5hmdC-modified DNA. The principal results demonstrate high specificity and efficiency, providing a robust tool for epigenetic research, cancer diagnostics, and protein binding assays. Additionally, our technique offers 5hmdC-DNA for functional studies and as standards for diagnostic assays."
"Computational explorations are described generating small peptide and acetic-polymer evolutecas targeting one of the virulence regulons of Listeria monocitogenes (Lm). Lm are among the most important multiple-resistant food-borne infective bacteria whose antibiotic resistances raise worldwide concerns. The glutathion cavity of the Lm positive regulatory factor A (prfA) virulence regulon, was computationally targeted here because of the importance of the glutathion tri-peptide-dependent prfA activation of many virulent Lm genes. Computationally screening of alternative tri-,tetra-, and penta-mer peptides and innovative-acetic polymers and evolutecas generated from the top-screened molecules, were employed to optimize their fitting to glutathion-prfA cavities. Combining library-screening and children generation by co-evolution, several novel top-peptides and acetic-derived polymers were generated predicting low-toxicities (to reduce any known undesirable side-effects) and low nanoMolar consensus affinities (to maximize their specificities and accuracies). However, their possible inhibition of prfA virulence remains to be demonstrated. To continue these explorations, additional chemical synthesis and in vitro experimental validation, are strictly required to demonstrate any desirable interference with Lm virulence and/or biological functions."
"BackgroundLung cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality, necessitating novel therapeutic strategies with minimal side effects. Lycopene, a natural carotenoid, has shown potential anticancer properties, yet its efficacy and mechanisms in lung cancer models require systematic exploration.

ObjectiveThis study aimed to evaluate the antitumor effects of lycopene in both in vivo and in vitro lung cancer models, elucidate its molecular mechanisms, and assess systemic safety.

MethodsIn vivo, tumor-bearing mice received intratumoral injections of lycopene at varying concentrations (10, 20, 40 mg/kg) to evaluate tumor regression . In vitro, A549 and LLC lung cancer cell lines were treated with lycopene (0-40 M) to assess the ability of clonogenic survival, tumor new cell, cell invasion and promoting apoptosis.Western blot and immunohistochemistry were used to detect related pathways and apoptotic proteins, and target genes were silenced or overexpressed to verify the correctness of the pathways. Systemic toxicity was analyzed through blood biochemical profiling and histopathological examination (HE staining) of major organs at 40 mg/kg.

ResultsLycopene significantly reduced tumor volume in mice in a dose-dependent manner (p<0.05). Systemic toxicity assessments revealed no abnormalities in hepatic, renal, or hematological parameters, and organ histology remained unaffected at 40 mg/kg. In vitro, lycopene suppressed colony formation, tumor new cell, cell invasion numbers, and increased apoptosis rates about 60%. Mechanistically, lycopene downregulated phosphorylated PI3K and AKT levels, indicating pathway inhibition. Interference of PI3K gene silencing or overexpression suggests that the PI3K/AKT pathway is the main target for lycopene to produce apoptotic effects.

ConclusionLycopene exerts potent antitumor effects by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT pathway and promoting apoptosis in lung cancer cells, while demonstrating a favorable safety profile at therapeutic doses. These findings highlight its potential as an adjunctive therapy for lung cancer management."
"Spatial group independent component analysis (sgr-ICA) has become a crucial method to understand brain function in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) research, especially in resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) studies. Early studies identified large-scale brain networks using sgr-ICA with lower order (e.g., 20 - 45 components); however, more recent studies have employed higher model orders (e.g., 200 components) to reveal more refined intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs), offering a more detailed representation of functional brain architecture. This increased granularity has encouraged researchers to explore even higher model orders to better capture the brains function. Although previous studies explored higher model orders, small datasets often limited them. In this study, we addressed this gap by assessing an sgr-ICA model with 500 components using a large rsfMRI dataset of over 100,000 subjects. This extensive data set allowed us to provide a robust estimation of fine-grained ICNs. We further assessed diagnostic effects and cognitive performance using whole-brain functional network connectivity (FNC) of 502 individuals with schizophrenia and 640 typical controls from these ICNs. We also compared the results with ICNs obtained using a lower-order, multi-spatial-scale template. Results demonstrate that our approach yields a large set of reliable and fine-grained ICNs, enhancing characterization of schizophrenia related dysconnectivity patterns. Specifically, we observed a relatively large number of ICNs within the cerebellar and paralimbic area. We detected significant hypoconnectivity between the cerebellar and subcortical domains, including the basal ganglia and thalamic regions. We also found hyperconnectivity between the cerebellar domain and the visual, sensorimotor, and higher cognitive domains, as well as between the sensorimotor and subcortical domains. Our finding revealed that granular ICNs can detect significant FNC differences between cohorts which are missed in larger scale ICNs. This work highlights the capability of higher model order ICA to capture distinct, fine-grained ICNs, enriching our understanding of FNC and serving as a valuable addition to current multiscale ICN templates. The ICNs derived from this study may serve as valuable references for future research, with the potential to improve the clinical utility of rsfMRI and advance the study of psychiatric disorders."
"Animal behavioural diversity ultimately stems from variation in neural circuitry, yet how central neural circuits evolve remains poorly understood. Studies of neural circuit evolution often focus on a few elements within a network. However, addressing fundamental questions in evolutionary neuroscience, such as whether some elements are more evolvable than others, requires a more global and unbiased approach. Here, we used synapse-level comparative connectomics to examine how an entire olfactory circuit evolves. We compared the full antennal lobe connectome of the larvae of two closely related Drosophila species, D. melanogaster and D. erecta, which differ in their ecological niches and odour-driven behaviours. We found that evolutionary change is unevenly distributed across the network. Some features, including neuron types, neuron numbers and interneuron-to-interneuron connectivity, are highly conserved. These conserved elements delineate a core circuit blueprint presumably required for fundamental olfactory processing. Superimposed on this scaffold, we find rewiring changes that mirror each species ecologies, including a systematic shift in the excitation-to-inhibition balance in the feedforward pathways. We further show that some neurons have changed more than others, and that even within individual neurons some synaptic elements remain conserved while others display major species-specific changes, suggesting evolutionary hot-spots within the circuit. Our findings reveal constrained and adaptable elements within olfactory networks, and establish a framework for identifying general principles in the evolution of neural circuits underlying behaviour."
"The brain constructs a perceptual interpretation of the world by integrating sensory input with prior knowledge and expectations. Causality perception, a core example of this inferential process, enables observers to infer cause-effect relationships, such as whether a moving object causes another to move. Traditionally considered a low-level visual computation, causality perception is increasingly recognized as shaped by top-down dynamics, perceptual history, and individual predictive processing styles. Here, we examined how prior experience and cognitive-perceptual traits shape causal inference in 150 neurotypical individuals, using data-driven clustering to stratify participants along the autism-schizotypy (ASD-SSD) spectrum. Participants viewed dynamic collision events in which a moving circle contacted a stationary one, followed by variable temporal lags before the second objects motion, and judged whether the interaction appeared causal or non-causal. Causality judgments were influenced by both physical timing (sensory-driven) and serial dependence on previous perceptual decisions (prior-driven). Hierarchical drift diffusion modeling (HDDM) revealed that SSD-like individuals showed a strong prior bias toward causality, greater serial dependence, and lower decision thresholds, reflecting a prior-dominated perceptual style. Conversely, ASD-like individuals exhibited reduced influence of perceptual history and higher decision thresholds, reflecting a conservative, data-driven style. Crucially, prior bias, serial dependence, and decision-making dynamics were strongly interrelated, revealing a hierarchical structure to perceptual inference across neurocognitive profiles. These findings demonstrate that causality perception emerges from predictive processes operating at multiple timescales and shaped by individual differences in neurocognitive style and perceptual flexibility.

Significance StatementAccurate causality perception is a fundamental building block of cognition, supporting our ability to parse the sensory world, guide action, and construct coherent models of the environment. It provides a key example of perceptual inference, and thus how the brain integrates sensory input, prior expectations, and recent experience to shape subjective perception.

Here, we show that causality perception is not fixed, but varies systematically across individuals, mirroring broader variability in how different neurocognitive architectures balance sensory evidence and prior expectations along the autism-schizotypy (ASD-SSD) spectrum within the general population. By combining psychophysical data with hierarchical computational modeling, we reveal distinct perceptual inference styles along the autism-schizotypy continuum, ranging from sensory-driven to prior-driven processing.

These findings advance predictive processing accounts of individual variability and offer new insights into the mechanisms supporting flexible and adaptive perception in neurodiverse populations."

"Tactile representations in the barrel field of the primary somatosensory cortex of rodents (wS1) receive inputs from two distinct thalamic nuclei, the ventro-posterior-medial nucleus (VPM) and the posterior medial complex (POm). Previous work has revealed a sweep-stick code in rat wS1 by using a novel whisker velocity-white noise stimulus. Sticks refer to high velocity single whisker bumps, while sweeps correspond to large multiwhisker displacements with extended temporal profiles. We hypothesized that barrel cortex neurons inherit  stick responses from the VPM and  sweep responses from the POm. Here we test this hypothesis by studying the coding strategy of both thalamic nuclei and wS1 in mice. We found a stratified wS1 representation of both sweep and stick functional classes, whereas VPM and POm contained mainly stick encoding neurons. Cortical layer 4  stick responses are a delayed version from VPM, while layer 5b  sweep responses come from POm. Notably, layer 5a  sweep responses result from a temporal integration of  stick information from VPM and POm. Our results put forward a circuit scheme in which fast encoding stick events from VPM allow a fine-tuned texture processing in the cortex, modulated by sweep-responding cells that integrate multi-whisker information."
"Hemispheric asymmetries in NMDAR-dependent synaptic plasticity have been described in hippocampal area CA1, but it remains unclear whether similar lateralized mechanisms exist for cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent plasticity. Here, we investigated whether cAMP-mediated potentiation of synaptic transmission in mouse CA1 exhibits hemisphere-specific properties. In recordings with electrical stimulation of CA1 inputs, a subset of recordings in the left, but not in the right hemisphere CA1, exhibited a pronounced cAMP-induced potentiation of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs). To isolate input specific contributions, we expressed the optogenetic actuator ChrimsonR unilaterally in the CA3/CA2 region of wild-type mice. Light-evoked glutamate release from ipsilateral Schaffer collaterals showed no cAMP sensitivity in either hemisphere, while commissures originating from the right (COR) exhibited cAMP-mediated potentiation of transmission in a subset of experiments. Notably, this effect was absent at commissures originating from the left (COL). The selective presence of the effect prompted us to further investigate the underlying cell population using CA3-specific (G32-4 Cre) and CA2-specific (Amigo2-Cre) driver lines. Recordings from synapses of CA3 COR recapitulated the cAMP-induced potentiation of transmitter release observed in wild-type animals. However, the effect was again restricted to a subset of experiments and was absent in recordings with specific stimulation of CA2 COR. Our results demonstrate a variable cAMP-sensitivity of transmitter release at COR synapses in the left CA1. Altogether, we reveal a hemisphere-specific cAMP-mediated synaptic plasticity at CA3 COR onto CA1, underscoring hidden heterogeneity and lateralization in hippocampal circuit function."
"Homotopic functional connectivity (HoFC)--the synchronous activity between homologous regions of the left and right cortical hemispheres--is a hallmark of inter-hemispheric brain architecture, yet its biological underpinnings remain incompletely understood. Here, we characterize spatial variation in resting-state HoFC and its relation to dominant natural axes of anatomical, functional, and transcriptomic organization across the human cerebral cortex. We show that the regional distribution of HoFC, from the lowest in association areas (especially limbic) to the highest in primary sensorimotor regions, is preserved in neuropsychiatric disorders in a separate neuroimaging cohort (including schizophrenia, bipolar I disorder, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder) despite disease-associated perturbations in magnitude. Regional variation in HoFC is not fully explained by properties of physical embedding or vascular innervation in the brain, suggesting involvement of alternative physiological processes. Furthermore, we find that regions with stronger HoFC are more functionally connected within and across hemispheres at rest, suggesting that homotopic functional coupling is positively associated with brain-wide functional synchrony. Our results collectively suggest that HoFC is inherently aligned with a fundamental natural axis of macroscopic cortical organization and shared global signal--advancing our understanding of the biological correlates of cortical homotopy and suggesting potential mechanisms to investigate in the future."
"Identifying individual differences in brain activity that reflect variation in domains of mental health - including those in the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework - remains a core challenge in neuropsychiatry. Here, we cross-analyzed mental health and brain function profiles in hundreds of individuals using factor analysis of 87 neurocognitive/psychiatric assessments and tensor independent component analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data acquired during task and movie-watching paradigms with putative mental health relevance.Across 77 brain network variants evoked across five paradigms, univariate and multivariate network activity differences predominantly reflected and predicted cognition, weakly indexing other mental health domains despite their similar reliability and interindividual variability.Normative mental health variation was not reflected in comparatively homogeneous evoked brain activity, and clustering subjects by brain function versus mental health produced discordant subtypes. Brain activity evoked by common fMRI paradigms may contain insufficient non-cognitive information to differentiate mental health in the general population."
"The locus coeruleus (LC) regulates various neural processes through a limited number of norepinephrine (NE)-releasing neurons with widespread axon projections. However, how the LC is organized to exert brain-wide regulatory functions remain elusive. Utilizing larval zebrafish as a whole-brain-scale model, we reveal that morphologically heterogenous but physiologically comparable LC-NE neurons assemble complementarily to implement region-specific regulation of brain-wide neural dynamics. Individual LC-NE neurons exhibit diverse axon projections with ipsilateral bias and region preference, but share comparable electrophysiological properties, sensory responses and neural function-related genes expression. Moreover, population LC-NE neurons display bilaterally symmetrical yet regionally different axon projections and fire synchronously, causing regionally patterned NE release. Along with the regional comparability of NE receptor expression, these enable the LC to tune brain-wide neural dynamics in an inverted-U manner with region difference. Thus, our study provides a comprehensive understanding of the organizational logic of the LC system."
"While much research in social cognitive neuroscience has focused on which brain regions are engaged when processing social content, it remains unclear what these areas are doing in terms of underlying mechanisms. Here, we approached this question using predictive processing theory, which suggests that the brain instantiates a generative model of its sensory environment. Using a novel animated shapes fMRI task, we observed a functional double dissociation between brain regions that were engaged when forming a prediction for agentic movement - which involved the premotor cortex and the lateral parietal cortex, previously implicated in action observation and mirroring - from those associated with processing feedback for updating abstract priors to guide predictions - which involved the dorsomedial and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, the temporoparietal area, and the lateral temporal cortex, previously associated with mentalizing/theory of mind. We observed parallel functional dissociations in the cerebellar areas affiliated with these networks. These findings suggest new insights into how brain regions associated with action observation/mirroring and mentalizing/theory of mind play complementary roles in supporting facets of a predictive processing architecture underlying social cognition."
"In a previously published study, we found atypical visual cortical laterality patterns during global motion perception in 5-month-old infants who showed high levels of autistic symptoms in toddlerhood. Here, using data from a separate experiment, we examined whether these results could reflect altered visual cortical functional connectivity in theta, alpha, and gamma rhythms. We assessed this in a sample of 5- month- old infants (n = 59; 39 elevated familial likelihood of autism) by means of electroencephalography (EEG) when they were watching videos showing social and non-social scenes. Gamma connectivity between midline and far-lateral visual cortex when viewing social scenes was linked to both later autism symptoms and global motion visual cortical laterality we reported in the previous study. This may indicate a shared integrative mechanism underlying social perception and global motion processing. Further, we found that higher midline-to-lateral theta connectivity in the visual cortex when perceiving non-social scenes in infancy was strongly associated with having more autistic symptoms at follow up, but uncorrelated with concurrent motion perception. Our study points to atypical functional connectivity in the visual cortex as a potential early marker of autistic symptoms and highlights a probable link between motion processing and social perception."
"Several clinical attempts to use deep brain stimulation applied to nucleus basalis of Meynert to reduce cognitive decline in different types of dementia report inconclusive effects. At the same time, experiments in rodents have largely demonstrated cognitive improvement. The hypothesised basis for this difference was the application of different patterns of stimulation - tonic continuous over multiple sleep-wake cycles in human clinical trials vs intermittent bursts over shorter intervals in animal studies. However, since no systematic testing of the effects of different stimulation patterns applied in different states of vigilance was conducted, it remains unclear what specific attributes of cortical responses are associated with these patterns, and the effect of vigilance state on pattern response.

We hypothesised that communication between nucleus basalis and its cortical targets involves frequencies in both low and high ranges, making burst-type intermittent patterns potentially more effective. Therefore we studied preferred frequencies of neuronal synchronization within nucleus basalis as well as between nucleus basalis and its cortical targets in B6 mouse strain (N=9, age 4-6 month) by recording neuronal spiking and local field potentials (LFP) from 2 sites of the nucleus basalis and 4 cortical sites simultaneously across multiple sleep-wake cycles. Spike-field coherence (SFC) analysis revealed natural synchronization tendencies of nucleus basalis - all animals demonstrated significant SFC at delta-theta range and gamma coherence peaking between 57 and 88 Hz (SFC > 95% Jackknife confidence interval at frequency range > 2*bandwidth). SFC between cortical cells and local field potentials of nucleus basalis, which reflects cortical feedback, peaked at delta-theta frequencies.

Based on these results we constructed ""nested"" patterns of stimulation that included both delta-theta and individually assessed gamma peak for each animal (N=8). The effects of nested stimulation were compared to the ones of random and tonic (20Hz) stimulation patterns. These patterns of stimulation were applied across multiple sleep-wake cycles to freely behaving animals, and spectral power density in response to stimulation compared between patterns for different states of vigilance.

We report significant reduction of delta power during slow wave sleep and theta power in REM for all three patterns. Slow wave suppression was also present during wakefulness. This indicates all patterns may improve levels of alertness but highlights strong likelihood of sleep disturbances in response to stimulation during sleep. Thus, deep brain stimulation of nucleus basalis may be counterproductive during sleep.

The nested pattern of stimulation alone demonstrated preservation or even enhancement of gamma activity in the cortex while suppressing low frequencies. Broad-band suppression of cortical activity was shown in response to tonic stimulation, and to some extent to the random pattern as well, suggesting that tonic stimulation may be unsuitable for deep brain stimulation of the nucleus basalis of Meynert."
"Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) is crucial for development and survival of melanocytes and serves as a lineage-specific oncogene that is amplified in 10-20% of melanomas. The role of MITF in pathways maintaining genome integrity, such as DNA replication, DNA repair and mitosis has been extensively studied in melanocytes. In addition to its pro-survival role in melanoma, recent studies have shown that MITF expression has important implications for cancer progression and treatment in other cancer types. Nevertheless, studies on the role of MITF in other tissues are scarce. Here, we show that depletion of MITF causes genome instability in non-melanocytic cell lineages, which results in activation of P53, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Moreover, we show that P53 activation in MITF depleted cells is dependent on LATS2, a key kinase in the Hippo pathway. Finally, we show that this LATS2 mediated upregulation of P53 is ATR dependent. Collectively, this study highlights the role of MITF as a genome maintenance factor beyond the melanocyte lineage, which might contribute to the tumor suppressive function of MITF."
"The Integrated Stress Response (ISR) is a cell signaling pathway that enables cells to adapt to diverse cellular stresses. Conversely, during chronic/unmitigated cellular stress the ISR becomes maladaptive and has been implicated in a range of neurodegenerative conditions including Parkinsons Disease (PD). However, the mechanisms by which maladaptive ISR/ATF4 signaling contributes to neurodegeneration have not been elucidated. In this study we establish a critical mechanism by which chronic ISR activation becomes maladaptive and promotes neurodegeneration in neurotoxin and - synucleinopathy models of PD in vitro and in vivo.

Specifically, we demonstrate that chronic activation of ATF4, the central transcription factor of the ISR, promotes neurodegeneration by regulating the transcriptional induction of SESN2, DDIT4 and Trib3 that co-operate to suppress both mTORC1 and mTORC2 activity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ATF4-mediated suppression of mTORC1/2 activity promotes dopaminergic neuronal death in PD models by facilitating the activation of the pro- apoptotic BCL-2 family protein PUMA. Taken together, we have discovered a novel maladaptive ISR/ATF4 signaling pathway leading to chronic suppression of mTORC1/2 activity resulting in PUMA-mediated neuronal death that may have therapeutic implications in a range of neurodegenerative conditions that exhibit chronic ISR activation.

"Neuronal remodeling is crucial for proper nervous system development and function, and can be initiated by developmental programs, activity-dependent mechanisms, or stress. Despite significant advances, the underlying mechanisms that govern this process remain poorly understood. Here, we adapted C. elegans IL2 sensory dendrites as a model system to study developmental and stress-mediated dendrite pruning. Upon entering a stress-induced developmental diapause, IL2 dendrites grow a complex dendritic arbor, which is later pruned when reproductive development resumes. We identified unexpected specificity in the pruning process, with distinct genetic requirements to direct branch-specific elimination of secondary, tertiary, and quaternary branches. The serine/threonine kinase SAX-1/NDR promotes elimination of secondary and tertiary, but not quaternary, dendrites. SAX-1 functions with its conserved interactors SAX-2/Furry and MOB-2 in the removal of both dendritic branches. The guanine-nucleotide exchange factor RABI-1/Rabin8 and the small GTPase RAB-11.2 mediate the elimination of secondary branches with SAX-1, but their effect on tertiary branches is minimal. Consistent with the known roles of RABI-1 and RAB-11.2 in regulating membrane dynamics, we find that SAX-1 promotes endocytosis during remodeling. Together, our findings reveal distinct mechanisms for branch-specific elimination under stress-induced and developmentally regulated neuronal remodeling."
"Amid declining manta ray populations globally, the well-established and growing manta ray tourism industries generate substantial economic benefits and aid protective legislation for these threatened elasmobranchs. As flagship species, manta rays are a drawcard for marine wildlife tourism and a gateway for engaging the public and communities in conservation. Healthy marine ecosystems are the key drivers of employment and economic sustainability for island nations such as the Maldives. However, there are many stakeholders competing for these shared resources, which can result in environmental degradation. Economic evaluations are a powerful tool for justifying the conservation efforts of threatened species and natural areas, especially in light of competing stakeholders. Using tour operator surveys (n=106) and data mining, this study provides an updated assessment of manta ray watching tourism in the Maldives, and represents the first national evaluation of its total economic and socio-economic benefits. In 2021, manta ray tourism in the Maldives generated an estimated US$227.3 million, including US$39 million on manta ray focused diving and snorkelling excursions, and US$188.3 million in related tourist expenditure. This represented 4.8% of the national Gross Domestic Product. This industry appears to have grown around 380% since 2008 (US$8.1 million) and manta ray watching is now offered by 80% of tourism operators nation-wide. Our findings revealed that manta rays hold intrinsic value and cultural significance within local communities. Acknowledging this, the flow-on benefits to the community extend beyond this industry, reaching local businesses, employed staff, and the government with the total economic benefits of the manta ray tourism industry were estimated at over US$311 million per year. Such value highlights the significance of manta rays for this nation and the need for effective management centred on manta ray conservation to safeguard future prosperity and mitigate the potential impact of tourism on manta ray populations."
"Short tandem repeats (STRs) are hotspots of genomic instability that mutate at rates orders of magnitude greater than non-repetitive loci due to frequent replication slippage. Expansions at some STR loci cause Mendelian diseases, while variation at other noncoding loci may affect complex traits, possibly by altering transcription factor occupancy of nearby binding sites. Accordingly, some STRs are inferred to be under purifying selection, regardless of their instability. One or more ""interruptions"", or bases that disrupt the locuss canonical repeat, significantly decrease an STRs mutability. For example, the onset of Huntingtons Disease, a neurodegenerative disorder associated with somatic expansions of a trinucleotide coding STR, is delayed in individuals whose inherited alleles contain interruptions. Thus, interruptions that decrease mutation rate at some coding loci may broadly protect against deleterious phenotypes associated with locus instability. However, interruptions may themselves be deleterious at constrained loci, particularly at noncoding loci in gene regulatory elements, possibly disrupting the formation of secondary structures key to their function. We therefore hypothesized that the frequency of interruptions could depend on a locuss functional importance-at constrained loci, the fitness effects of expansions but also interruptions could be more deleterious than at neutral loci. To test this hypothesis, we examined the distribution of interruptions at [~]650,000 autosomal STRs. In the [~]2,500 3- or 6bp-motif coding STRs, we find that synonymous interruption density increases with purifying selection on the gene, while the opposite is true for missense-causing interruptions. In contrast, noncoding STRs in gene regulatory elements harbor fewer interruptions than those unassociated with function and putatively evolving neutrally. Our findings indicate that the abundance of interruptions may be partially explained at coding STRs by the benefit of lower instability. In contrast, maintaining a minimum core stretch of uninterrupted repeat may be key to the function of noncoding STRs that fall within regulatory elements, outweighing the benefits of stability."
"The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is well recognized for its role in cognitive functions and activating action plans. In contrast, the properties of prefrontal neurons with respect to multisensory processing are less well studied. To address this question, we recorded single units from areas 8a and 46 of two female rhesus macaques while they were presented with visual, auditory, and audiovisual motion stimuli. The majority of dorsolateral prefrontal neurons responded to these sensory stimuli, with similar percentages of auditory-only, visual-only and audiovisual neurons. Approximately one third of responsive neurons exhibited significant super- or sub-additive interactions in response to the pairing of auditory and visual stimuli, revealing significant nonlinearities in their response profiles. Decoding motion signals from the population activity robustly differentiated multisensory from unisensory trials and also unisensory auditory and visual trials from each other. These results demonstrate that dorsolateral prefrontal neurons integrate auditory and visual motion signals, extending multisensory computations beyond sensory cortices into prefrontal circuits that support higher-order cognition.

New & NoteworthyWe recorded single neurons in macaque dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during visual, auditory, and audiovisual motion. Nearly half of responsive neurons were multisensory and a third displayed significant super- or sub-additive interactions, while ensemble activity reliably decoded stimulus modality. These findings provide the strongest evidence to date that DLPFC performs rapid, nonlinear audiovisual integration, extending multisensory computations beyond classical posterior regions into the prefrontal circuits that support cognition."
"Kidney organoids are an emerging tool for disease modeling, especially genetic diseases. Among them, X-linked Alport syndrome (XLAS) is a hematuric nephropathy affecting the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) secondary to pathogenic variations in the COL4A5 gene encoding the 5 subunit of type IV collagen [5(IV)]. In patients carrying pathogenic variations affecting splicing, the use of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) offers immense therapeutic hope. In this study, we develop a framework combining the use of patient-derived cells and kidney organoids to provide evidence of the therapeutic efficacy of ASOs in XLAS patients. Using multiomics analysis, we describe the development of GBM in wild-type and mutated human kidney organoids. We show that GBM maturation is a dynamic process, which requires long organoid culture. Then, using semi-automated quantification of 5(IV) at basement membranes in organoids carrying the splicing variants identified in patients, we demonstrate the efficacy of ASO treatment for 5(IV) restoration. These data contribute to our understanding of the development of GBM and pave the way for a therapeutic screening platform for patients."
"BackgroundAnxiety, depression, and related internalizing illnesses are a leading burden on global public health, and often emerge during times of stress. Yet the underlying neurobiology has remained enigmatic, hindering treatment development.

MethodsHere we used a combination of tools--including a well-established threat-anticipation fMRI paradigm and longitudinal assessments of internalizing symptoms and negative life events (NLEs)--to identify the neural systems associated with future internalizing illness in a risk-enriched sample of 224 emerging adults followed for 2.5 years. We performed parallel analyses in an overlapping sample of 209 participants who completed a popular threat-related faces paradigm.

ResultsHere we show that heightened reactivity to uncertain-threat anticipation in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and the periaqueductal gray is associated with a worsening longitudinal course of broadband internalizing symptoms among individuals with low levels of NLE exposure. These associations were specific to uncertain threat and generally remained significant when controlling for concurrent measures of threat-elicited distress or psychophysiological arousal, highlighting the added value of the neuroimaging measures. Symptom trajectories were unrelated to amygdala and frontocortical reactivity to anticipated threat. Contrary to past research, amygdala reactivity to threat-related faces was unrelated to future symptoms.

ConclusionsThese observations provide a novel neurobiological framework for conceptualizing transdiagnostic internalizing risk and lay the groundwork for mechanistic and therapeutics research. A racially diverse, risk-enriched sample and pre-registered, best-practices approach enhance confidence in the robustness and translational relevance of these results."
"The widespread availability of multi-omics tumor profiling has enabled detailed molecular characterization of individual tumors, paving the way for more effective, less toxic, and patient-specific therapies. However, widespread compound screens in human patients are constrained by ethical and logistical challenges, underscoring the need for computational models capable of predicting in vivo drug response. Here, we introduce PDDRNet-MH, a multiplex heterogeneous network-based framework that integrates genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic tumor profiles with drug chemical structures, pharmacological activity, and side-effect data to infer personalized drug responses. PDDRNet-MH constructs an integrated network connecting patients, cell lines, drugs, and genes, with each component represented by four biologically and pharmacologically informed similarity layers. This design enables the systematic propagation of drug-biomarker associations across modalities. We applied PDDRNet-MH to breast cancer patient data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and benchmarked its predictive performance against state-of-the-art methods on eleven FDA-approved breast cancer drugs. PDDRNet-MH achieved consistently high accuracy, with perfect prediction scores for gemcitabine and vinorelbine (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve [AUC-ROC] = 1.00; Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve [AUC-PR] = 1.00) and near-perfect scores for methotrexate and zoledronate (AUC-ROC = 0.95; AUC-PR = 0.99), demonstrating its ability to robustly distinguish sensitive from resistant patients. Biologically, PDDRNet-MH accurately prioritized established clinical biomarkers, including HER2 (ERBB2) for lapatinib and BRCA1/2 for doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. Beyond known associations, the model identified additional genes within the HER2 amplicon on chromosome 17q12, including STARD3, MIEN1, and PPP1R1B, whose amplification was significantly associated with elevated drug response scores, suggesting potential roles in HER2-targeted therapy. These findings highlight the ability of PDDRNet-MH to recover and extend clinically relevant drug-biomarker associations, supporting its utility in guiding precision oncology."
"People with Parkinsons disease suffer from levodopa-induced dyskinesia, adversely to chronic dopaminergic medication. These involuntary movements affect quality of life and are linked to lowered motor inhibition in the cortico-basal-ganglia motor network during hyperdopaminergic states. Several cortical and subcortical spectral biomarkers are associated with dyskinesia, but the oscillatory patterns associated with the behavioral complexity of involuntary movement and voluntary movement suppression that defines dyskinesia, is not studied so far. To elucidate these spatio-temporal dynamics and its behavioral relevance, we studied cortico-subthalamic oscillations in 21 Parkinsons patients during a dyskinesia-provoking experiment. We differentiated between non-dyskinetic and dyskinetic periods, and split data based on a kinematic movement registration, leading to respectively resting states and voluntary movement, and active movement suppression and dyskinetic movement. Elevated theta-activity and attenuated beta-activity was found in the subthalamic nucleus during voluntary movement suppression within dyskinetic periods, while cortico-subthalamic gamma-activity was only elevated during dyskinetic movement presence. Subthalamic spectral changes significantly predicted dyskinesia presence, and the amount of registered movement significantly affected the predictive value of dyskinesia predictions. We propose a dyskinetic macrostate to consist of distinct behavioral microstates of dyskinetic movements versus movement suppression, both associated with distinct oscillations in the cortico-subthalamic motor network."
"Forestry industry requires high-quantity and quality seeds for afforestation and assisted migration programs. Finding reliable non-destructive methods to characterize seeds would significantly enhance efforts to identify climate-adapted populations. This study presents near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy models to classify seed origin and predict germination characteristics at different temperatures non-destructively. We focus on Abies alba Mill., a key European forest tree with genetic variation along climatic gradients and seeds with shallow physiological dormancy. Seeds from six populations were analyzed using NIR spectroscopy, and germination was tested at 15{degrees}C, 20{degrees}C, and 25{degrees}C after stratification treatments at 4{degrees}C (0 or 3 weeks). Population classification accuracy using Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis was 69%, with significant NIR peaks at 1712, 1929, and 2111 nm, linked to moisture content and storage compounds. NIR spectra explained 51% and 65% of the variation in germination probability and timing using Partial Least Squares Regression, with significant peaks at 1712, 1929, 2111, 1632, and 2073 nm. General Linear Mixed-Effects Models showed that a NIR predictor contributed to 39% of the germination probability variance explained by fixed-effects, and the stratification treatment was the most important driver explaining germination time. Our results proved the utility of NIR-based tools to effectively classify bulked seeds and predict germination, opening new perspectives to nursery and forestry sectors and populations adaptation and adjustments to warming climate. This study will facilitate further investigations on the physiological processes that occur during dormancy, a critical process for forest regeneration given the expected impact of shorter and warmer winters on seed behavior."
"Ecosystem based fisheries management is an increasingly accepted approach for many fisheries management agencies. Indicators and methods that can usefully support the aspiration of making ecosystem based fisheries management decisions on tactical time frames are slowly accumulating, but have primarily focused on biomass status and trends. We first verify that fishing can distort the cumulative distribution of connections within an ecosystem, and then show (via theoretical testing and application to four contrasting case study locations) how relating catch with production by defining an acceptable band of exploitation pressure - the ""Green Band"" - can help inform fisheries decision makers as to whether an ecosystem is under distortive patterns of fishing pressure that will ultimately undermine the structure of the ecosystem."
"Phylodynamic analysis has been instrumental in elucidating the epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics of pathogens. The Bayesian approach to phylodynamics integrates out phylogenetic uncertainty, which is typically substantial in phylodynamic datasets due to low genetic diversity. Bayesian phylodynamic analysis does not, however, scale with modern datasets, partly due to difficulties in traversing tree space. Here, we set out to characterize tree space of phylodynamic inference and assess its impacts on analysis difficulty and key biological estimates. By running extensive Bayesian analyses of 15 classic large phylodynamic datasets and carefully analyzing the posterior samples, we find that the posterior landscape in tree space (""tree landscape"") is diffuse yet rugged, leading to widespread tree sampling problems that usually stem from the sequences in a small part of the tree. We develop clade-specific diagnostics to show that a few sequences-- including putative recombinants and recurrent mutants--frequently drive tree space ruggedness and sampling problems, although existing data-quality tests show limited power to detect such sequences. The sampling problems can significantly impact phylodynamic inferences or even distort major biological conclusions; the impact is usually stronger on ""local"" estimates (e.g., introduction history) that are associated with particular clades than on ""global"" parameters (e.g., demographic trajectory) that are governed by the general tree shape. We evaluate existing and newly-developed MCMC diagnostics, and offer strategies for optimizing MCMC settings and mitigating impacts of the sampling problems. Our findings highlight the need for and directions to develop efficient traversal over the rugged tree landscape, ultimately advancing scalable and reliable phylodynamics.

Significance StatementBayesian phylodynamics is central to epidemiological studies but computa tionally challenging. One major chal lenge is posed by the need to explore a vast and complex tree space. Phy lodynamic datasets usually comprise many sequences with limited genetic diversity, distinct from traditional phy logenetic datasets, warranting charac terization of phylodynamic tree space and inference performance. Here, we demonstrate that: 1) phylodynamic tree landscape is highly rugged, lead ing to widespread tree sampling prob lems that are frequently driven by a few sequences, and; 2) these problems can distort biological conclusions. We develop new diagnostics to identify the problematic sequences and highlight potential solutions to mitigate their im pacts. We offer strategies to optimize phylodynamic analysis workflows and to develop algorithms for navigating tree space ruggedness, thereby facili tating infectious disease investigation."
"Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) are a powerful approach for studying the genes underlying complex traits by directly integrating GWAS and gene expression datasets. In cattle, they have been previously applied to identify genes driving fertility, milk production, and health. However, these studies have also highlighted several challenges, from difficulties in reproducing these complex analyses to limitations from poor genotype calls, especially when called directly from RNA sequencing data. To address these and other challenges, for the H2020 BovReg Project, we have developed a streamlined, species-agnostic, and reusable Nextflow TWAS workflow to integrate transcriptomic and GWAS summary statistic datasets. Our workflow first generates accurate genotype calls and gene expression prediction models from transcriptomic datasets and then applies these tools to impute gene expression levels into GWAS cohorts, enabling the association of genes with traits of interest. We explore optimal strategies for calling genetic variants directly from transcriptomic data and illustrate that using imputation approaches specifically designed for low-pass sequencing data can improve variant calling over previously adopted methods. We demonstrate the utility of our TWAS workflow by applying it to both novel and publicly available GWAS cohorts for cattle, detecting novel gene-trait associations for complex traits. Using a new transcriptome annotation of the cattle genome generated for the BovReg project we also illustrate how previously un-assayable associations can be detected. The results and the workflow we present, provide a new resource for the community and contribute to a better understanding of the molecular drivers of complex traits in cattle with the goal of eventually leveraging this information in future breeding decisions."
"AbstractData-independent acquisition (DIA) has gained much attention in mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics for its improved reproducibility and unbiased data acquisition. In DIA-MS, the spectral library is crucial in peptide identification. However, this method is limited to peptides previously identified via data-dependent acquisition (DDA) MS experiments. This study proposes a deep learning approach for generating spectral libraries, even for previously unseen peptides. While most deep learning-based methods rely on one-hot encoding representation for peptides, the proposed method incorporates physicochemical features, including atomic composition, hydrophobicity, flexibility, fractional surface probability, and aromaticity. We introduce sparsity regu-larized neural network layers to facilitate the selection and combination of important high-dimensional physicochemical features and improve prediction performance. Fur-thermore, we suggest a transfer learning strategy for training the proposed deep neural networks having multiple heterogeneous input channels. Numerical experiments using benchmark DDA-MS data demonstrated that the proposed deep learning model out-performed existing benchmark models, such as Prosit and DeepDIA, particularly in predicting retention times. And it was demonstrated that the proposed models with sparsity regularization identified more peptides from HeLa cell DIA data compared to the other deep learning models."
"For decades, flow cytometry has allowed for single-cell profiling based on selected biomarkers and is widely used in both clinical and research settings. One major limitation of most conventional flow cytometry analyses is the dependency on a mostly manual gating process. This generally involves sequentially selecting biomarkers to isolate phenotype-associated cell populations, an approach that is both labor-intensive and prone to bias. To address this challenge, we introduce the application of a series of multi-instance learning frameworks for automated flow cytometry data analysis. Our models demonstrate strong performance across diverse biomedical applications, including cancer subtyping based on tumor-infiltrating immune cells, HIV survival stratification, AML minimal residual disease prediction, and COVID-19 severity assessment. We further examine how network architecture affects predictive performance and the detection of rare but clinically significant cell populations. Notably, our models utilize attention mechanisms to directly identify phenotype-associated cell subsets, serving as an interpretable, data-driven alternative to fully manual gating. These findings underscore the potential of multi-instance learning as a scalable and interpretable framework for flow cytometry, with broad applications in precision medicine and translational immunology."
"BackgroundSenescence identification is rendered challenging due to a lack of universally available biomarkers. This represents a bottleneck in efforts to develop pro-senescence therapeutics - agents designed to induce the arrest of cellular proliferation associated with a senescence response in cancer cells for therapeutic gain. This is particularly true in contexts such as basal-like breast cancer (BLBC), which often express high levels of widely reported senescence hallmarks, which has led to the designation of these subtypes as senescence marker positive (Sen-Mark+). Unfortunately, these are often cancers with the most limited treatment options, where novel pro-senescence compounds would be of potential clinical utility.

ResultsTo address these challenges, we have developed SAMP-Score, a machine learning classification tool for identifying senescence induction in Sen-Mark+ cancers. This technique builds upon our previous observation that senescent cells develop distinct senescence-associated morphological profiles (SAMPs), which can be assessed readily in traditionally challenging contexts for senescence identification, including high-throughput screens.

ConclusionsThrough application of SAMP-Score, we have identified QM5928, a novel pro-senescence compound, that is able to induce senescence in a variety of Sen-Mark+ cancers and has potential utility as a tool molecule to explore the mechanisms and pathways through which senescence induction occurs in these cells."
"Barretts esophagus (BE), a metaplastic condition that is the only known precursor for esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), is relatively common, but progression to cancer is infrequent. BE is inflamed but the contribution of the immune system to the carcinogenic process is unknown. To this end, we contrasted non-dysplastic metaplasia of BE patients, captured when they did not progress (non-progressors), did subsequently, but had not yet progressed (pre-progressors) or had already progressed to EAC (progressors). Using spatial multiplexed 56-protein analysis, serial laser capture microdissection (LCM) RNAseq and shallow whole genome sequencing, we identified prooncogenic immune neighbourhoods and dysregulated immune cell populations predictive of subsequent progression to EAC. Indeed, spatial analysis revealed that M1 macrophages, regulatory natural killer (NK) cells, neutrophils and altered ratios of intraepithelial CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes typify tumor microenvironmental (TME) changes associated with cancer initiation. Spatially derived cell-to-cell interactions revealed progression-specific immune cell interaction signatures predominantly involving M1 macrophages NK cells and plasma cells. Furthermore, LCM RNAseq analysis identified gene expression  hot signatures enriched in pre-progression and progression samples. Notably, we also observed a correlation between immune cells and copy number alterations in progressor metaplasia. By exposing coordinated changes in the immune cell landscape in patients at high risk of developing EAC, this multi-omic dataset provides novel diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities"

"Plant cuticle is the first hydrophobic barrier between the epidermis and the environment. Upon wounding, damaged tissues undergo healing processes that involve cuticle or callus formation at the wound site. However, signaling pathways that initiate cuticle development and callus formation in the wound-proximal region are still poorly understood. Here, we reveal that the FERONIA receptor-like kinase facilitates cuticle development in the epidermis and FER-mediated cuticle formation limits the propagation of wound-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS), which trigger callus formation. Cuticle defects stimulate NADPH oxidase-dependent ROS production, which leads to unrestricted callus formation. However, the cuticle formed in mesophyll cells in the vicinity of the wound suppresses ROS propagation, thereby preventing unorganized callus formation beyond the wound-proximal site and activating programmed cell death adjacent to the wound. These findings provide valuable insights into cuticle development in aerial tissues and its defensive function for preserving the integrity of undamaged regions."
"Uniformity of production traits is desired for different traits in livestock species, including the uniformity of within-litter birth weights in piglets. Birth weight (BW) in pigs is associated with increased vitality and survival until weaning. However, as uniformity of BW increases, the importance of initial weight decreases as competition between piglets decreases. The aim of this study was to estimate the direct and maternal genetic components of BW, jointly with the maternal genetic component of the residual variance for within-litter BW, and their genetic correlations. We used two distinct datasets of Swiss Large White pigs: 1) the experimental farm dataset and 2) the commercial farms dataset, comprising 43,135 and 23,313 records of individual piglet birth weight, respectively. For statistical analysis, the heteroscedastic (or canalising selection) model was used. This model assumes that both the mean BW and the residual variance are affected by systematic and random effects, with the residual variance being heterogeneous and partially under genetic control. Despite the best fitting model was the most complex one including both genetic effects for the mean trait, the results indicated that direct genetic effects, or correlations with such effects, are negligible. The genetic environmental variance for BW ranged between 0.071 and 0.131 for experimental farm and 0.037 to 0.094. The genetic correlation between the mean BW and its variability was always positive and ranged between 0.149 and 0.307 for the experimental farm and between 0.220 and 0.589 for the commercial farms. It is thus sufficient to model BW and its variability by including only the maternal genetic effect for both traits. In addition, even though moderate genetic correlations exist between the mean and the variance of BW, focusing selection on BW uniformity within litters would be preferable to creating a selection index for both traits simultaneously.

ImplicationsMonitoring within-litter birth weight variability is important for efficient piglet production and welfare. Our findings suggest that maternal genetic effects are sufficient to model birth weight and its variability as genetic components of environmental variance. For both traits, direct genetic variance and its correlations with other components are negligible. However, since there are moderate genetic correlations between the mean and variance of birth weight, it is preferable to focus solely on selecting for within-litter birth weight uniformity rather than combining both traits in the selection index. This approach simplifies breeding strategies while maintaining the goal of improving piglets welfare.

"Tungiasis, one of the oldest and most neglected tropical diseases endemic to sub-Saharan Africa and the Americas, is caused by the female parasitic flea, Tunga penetrans. The flea burrows into the skin, leading to acute and chronic inflammation, often exacerbated by bacterial superinfection. Despite its significant public health impact, genomic studies on T. penetrans are scarce. Here, we present the first complete mitochondrial genome of T. penetrans, comprising 17,279 base pairs and encoding 13 protein-coding genes, 22 transfer RNAs and 2 ribosomal RNAs. Phylogenetic analysis of the cox2 gene revealed a divergent basal lineage from Brazil, supporting a South American origin of T. penetrans and highlights genetic differentiation within the Americas. Clustering of the Ecuadorian and African isolates further suggests historical connections, likely linked to transatlantic maritime trade. The tree highlights a strong South American origin and evidence of migration and diversification, facilitated by human and animal movement. Phylogenetic analysis of the complete genomes relying on the protein-coding genes of other fleas revealed that T. penetrans is closely related to Dorcadia ioffi, a semi-sessile flea of goats and sheep in China. This mitochondrial genome provides a critical resource for future studies on molecular epidemiology, evolutionary history, and control of tungiasis."
"Loop extrusion by SMC complexes is a key mechanism underlying chromatin folding during both interphase and mitosis. Despite this shared mechanism, computational models of loop extrusion often rely on fundamentally different assumptions: interphase models typically use dynamic extruders with finite lifetimes, while mitotic models employ static extruders placed according to loop size distributions. In this work, we investigate whether these modeling paradigms are interchangeable or yield intrinsically incompatible results. Using publicly available Hi-C data from mitotic chicken cells, we systematically compare dynamic and static loop extrusion models implemented in the Polychrom framework. We evaluate how key parameters--such as extruder lifetime, extrusion velocity, and spatial noise--affect simulated contact probability curves P(s) and loop size distributions. Our results reveal that while both model types can be tuned to approximate the general shape of P(s), they produce distinct internal structures and divergent relationships between loop size and contact decay. We also show that increased extruder lifetimes lead to excessive nested loop formation, which alters both loop statistics and P(s) derivatives. Introducing spatial exclusion constraints between extruders partially restores consistency with static models. These findings highlight that differences in extruder behavior and polymer noise levels can significantly impact chromatin model outcomes and must be carefully accounted for when interpreting or comparing simulation results across biological conditions.

Author summaryChromatin organization plays a crucial role in gene regulation and cellular function, yet our understanding of its three-dimensional structure relies heavily on computational modeling and the interpretation of complex experimental data. In this study, we use coarse-grained modeling approaches to simulate chromatin folding and systematically investigate how different analysis metrics and data processing methods influence the conclusions drawn from such models. By comparing widely used metrics and exploring the effects of normalization and noise, we highlight potential pitfalls and biases that can arise in chromatin modeling studies. Our findings provide practical recommendations for researchers in the field, aiming to improve the robustness and reproducibility of computational analyses of chromatin architecture. This work will help guide future studies toward more reliable interpretations of chromatin structure and its biological implications."
"Although several cancer cells are shed into the circulation, most die due to the stresses they encounter. Detachment from the underlying extracellular matrix is one major stress; cell death due to matrix detachment is known as anoikis. Few cancer cells overcome this stress, become anoikis-resistant, and survive to seed metastasis. Autophagy, a cell survival mechanism during stressful conditions that promotes cellular homeostasis by recycling cellular components, is activated upon matrix detachment. On the other hand, apoptosis is a cellular mechanism that is responsible for programmed cell death which is also activated upon matrix detachment. It is unclear how matrix-deprived cancer cells maintain a balance between autophagy and apoptosis to decide the cell fate: whether the cell dies due to anoikis or acquires anoikis-resistance and survives to seed metastasis.

Though multiple pathways contribute to cell fate decisions, we have shown experimentally that autophagy and apoptosis are influenced by Akt-AMPK axis and AMPK-ERK axis in matrix-deprived cancer cells. Since Akt, AMPK and ERK are in turn linked to each other it is essential to understand how these proteins simultaneously affect the cell signaling and survival/death outcomes of matrix-deprived cancer cells. To study the cumulative effect of Akt-AMPK-ERK activities on survival/death decisions and to understand the fine balance between apoptosis and autophagy that facilitates the survival/death of matrix-deprived cancer cells, we formulated a deterministic ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based protein interaction model of anoikis resistance. Model stability analysis and 3D-nullcline analysis depicted that the system has a unique steady state in matrix-attached and matrix-deprived condition. Parameter sensitivity analysis depicted that the model is highly robust, and the model variables are sensitive to only a few model parameters. By simulating differential activity of pAkt, pAMPK and pERK, the model predicted a heterogeneity in pERK levels: high/low levels pERK along with high pAMPK enable survival as long as levels of pAkt are maintained low. Additionally, the model predicted a heterogeneity in pAMPK: high/low levels of pAMPK along with low pERK determines the shift from survival to death when levels of pAkt are high. Such high levels of pAkt are obtained at critically low levels of pERK. Molecular perturbation revealed a hierarchy among proteins while deciding the cell fate: pAkt dominates over pAMPK which further dominates over pERK and intermediate to high levels of pAkt were sufficient for apoptosis to surpass autophagy in matrix-detached cells. The model also predicted that Akt impacts apoptosis more than autophagy and classified the cell fate decision into survival and death zones in matrix-deprived condition. Overall, this work provided multiple insights on the molecular interplay among key kinases Akt, AMPK and ERK and their effects on apoptosis and autophagy. This model also depicted that autophagosome formation is rather robust as compared to apoptosis which is more sensitive to molecular perturbations. Hence, apoptosis emerged as a deciding factor that influences the decision of cell fate of a matrix-deprived cancer cell."
"The virulence of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, the causal agent of bacterial blight (BB) of rice, critically depends on the activation of SWEET sucrose uniporters of the host. To date, the role of SWEET-released sucrose for virulence remains unclear. We here identified the sux locus of Xoo, consisting of a LacI-type repressor (SuxR), an outer membrane TonB-like porin (SuxA), an inner membrane MFS H+-symporter (SuxC), and a cytosolic sucrose hydrolase (SuxB). Structural and functional analyses demonstrate that SuxB has exclusive sucrose hydrolase activity. Mutant analyses show that the transporter SuxC and the sucrose hydrolase are necessary for growth of bacteria on sucrose, while SuxA is not essential, likely due to the ability of other porins to transport sucrose across the outer membrane. Consistent with a role of SuxR as a sucrose repressor, transcriptome studies show sucrose-dependent regulation of the suxA/suxB genes. Besides a role of sucrose for reproduction, we found that sucrose promotes motility, EPS production, biofilm formation, and virulence. Notably, the SuxC sucrose H+-symporter and the sucrose hydrolase SuxB were required for full virulence of Xoo on indica and japonica rice varieties. Our findings indicate that pathogen-induced sucrose efflux via SWEETs provides sucrose to Xoo, that Xoo uses the sux gene cluster to acquire and utilize sucrose, and that sucrose promotes bacterial fitness and xylem colonization.

Significance StatementUnderstanding disease mechanisms is critical for developing strategies to protect plants against infections. Bacterial blight, a major threat to global rice production, is caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae strains that hijack rice SWEET sucrose uniporters. Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae deploys a set of molecular ""keys"", TAL effectors, to trigger host sucrose release. Sugars could serve as nutrients for the bacteria or prime host defense. Here, we provide evidence that the pathogens ability to attack and grow depends on sucrose uptake. We explore how crucial virulence functions, such as motility, EPS production, and biofilm formation, depend on the activity of the sucrose utilization system, supporting a key role of sucrose for the nutrition of the bacteria in the xylem."
"The fragmentation of single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics (ST) tools across Python/R ecosystems, coupled with escalating computational demands for million-cell datasets, creates critical barriers to reproducible analysis. To overcome this, we present CrosPIT (Cross-Platform Omics Pipeline for Integrated Transcriptomics), a cloud-native framework that unifies cross-language analysis in Google Colab with versioned storage on Google Drive. Pre-configured environments enable rapid switching between CPU/GPU/R runtimes, eliminating local hardware constraints. To demonstrate biological utility, we embedded several modules, such as a module for precision detection of malignant epithelial cells in colorectal cancer.

CrosPIT thus delivers a scalable, language-agnostic solution that standardizes workflows through native AnnData/Seurat object interoperability, accelerates integrative omics research, and democratizes access to high-performance transcriptomic analysis."
"Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) underpin a multitude of fundamental biological processes and represent critical therapeutic targets. Peptide compounds--owing to their structural flexibility, high target specificity, and the combined advantages of small molecules and biologics--have emerged as powerful modulators of these interactions. However, the exponential growth of scientific publications and patent filings poses a significant challenge for the systematic integration of protein-peptide interaction (PPepI) data. To address this, we implemented a high-throughput extraction pipeline powered by large language models (LLMs) to harvest affinity data from both research articles and patents, followed by rigorous manual curation. Applying this approach to 4,241 research papers and 483 patents published between 1972 and 2025, we compiled 21,760 manually validated quantitative affinity entries encompassing 2,013 unique protein targets derived from human, mouse, rat, viral, bacterial, and other species. In parallel, we consolidated 18,005 structural entries of protein-peptide complexes from the Protein Data Bank and associated literature. Leveraging these comprehensive datasets, we developed PPIKB, a user-friendly database and analysis platform that enables efficient querying, visualization, and in-depth analysis of protein-peptide interactions. PPIKB also provides a suite of tools tailored to facilitate peptide-based drug discovery, protein engineering, and systems-level biological research. By combining state-of-the-art text-mining technologies with expert validation, PPIKB sets a new standard for accessibility and utility in the field of protein-peptide interaction data resources.

"Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is a key mechanism driving the rapid dissemination of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) among bacterial populations, posing a severe threat to global public health. Traditional detection methods for HGT, such as phylogenetic incongruence and compositional analysis, are often limited in their scope and accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose a comprehensive knowledge graph (KG)-based framework that integrates genomic, environmental, biochemical, and ontological datasets to detect and analyze HGT events contributing to AMR. Our KG captures relationships among genes, plasmids, species, mobile genetic elements, antibiotics, and ecological factors using curated sources like NCBI, CARD, ICEberg, MGnify, and KEGG. We enrich nodes and edges with biological (e.g., GC content, codon bias) and chemical (e.g., binding affinities, environmental exposure) signatures and apply ontology-based semantic enrichment using ARO and GO. A Graph Neural Network (GNN) trained on the KG achieves high accuracy (92%) and F1-score (0.90) in predicting HGT events, outperforming conventional methods. Community detection identifies AMR dissemination hubs, while environmental analyses reveal strong correlations between antibiotic concentrations and resistance gene prevalence. Our framework demonstrates strong biological and chemical validation and provides a scalable, interpretable, and data-rich tool for AMR surveillance, with implications for clinical, agricultural, and environmental microbiology."
"The COVID-19 pandemic exposed vulnerabilities in global laboratory supply chains, disrupting genomic surveillance efforts essential to epidemic response. To address this challenge, we developed ARTIC HELP (Homebrew Enzymes for Library Preparation), a practical, open-source adaptation of the widely adopted ARTIC nanopore sequencing protocol for viral genomic surveillance. We describe generic, cost-effective alternatives to all enzyme mixes used in tiling multiplex RT-PCR amplification of the virus genome, and the nanopore native barcoding workflow, including end-prep (EP), barcode ligation (BL), and adapter ligation (AL), making it broadly applicable to any laboratory. Through systematic evaluation, we identified a wild-type M-MLV reverse transcriptase and two types of proofreading DNA polymerases as effective alternatives when standard reagents are unavailable due to high cost or limited supply: B-family Pfu-based polymerases with a fused Sso7d DNA-binding domain, and blends combining A-family (Taq-based) and B-family (Pfu-based) polymerases. Validation on clinical samples of SARS-CoV-2 and Norovirus GII confirmed that the HELP workflow achieves genome coverage comparable to the ARTIC LoCost protocol. For SARS-CoV-2 samples (Ct [&le;]28), the wild-type M-MLV RT combined with selected Pfu or A+B polymerases, along with optimised HELP mixes (EP, BL, AL), achieved genome coverage of 84.0-99.6%. For Norovirus GII (Ct [&le;]32), the HELP workflow using one of the Pfu polymerases achieved genome coverage of >85% for six out of eight genotypes tested. Notably, several of the other polymerases tested showed reduced performance at higher Ct values. However, they still achieved strong coverage at Ct <24, supporting their use as emergency alternatives in rapid outbreak-response sequencing when viral input is high and RNA quality is sufficient. Our approach, ARTIC HELP, provides a framework which can be implemented to address supply chain disruptions, while maintaining robust genomic sequencing capabilities. A cost analysis highlights the well-known significant global disparities in reagent pricing, driven not by protocol differences but by import fees and supply barriers. Thus, our findings highlight the need for fairer global pricing models and support for local sourcing strategies like HELP, to promote equity in genomic research and ensure preparedness for future public health challenges."
"The transition from benign to malignant growth is a pivotal yet poorly understood step in cancer progression that marks the shift from a pathologically inert condition to a clinically lethal disease. Here, we integrate lineage tracing, single-cell and spatial transcriptomics to visualize the molecular, cellular and tissue-level events that promote or restrain malignancy during the tumor initiation in mouse models of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We identify a discrete progenitor-like population of KRAS-mutant cells that co-activates oncogenic and tumor-suppressive programs--including p53, CDKN2A, and SMAD4--engaging senescence-like responses and remodeling their microenvironment, ultimately assembling a niche that mirrors invasive PDAC. KRAS inhibition depletes progenitor-like cells and dismantles their niche. Conversely, p53 suppression enables progenitor cell expansion, epithelial-mesenchymal reprogramming, and immune-privileged niche formation. These findings position the progenitor-like state as the convergence point of cancer-driving mutations, plasticity, and tissue remodeling--revealing a critical window for intercepting malignancy at its origin."
"Optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) have emerged as a promising technology for neuromagnetic recording in humans. Current state-of-the-art OPM systems are housed in immobile magnetically-shielded rooms to reduce external electromagnetic noise, and typically comprise sensor arrays covering the entire head. Here we sought to validate a low-cost, mobile OPM system comprising a small cylindrical mu-metal shield and partial sensor coverage. Twelve participants underwent right-sided median nerve stimulation (MNS) and cued right-handed button-pressing intended to elicit ubiquitous sensorimotor responses: somatosensory-evoked fields (SEFs; comprising N20m, P35m and P60m components) and event-related (de)synchronisation (ERD/ERS) of oscillatory neuronal rhythms in the mu and beta frequency ranges. Following MNS, we observed robust N20m and P60m peaks, as well as the expected mu ERD and beta ERS effects. Moreover, we successfully localized these responses to expected cortical generators using distributed source modelling. SEFs and mu ERD were both maximal in left (i.e., contralateral to stimulation) primary somatosensory cortex (central sulcus, postcentral gyrus and sulcus), while beta ERS appeared more anteriorly, in the central sulcus and precentral gyrus. By contrast, results from the button-pressing paradigm were less conclusive--we observed beta ERS (but not mu/beta ERD), and an atypical distribution of the ERS effect over posterior ROIs. Overall, our findings provide proof-of-principle support for the use of our system in the context of passive (e.g., MNS) paradigms; its viability for cued movement tasks will require further development. Based on these results, we make recommendations for further developments in mobile and partial-coverage OPM."
"The o2S2PARC platform is an open-source, extensible, and scalable cloud-based platform developed in the context of the U.S. National Institutes of Health SPARC program to support collaborative, sustainable, FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) and reproducible computational modeling and analysis. This publication presents the main features of o2S2PARC, its underlying approaches and philosophy, innovative aspects of the developed technologies, while also drawing attention to its rapid adoption. The paper showcases a variety of applications and use cases enabled by the platform. These include hybrid electromagnetic-electrophysiology simulations of neural interfaces, personalized brain and spinal cord stimulation planning, in silico device safety assessments, the training and application of AI systems (e.g., for model-predictive control and medical image segmentation), hybridized surrogate modeling and multi-objective optimization in high-dimensional parameter spaces, sensitive and unbiased validation of measurement devices, and interactive data analysis as paper supplements."
"With the rise of precision medicine and large neuroimaging datasets, measuring brain changes on an individual level becomes more possible and more important. However, functional connectivity has some mathematical and conceptual quirks that make estimating individual-level changes more complicated than, for example, estimating structural brain changes. Here, we compared six different change scores, i.e., metrics for quantifying change in functional connectivity, using a large sample with two time points, roughly 2 years apart, of low-motion data from the ABCD Study (N=2,719, ages 9-13 years). First, we compared distributions and potential interpretations of each metric. Then, we assessed how well different metrics captured topology change estimates by comparing them to individual-level changes in clustering coefficient, betweenness centrality, and network strength. As multivariate metrics may be more reliable than single connections and researchers often interpret connectivity changes in topological terms, this offers additional insight into the implications of change score choice. Overall, our analyses revealed widely different distributions between change scores that conferred vastly different results and interpretations of functional connectivity changes between time points. Thus, we provide recommendations for each change score and its optimal (or suboptimal) use cases, depending on the population, study design, and research question."
"Allicin, a natural sulfur-rich compound, is formed when garlic is crushed or chopped. It has been used for centuries as a natural defence against bacteria and fungi. However, we do not fully understand how well it works against viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we investigated the effect of allicin on the expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain of the spike protein in human primary splenic fibroblasts. These cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding RBD-S protein fused to a superfolder green fluorescent protein (sfGFP), a bright, stable marker. When cells were treated with 50{square}{micro}M allicin, either 30 min before or 6 h after transfection, a pronounced drop in fluorescence was observed, indicating reduced spike protein expression. Interestingly, the cell morphology, growth, and behavior remained normal, indicating that allicin could minimize spike protein levels without being toxic to the cells. These results open the door to the use of allicin as a gentle, natural antiviral agent and raise critical questions regarding the regulation of protein expression after transcription. Further research is required to understand these effects better."
"Measuring resilience has been a longstanding challenge in social-ecological research. While there are established resilience metrics, they often do not account for agency, which is crucial in social-ecological systems. Pathway diversity is a recent approach to measuring resilience that integrates systems thinking with individual-based elements, such as agency. According to this approach, resilience is larger if actors have more decision pathways and can maintain them over time. Here we measure resilience using pathway diversity within a lake eutrophication model to analyse (a) the extent to which it is sensitive to changes in agency and (b) its compatibility with more established resilience metrics. Our findings reveal that pathway diversity is sensitive to regime shifts and can provide early warnings of them. Through five policy decision-making scenarios, we then show how pathway diversity can capture constraints on decision makers capability and agency that affect the systems resilience. We find that higher pathway diversity is associated with greater capability of decision-makers to influence the system. Pathway diversity addresses a critical gap by incorporating agency into a resilience metric while remaining compatible with established metrics. This work shows the potential of pathway diversity to identify resilience-based policy implications."
"Spatially explicit indicators that quantify to which extent landscapes support biodiversity are essential for guiding evidence-based conservation planning. Here, we present a 25-meter resolution dataset for Switzerland, encompassing three key biodiversity indicators-- Complementarity, Extinction Risk, and Ecological Connectivity--developed across 17 major taxonomic groups, using habitat suitability maps for approximately 7,500 individual species. These three indicators capture (1) the contribution of landscapes to taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity, (2) species vulnerability to extinction and (3) ecological connectivity. Outputs are provided for both terrestrial and aquatic realms, including versions adjusted for species richness, and integrated into composite indices. In total, 272 spatial layers were produced and made openly accessible. Relationships among the three indicators were analyzed to assess their distinct contributions, and expert-based validations were performed to evaluate their ecological plausibility and relevance for conservation applications. This dataset provides a robust foundation to support spatial planning and conservation decision-making in Switzerland and can be used as a blueprint for analogue integration in other countries."
"Fires are generally considered to promote biodiversity, although this relationship can be affected by several factors, including fire regime and ecosystem type. Given the ongoing global change, a better understanding of this connection is needed to assess the extent to which projected increases in fire frequency may affect current biodiversity trends. A major challenge lies in vegetation-fire feedback, which often mediates the changes in fire regime. To shed light on the role of fires in promoting or limiting biodiversity, we studied the compositional and functional diversity of simulated plant communities as a function of different fire frequencies. We extended an existing model to include a large number of species. The model reproduces successional dynamics and is parameterized to represent Boreal and Mediterranean plant communities. Fire events are stochastic, with frequency that depends on the community flammability, and plants have different fire responses, thus representing a vegetation-fire feedback. For both ecosystems, we found that fires generally have a positive effect on diversity. All of the biodiversity indicators analyzed, to some extent, peaked at intermediate fire frequency. Interestingly, we observe a decoupling between compositional and functional diversity. These results are related to the vegetation-fire feedback and underline its importance for biodiversity in fire-prone ecosystems."
"Allochronic divergence is a key evolutionary mechanism that can frequently lead to incipient speciation. Although theoretical models suggest that such divergence is notably facilitated by small population size and genetic polymorphisms influencing reproductive timing, though constrained by genetic load, empirical validation remains limited. We investigated these predictions by re-analyzing a case of allochronic differentiation between two sympatric populations of pine processionary moth (Thaumetopoea pityocampa) in Portugal, using whole genome resequencing (IndSeq and PoolSeq) of those two populations and eight allopatric ones. We inferred the demographic history of those populations, assessed their genetic load, and searched for genomic regions associated with life cycle differences. Our analyses revealed a recent split between the sympatric allochronic populations, accompanied by a strong reduction in gene flow, bottlenecks, inbreeding and accumulation of deleterious variants. Genome scans identified several loci associated with life cycle variation, including genes putatively involved in circadian rhythm regulation. These loci were predominantly located on the Z chromosome, which overall exhibited a marked reduction in diversity in the population with the shifted phenology, likely caused by a bottleneck and an interruption of gene flow at the Z in this population. We discuss how these empirical genomic findings support theoretical expectations that assortative mating driven by differences in reproductive timing, underpinned by polymorphisms in circadian genes, along with genetic drift and purge of genetic load at high-impact sites, can promote the onset and persistence of allochronic divergence."
"The reactive oxygen species superoxide is generated by mitochondria during the process of producing energy. While superoxide can cause oxidative damage to the cell, we and others have shown that a mild increase in mitochondrial superoxide extends longevity in multiple model organisms. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved, we identified transcriptional changes in mitochondrial superoxide dismutase deletion mutants (sod-2 worms) using RNA sequencing. sod-2 mutants exhibit a number of changes in nuclear gene expression resulting from elevated mitochondrial superoxide suggesting that mitochondria-to-nucleus signaling is contributing to their longevity. Gene ontology enrichment analysis demonstrated that genes involved in innate immunity and cuticle formation are significantly upregulated in sod-2 worms. To identify kinases involved in this lifespan-extending pathway, we completed a targeted RNA interference screen to examine the contribution of 61 selected kinases to sod-2 longevity. From this screen, we found 25 kinases which are required for the long lifespan of sod-2 mutants including mak-2, which has an established role in a kinase signaling pathway involved in axon regeneration. Disruption of mak-2 specifically reduces sod-2 lifespan but not wild-type longevity and also decreases resistance to multiple exogenous stressors. In examining other genes that act with mak-2 in pathways controlling axon regeneration, we identified a SEK-3/PMK-3/MAK-2/CEBP-1 signaling pathway that is specifically required for sod-2 longevity but not wild-type lifespan. Combined these results suggest a novel role for kinases with established roles in axon regeneration in promoting longevity through a mitochondria-to-nucleus signaling pathway."
"Precise control of hormones is essential to development and reproduction. Hormone bioavailability is regulated by their synthesis and transport, as well as sequestration, natural turnover, and programmed degradation. Here, we use Drosophila melanogaster to investigate developmentally programmed degradation of the retinoic acid-like Juvenile hormones (JHs) that functionally oppose the steroid hormone, ecdysone. Elevated JH titers promote growth and prevent metamorphosis. To understand the role of programmed JH degradation, we generated double and triple knockout animals lacking one of two classes of JH degradation enzymes: JH esterases (JHEs) and JH epoxide hydrolases (JHEHs). While both classes of enzymes degrade JHs, we found they have separate developmental functions such that JHEs restrain growth while JHEHs support growth and ensure timely metamorphosis. To investigate the nature of these unique developmental requirements, we performed genetic and hormone rescue experiments, analyzed hormone-producing glands, and characterized dysregulated gene networks by RNA-sequencing. Together, these data revealed unique dysregulated networks consistent with the separate developmental requirements, as well as shared regulation of Cytochrome P450 gene expression and the size of the ecdysone-producing gland. Strikingly, the four-day delay in metamorphosis in the absence of JHEHs is rescued by ecdysone despite increased ecdysone synthesis gene expression and larger glands in these animals. Together, this study provides new genetic tools and insights into the complexities of programmed hormone degradation in development."
"The Drosophila telomere is one of the best-studied examples of active transposable elements (TEs) benefitting, rather than harming, a host genome. All Drosophila species lack telomerase and instead have telomeres composed of head-to-tail arrays of specialized retrotransposons. These TEs ostensibly act as mutualists by elongating chromosome ends, but evidence from species closely related to Drosophila melanogaster suggests that telomeric transposons may also antagonize their host genome. Importantly, the limited number of Drosophila species characterized thus far has precluded our ability to delineate idiosyncratic from universal evolutionary forces and genetic mechanisms that shape the history of these TEs. Here, we have surveyed long-read genome assemblies of over 100 species of Drosophila, identifying a total of 396 telomeric TE families. Our findings show that these telomere-specialized elements evolve rapidly and also undergo striking convergent evolution: the complete loss of telomeric TEs has occurred repeatedly across the genus while individual telomeric TE lineages have repeatedly lost one of their two protein-coding genes. These elements have also repeatedly undergone horizontal transfer between distantly related Drosophila lineages and have repeatedly captured host gene fragments that promote their selfish suppression of host TE-silencing systems. Furthermore, telomere specialization itself appears to have evolved convergently, as some non-telomeric families have gained the ability to target their insertions to telomeres. These results provide unprecedented resolution into the evolution of these unusual TEs and highlight several novel mechanisms by which they evolve in conflict both with each other and their host genome despite the essential telomere function they provide."
"Testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs) are the most common malignancy in young men, exhibit a unique developmental origin and exceptional chemosensitivity. However, the molecular distinctions between TGCT subtypes remain poorly understood. Here we present a comprehensive genomic analysis of 252 treatment-naive primary TGCTs, integrating deep whole-genome sequencing with matched transcriptomic and epigenomic data. We identify new driver genes and uncover defining features of TGCTs, including pervasive chromosome X amplification with subtype-specific X chromosome inactivation, and a germ cell-like transcriptional program. Although previously reported, whole genome doubling (WGD) in TGCTs is further characterized here as ubiquitous, developmentally early, and associated with age at onset. Seminomas are enriched for early driver mutations, secondary WGD events, sustained XIST expression and replication stress-associated indel mutational signatures, while non-seminomas show greater structural complexity, subclonal diversity, relatively earlier-onset WGD, extended tumor latency, and telomere elongation. Moreover, we identify a mutational signature, SBS87, that is exceptionally rare across cancers with exception of thiopurine-treated leukemia, but strikingly prevalent in TGCT, especially non-seminomas. SBS87 is linked to extended tumor latency and telomere elongation, implicating possible environmental or endogenous processes that mimic thiopurine-induced DNA damage in TGCT pathogenesis. Collectively, our findings define TGCTs as molecularly distinct tumors shaped by early genomic instability and highlight SBS87 as a novel mutational footprint with potential etiologic and clinical relevance."
"Humpback whales construct predictably patterned sequences within multi-hour sessions of sound production. These sequences (called ""songs"") are some of the most structurally and acoustically complex vocal patterns produced by any mammal. Humpback whale song production is highly dynamic in that individuals constantly modify the properties of songs across multiple time scales throughout their adult lives. Past analyses of co-vocalizing humpback whales suggest that singers within earshot of one another may dynamically and interactively adjust their vocalizations in reaction to what they hear. The current study investigated whether singing humpback whales coordinate their production of overlapping sound patterns either by modulating how long they produce similar patterns or by dynamically adjusting the spectral properties of individual sounds and/or sound sequences. Our results show that the vocal adjustments singing humpback whales make when singing in dyads are diverse and appear to depend on the acoustic context. These findings confirm that individual singers flexibly adjust song features in real-time. When pairs of singers adjust song content, they do so in ways that may increase or decrease the acoustic similarity of concurrent sound patterns. No evidence was found of singers adjusting the number or timing of sound pattern repetitions to alter pattern overlap. However, most singers modified how they produced units after a second singer began singing. The current results suggest that co-singing humpback whales attend to the vocal actions of other audible singers and may sometimes modulate song content to initiate social interactions from long distances. Understanding how singing whales vocally interact can clarify the relevance of singing in coordinating vertebrate behavior."
"Cells regulate metabolite levels to efficiently utilize metabolic networks and avoid toxic buildup. In turn, metabolites dictate metabolic activity by acting as substrates, products, and effectors. Despite their foundational role in cell physiology, kinetics, and thermodynamics, absolute metabolite concentrations are seldom known. Here we develop an ensemble method for absolute metabolite quantitation and quantify 84 metabolites in T cells. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry of metabolites co-extracted from T cells and 13C-labeled reference cells reveals absolute concentrations en masse. Across subtypes and individuals, T cell metabolomes resemble one another. T cells possess high adenylate energy charge and favorable redox ratios for energy and biomass production without compromising the forward driving force in glycolysis. Across metabolism, metabolite concentrations exceed their associated Michaelis constants and inhibitor constants two thirds and half of the time, respectively. The conserved features of T cell metabolomes underlie a design principle: metabolite levels prime cells for adaptive immune response."
"Intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) is a widely used tool for neuroprostheses, but its long-term efficacy is often limited by biofouling and neuroinflammatory responses at the electrode-tissue interface. Microglia orchestrate neuroinflammation and regulate synaptic plasticity, and low-frequency stimulation has been shown to promote anti-inflammatory microglial phenotypes. We therefore examined, over the first three days post-implantation, how 10-Hz ICMS influences microglial-neuronal interactions in vivo using two-photon imaging in Cx3cr1-GFP/jRGECO1a mice.

A one-hour session of 10-Hz ICMS did not induce overt morphological activation of microglia but increased their process motility, directing extensions toward both the electrode and neurons exhibiting elevated calcium activity. By post-implantation Day 2, microglial extensions were significantly biased toward neurons whose {Delta}F/F surpassed a 3 standard deviation threshold after stimulation onset (74.26{degrees} {+/-} 11.83{degrees}) but shifted away from those same neurons after 40 min of continuous stimulation (116.99{degrees} {+/-} 9.19{degrees}) (p = 0.001732), suggesting a dynamic, homeostatic response to sustained neuronal calcium elevations. Although multi-day electrode insertion accelerated microglial motility and polarization toward the device, 10-Hz ICMS alone did not alter microglial branching or soma shape. Microglial contact frequency scaled with neuronal adaptation profiles: depressed neurons received the most contacts immediately post-implant (1.15 {+/-} 0.3 contacts; p = .0460). These findings reveal stimulus-associated, neuron-dependent surveillance behaviors of microglia during early post-implantation ICMS and implicate them as active participants in short-term modulation of cortical circuits."
"Multiplets--droplets that capture more than one cell--are a known artefact in droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), yet their prevalence and impact remain underestimated. In this study, we assess the frequency of multiplets across diverse publicly available datasets and evaluate how well commonly used detection tools are able to identify them. Using cell hashing data to determine a lower bound of the true multiplet rate, we demonstrate that commonly used heuristic estimations systematically underestimate multiplet rates, and that existing tools--despite optimized parameters--detect only a small subset of cell-hashing multiplets. We further refine a Poisson-based model to estimate the true multiplet rate, revealing that actual rates can exceed heuristic predictions by more than twofold.

Downstream analyses are significantly affected by multiplets: they are not confined to isolated clusters but are distributed throughout the transcriptional landscape, where they distort clustering and cell type annotation. Using both quantitative and qualitative approaches, we visualize these effects and show that cell-hashing-informed multiplet removal eliminates artefactual clusters and improves annotation clarity, whereas computationally detected multiplets fail to fully remove artefacts in the most common experimental contexts.

Our findings confirm that multiplet contamination remains a pervasive and under-addressed issue in scRNA-seq analysis. Since most datasets lack multiplexing, researchers must often rely on heuristics and limited tools, leaving many multiplets unidentified. We advocate for more robust multiplet-detection strategies, including multimodal validation, to ensure more accurate and interpretable scRNA-seq results."
"MotivationRealising the value of large DNA sequence collections demands efficient search and extraction of sequences of interest. Search queries may vary in size from short gene sequences to multiple whole genomes that are too large to fit in computer memory. In microbial genomics, a routine search application involving both large queries and large collections is the removal of contaminating host genome sequences from microbial (meta)genomes. Where the host is human, sensitive classification and excision of host sequences is usually necessary to protect host genetic information. Precise classification is also critical in order to retain microbial sequences and permit accurate microbial genomic analysis. While human pangenomes have been shown to increase sensitivity of human sequence classification, existing bioinformatic host depletion approaches have either limited precision when used with metagenomes or large computing resource requirements.

ResultsWe present Deacon, an efficient and versatile sequence filter for raw sequence files and streams. We demonstrate its leading accuracy for the task of host depletion, using less computing resource than existing approaches. By querying a human pangenome index for minimizers contained in each input sequence, Deacon is able to accurately classify and discard diverse human sequences from long reads at over 250Mbp/s with a commodity laptop. We present validation of classification sensitivity, specificity and speed with simulated short and long reads for diverse catalogues of human, bacterial and viral genomes alongside existing methods. Beyond host depletion, Deacon is well suited to common sequence search and filtering applications, particularly those involving large queries. Capable of indexing a human genome in under 30s, Deacon is equipped to rapidly compose custom minimizer indexes using set operations, facilitating efficient search and filtering of massive sequence datasets using gigabase queries.

Availability and implementationDeacon is implemented as an MIT-licensed command line tool written in Rust and packaged with Bioconda. Code is available from https://github.com/bede/deacon."
"Multi-omics technologies allow for a detailed characterization of cell types and states across multiple omics layers, helping to identify features that differentiate biological conditions, such as chemical or CRISPR-based perturbations. However, current tools employing variational inference on single-cell datasets, including methods for paired and mosaic integration, transfer learning, and modality imputation, typically act as black boxes. This lack of interpretability makes it challenging to evaluate whether biological variation is preserved, which can compromise downstream analyses. Here, we introduce NetworkVI, a sparse deep generative model designed for the integration and interpretation of multimodal single-cell data. NetworkVI utilizes biological prior knowledge as an inductive bias, specifically it relies on gene-gene interactions inferred from topologically associated domains and structured ontologies like the Gene Ontology to aggregate gene embeddings to cell embeddings, enhancing the interpretability at the gene and subcellular level. While achieving state-of-the-art data integration, modality imputation, and cell label transfer via query-to-reference mapping benchmarks across bimodal and trimodal datasets, NetworkVI additionally excels in providing biologically meaningful modality- and cell type-specific interpretations. NetworkVI aids researchers in identifying associations between genes and biological processes and uncovers immune evasion mechanisms in a Perturb CITE-seq dataset of melanoma cells. NetworkVI will support researchers in interpreting cellular disease mechanisms, guiding biomarker discovery, and ultimately aiding the development of targeted therapies in large-scale single-cell multimodal atlases.

NetworkVI is available at http://github.com/LArnoldt/networkVI."
"Understanding cellular identity and function across species is fundamental to deciphering conserved biological principles and translating insights from model organisms to human health. However, integrating single-cell transcriptomic data, particularly from resource-limited human studies, with comprehensive datasets from model organisms like mice remains a significant challenge due to evolutionary divergence and technical variability. Here, we introduce the Cross-Species Latent Alignment Network (CSLAN), a transfer learning framework that effectively bridges this gap for robust cell type classification. CSLAN employs a novel strategy involving focused feature selection on source (mouse) data followed by pretraining an encoder-decoder architecture. Crucially, for transfer to human data, only the encoder is fine-tuned while the latent space processor and the decoder, which encapsulate learned, conserved cell type signatures, remains fixed. This targeted adaptation mechanism allows CSLAN to achieve exceptional accuracy (e.g., 96.67% for human immune cells in a trauma context) by efficiently aligning human gene expression profiles to a biologically informed latent space derived from mouse data. Our findings establish a powerful and broadly applicable paradigm for cross-species knowledge transfer, enabling deeper biological insights from limited human scRNA-seq data by leveraging the wealth of information from model systems, with significant implications for translational research and the construction of comprehensive, cross-species cell atlases."
"Non-collagenous proteins (NCPs) are specialized biomacromolecules within the extracellular matrix (ECM) that regulate the mineralization of calcified tissues, such as bone and dentin. Numerous in vitro studies have demonstrated that natural polyanionic NCPs and their analogues can mediate intrafibrillar mineralization, characterized by the infiltration of apatite minerals into collagen fibrils. However, these studies primarily utilize self-assembled collagen fibrils or demineralized mature tissues, leaving it unclear whether pristine embryonic bone ECM at a developmental stage permissive to mineral deposition can regulate intrafibrillar mineralization independently or requires polyanionic NCP substitutes to promote the process artificially. To address this, we employed an ex vivo model of endochondral ossification using metatarsals isolated from 15-day-old embryonic mice (E15). In addition to a supersaturated calcium (Ca) and inorganic phosphate (Pi) medium, we introduced fetuin-A, a native polyanionic NCP or poly-DL-aspartic acid (pAsp), commonly used as an NCP substitute. The incorporation of either additive was essential for the effective mineralization of embryonic metatarsals. Both fetuin-A and pAsp played a direct role in facilitating the infiltration of Ca-Pi precursors into the avascular cartilaginous matrix. Raman spectroscopy and electron microscopy confirmed the formation of hydroxyapatite (HAp) exhibiting diverse levels of crystallinity, with fetuin-A supplementation resulting in the greatest HAp accumulation within the rudiments. HAp was localized in the perichondrium, a region conducive to initial mineralization and enriched with a fibrillar network of collagen types I and II. Three-dimensional reconstructions implementing Dijkstras algorithm revealed the association between HAp and collagen fibrils either organized in an intrafibrillar, extrafibrillar, or combined arrangement."
"Scientists seemed not to have explored mechanical kinetic energy, a path function for the determination of nonequilibrium binding energy (NEBE). The study explored mechanical kinetic energy, a path function in particles that requires nonequilibrium binding energy (NEBE) to counteract it. It aimed to show that there was a minimally sufficient NEBE to counteract mechanical kinetic energy, using literature data to evaluate derived equations and computations. As is typical, diffusivities increase with temperature; however, near binding, the binding limitations cause the diffusivities (1.519 [-&gt;] 2.784 exp. (- 15) m2/s for D variant; 1.415[-&gt;]2.577 exp. (- 15) m2/s for G variant) to be lower than when they are far from binding (4.36 [-&gt;]7.99 exp. (- 15) m2/s for D variant; 4.151[-&gt;]7.611 exp. (- 15) m2/s for G variant). With breath emission equal to 1.29 exp. (7)/m3, the NEBEs were 656.020 and 663.212 kcal/mol for Delta and Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2, respectively; and with 27.9 exp. (7)/m3, the corresponding values were 568.921 and 633 kcal/mol; with a breath emission rate equal to 9.31 exp. (+6)/hr., the NEBEs for the Omicron variant in 1 hr. and in 1 min. were 651.703 and 683.353 kcal/mol, respectively; with 201 exp. (+6)/hr., the corresponding values were 444.157 and 663.212 kcal/mol. The G variant of SARS-CoV-2 showed higher NEBEs (952[-&gt;]671 kcal/mol) than D variants (834[-&gt;]588 kcal/mol), corresponding to 293.15[-&gt;]318.15 K. The decreasing trend in maximum NEBE [Formula] with rising temperature implies that the binding affinity of the virus may be attenuated at higher temperatures. It is, therefore, medically plausible to administer airborne, parenteral, oral, etc., drugs at temperatures above body temperatures that are tolerable and in a controlled fashion. Future studies should be directed to a definite determination of the size and molar mass of variants of SARS-CoV-2."
"Sub-populations of cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF)-like tumor cells deposit extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins that support Ewing sarcoma (EwS) progression and metastasis. We previously showed a hallmark of CAF-like EwS cells is their hybrid transcriptional state wherein the driver fusion oncogene, EWS::FLI1, maintains activation of proliferative programs but loses capacity to repress mesenchymal genes. Here, we studied primary patient tumors and cell line models to identify molecular drivers of this hybrid state. Our data reveal that hybrid EwS cells are induced and maintained by a TGF{beta} signaling positive feedback loop. Hybrid cells de-repress TGFBR2 and upregulate expression and secretion of TGF{beta}2 to sustain pathway activation and ECM deposition. While TGF{beta} ligands can potently induce growth arrest in cells of epithelial origin, we show that TGF{beta}1 and TGF{beta}2 promote cell invasion of EwS cells without affecting proliferation. Thus, stroma and tumor-derived TGF{beta} ligands induce and maintain hybrid EwS cells to promote pro-metastatic cell phenotypes."
"Spatial transcriptomics is a technology that captures gene expression levels at different spatial locations, widely used in tumor microenvironment analysis and molecular profiling of histopathology, providing valuable insights into resolving gene expression and clinical diagnosis of cancer. Due to the high cost of data acquisition, large-scale spatial transcriptomics data remain challenging to obtain. In this study, we develop a contrastive learning-based deep learning method to predict spatially resolved gene expression from whole-slide images. Evaluation across six different disease datasets demonstrates that, compared to existing studies, our method improves Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) in the prediction of highly expressed genes, highly variable genes, and marker genes by 6.27%, 6.11%, and 11.26% respectively. Further analysis indicates that our method preserves gene-gene correlations and applies to datasets with limited samples. Additionally, our method exhibits potential in cancer tissue localization based on biomarker expression."
"BackgroundDegenerative protein modifications (DPMs) accumulate with aging and can alter biomolecule structure and function, including via spontaneous conversion of Asn-Gly-Arg (NGR) to isoAsp-Gly-Arg (isoDGR) motifs that can bind integrins and drive chronic inflammation.

Since isoDGR-modified extracellular matrix proteins are enriched in atherosclerosis and have been associated with rupture-prone plaque characteristics, we hypothesized that antibody neutralisation can inhibit key pathological features including atherosclerotic vascular plaque formation and metabolic dysfunction.

MethodsWe first examined Pcmt1-/- mice which rapidly accumulate isoDGR due to lack of the corresponding repair enzyme to assess the extent of vascular protein damage. We then treated 6-8 week old atherosclerosis-prone (ApoE-/-) mice which were fed a high-fat Western diet (WD) with weekly dose of 1mg/kg isoDGR-specific monoclonal antibody (isoDGR-mAb) or isotype-matched control (while on diet) for 2 months duration. A regular chow-fed ApoE-/- group served as baseline control. Aortic atherosclerotic burden, plaque composition, systemic inflammation, lipid profiles, hepatic steatosis, and metabolic parameters (indirect calorimetry) were assessed.

ResultsPcmt1-/- mice displayed extensive isoDGR deposition and degeneration of the aortic wall, linking this DPM to vascular structural damage. In the ApoE-/- mice, WD induced large aortic root plaques with abundant isoDGR and macrophage infiltration. IsoDGR-mAb treatment decreased plaque size by [~]30% with reduced lipid and collagen content (p=0.001). Furthermore, plaques in treated mice contained significantly fewer CD68+ macrophages that also exhibited limited activation. Systemically, isoDGR-mAb modified lipoprotein profiles by decreasing atherogenic VLDL/IDL/LDL cholesterol (p=0.04) while slightly increasing HDL, accompanied by a reduction in circulating inflammatory proteins. IsoDGR-mAb also protected against hepatic lipid accumulation which was reduced by [~]60% in treated animals (p<0.001), with indirect calorimetry confirming [~]30% higher oxygen consumption and energy expenditure without change in food intake or physical activity.

ConclusionWe identified isoDGR as a key pathological factor involved in the progression of atherosclerosis. Remarkably, isoDGR neutralization diminished plaque inflammation and improved atherosclerotic plaque stability. Our findings support isoDGR neutralization as a promising therapeutic strategy to mitigate both atherosclerosis and aging-associated metabolic dysfunction."
"PremisePlastid-based data sets continue to play a major role in our understanding of early flowering-plant relationships, although organellar genomes of major lineages outside the monocots and eudicots remain under-sampled. A tendency of mitochondrial RNA-edit sites to mislead phylogenetic analysis in mixed transcriptomic/genomic data sets needs attention in angiosperm-wide studies, which only rarely consider mitochondrial genomes.

MethodsWe compared mitochondrial- vs. plastid-based phylogenomic inferences, examined the effect of removing putative RNA-edit sites from mitochondrial data, and performed combined organellar analysis (plastid plus filtered mitochondrial genomes). We expanded taxon sampling for multiple angiosperm lineages for phylogenomic analysis using both organellar genomes, representing several poorly sampled lineages (in particular Degeneriaceae, Trimeniaceae) with smaller (few-gene) data sets.

ResultsPlastid-based inferences recover well-supported relationships that align with and build upon previous studies, and recover well-supported internal relationships for two ANA-grade families (Hydatellaceae, Trimeniaceae) sampled for nearly all species. By contrast, unfiltered mitochondrial inferences of angiosperm phylogeny are generally poorly supported, and recover anomalous relationships compared to plastid-based inferences. However, removing putative mitochondrial RNA-edit sites dramatically reduces inter-organellar conflict and improves overall branch support.

ConclusionsWe accounted for phylogenomic discordance between the two organellar genomes regarding overall angiosperm-wide relationships and filled in taxonomic gaps (poorly sampled lineages). Removing RNA edit sites substantially improves congruence in interorganellar inferences by effectively correcting a systematic bias in mitochondrial data. Uncertain relationships persist among five major mesangiosperm lineages in plastid-based inferences, but a clade comprising Chloranthales, Ceratophyllales and eudicots is well supported by filtered mitochondrial data."
"Active sensing necessarily requires integrating information about both self-generated movements as well as past, present, and future afferent inputs1,2. However, such information is inherently variable and relies, at least in part, on uncertain extrapolations. Here, using saccadic suppression3,4 of visual sensitivity as a classic example of sensory-motor integration, we show that suppression strength in two drastically different species, macaque monkeys and zebrafish larvae, may be a direct outcome of efficient state estimation in the presence of uncontrollable sensory and motor variability. Bayesian estimator models5 suggest that optimal saccadic suppression should rely not just on the sensory-motor information being processed, but also on the time-dependent magnitude of unexplained variability in the nervous system encoding it. In both macaques and zebrafish larvae, and using matched visual stimulation regimes across the species, we experimentally measured saccadic suppression strength in the superior colliculus (SC) of the monkeys and the homologous optic tectum (OT) of the fish. We also experimentally quantified additive and multiplicative noise components in the motor systems of both species, and we furthermore estimated noise in the sensory systems. We found that inter-species differences in noise levels and their theoretically predicted impacts on visual sensitivity are qualitatively consistent with our experimentally observed differences in saccadic suppression strength between the fish and the monkeys. Because sensory and motor noise levels can reflect the amounts of available neural resources committed to a given task, our results strongly underscore the value of incorporating computational resource limits in investigating performance differences that have evolved in homologous brain areas."
"ObjectiveFetal alcohol spectrum disorders affect approximately 1 in 20 school age children in the United States of America. To study fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, mouse models are commonly used. Of the many approaches of gestational exposure, voluntary drinking paradigms represent the most similar mechanism of drinking as human exposure. These exposures can be done through low-tech solutions such as test tubes (TT), or more high-tech methods such as a volumetric drinking monitor (VDM). Here were compare the TT method and the VDM directly, to evaluate their effect on female mouse drinking.

MethodWe adapted a drinking in the dark, active cycle, limited access (4 hr.) voluntary drinking paradigm first described by Brady et al. (2012) to test tubes and the volumetric drinking monitor. 8 mice were placed in either drinking method and we evaluated their drinking volume and blood alcohol concentrations (BACs). We compared the values for each group using t-tests.

ResultsAfter 2 weeks of drinking 10% ethanol with 0.4% saccharine, BACs were not significantly different [t(14)=0.2681, p=0.7935] between the VDM (81.56 {+/-} 21.16 mg/dL) vs.TT (73.14 {+/-} 23.20 mg/dL) groups. Calculated intake of ethanol (g/kg) on the day of blood draw for BAC analysis was also not significantly different [t(14)=0.4308, p=0.6732] between VDM (2.985 {+/-} 0.4127) vs.TT (3.260 {+/-} 0.4863; Fig 1B) groups.

"Spontaneous stereotypies (abnormal, repetitive, and seemingly goal-less behaviors) in captive animals resemble stereotypies documented in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders, including evidence of homologous cortico-striatal dysfunction and shared behavioral deficits. While environmental risk factors for stereotypies are well documented, their developmental pathophysiology remains unclear. However, as previously found for compulsive behavior, there is growing evidence that REDOX imbalance may be linked to stereotypy. To examine the nature of this relationship, we first tested whether plasma glutathione level, the gold-standard biomarker of REDOX imbalance, is predictive of stereotypy severity in N=19 C57BL/6 mice. After confirming the presence of this relationship, we used a proteomics approach (Olink) to identify a broader biomarker profile of dysfunction. We found expression of 9 proteins to correlate with plasma glutathione level, and expression of 15 proteins to correlate with stereotypy severity. A subset of these proteins additionally correlated with stereotypy severity in a validation cohort of CD1 mice (N=28). Further supporting a role for REDOX imbalance in the developmental pathophysiology of stereotypies, the identified proteins were associated with REDOX physiology, dopamine physiology, and stereotypy-presenting human neurodevelopmental disorders. These data suggest REDOX imbalance may contribute to the developmental pathophysiology of abnormal repetitive behaviors and highlight promising novel targets for intervention."
"The skin lesion erythema migrans (EM) is the first clinical sign of Lyme disease, an infection due to the tick-transmitted bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb). Previously, we used scRNA-Seq to characterize the cutaneous immune response in the EM lesion, focusing on B cells. Here, with an expanded sample size, we profiled T cell responses in EM lesions compared to autologous uninvolved skin. In addition to CD4+ T cell subsets known to be abundant in the EM, we identified clonal expansion of CD8+ GZMK+ IFNG+ T cells that exhibited significant differential expression of interferon-regulated genes. This subset included IFNG+ cells with low cytotoxic gene expression, which may promote inflammation. While FOXP3+ regulatory T cells were also increased in EM, they exhibited little IL10 expression. In contrast, a CD4+ FOXP3- tissue-resident T cell subset contained the largest population of cells with IL10 expression. Fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and pericytes were the principal cells that significantly differentially expressed key T cell-recruiting chemokines. These studies represent the first comprehensive interrogation of the cutaneous T cell response to Bb infection using single cell transcriptomics with adaptive immune receptor sequencing, providing insight into the skin barrier defense and orchestration of the immune response to this vector-borne pathogen."
"Bats play important ecological roles but also can carry various pathogens, including trypanosomatids. This study reports the first detection of Trypanosoma sp. in flies from the Streblidae family parasitizing Carollia perspicillata bats in a peri-urban fragment of the Atlantic Forest in Sao Paulo. Using shotgun metagenomics, we detected Trypanosoma sequences in half of the fly samples analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis showed these sequences belong to the Neobat 4 clade, previously reported in Carollia sp. bats. Although streblid flies ability to transmit Trypanosoma is still unknown, their close connection with bats means they might be used as a non-invasive way to monitor pathogens when bat sampling is difficult. More research is needed, but this work expands what we know about the Neobat 4 clades geographic distribution and parasite circulation in bats and their ectoparasites."
"AbstractFrequent spillover of influenza A viruses from humans to swine contributes to the increasing diversity of influenza viruses circulating in pigs. Although these events are common, little is known about the adaptation processes that take place when viruses jump between the two species. We examined the changes that occurred during serial passages of a reassortant H3N2 virus (VIC11pTRIG) containing human seasonal surface genes (Hemagglutinin and Neuraminidase) and a swine-adapted internal gene constellation in differentiated primary swine tracheal epithelial cells (pSTECs). The VIC11pTRIG reassortant virus was serially passaged 8 times in pSTECs and compared to a control swine-adapted strain (OH/04p) containing the same internal gene constellation. Viral RNA from passages 0 (inoculum), 1, 3, 4-8 were sequenced via next generation or Sanger sequencing. Hemagglutinin diversity was highest at passage 3. Two amino acid mutations in the Hemagglutinin protein (N165K and N216K) were fixed at passages 7 and 5, respectively. These changes were associated with increased fitness of the virus in pSTECs compared to the original parental strain. Our results suggest that the adaptation of human seasonal H3N2 to swine cells may lead to the selection of HA mutations located near the receptor binding site. These mutations may result in increased fitness of human-origin H3N2 strains to adapt in swine."
"During CRISPR-Cas adaptation, prokaryotic cells become immunized by the insertion of foreign DNA fragments, termed spacers, into the host genome to serve as templates for RNA-guided immunity. Spacer acquisition relies on the Cas1-Cas2 integrase and accessory proteins like Cas4, which select DNA sequences flanked by the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) and insert them into the CRISPR array. It has been shown that in type II-A systems selection of PAM-proximal prespacers is mediated by the effector nuclease Cas9, which forms a  supercomplex with the Cas1-Cas2 integrase and the Csn2 protein. However, the supercomplex structure and the role of the ring-like Csn2 protein remain unknown. Here, we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of the type II-A prespacer selection supercomplex in the DNA-scanning and two different PAM-bound configurations. Our study uncovers the mechanism of Cas9-mediated prespacer selection in type II-A CRISPR-Cas systems, and reveals the role of the accessory protein Csn2, which serves as a platform for the assembly of Cas9 and Cas1-Cas2 integrase on prespacer DNA, reminiscent of the sliding clamp in DNA replication. Repurposing of Cas9 by the CRISPR adaptation machinery for prespacer selection characterized here demonstrates Cas9 plasticity and expands our knowledge of the Cas9 biology."
"RNA modifications are critical regulators of gene expression and cellular processes; however, the epitranscriptome is less well studied than the epigenome. Here, we studied transcriptome-wide changes in RNA modifications and expression levels in two human pancreatic beta-cell lines, EndoC-BH1 and EndoC-BH3, after one hour of glucose stimulation. Using direct RNA nanopore sequencing (dRNA-seq), we measured N6-methyladenosine (m6A), 5-methylcytosine (m5C), inosine, and pseudouridine concurrently across the transcriptome. We developed a differential RNA modification method and identified 1,697 differentially modified sites (DMSs) across all modifications. These DMSs were largely independent of changes in gene expression levels and enriched in transcripts for type 2 diabetes (T2D) genes. Our study demonstrates how dRNA-seq can be used to detect and quantify RNA modification changes in response to cellular stimuli at the single-nucleotide level and provides new insights into RNA-mediated mechanisms that may contribute to normal beta-cell response and potential dysfunction in T2D."
"Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) play a central role in protein translation and are increasingly recognized as dynamic regulators of gene expression. Both physiological and environmental signals can modulate tRNA abundance and chemical modifications, yet the impact of dietary cues on the tRNA landscape remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the effects of two distinct dietary interventions--low-protein and high-fat diets--on tRNA abundance and modification profiles across multiple mouse tissues. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of tRNA abundance and modification changes in response to these nutritional challenges using RNA mass spectrometry and Ordered Two-Template Relay sequencing (OTTR-seq), a modified-base-sensitive tRNA sequencing method. Our results reveal both shared and tissue-specific alterations in abundance and modifications of specific nuclear and mitochondrial genome-encoded tRNAs in response to dietary conditions at isotype, isoacceptor, and isodecoder levels. As many of the tissue-specific or diet-responsive tRNA modifications have been previously reported to affect decoding efficiency or translational fidelity, these results have implications for understanding translational adaptation in response to dietary conditions."
"Tuberculosis, caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Proteins involved in lipid metabolism, such as the monoacylglycerol lipase Rv0183, play critical roles during both the active and dormant phases of Mtb and present novel targets for therapeutic intervention. Through high-throughput screening at the European Lead Factory, we identified a novel chemotype characterized by a hydroxypyrrolidine ring, which demonstrated potent inhibition of Rv0183 and promising results in whole cell bacterial studies. Subsequent co-crystallization studies of this chemotype with Rv0183 revealed non-covalent interactions within the lipases binding pocket, elucidating the inhibitory mechanism. Comparative analysis, augmented by AI-driven 3D-point-cloud approaches, distinguished Rv0183s ligand-binding cavity from that of human monoacylglycerol lipase, implying the possibility for species-selective inhibition. This selectivity was further supported by molecular docking simulations which validated the experimental binding affinities and predicted strong, specific binding modes. Our study presents not only the structural basis for the inhibition of Rv0183 by these novel hydroxypyrrolidine-based inhibitors but also demonstrates the utility of integrating computational and empirical methods to achieve species-specific targeting. This approach could minimize off-target effects in humans, marking a significant step toward developing more effective antitubercular therapies. The potential to selectively inhibit Mtb in its dormant state could lead to treatments that prevent the persistence and resurgence of the disease, addressing a crucial gap in the fight against tuberculosis."

"Siglecs are immunomodulatory receptors that regulate immune cell function. A fundamental challenge in studying Siglec-ligand interactions is the low affinity of Siglecs for their ligands. Inspired by how nature uses multivalency, we developed Siglec-liposomes as a highly multivalent and versatile platform for detecting Siglec glycan ligands in which recombinant Siglecs were conjugated to liposomes using the SpyCatcher-SpyTag system. Siglec-liposomes offer tunable multivalency and a modular assembly, enabling presentation of different Siglecs on the same liposome. Using Siglec-liposomes, we profiled Siglec ligands on human leukocytes, revealing new insights into Siglec ligands. Moreover, Siglec-liposomes are in vivo compatible, where we demonstrated that Siglec-7-liposomes bind to the brain vasculature in a mucin-dependent manner. Given the abundance of Siglec ligands on T cells, we investigated whether Siglec-liposomes modulate T cell function and find that Siglec-7-liposomes increase T cell proliferation in a ST3Gal1-dependent and CD43-independent manner. Taken together, Siglec-liposomes are a versatile and sensitive tool for detecting Siglec ligands and immunomodulation."
"Cyanide is widely used in industries due to its strong affinity for metals, a property that also underlies its potent toxicity. Industries therefore must reduce cyanide concentration in wastewater final disposal. Physical, chemical, and biological methods have been developed for this purpose; however, knowledge about the structure of enzymes involved in cyanide degradation remains limited. Structural characterization of these proteins could facilitate the development of more efficient enzymes with enhanced bioremediation potential. Here, we present the single-particle cryo-electron microscopy structures of a cyanide dihydratase from Bacillus safensis and a cyanide hydratase from Gloeocercospora sorghi at 2.2 [A] and 2.0 [A] resolution, respectively. We provide a comprehensive description and comparative analysis of these structures alongside all previously experimentally determined nitrilase structures. Importantly, our full-length structures reveal new structural features in the C-terminal as well as specific intermolecular interactions between protomer interfaces and within the helix lumen. Finally, our findings offer insights into the possible reaction mechanisms of these two enzymes."
"Three-dimensional (3D) neural spheroids, or neurospheres, generated from human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived neural stem cells (NSCs) more accurately recapitulate the microenvironmental cues of neural tissue compared to traditional two-dimensional (2D) monolayers. However, comparative omics-based characterizations of these models remain limited. Here, we present a streamlined and scalable TMT-based quantitative proteomics workflow to contrast the proteomic landscapes of hiPSC-derived NSCs cultured in 2D monolayers versus 3D neurospheres. A total of 1,576 proteins were identified in an unfractionated LC-MS/MS of 68 minutes, with 542 showing significant differential abundance between groups. Neurospheres exhibited enrichment in neural-related pathways, such as synaptic signaling, neurotrophin signaling, cytoskeletal organization and vesicle trafficking, while monolayers enriched for multipotency features, such as general metabolic activity. Cell-type enrichment analyses confirmed increased neuronal identity in neurospheres, including elevated levels of markers associated with neuronal maturation. Our results demonstrate that 3D culture of NSCs induces a proteomic shift toward a more mature neural phenotype. This rapid, multiplexed proteomic approach enables high-content molecular profiling suitable for drug screening and personalized medicine applications.

SignificanceThe present work contributes to the molecular and biological understanding of iPSC-derived neurospheres by exploring the proteome of this model. Neurospheres are a culture model of great potential and applicability in neurobiology research and personalized medicine, which still lacks a robust omic characterization. By studying neurospheres, we also work with a 3D culture model generated in vitro, avoiding the use of primary neural cells culture and animal models. Our fast method is relevant to single-cell proteomics, personalized medicine and screening assays."
"Intracellular protein transport (ICT) is a tightly regulated process that orchestrates protein localization and expression, ensuring proper cellular function. Dysregulated ICT can lead to aberrant expression of surface proteins involved in cell-cell communication, adhesion, and immune responses, contributing to disease progression and therapeutic resistance. Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by Sequencing (CITE-seq) enables the simultaneous measurement of mRNA and surface protein levels in the same cell, providing a powerful opportunity to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying surface protein regulation. In this study, we introduce a novel computational frame for Modeling Protein Expression and Transport (MPET) that evaluates the contribution of ICT activity to differential surface protein expression using CITE-seq data. MPET comprises three modules for identification of ICT- surface protein regulatory circuits across biological scales and their contributions to phenotypic variation. We applied MPET to analyze single-cell data from COVID-19 patients with varying disease severity. Our analysis revealed context-dependent recruitment of ICT genes and pervasive rewiring of ICT pathways throughout the course of disease progression. Notably, we found that even when the transcriptional levels of key immune response proteins remained stable, their expression on cell surface were significantly altered due to dysregulated ICT. MPET provides a valuable new tool for dissecting complex regulatory networks and offers mechanistic insight into post-transcriptional regulation of cell surface proteins in diseases."
"Reliable human-relevant models of peripheral nerve function remain a critical unmet need in preclinical drug development, particularly for predicting neurotoxicity and bridging the gap to clinical translation. Here, we introduce a next generation Nerve-on-a-Chip, PNS-3D organoids, as a novel human-cell-based 3D peripheral nerve microphysiological system (MPS) that recapitulates key functional and structural features of native nerves, including long-distance axonal outgrowth, physiological myelination, and clinically translational population level electrophysiology. The platform integrates iPSC-derived human sensory neurons and primary human Schwann cells within a spatially organized 3D environment, coupled to a custom embedded electrode array that enables high-content, longitudinal, and clinically translatable functional assessments. As a proof of concept, we evaluated the platforms predictive power using vincristine, a chemotherapeutic agent known to cause chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). PNS-3D organoids captured dose- and time-dependent deficits in nerve conduction velocity, compound action potential amplitude, and axonal degeneration, with IC values in line with human clinical exposures-- outperforming traditional 2D cultures and in vivo benchmarks. Transcriptomic and morphological analyses further revealed neuron-specific degeneration consistent with axonopathy. These results validate the platform as a human-relevant, clinically translation, and scalable solution, enabling mechanistic safety assessment and drug discovery for neurotoxic and neuroprotective therapeutics."
"Fetal growth restriction (FGR) affects [~]10% of pregnancies worldwide and is often associated with placental insufficiency. Iron is essential for maternal haematopoietic adaptations and placental processes such as mitochondrial iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster assembly, heme synthesis, and erythropoiesis. This study aimed to characterise iron transport and downstream utilisation in FGR. Placental tissues from term uncomplicated (n=19) and FGR (n=18) pregnancies were analysed. Maternal iron status was retrospectively assessed from clinical records. Placental mRNA and protein expression of iron-dependent pathways were analysed via RT-qPCR, LC-MS, and Western blotting. Placental iron content was assessed histologically, and heme levels were measured by activity assay. FGR pregnancies showed significantly elevated maternal serum ferritin and lower red cell distribution width, although remained within normal clinical values. Placental iron uptake transporters TFRC and DMT1 were significantly upregulated, while the iron exporter to the fetus, ferroportin, was reduced, indicating increased iron retention in the FGR placenta. Despite altered transporter expression, Fe3+ iron levels were unchanged, suggesting iron utilisation over storage. Subsequent investigations identified reduced mitochondrial Fe-S synthesis components (FDXR, FDX2, NDUFAB1, HSPA9), and a prioritisation of mitochondrial and cytosolic heme synthesis enzymes in FGR. Protein levels of haemoglobin subunits (HBG1, HBG2, HBB, HBA1) and erythrocyte membrane markers (EPB41, EPB42, SPTA1, SPTB, ANK1) were decreased. These findings reveal a compensatory response in FGR placentae, with increased iron uptake and utilisation favouring heme synthesis over Fe-S cluster formation, possibly to support oxygen handling under poor placental vascularisation and reduced fetal oxygenation, with potential consequences for mitochondrial energy metabolism.

"The heterodimeric GABAB receptor, composed of GB1 and GB2 subunits, is a metabotropic G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) activated by the neurotransmitter GABA. GABA binds to the extracellular domain of GB1 to activate G proteins through GB2. Here we show that GABAB receptors can be activated by mechanical forces, such as traction force and shear stress, in a GABA-independent manner. This GABA-independent mechano-activation of GABAB receptor is mediated by a direct interaction between integrins and the extracellular domain of GB1, indicating that GABAB receptor and integrin form a novel type of mechano-transduction complex. Mechanistically, shear stress promotes the binding of integrin to GB1 and induces an allosteric re-arrangement of GABAB receptor transmembrane domains towards an active conformation, culminating in receptor activation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that shear stress-induced GABAB receptor activation plays a crucial role in astrocyte remodeling. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized function of GABAB receptor in mechano-transduction, uncovering a novel ligand-independent activation mechanism for GPCRs."
"Recent progress in therapeutic cancer vaccines has shown promising clinical activity, especially when targeting MHC class I (MHCI) neoantigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses in post-surgical patients. To explore the role of CD4+ T cells in vaccine-dependent tumor rejection, we constructed an mRNA lipoplex vaccine encoding a single MHCII-restricted neoantigen. The vaccine elicited Tfh and Th1 cell responses while decreasing Tregs, leading to rejection of established tumors in mice. IL-21 and IFN-{gamma}, crucial for Tfh and Th1 function respectively, contributed to anti-tumor activity. B cells and neoantigen-specific antibodies were also shown to participate in vaccine efficacy. Additionally, conventional type 1 dendritic cells (cDC1s) were essential for eliciting vaccine-induced CD4+ T cells, and both cDC1s and CD4+ T cells were required to enhance endogenous CD8+ responses, which were crucial for tumor control. Our results suggest that immunizing against MHCII neoantigens alone is sufficient to orchestrate a potent and cooperative immune response against cancer."
"Conjugative plasmids drive bacterial evolution and niche adaptation. Their carriage often corresponds with changes to the host transcriptome, but it is unknown during which stage of the conjugation process these transcriptional changes are initiated, and how gene transfer is modulated as they occur. This is because they are normally studied after their full acquisition by conjugation has already occurred, not during the process. Here, active RP4 conjugation revealed that the transcriptional response to plasmid acquisition is almost immediate and is host and surface factor dependent. Responses included activation of non-SOS stress pathways, motility, exopolysaccharide production, anaerobic respiration, and metabolic adaptation. These responses were not a barrier to conjugation, indicating that their significance relates to host homeostasis rather than gene transfer. The recipient could prevent these responses by blocking conjugation through capsule expression. RP4 expression was also inhibited by recipient capsule, since capsule physically blocked donor-recipient contact. Unexpectedly, within a population, RP4 was found to exploit single cell variation in recipient capsule thickness and to successfully conjugate with recipient bacteria with reduced capsule. These results show a novel interplay between plasmid and surface architecture across diverse species that controls the conjugation transcriptional landscape, with important ramifications for plasmid dissemination and evolution."
"Bacteria use diverse sensors to integrate environmental stimuli into physiological responses that ensure fitness and survival. Ralstonia pseudosolanacearum (Rps), a soil-borne plant pathogen that causes bacterial wilt disease, encodes a conserved LOV (light-oxygen-voltage) protein that mediates photoreception across the tree of life. However, Rps had a minimal LOV-dependent transcriptional response to light in culture. Clues from functional domains, the lov genomic neighborhood, and transcriptional analyses suggest that LOV shapes Rps biology in response to stress. Loss of LOV did not affect Rps biofilm or motility in vitro, but did influence expression of genes encoding for these phenotypes in planta. The{Delta} lov mutant had reduced heat tolerance and broad metabolic dysregulation, leading to growth defects on several carbon sources but a growth advantage in ex vivo tomato xylem sap and in high-iron medium. In vitro, the{Delta} lov mutant was more tolerant than wild type of redox stress and the antimicrobial phenolic caffeate, but Rps required lov for full virulence on tomato. LOV mediated attachment to the root surface, stem colonization, and overall symptom development. Together these findings reveal that LOV, which is highly conserved among plant pathogenic Ralstonia, modulates Rps stress response and virulence independently of light cues, but in a plant-dependent fashion.

ImportanceLike other plant-associated microbes, the destructive crop pathogen Ralstonia pseudosolanacearum (Rps) must integrate a complex array of biotic and abiotic signals to successfully infect and colonize the roots and xylem vessels of its plant hosts. Rps encodes a large LOV domain protein. LOV proteins sense blue light in leaf colonizing microbes, but Rps inhabits soil, plant roots, and xylem where there is little blue light. Although deleting lov had only minor effects when the bacterium grew in culture, many genes were dysregulated when the{Delta} lov mutant infected tomato plants. Functional experiments showed LOV has diverse light-independent roles in Rps, including modulating environmental stress tolerance and cellular iron and redox status. Most importantly, Rps needs LOV to grow normally in plants and cause bacterial wilt disease. Thus, LOV is a key sensor-regulator that controls Rps adaptation to the plant environment and virulence."
"CRISPR-Cas systems confer prokaryotic adaptive immunity by integrating foreign DNA (prespacers) into host arrays. Type II-A systems employ Cas9 for protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) recognition and coordinate with Csn2 and the Cas1-Cas2 integrase during spacer acquisition, yet their structural basis remains unresolved. Here, we report cryo-EM structures of the Enterococcus faecalis Cas9-Csn2-Cas1-Cas2 supercomplex in apo and DNA-bound states. The apo-state structure (Cas92-Csn28-Cas18-Cas24) adopts a resting conformation, with Cas9 locked in a nuclease-inactive state and Cas1-Cas2 sterically blocked from prespacer loading. Upon DNA engagement, Cas9 undergoes a conformational transition, forming a prespacer catching complex that threads the DNA through Csn2s central channel. This architecture enables Cas9 to interrogate the PAM sequence while sliding along the DNA, with Cas9 and Csn2 jointly define a 30-bp DNA segment which matches the prespacer length. Subsequent dissociation of Cas9 triggers a structural reconfiguration of the Csn2-Cas1-Cas2 assembly. The PAM-proximal DNA becomes accessible, and Cas1-Cas2 relocates to bind to the exposed DNA, enabling further prespacer processing and directional integration. These findings reveal how Cas9 collaborates with Csn2 and Cas1-Cas2 to couple PAM recognition with prespacer selection, resolving the dynamic structural transitions that ensure fidelity during type II-A CRISPR adaptation."
"Epigenetic landscapes were proposed by Waddington as the central concept to describe cell fate dynamics in a locally low-dimensional space. In modern landscape models, attractors represent cell types, and stochastic jumps and bifurcations drive cellular decisions, allowing for quantitative and predictive descriptions. However, given a biological problem of interest, we still lack tools to infer and build possible Waddington landscapes systematically. In this study, we propose a generative model for deriving epigenetic landscapes compatible with data. To build the landscapes, we combine gradient and rotational vector fields composed of locally weighted elements that encode  valleys of the Waddington landscape, resulting in interpretable models. We optimize landscapes through computational evolution and illustrate our approach with two developmental examples: metazoan segmentation and neuromesoderm differentiation. In both cases, we obtain ensembles of solutions that reveal both known and novel landscapes in terms of topology and bifurcations. Conversely, topographic features appear strongly constrained by dynamical data, which suggests that our approach can generically derive interpretable and predictive epigenetic landscapes."
"Most adaptive traits have a polygenic basis, and their evolution in response to environmental change results from the cumulative effect of many underlying loci. Theoretical studies predict two phases of phenotypic evolution: an initial directional phase, characterized by shifts in the mean of the trait towards a new optimum; and a subsequent stabilizing phase, in which the mean phenotype remains in equilibrium. However, there is limited empirical evidence to confirm these predictions. We exposed six replicate populations of Drosophila simulans, each with 100,000 individuals, to a new high-protein diet for 31 generations. Using time-series, high-order and molecular phenotypes, we characterized the phases of polygenic adaptation and inferred the transition between the directional and stabilizing selection phases empirically. The initial (directional) phase was characterized by a rapid phenotypic response, followed by a plateau after seven generations of adaptation, suggesting proximity to the new trait optimum (i.e. the stabilizing phase). The phenotypic responses were highly parallel among the replicate populations throughout the experiment. The contribution of pleiotropic loci to adaptive phenotypic evolution varied across the different phases of adaptation. Adaptation was facilitated by genes with low-to-intermediate pleiotropy whereas highly pleiotropic genes played a significant role in the rapid phase of adaptation. Parallel evolutionary responses across the replicate populations were also driven by genes with low-to-intermediate pleiotropy. Our findings support the predictions of theoretical models and is the first empirical inference of directional and stabilizing phases."
"3-prime end sequencing (3-seq) is a high-throughput sequencing technique that is used to specifically quantify the changes in 3-end formation of transcripts in bacterial cells, which is increasingly being utilized to address fundamental questions regarding transcription termination and pausing across a range of different bacterial species. However, the growing number of 3-seq studies is accompanied by an increase in study-specific 3-seq data analysis approaches. Thus, differences in a number of factors including: experimental design, data collection approaches, analysis methodologies, and interpretation decisions, make it challenging to confidently compare results derived from different studies, even those that were performed on the same organism. To assess the potential severity of these discrepancies, we used PIPETS, a statistically robust and genome-annotation agnostic 3-seq analysis package, to study Escherichia coli 3-seq data sets from three different groups collected under similar conditions. By using a consistent analysis and results interpretation approach, we identified large disparities in the characteristics of the raw 3-seq data between each of the studies, despite all three studies using the same strain and very similar reported experimental conditions. Additionally, we found strand-specific inconsistencies, with some data sets having reference strand 3-seq read coverage distributions that differed greatly from the complement strand within the same replicate. Finally, when the 3-seq distribution profiles of the three E. coli studies are compared to studies from four additional bacteria, we identified 3-seq results clustering patterns that are not explained by phylogenetic similarity between organisms. With the large differences seen between data sets from the same organism as well as the inconsistencies seen between replicates from the same data sets, we urge the field to reconsider the assumptions around 3-seq data homogeneity and move towards consistent analysis approaches, and cautious interpretation of the data.

"Striated muscles--including cardiac and skeletal muscle--share key structural features but are governed by distinct regulatory mechanisms that maintain their function and integrity. Here, we identify the previously uncharacterized Lrrc14b gene as a striated muscle-specific gene with enriched expression in cardiac and skeletal myocytes. Germline Lrrc14b deletion in mice led to progressive left ventricular dilation and systolic dysfunction in both sexes, consistent with features of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Notably, AAV-mediated re-expression of Lrrc14b in knockout mice restored cardiac function. In contrast, Lrrc14b deletion in skeletal muscle resulted in increased muscle mass, myofiber cross-sectional area and hindlimb force, whereas skeletal-muscle-specific overexpression induced muscle atrophy and functional decline independent from aging. These findings establish LRRC14B as a tissue-specific regulator of striated muscle function and underscore its potential relevance in cardiovascular and musculoskeletal diseases."
"Yellow fever (YF) is an infectious disease caused by the yellow fever virus (YFV), an arbovirus of the Flaviviridae family. It is transmitted through the bite of infected mosquitoes belonging to the Culicidae family and affects both humans and non-human primates (NHPs).

This study aimed to investigate the sylvatic Culicidae fauna and the occurrence of natural YFV infection in a microregion of southern Santa Catarina, Brazil, an area recently affected by a sylvatic YF outbreak. Entomological collections were carried out between January and February 2023 in five municipalities with confirmed viral circulation.

Natural YFV infection was assessed using RT-LAMP. A total of 4,352 female culicids were collected, representing at least 32 species, including several key sylvatic YFV vectors. Haemagogus leucocelaenus was identified in all sampled municipalities, whereas Haemagogus janthinomys, the primary vector of sylvatic YFV in Brazil, was not detected.

Mosquitoes from the genera Aedes, Haemagogus, Psorophora, and Sabethes were tested for YFV. Only one pool, composed of Sabethes albiprivus, tested positive, yielding a minimum infection rate (MIR) of 11.6. This is the first record of natural YFV infection in Sa. albiprivus in southern Brazil, and only the third reported case globally, highlighting its potential role as a secondary vector in maintaining viral circulation in sylvatic environments.

Based on species presence and abundance, Hg. leucocelaenus is likely to have acted as the primary YFV vector in the study area. The composition of the culicid fauna, coupled with the detection of YFV in sylvatic vectors, indicates an ongoing epidemiological risk. These findings underscore the need to strengthen entomological surveillance and expand YF vaccination coverage in affected and neighbouring regions.

Author SummaryThis study investigated sylvatic mosquito populations in a region of southern Santa Catarina, Brazil, recently affected by a yellow fever outbreak. Yellow fever is a serious mosquito-borne disease that can affect both humans and non-human primates. Nearly 4,400 mosquitoes from various species were collected, and, for the first time in southern Brazil, natural infection with yellow fever virus (YFV) was detected in Sabethes albiprivus. This finding suggests that Sa. albiprivus may play a previously unrecognized role in maintaining YFV in the environment.

The known vector Haemagogus leucocelaenus was found in all sampled locations, indicating it may have been the primary vector responsible for virus transmission in the region. These results enhance our understanding of YFVs natural transmission cycles and provide new insights into how the virus persists in sylvatic environments.

This research contributes to the fields of biology, ecology, and public health by reinforcing the importance of ongoing entomological surveillance and preventive vaccination, both of which are essential for preventing future outbreaks and protecting vulnerable populations."
"Interactions between microbes and their mobile genetic elements (MGEs), including viruses and plasmids, are critical drivers of microbiome structures and processes. CRISPR-Cas systems are known to be important regulators of these host-MGE interactions, but a global understanding of CRISPR-Cas diversity, activity, and roles across Earths biomes is still lacking. Here, we use an optimized computational approach to search short-read data and collect [~]800 million CRISPR spacers across [~]450,000 public metagenomes. Comparing spacers across samples and taxa revealed a high population diversity for CRISPR loci overall, with typically only a small subset of spacers detected as prevalent and conserved within a microbial population. From this extensive CRISPR spacer dataset, we identified 1.18 billion hits between 41 million spacers and 2.5 million viruses and plasmids. Prevalent and conserved spacers were over-represented in these MGE-matching spacers, and CRISPR spacers frequently matched multiple MGEs, consistent with a positive selection pressure associated with MGE targeting. Focusing on the role of CRISPR as anti-phage defense, we observed surprising cases of viruses targeted by microbes not expected to be viable hosts. These were more frequent for viruses encoding a diversification mechanism (DGR) for their host attachment proteins, and associated with a reduced rate of escape mutations. This suggests that broad spacer targeting may derive from the recurring entry of a virus genome into a non-host microbial cell, leading to some viruses being targeted by taxonomically diverse microbes well outside of their actual host range. Taken together, this petabase-scale exploration of CRISPR arrays in nature outlines the extensive diversity of CRISPR array loci across microbiomes. It highlights several key genomic and ecological parameters driving the activity of CRISPR arrays that are likely influencing strain-level diversification and selection processes within microbial populations."
"The cellular proteome represents a mixture of older and newer copies of each protein type and turnover of this mixture occurs by cycles of protein synthesis and degradation. There is considerable research on new protein synthesis, the nature of nascent proteins and cellular machinery of protein degradation. However, we have limited insights into older proteins or the protein aging process in plants at scale. In this study we use pulse chase biorthogonal non-canonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT) in Arabidopsis cells coupled to affinity purification to capture and analyse snapshots of the cellular proteome as it ages over a two-week period. Each snapshot was subjected to peptide mass spectrometry-based identification, quantitation and characterisation. We show that there are a broad range of lifespans among the 1688 proteins studied and that their subcellular location correlates strongly with protein longevity. Mitochondria, plastids and the extracellular environment contained the longest lived sub-proteomes while the vesicular pathway to ER, PM and peroxisomes contained the shortest-lived protein sets. Abundant primary metabolic enzymes have considerable longevity, while kinases and ubiquitination machinery do not. Through analysis of the aging profiles, we demonstrate that many proteins selectively accumulate posttranslational modifications (PTMs) as they age and that these are mostly oxidative in nature. We show by analysis of exemplar proteins that distinct PTM profiles and proportional changes with age exist between proteins, likely dictated by differences in subcellular environment and protein function. Implications of these insights for understanding cellular function and for biotechnological modification of the plant proteome are discussed."
"Allostery, the transmission of locally induced conformational changes to distant functional sites, is a key mechanism for protein regulation. Artificial allosteric effectors enable remote manipulation of cell function; their engineering, however, is hampered by our limited understanding of allosteric residue networks. Here, we introduce a phage-assisted evolution platform for in vivo optimization of allosteric proteins. It applies opposing selection pressures to enhance activity and switchability of phage-encoded effectors and leverages retron-based recombineering to broadly explore fitness landscapes, covering point mutations, insertions and deletions. Applying our pipeline to the transcription factor AraC yielded optogenetic variants with light-controlled activity spanning [~]1000-fold dynamic range. Long-read sequencing across selection cycles revealed adaptive trajectories and corresponding allosteric interactions. Our work facilitates phage-assisted evolution of allosteric proteins for programmable cellular control."
"1Behavioral responses to threats -- such as fleeing, freezing, or fighting -- can be either innate or shaped by learning and context. Here, we investigated whether mice exhibit fear of predators across four experimental contexts: one in a novel head-fixed condition and three in established, freely moving scenarios. In head-fixed mice, we measured the behavioral outcome and response to a live rat. Mice were water-deprived and habituated to walk on a treadmill that controlled a virtual environment and reward delivery. After meeting performance criteria, baseline data were collected in one session, followed by a test session in which the mice were exposed to a live rat. Despite the presence of the predator, most (5 out of 7) mice continued to forage at baseline levels; however, individual mice showed significant alterations in one or more of the following measures: running speed, pupil size, eye movement, and posture. To assess how behavioral context and physical restraint influence predator responses, we exposed 36 naive, freely moving mice to fear-inducing stimuli -- including looming visual cues, rat odor, and a live rat. Even in these conditions, a substantial proportion of mice failed to exhibit classical defensive responses such as avoidance or escape. Notably, when presented with a freely moving rat, only about half of the mice displayed avoidance behavior. Together, these findings suggest that mice do not universally express innate fear behaviors such as avoidance or fleeing, even in ethologically relevant predator encounters. Instead, their responses appear to be context-dependent and variable, challenging common assumptions about automatic defensive reactions in rodents."
"Brain functions involve processing in local networks as well as modulation from brainwide signals, such as arousal. Dissecting the contributions of populations of neurons to these functions requires knowledge of interactions between brain areas. We investigated these interactions using dual hemisphere recordings of prefrontal cortex in monkeys performing a spatial memory task. To tease apart global processing from local interactions, we applied a novel statistical approach called pCCA-FA (a combination of probabilistic canonical correlation analysis and factor analysis) to analyze trial-to-trial variability in neuronal responses. We found substantial shared variability among neurons within each population, much of which was actually shared across populations and linked to an arousal process. Our work presents a path by which we can leverage multi-area recordings to reveal aspects of brain functions that are hidden in single-area recordings."
"Individuals on the autism spectrum often exhibit atypical responses to sensory stimuli and difficulties with behavioral regulation, reflecting altered functional patterns in core sensory-motor circuits. These sensory processing differences suggest the potential for using patterned auditory stimulation to modulate neural activity and mitigate symptoms. While impairments in higher cognitive functions are a hallmark of autism, they remain underexplored in rodent models compared to basic sensory-motor deficits. In this study, we investigated higher cognitive function in the valproic acid (VPA) rodent model of autism and evaluated whether auditory entrainment could ameliorate associated impairments. Pregnant dams received an intraperitoneal injection of VPA on embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5), and offspring were subsequently tested on a delayed non-match to place (DNMP) task to assess working memory. Following 40Hz sensory entrainment, VPA-exposed animals showed significantly impaired performance and altered trial-by-trial learning dynamics, indicating deficits in working memory-based decision making. More importantly, auditory stimulation led to increased gamma-frequency oscillations and enhanced power in other bands (theta, beta) across brain regions, as assessed by LFP recordings in freely moving animals. These neural effects were sustained even after stimulation ended, indicating robust and lasting modulation of brain dynamics.

This provides strong evidence for the therapeutic potential of sensory entrainment in reversing autism-related cognitive deficits."
"Australia is an island nation and is free from many of the pests and disease found in other parts of the world. Therefore, Australia developed a national response mechanism to respond to detections of exotic pests. This mechanism includes early detection surveillance and identification services. Tomato red spider mite, Tetranychus evansi Baker & Pritchard is a serious pest of solanaceous plants (including tomato, potato and eggplant) in many parts of the world. T. evansi was first detected in Australia in August 2013 at Sydney, New South Wales. As part of a response to an exotic incursion, a delimiting survey was initiated. Other Tetranychus species exist in Australia and identification techniques were required to identify different species. Submitted survey samples were identified to species level using morphological keys and molecular sequence analysis of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) gene. Surveillance results of Solanaceae host plants at the time determined it was not technically feasible to eradicate this emergency plant pest (EPP). Additional to blackberry nightshade (Solanum nigrum L.), tomato, potato and sweetcorn, T. evansi was found damaging native kangaroo apple, Solanum aviculare G. Forst., (a new host plant record) and naturalised capeweed, Arctotheca calendula (L.) Levyns (Asteraceae). COI sequence analyses confirmed the morphological identifications of three different Tetranychus species (including T. lambi Pritchard & Baker and T. ludeni Zacher) among samples and further identified all twelve T. evansi specimens to a single mitochondrial haplotype (clade1; H4) previously reported from climatically diverse locations in Africa, East Asia and the Mediterranean region. Currently, T. evansi is considered to be an established plant pest in NSW, so far extensively recorded in the Sydney Basin. Based on the lack of COI sequence variation diversity among the Australian specimens of T. evansi, we suggest that this species was likely introduced from a single genetically depauperate source population. This genetic lineage of T. evansi established now in Australia was previously reported as invasive in semi-arid and cold regions outside of the species preferred distribution, and laboratory trials have indicated its propensity for increased tolerance of cold climate habitats. This has implications concerning potential for further spread of this lineage of T. evansi to a broader range of habitats and plant hosts in Australia."
"Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a zoonotic disease of global concern, driven by environmental conditions, vector activity, and livestock mobility. Although RVF has been reported in The Gambia, its epidemiology remains poorly understood. This study developed a compartmental model to study RVF dynamics in the cattle population of the country. The model incorporated seasonally dynamic transmission parameters reflecting transhumant movement and ecological differences between two distinct ecoclimatic regions: the Sahelian area and the Gambia river. Parameterised using serological data linked to household survey data, the model predicted endemic RVF virus (RVFV) circulation within The Gambia, and captured temporal infection trends that closely match empirical data. Weak decay rates of seropositivity were required to match predicted and observed age-seroprevalence. Results indicated sustained RVFV transmission during the dry season in the Gambia river eco-region, with a high risk of seasonal virus introductions to the Sahelian eco-region at the start of the wet season via the returning transhumant cattle. A hypothetical transhumant movement ban reduced the frequency of outbreaks in the Sahelian eco-region but disproportionately increased their magnitude, with no long-term reduction in the number of infectious cattle. Our study highlighted the role of livestock mobility in RVFV epidemiology in The Gambia and the need for targeted control strategies that do not involve bans on transhumance movements. These control measures might include, for example, targeted cattle vaccination or application of topical insecticide treatments."
"This study investigates the impact of different attachment shapes and configurations on the displacement, stress, and strain profiles of maxillary first molar during clear aligner-based orthodontic treatment. A subject-specific 3D maxillary model was developed from CBCT imaging, incorporating cortical and trabecular bone, periodontal ligament (PDL), teeth, attachments, and aligner geometry. Five attachment shapes square, rectangle, trapezoid, ellipse, and semicircle were analyzed in single and dual (buccal-lingual) configurations across four clinically relevant movements: mesialization, intrusion, extrusion, and rotation. Finite-element simulation results indicated that flat-shaped attachments (rectangular and trapezoidal) generated the greatest crown displacement but induced higher PDL strain (up to 0.390 mm/mm) and localized bone stress (7.11 MPa), particularly at the root apex and alveolar crest. Curved attachments provided more diffused load distribution but significantly reduced movement efficiency. Dual attachments improved root engagement and bodily displacement in all movement types, mitigating undesired tipping and enhancing force symmetry, albeit with elevated strain. Rotational control was most influenced by attachment geometry, with flat designs producing greater angular movement. Overall, attachment shape and placement exert a substantial influence on orthodontic biomechanics during aligner therapy. The findings underscore the need for evidence-based attachment protocols tailored to specific movement goals and patient risk profiles. These insights can guide clinicians toward optimizing clear aligner treatments for improved movement precision, minimized biological risk, and enhanced treatment outcomes in complex orthodontic cases."
"Pancreatic cancer is highly aggressive and lethal malignancies worldwide. {beta}-catenin, LEF-1, MMP7 and SFRP5 are key regulatory proteins in the Wnt signaling pathway. It has been confirmed that Wnt signaling pathway is involved in the biological regulation of pancreatic cancer cells and plays an important role. However, its effect on the malignant phenotypes of pancreatic cancer cell and the corresponding molecular details remains unknown. In the current study, the expression of {beta}-catenin, LEF-1 and MMP7 was up-regulated and the expression of SFRP5 was down-regulated in pancreatic cancer cell lines and tissues by RNA sequencing, quantitative PCR (qPCR) and immunohistochemical analysis. {beta}-catenin, LEF-1 and MMP7 positive expression correlates with poor prognosis in PDAC patients, and SFRP5 positive expression correlates with longer survival times. Subsequently r software was used to establish a rosette model to predict the prognosis of pancreatic cancer according to the results of multi-factor analysis. After statistical analysis, age, CA-199, {beta}-catenin, MMP7 and SFRP5 could serve as promising biomarkers for predicting prognosis in PDAC patients. This study also suggests that survival probability of patients can be reliably predicted by a nomogram-based method."
"Instructor use of humor can positively affect students educational experiences by increasing students comfort in the classroom and making the instructor seem more approachable. Humor can also elicit emotional responses, which in turn may influence students engagement in the course and their relationship with the instructor. However, students may interpret instructor humor differently, resulting in varied effects. The present study examined how instructors use of humor relates to students emotions about their lab course. In addition, we examined whether researcher-identified humor aligned with student reports to support valid inferences about instructor humor. To accomplish this, trained researchers analyzed classroom audio recordings of instructor talk in 48 lab courses to identify instances of instructor humor. We also surveyed their undergraduate students (n = 462) about their instructors humor and pleasant and unpleasant emotions about their lab course. Our results revealed that trained researchers coding of instructor humor was poorly predictive of students emotions about their laboratory courses. In contrast, students who perceived their instructor to be humorous reported greater pleasant emotions and fewer unpleasant emotions. Our results suggest that instructor humor from students perspective may be influential in how they experience instruction. In addition, student perceptions of instructor humor may be a more useful indicator than researcher observations for studying instructor humor."
"Lewy body dementia (LBD), which encompasses Parkinsons disease dementia (PDD) and Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), currently lacks established biofluid markers reflective of its complex molecular pathophysiology. Multiplex proteomic tools, such as the recently released NUcleic acid Linked ImmunoSandwich Assay (NULISATM), can simultaneously assess a diverse array of neurodegenerative targets and address this critical biomarker gap. We used the NULISA CNS disease panel to analyze 852 baseline and longitudinal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from control, PD without cognitive impairment (PD-NCI), PD with cognitive impairment (PD-CI), DLB, and Alzheimers disease (AD) subjects. A subset of control and DLB cases also had alpha-synuclein seed amplification assay (Syn-SAA) results. Of the 124 panel markers analyzed, nearly half (n=53) were significantly altered in PD-CI and/or DLB compared to controls. Of these LBD-associated targets, 12 demonstrated divergent abundance trends in AD. Alpha-synuclein (SNCA) as measured by NULISA did not change across clinical LBD diagnoses but was among proteins significantly altered in subgroup comparisons of SAA+ and SAA-cases. Longitudinal analysis revealed five proteins (NEFL, NRGN, CCL26, CRH, PGF) with baseline changes indicative of subsequent cognitive progression. Machine learning identified a series of panels, each comprising only 10 markers, capable of discriminating clinical diagnoses and SAA positivity with high accuracy (AUC > 0.89). Overall, our results highlight the utility of NULISA multiplex proteomic analysis in the identification of diagnostic and prognostic CSF biomarkers of LBD that reflect its diverse molecular pathophysiology.

One Sentence SummaryThis multiplex proteomic analysis using the recently released NULISA platform revealed unique targets of Lewy body dementia pathology and progression."
"Missing data remain a ubiquitous and critical challenge in large-scale clinical studies. Despite advances in imputation, most existing methods fail to address structured missingness, where data are missing according a deterministic pattern and which arise due to systematic patterns introduced by experimental design, site protocols, or cohort differences. These patterns violate key assumptions of most imputation algorithms, yet their impact is rarely evaluated.

We demonstrate that structured missingness is a fundamental challenge to drawing valid inferences from standard imputation techniques. First, we present a comprehensive framework for understanding and accommodating the effects of structured missingness. Next, we show through simulations and real-world psychometric data with structured missingness, that widely used algorithms optimised for numerical precision (e.g., Extra Trees, AutoComplete) underperform due to site effects, while donor-based methods (e.g., MICE, hierarchical MICE) better preserve multivariate structure. We propose a novel hierarchical approach that provides optimal performance in simulated and experimental data. Finally, we show that commonly used accuracy metrics, such as mean squared error can obscure these failures, and are therefore inadequate for the evaluation of structured missingness. In contrast, other divergence-based metrics offer a more sensitive and interpretable alternative. We apply this approach to harmonising psychometric data across cohorts, which provides excellent item-level alignment across different instruments.

Our study highlights the need for a paradigm shift in handling missing data within biomedical research, moving beyond conventional imputation frameworks to develop tools that can account for structured missingness. This shift is essential for ensuring reliable inference in multi-site clinical studies, precision medicine, and large-scale population analyses."

"Pathogenic mutations in Tetratricopeptide repeat domain 7A (TTC7A) result in gastrointestinal and immunological disorders of which the pathobiology is not fully understood. Previous case reports indicate that TTC7A plays an important role in preserving intestinal epithelial integrity, but thus far only few variants have been investigated and it is unclear if different variants exert the same effects. Here, we aim to study the effects of different variants on the intestinal epithelium. We present three instances of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), displaying varying clinical symptoms and severity levels, and associated with different heterozygous missense mutations in TTC7A. Intestinal organoids derived from patients show dissimilar epithelial phenotypes and exhibit differences in growth, morphology, apicobasal polarity, responses to specific drugs, TTC7A expression, and transcriptional profiles. The findings of our study suggest differences in pathobiology between individuals with different TTC7A mutations. This investigation enhances our comprehension of TTC7A-related conditions and can have implications for developing targeted therapies for TTC7A-associated disorders."

"In Drosophila melanogaster females, as in most organisms, the segregation of meiotic chromosomes depends on the proper distribution of crossovers along paired maternal and paternal chromosomes. In most cases, crossovers require the synaptonemal complex (SC), a conserved multi-protein structure that forms between homologous chromosomes in meiotic prophase I. Recent studies leveraging hypomorphic alleles suggest that the SC plays a more direct role in the distribution of crossover events. However, identifying additional hypomorphic mutations that avoid catastrophic phenotypes by partially disrupting the SC has been challenging. Here, to create a new hypomorphic allele of the D. melanogaster SC gene corolla, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to replace it with the coding sequence of its Drosophila mauritiana ortholog, yielding corollamau. Since the amino acid sequence of SC proteins is rapidly diverging while maintaining the general tripartite structure of the SC, we hypothesized that this replacement would enable the assembly of the SC but show defects in crossover distribution. Indeed, at 25 {degrees}C corollamau homozygous females exhibited full-length SC with defects in SC maintenance and crossover formation, resulting in moderate levels of chromosome missegregation. At 18 {degrees}C, SC maintenance was rescued, and recombination rates were improved, although they remained significantly lower than observed in wild type. Importantly, these phenotypes are less severe than observed in corolla null mutant flies, suggesting corollamau is a hypomorphic allele. Unexpectedly, in homozygotes we also observed unique polycomplexes composed of the SC proteins Corolla and Corona but lacking the transverse filament protein C(3)G. Overall, we report a novel hypomorphic allele of corolla that will enable future studies on the role of the SC in crossover distribution. Further, the unique polycomplexes found in mutant flies may provide new insights into SC protein-protein interactions and SC architecture.

Author SummaryIn many species, the success of sexual reproduction relies on a protein structure called the synaptonemal complex (SC). The SC forms between the maternal and paternal copies of chromosomes and functions to ensure crossing over. Most prior studies have used SC mutants that have grave defects, preventing the study of nuances in SC function. Here, we replace one of the SC genes in Drosophila melanogaster with the ortholog of a close relative, creating a new allele that displays a partial loss-of-function phenotype. At the standard rearing temperature, flies homozygous for this allele exhibit SC maintenance defects, a reduced number of crossover events, and aberrant chromosome segregation. In flies reared at a lower temperature, SC maintenance is rescued but the defects in recombination and chromosome segregation persist. We also found a unique SC protein aggregate in these flies. Altogether, this new mutant reflects a novel approach to study the structure and function of the SC."
"Alzheimers disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder defined by amyloid beta (A{beta}) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), yet approximately 20-30% of aged individuals exhibit these hallmark lesions without developing cognitive impairment--a clinically silent condition termed asymptomatic AD (AsymAD). The molecular basis of this cognitive resilience remains poorly understood due to a lack of mechanistic models. Here, we integrate systems-level Boolean network modeling with in vivo validation to define the transcriptomic logic of AsymAD and uncover a novel preclinical model. Using Boolean implication networks trained on large-scale human cortical RNA-seq datasets, we identified a robust and invariant AD gene signature that accurately stratifies disease states across independent datasets. Application of this signature to Chromogranin A- deficient PS19 mice (CgA-KO/PS19) revealed a unique resilience phenotype: male mice developed AD-like molecular and neuropathological profiles in the pre-frontal cortex yet retained intact learning and memory. Female CgA-KO/PS19 mice displayed even greater protection, including reduced Tau phosphorylation and preserved synaptic ultrastructure. These findings establish the first validated murine model of AsymAD and identify CgA as a modifiable node linking neuroendocrine signaling, Tauopathy, and cognitive preservation. This work provides a scalable platform to probe sex-specific resilience, uncover early-stage biomarkers, and accelerate preventive therapeutic development in AD."
"DNA N6-methyladenine (6mA) has recently been rediscovered as an epigenetic mark in eukaryotes. Several demethylases responsible for 6mA removal have been identified in multicellular eukaryotes. However, despite the much higher abundance of 6mA in unicellular species, no such enzymes have been reported and the biological significance of 6mA removal in these organisms remain unclear. Here, we identify and functionally characterize DMT3 as a dedicated 6mA demethylase in unicellular eukaryotes. DMT3 targets both fully and hemi-methylated ApT dinucleotides on DNA. It is predominantly localized at transcription start sites (TSS), where it antagonizes the activity of the 6mA methyltransferase AMT1. Deletion or catalytic inactivation of DMT3 leads to genome-wide ectopic 6mA deposition specifically at TSS regions, driven by AMT1, and is accompanied by increased chromatin accessibility and elevated enrichment of transcription-associated histone marks. These epigenetic alterations disrupt gene expression, reduce osmotic stress resistance, and impair the initiation of sexual reproduction. Together, our findings uncover a critical 6mA demethylase in unicellular eukaryotes, and highlight the essential role of active 6mA removal in maintaining transcriptional and developmental integrity."
"Emerging zoonotic viruses pose a significant threat to global health. The order Nidovirales includes diverse viruses, such as coronaviruses, which are well known for their zoonotic potential. Toroviruses are a less-studied genus within Nidovirales primarily associated with gastrointestinal diseases in ungulates, although some evidence suggests their presence in humans. In this study, we report the discovery of a novel torovirus from a fecal sample of a dormouse (Eliomys quercinus) in Spain, which we named Dormouse torovirus (DToV). This represents the first complete genome of a rodent-associated torovirus. The 28,555-nucleotide genome encodes the six characteristic torovirus open reading frames, but these exhibit low amino acid sequence identity (44.3-86.3%) compared to other toroviruses, indicating that DToV likely represents a new viral species. Bayesian analysis of the ORF1b suggests that DToV diverged from known toroviruses approximately 1300 years ago. Moreover, the basal phylogenetic position of DToV suggests that rodents may represent a reservoir for this viral genus. Our findings expand the known torovirus host range, underscore their potential for cross-species transmission, and highlight the importance of continued surveillance of wildlife viruses.

ImportanceCurrently, there is concern about the potential emergence of new viruses from natural reservoirs. This has led to an increasing search taking advantage of new massive sequencing methodologies. In our study, we have identified a complete genome of a torovirus in a rodent species in Spain. Toroviruses are a group related to coronaviruses and cause gastrointestinal diseases in ungulates, such as cows or pigs. However, they have not been studied in depth, as there is no clear evidence of their ability to infect humans. Our results suggest that rodents may be the natural reservoir of toroviruses and underline their potential for cross-species transmission. Based on the results obtained from monitoring wildlife for viruses with zoonotic potential, the next step will be to implement new approaches in the laboratory to characterise the ability of these viruses to infect humans."
"Despite advances in immunotherapy treatment, nonresponse rates remain high, and mechanisms of resistance to checkpoint inhibition remain unclear. To address this gap, we performed spatial transcriptomic and proteomic profiling on human hepatocellular carcinoma tissues collected before and after immunotherapy. We developed an interpretable, multimodal deep learning framework to extract key cellular and molecular signatures from these data. Our graph neural network approach based on spatial proteomic inputs achieved outstanding performance (ROC-AUC > 0.9) in predicting patient treatment response. Key predictive features and associated spatial transcriptomic profiles revealed the multi-omic landscape of immunotherapy response and resistance. One such feature was an interface niche expressing restrictive extracellular matrix factors that physically separates tumor tissue and lymphoid aggregates in nonresponders. We integrate this and other spatially-resolved signatures into SPARC, a multi-omic ""fingerprint"" comprising scores for immunotherapy response and resistance mechanisms. This study lays groundwork for future patient stratification and treatment strategies in cancer immunotherapy."
"BackgroundThe clinical manifestations of cerebrovascular disease are known to differ between the Chinese and United States (U.S.) populations as do the plaque features on imaging.

ObjectivesThe aim of this study was to investigate and compare the histological features of excised carotid plaques from Chinese and U.S. patients.

MethodsCarotid endarterectomy specimens collected from two prospective studies were included. The entire plaque was serially sectioned (10 {micro}m thickness) at 0.5-1 mm intervals. Hematoxylin and eosin staining and Mallorys trichrome staining were performed. The morphology and components of the plaques were measured and compared between the two groups.

ResultsA total of 1,152 histological sections from 75 Chinese patients and 1,843 sections from 111 U.S. patients were analyzed. The Chinese group had significantly smaller minimum lumen diameters (median: 1.1 vs. 1.3 mm, p=0.046) and a larger percent wall volume (median: 74% vs. 70%, p=0.018) than the U.S. group. After adjusting for confounding factors, carotid plaques in the Chinese population were more likely to have more lipid pools ({beta}=10.0%, 95%CI: 4.9 to 15.9%), more recent intraplaque hemorrhage (IPH; {beta}=8.4%, 95%CI: 4.5 to 12.7%), and less late IPH ({beta}=-8.2%, 95%CI: -11.3 to -5.4), and fewer fibrous cap disruptions (45% vs. 67%, p=0.061). Chinese plaques were more homogeneous and had a higher percentage of plaques with features of xanthomas than did U.S. plaques (20% vs 2.7%, p<0.001).

ConclusionsThe histology of Chinese plaques differs significantly from that of U.S. plaques, suggesting substantial differences in the pathophysiology of atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease between Chinese and North American populations, which could enhance the gap in racial pathology comparison, indicating a need for a different management approach.

"We applied the TempO-LINC(R) platform to generate single-cell transcriptomic (SCTr) profiles of [~]40,000 HepaRG cells exposed to etoposide, brefeldin A, cycloheximide, rotenone, tBHQ, troglitazone, and tunicamycin at three concentrations for 24 hours. SCTr enabled a detailed analysis of adaptive stress response pathways (SRPs), including the unfolded protein response (UPR), oxidative stress response (OSR), heat shock response (HSR), and DNA damage response (DDR). Troglitazone upregulated lipid metabolism genes (PLIN2, ACOX1) along with HSR and UPR activation, with co-expression of DNAJA1, HSP90AA1, and DDIT3 in subsets of cells. Brefeldin A and tunicamycin strongly induced UPR markers (HSPA5, SYVN1, LMF2, PDIA4) in subsets of cells, with some also expressing apoptotic (DDIT3, CASP8) and autophagic (SQSTM1) genes, indicating diverse stress responses. Rotenone activated GDF15, TRIB3, and DDIT3 in a fraction of cells, accompanied by PLIN2 and mild UPR induction, reflecting heterogeneous mitochondrial stress responses. We scored individual cells using literature-derived SRP gene signatures to characterize overall stress phenotypes and clustered them using a generalized Jaccard metric. The clustering revealed five phenotypic groups spanning cell states associated with homeostasis, adaptive responses, terminal outcomes, autophagy, and apoptosis. By systematically analyzing the distributions of cells in different states across treatments, we visualized dynamic shifts in cellular subpopulations responding to chemicals, revealing early stress responses and potential transitions to cell death. Our findings suggest the utility of SCTr in decoding stress states that could provide possible insights into transitions between cellular adaptive and terminal transitions involved in toxicity."
"It is crucial to accurately predict hosts of viruses to understand and anticipate human infectious diseases that originate from animals. There is a lack of versatile models that handle out-of-distribution factors such as unseen hosts and viruses. We develop a machine learning model for predicting the host infected by a virus, given only the sequence of a protein encoded by the genome of that virus. Our approach, HAVEN, is the first to apply to multiple hosts and to generalize to unseen hosts and viruses. HAVEN is a transformer-based architecture coupled with hierarchical self-attention that can accept sequences of highly diverse lengths. We integrate HAVEN with a prototype-based few-shot learning classifier to predict rare classes. We demonstrate the accuracy, robustness, and generalizability of HAVEN through a comprehensive series of experiments. In particular, we show that HAVEN can achieve a median AUPRC of 0.67 while predicting common hosts. Moreover, HAVEN retains this AUPRC value even for rare hosts (median prevalence as low as 0.09%). Our model performs on par with state-of-the-art foundation models, which are 65 to 5, 000 times larger in size, and outperforms them in identifying hosts of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern."
"Accurately characterizing human diversity is foundational to equitable genomics. In this study, we present a large-scale analysis comparing self-declared ancestry with genetically inferred ancestry in 10,250 participants from the pan-Canadian HostSeq cohort. Using the ntRoot algorithm on whole genome sequencing data, we inferred both global and local continental-level ancestry and assessed concordance with self-identified sociocultural categories. High agreement was observed among individuals self-identifying as White (concordance rate=98.8%), Black (97.2%), East Asian (96.1%), and South Asian (89.9%), while substantial discordance was found in those self-identifying as Hispanic (concordance rate=74.6%), Middle Eastern / Central Asian (67.9%) or Indigenous (40.7%). We quantified agreement using Cohens kappa ({kappa} = -0.01 unweighted; 0.35 weighted) and assessed admixture complexity with Shannon entropy, revealing a strong relationship between discordance and ancestry heterogeneity. Principal component analysis further revealed that tightly clustered genetic profiles often corresponded with lower admixture complexity, whereas broader, overlapping distributions were observed in groups with more heterogeneous ancestry and complex sociocultural histories. These findings underscore the complex interplay between sociocultural identity and genomic data, with discordance patterns reflecting the historical and cultural complexity of human populations. By quantifying this relationship systematically with ntRoot, our approach provides a framework for moving rigid categorical labels toward more nuanced genome-derived ancestry characterization that can improve both scientific rigor and representational equity in genomics.

"Regardless of the high recurrence rate, copers manage the damage after a sprain. Copers do not experience ankle instability and continue their daily activities. However, it is unclear whether copers can use movement strategies similar to people without an ankle sprain. Identifying movement strategies can improve efficacy and prevent unwanted effects during training. Therefore, we aimed to compare the kinematics and muscular activities of the lower limbs during half squats and gait between copers and healthy controls. Ten copers (7 men, 3 women; age = 21.6 {+/-} 1.1 years) and 10 controls (6 men, 4 women; age = 22.5 {+/-} 2.8 years) were included in the cross-sectional study. We compared angles of the thigh, shank, and foot calculated from inertial measurement units and muscle activities of the biceps femoris long head, rectus femoris, gastrocnemius, and tibialis anterior between copers and controls during half squats and gait. For half squats, copers demonstrated thigh restriction with an effect size of 0.67-1.35, whereas we observed no significant differences in the shank and foot angles in the descending phase. Copers demonstrated less activity with an effect size of 0.61-1.58 in all four muscles. Copers showed lower activities of the rectus femoris and tibialis anterior during the same period of thigh restriction. For gait, there were no significant differences in lower limb angles and muscle activities between copers and controls. Copers may restrict thigh rotation unintentionally, leading to less muscle activity during half squats. Removing unconscious restrictions using sensor-based quantitative feedback can enable copers to obtain more efficient training. Our results suggest that assessing the limb movements of copers is important for efficient training, even if they do not experience instability to continue with their daily activities."
"The limited controllability of CAR T cells in patients represents a key challenge of this highly potent immunotherapy. A molecular ON-switch, which can be regulated with a non-toxic and readily available small molecule drug, would represent a major advance towards controllable CAR T therapeutics. For that purpose, we engineered caffeine-responsive heterodimeric ON-switches (CaffSwitches) and demonstrate their high caffeine-dependency and virtually absent leakiness. When incorporating these CaffSwitches into CARs, the resulting CaffCARs were efficiently activated by caffeine concentrations achieved in human plasma after drinking one cup of coffee. Moreover, CaffCAR T cells also showed efficient tumor clearance in an in vivo mouse model, which was completely abolished in the absence of caffeine. This tight control was even observed with c-Jun overexpressing CaffCAR T cells, despite their massive expansion. Together, we anticipate that these novel CaffSwitches will be valuable tools for the development of safe and efficient next generation CAR T cells."
"Multiple lines of research have studied how complex brain dynamics emerge from underlying connectivity by using Ising models as simplified neural mass models. However, limitations on parameter estimation have prevented their use with individual, high-resolution human neuroimaging data. Furthermore, most studies focus only on connectivity, ignoring node heterogeneity, even though real brain regions have different structural and dynamical properties.

Here we present an improved approach to fitting Ising models to 360-region functional MRI data: derivation of an initial guess model from group data, optimization of simulation temperature, and two stages of Boltzmann learning, first with group data, then with individual data. We then analyze how data binarization threshold affects goodness-of-fit, the role of the external field in model behavior, and correlations between model parameters and features from structural MRI, including myelination and sulcus depth.

The fitted models can reproduce the functional connectivity of the data across a wide range of thresholds, but the role of the external field parameters in model behavior increases with threshold. In parallel, the coupling between nodes correlates with structural connectivity throughout this range, but correlations between the external field and structural features increase with threshold. These results show how our methodology enables personalized, biophysically interpretable modeling of structure-function relationships at the whole-brain level, which can aid understanding of individual differences in brain network organization and dynamics. This approach will help to bridge the gap between connectomics, which emphasizes brain networks, and translational neuroscience, which often focuses on the unique roles of brain regions."
"Amyloid pathology is a hallmark of Alzheimers disease (AD). Hippocampal sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) play a role in memory consolidation and are impaired in various AD mouse models. However, it remains unclear how experience affects SWRs and how extrinsic signals contribute to SWR generation in AD. Here, by combining behavioral, in vivo electrophysiological and fiber photometry approaches, we show that an experience-dependent increase in hippocampal SWRs is disrupted in male and female 5xFAD mice. In wild-type mice, SWRs during non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS) increased after exploring a novel environment and the SWR rate gradually decreased with NREMS episodes and multiple behavioral sessions. However, 5xFAD mice did not show such experience-dependent SWR rate changes. A similar deficit was observed after a novel object recognition test. On the other hand, sleep spindles were intact in 5xFAD mice under all conditions. Since deficits in basal forebrain cholinergic neurons have been implicated in 5xFAD mice and SWRs are regulated by hippocampal cholinergic tone, we examined if hippocampal cholinergic signals could explain experience-dependent SWR deficits. Using fiber photometry and expressing a genetically encoded acetylcholine (ACh) sensor in the hippocampus, we found that ACh dynamics in the hippocampus were intact in 5xFAD mice across sleep-wake cycles, including NREMS, while we also found a negative correlation of infraslow cortical signal power dynamics with hippocampal ACh signals during NREMS regardless of genotypes. These results suggest that experience-dependent SWR deficits stem from non-cholinergic pathological changes."
"Peary Land, northern-most Greenland, is a cold desert region whose soil microbiome remains underexplored. This is the first study to explore the halotolerant soil microbiome of this region with culture-dependent methods. Forty-nine taxonomically diverse bacterial isolates were obtained from dry biological soil crust, surface soil and permafrost soil. Nine isolates were selected for whole genome sequencing; these genomes showed adaptations to their cold, saline native environment, such as cold shock proteins and a large number of osmoprotectant transporters. The genomes also contained several biosynthetic gene clusters, including a large variety of clusters involved in the production of antimicrobial compounds. Furthermore, most of the sequenced genomes showed low digital DNA-DNA hybridisation to their closest relatives, suggesting that they represent novel species. Overall, this study demonstrates the unexplored potential of High Arctic deserts as a source of novel halotolerant bacteria and their secondary metabolites."
"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infects hepatocytes by specific binding to the cell-surface receptor --sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP)--through the preS1 region of its large envelop protein, followed by a less well understood transport process across the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Here, we report that scavenger receptor class F member 2 (SCARF2), a single-pass transmembrane protein, functions as an intracellular receptor for HBV. SCARF2 binds to a preS1 region downstream of the NTCP binding site through its N-terminal EGF-like domains 4-6, and its proline-rich C-terminal domain also plays an indispensable role in the infection. The internalized HBV virions are transported to the cytoplasmic side of nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) within the SCARF2-containing endosomes. HBV capsid release from the endosomal vesicles is significantly impaired by knockdown of SCARF2. These results suggest a model that SCARF2 conveys HBV to the periphery of NPCs and ultimately leads to viral capsid release for nuclear entry."
"CRISPR screening is a powerful approach to identify genetic perturbations that impact viral infection. However, most virus-focused CRISPR screens utilize selection strategies that limit the ability to identify genes important for infection. Here, we developed a novel CRISPR screening pipeline to identify cellular determinants of Human Cytomegalovirus infection based on virally induced remodeling of cellular antibody affinity (VIRCAA), which is scalable for large libraries and can identify cellular genes that impact HCMV infection at different life cycle stages. We utilized this pipeline to interrogate proteomic and transcriptomic data sets associated with the HCMV UL26 protein, which blocks anti-viral signaling during infection. We find that JUNB drives anti-viral gene expression, induces protein ISGylation, and suppresses diverse viral infections. Further, UL26 proximally interacts with JUNB and suppresses JUNBs nuclear condensation and JUNB-mediated contraction of viral DNA replication compartments. These results highlight the VIRCAA pipelines utility for identifying important determinants of viral infection."
"BackgroundThe paucibacillary nature of spinal tuberculosis (STB) makes diagnosis challenging, particularly in people living with HIV-1 (PLWH). It is suggested that HIV-1 and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) co-infection in tissues favours reciprocal replication, infection and reservoir expansion. Yet, confirmation of this detrimental synergism in diseased tissues is scant.

MethodsIn a prospective study of 25 adults (13 (52%) people living with HIV-1 (PLWH) on antiretroviral treatment (ART)) undergoing spinal biopsy investigation for STB in South Africa, droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) was used to detect and quantify Mtb complex (MTBC) DNA (rpoB and IS6110) in 93 biopsy segments, and HIV-1 DNA (pol and gag) in 41 segments from PLWH. ddPCR sensitivity for Mtb was validated against Xpert-Ultra and culture. Relationships between pathogen DNA abundance, co-detection, human cellularity, HIV status, and peripheral viral load (VL) were evaluated.

FindingsddPCR detected MTBC DNA in 19/25 (76%) patients (range: 8-59,144 rpoB copies/biopsy), with increased detection in those with confirmed STB and a history of TB. MTBC rpoB copies/million cells were higher in biopsies from PLWH (p=0.0096) and positively correlated with matched biopsy segment HIV-1 pol copies/million cells (r=0.40; p=0.0003), but not peripheral VL. HIV-1 DNA was detected in all biopsies from PLWH, four with undetectable VL. HIV-1 pol copies/million cells were higher in biopsy segments with MTBC DNA co-detected (p=0.011) and strongly correlated with VL (r=0.91; p=0.0003).

InterpretationddPCR has high sensitivity for Mtb and HIV-1 DNA quantification in STB biopsies. Mtb tissue abundance correlated with localised but not systemic HIV-1 abundance. Increased HIV-1 DNA detection at sites co-localised with Mtb supports further investigating the TB microenvironment as a site for HIV-1 reservoir persistence and expansion in PLWH on ART.

"Coronaviruses encode envelope (E), a structural component of the virion that is important for assembly and egress. E has proton channel activity that prevents premature rearrangement of the spike glycoprotein as virions encounter acidic compartments as they exit the cell. How infected cells respond to this pH disruption during coronavirus infection is unknown. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 E ion channel activity triggers the proton pump V-ATPases to recruit the ATG16L1 complex during infection. This results in ATG8 molecules such as LC3B decorating perturbed compartments. This recruitment of autophagy machinery does not inhibit viral replication, rather SARS-CoV-2 exploits this response. Inhibition of the V-ATPase/ATG16L1 interaction using the Salmonella effector SopF inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication. Careful distinction between use of the autophagic machinery from canonical macroautophagy is required in order to better understand coronavirus replication and for rational targeting of any potential host-directed therapies."
"A key event in meiosis is the conversion of a small subset of double strand breaks into interhomolog crossovers. In this study, we demonstrate that Caenorhabditis elegans male spermatogenesis has less robust mechanisms than hermaphrodite oogenesis for ensuring and limiting the conversion of double strand breaks into crossovers. This is not a consequence of differences in meiotic prophase timing, sex chromosome genotype, or the presence or absence of germline apoptosis. Using the cyclin-like crossover marker COSA-1, we show that males have a linear response in converting increasing numbers of double strand breaks into crossovers, suggesting weakened crossover homeostasis. While the topoisomerase SPO-11, responsible for initiating meiotic double strand breaks, has an extended period of activity in males as in hermaphrodites, we discovered that COSA-1 foci form at the very end of meiotic prophase in the absence of SPO-11 during spermatogenesis. These COSA-1-marked sites are also independent of homologous recombination, and Topoisomerases I and II. We find that the synaptonemal complex, which holds homologs in proximity, differently modulates COSA-1 enrichment to chromosomes in the absence of SPO-11 in males and hermaphrodites. Together, these findings suggest that males have less robust crossover control and that there are previously unrecognized lesions or structures at the end of meiotic prophase in spermatocytes that can accumulate CO markers.

Author SummaryFormation of healthy gametes depends on the accurate partitioning of genetic material in the daughter cells through meiosis. A hallmark of meiosis is the establishment of crossovers, which arise from physical exchange of DNA between the parental chromosomes during homologous recombination. Recombination is initiated via the induction of physiological DNA damage by the topoisomerase SPO-11 and its auxiliary factors. Abrogating SPO-11 activity prevents crossover formation, resulting in random chromosome segregation and generation of aneuploid gametes. While the underlying mechanisms of crossover formation are conserved between the sexes, several pieces of evidence indicate extensive sexual dimorphism. In our work we describe novel features of C. elegans spermatogenesis that reveal significant differences in the regulation of recombination compared to oogenesis. We find that in spermatogenesis crossover-promoting proteins can be recruited to chromosomes even in the absence of SPO-11 activity, a phenomenon not observed in the oogenic hermaphrodite germ line. Furthermore, removal of some auxiliary factors required for physiological break formation during oogenesis does not prevent crossover designation in spermatocytes. We show that the synaptonemal complex, tasked with keeping homologous chromosomes in proximity, exerts opposing roles in males and hermaphrodites by promoting and limiting the recruitment of SPO-11-independent crossover factors, respectively."
"K-Ras functions within nanoscale proteo-lipid domains of the plasma membrane, but few regulators of its membrane organisation are known. We combined TurboID-based proximity proteomics with a secondary BRET screen to identify eight novel K-Ras G-domain interactors. We focused on APLP2 and SPRY2 for further characterisation. APLP2 binds K-Ras indirectly via C-Raf, while SPRY2 exhibits properties of a novel effector. Co-immunoprecipitation and BRET assays revealed that the SPRY2 C-terminal fragment (residues 161-315) binds oncogenic RasG12V more strongly than the full-length protein. Both forms localise to the plasma membrane, but this localisation and binding to K-Ras is disrupted by inhibitors of K-Ras membrane anchorage or activity. Mutations at the predicted interface of K-Ras and SPRY2s C-terminal region affect the interaction. Both full-length SPRY2 and its C-terminal fragment promote differentiation of C2C12 muscle cells, a process requiring MAPK pathway inhibition. Finally, SPRY2 also forms homo- or hetero-oligomers with SPRY4. We propose that active K-Ras recruits SPRY2 dimers to the membrane, where they bind Ras and block effector access."
"In this work, we present the high-resolution structure of human aconitate decarboxylase 1 (hACOD1) in its true apo form (active site empty) as well in complex with the inhibitor citraconate. These two new structures show the architecture of the active site and the structure-activity relationships of citraconate inhibition. Careful analysis of the structures indicates probable dynamics required for substrate/inhibitor binding and catalysis. These observations were further explored using molecular dynamic simulations, which show a clear open-close mechanism of hACOD1 between the A1 and A2 loops, the lid- and helical-domain respectively. As part of the biochemical characterization of the protein, we also developed an alternative kinetic assay which measures the rate of catalysis of hACOD1 by direct observation of the conversion of cis-aconitate to itaconate by NMR spectroscopy. The work herein offers a foundation for structure- and dynamic-driven design of novel hACOD1 inhibitors as novel chemotherapeutics."
"Post-transcriptional RNA modifications are ubiquitous in biology, but the fate of epigenetic ribonucleotides after RNA turnover and the consequences of their metabolism and misincorporation into nucleic acids are largely unknown. Here we explore the metabolism of epigenetic ribonucleosides in human cells by studying effects on cell growth, quantifying misincorporation into cellular RNAs and identifying metabolic regulators, and exploring phenotypes associated with cytotoxicity. We find that bulky N6-modified adenosines (i.e. i6A) exhibit high levels of cytotoxicity and RNA misincorporation, whereas cells dramatically restrict the misincorporation of small N6-modified adenosines (i.e. m6A), partly through sanitization by enzymatic deamination. Epigenetic ribopyrimidines also exhibit cytotoxicity, mediated primarily by nucleoside kinase UCK2, but only at much higher concentrations than ribopurines. We further characterize the effects of cytotoxic ribonucleoside metabolism on nucleolar morphology and protein translation. Taken together, our work provides new insights into the metabolism of epigenetic ribonucleosides and mechanisms underlying their cytotoxicity to cells."
"Liquid biopsy, through the analysis of plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA), is transforming diagnostic medicine by enabling non-invasive insights into the genomic and epigenomic landscape of diseases--most notably cancer. As cfDNA reflects dynamic contributions from multiple tissues, it holds immense potential for early detection, disease monitoring, and personalized treatment. However, the rapid expansion of cfDNA applications has outpaced the availability of unified, versatile computational tools for the systematic analysis of cfDNA data. To address this unmet need, we present cfDNAanalyzer--a comprehensive, user-friendly toolkit that streamlines the feature extraction, selection, and construction of machine learning-based models for disease detection using cfDNA. Designed for flexibility and scalability, cfDNAanalyzer supports multimodal feature extraction, integration, and interpretable outputs, enabling both exploratory research and translational applications. By standardizing and accelerating cfDNA data analysis, cfDNAanalyzer provides a critical resource to advance precision diagnostics and deepen biological insight into disease processes."
"Antibodies are naturally evolved molecular recognition scaffolds that can bind a variety of surfaces. Their designability is crucial to the development of biologics, with computational methods holding promise in accelerating the delivery of medicines to the clinic. Modeling antibody-antigen recognition is prohibitively difficult, with data paucity being one of the biggest hurdles. Current affinity datasets comprise a small number of experimental measurements, which are often not standardized between molecules. Here, we address these issues by creating a dataset of seven antigens with two antibodies each, for which we introduce a heterogeneous set of mutations to the CDR-H3 measured by ELISA. Each of the parental complexes has a known crystal structure. We perform benchmarking of state-of-the-art affinity prediction algorithms to gauge their effectiveness. Current computational methods exhibit significant limitations in accurately predicting the effects of single-point mutations. In contrast, the older empirical, physics-based method FoldX, performs well in identifying mutants that retain binding. These findings highlight the need for more resources like the one presented here -- large, molecularly diverse, and experimentally consistent datasets."
"Reconstructing genome-scale gene regulatory networks (GRNs) remains a difficult problem in systems biology, and many experimental and computational methods have been developed to address this problem. Recent computational methods have aimed to more accurately model GRNs by estimating the hidden Transcription Factor Activity (TFA), from prior knowledge of TF target regulatory connections, encoded as an input directed graph, to relax the assumption that mRNA level of the regulator correlates with the protein activity of the regulator. However, the noise in the prior knowledge can adversely affect the estimated TFA levels and the quality of the downstream inferred GRNs. Here, we present a new approach, MERLIN+P+TFA, that uses prior knowledge-guided sparsity regularization to robustly and accurately estimate TFA and downstream GRNs. We apply our method to simulated and real expression data in yeast and mammalian systems and show improved quality of inferred GRNs for both bulk and single-cell datasets. Regularized TFA offers benefits to a variety of other GRN inference algorithms, including those that have traditionally be used with expression alone, in both bulk and scRNA-seq settings. We used the inferred GRN to prioritize key regulators for the mouse Embryonic Stem Cell (mESC) state and validate 58 regulators experimentally. We identify both known and novel regulators of the mESC state and further validate the targets of 4 known and novel regulators. Our validation experiments suggest that computationally inferred networks can capture functional targets of TFs with higher precision than estimated in current benchmarks, however, it is important to generate context-specific gold standards."
"Sensitization of the immune-suppressed tumor microenvironment (TME) of breast cancer by histone deacetylase inhibition shows promise, but the mechanisms of sensitization are unknown. We investigated the TME of breast-to-lung metastases by combining experimental and clinical data with theory. Knowledge-guided subclustering of single-cell RNA-sequencing data and cell circuits analysis identified 39 cell states and salient interactions, of which myeloid, T cell and B cell subpopulations were most affected by treatment. Using functional immunologic assays, we verified that inhibition of the ICAM pathway partially recapitulated treatment effects. Mathematical modeling of tumor-immune dynamics confirmed that tumor reduction required simultaneous modulation of multiple TME interactions. We found evidence that treatment affected anti-tumor antibody production. Analysis of patient biopsies via spatial proteomics corroborated preclinical findings: in responders we observed increased B cell activation, mature tertiary lymphoid structures, and increased CD8+ T cell--macrophage distances with treatment. Overall, this study provides a framework for the discovery of cell-cell interactions that govern responses in complex TMEs.

Statement of significanceThis study provides a framework for the discovery of cell-cell interactions that control responses in complex TMEs. We not only identify impactful tumor immunologic interactions that facilitate sensitization of the metastatic TME but also demonstrate how interdisciplinary data integration fuels cancer systems immunology to accelerate discovery of mechanisms of successful immunotherapeutic response in breast cancers and other previously unresponsive solid tumor types."
"Disruptions in sleep, circadian rhythms, and neural plasticity are closely linked to the pathophysiology and treatment of depression. Acute sleep deprivation (SD) produces rapid but transient antidepressant effects, yet the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Using a mouse model of stress-induced depression, we found altered sleep architecture, impaired sleep homeostasis, and disrupted day-night oscillations of the markers of glutamatergic plasticity - Homer1a and synaptic AMPAR expression in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). These changes were accompanied by a blunted homeostatic response to SD. We further show that SD and ketamine, both rapid-acting antidepressants, exert opposing effects on mPFC circadian gene expression: SD enhances the expression of negative clock loop genes (e.g., Per, Cry), mirroring stress effects, while ketamine downregulates these same genes. Targeted deletion of the core clock gene Bmal1 in CaMK2a-expressing excitatory neurons of the mPFC disrupted sleep-wake architecture, elevated slow-wave activity, and abolished the behavioral and molecular (Homer1a) response to SD. Additionally, pharmacological activation of the clock repressor REV-ERB suppressed the antidepressant effects of SD. Our results demonstrate that the mPFC molecular clock is essential for the regulation of sleep consolidation and homeostasis, and mediates the effects of SD on behavior."
"Animals interact with unfamiliar objects to learn about their properties and guide future behavior, but the underlying neurobiological mechanism is not well understood. Here, we developed a behavioral paradigm in which freely walking Drosophila melanogaster are repeatedly guided to spherical objects using a visual cue. Flies exhibited diverse and structured object interaction motifs, including ""ball pulling"", and ""ball walking"", that evolved over time. Notably, flies developed a strong preference for immobile over mobile objects, despite their near identical appearance, suggesting they learn about object stability through physical interaction. This preference was impaired by silencing specific h{Delta} neurons in the fan-shaped body, a circuit known for spatial navigation through vector computations. h{Delta} neurons also modulated object interaction motifs and fidelity of following visual guidance cues, pointing to a role in balancing goal-directed and exploratory behaviors. These findings establish Drosophila as a model for investigating how internal representations and multimodal feedback contribute to adaptive object interaction."
"The Northern Gulf of Alaska (NGA) is a highly productive and diverse marine ecosystem. Differences in nutrient supply and physical circulation between nearshore and offshore waters in the NGA result in a mosaic of water masses with distinct biogeochemical signatures. We hypothesized that microbial communities in these regions not only differ in composition but also in the ecological interaction networks they support. We used amplicon sequencing of the 16S (V4) and 18S (V9) rRNA genes to characterize the microbial community differences between nearshore, continental shelf, and offshore regions in the NGA in summers 2018-2021. We observed significantly different community assemblages by region (MRPP, p = 0.001), with higher relative abundances and cell counts of heterotrophic bacteria and Synechococcus nearshore, elevated Alphaproteobacteria and SAR11 clades offshore, and greater dinoflagellates and Spirotrich ciliates on the shelf. Co-occurrence networks of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of prokaryotes and eukaryotes were constructed for each region using statistically significant correlations (Spearman rank >0.8, Bonferroni corrected p < 0.05). Overall, the offshore network had higher centralization (0.331) and density (0.112), indicating higher connectivity and therefore more potential interactions compared to the shelf (0.191, 0.069) and nearshore (0.165, 0.041) networks. The nearshore network was characterized by higher proportions of potentially parasitic taxa such as Cryothecomonas aestivalis, Syndiniales Dino Group I, and MAST-1C and parasitoid bacteria Bdellovibrio and like organisms, suggesting that nearshore conditions may increase parasitoid/predator success through increased contact rates. Significant correlations between cryptophyte Plagioselmis prolonga and ciliate Oligotrichida were identified in all three regions, supporting previous findings that kleptoplasty is likely an important strategy across the NGA. Eukaryotic taxa that had the highest degree centrality across all three regions; P. prolonga and Phaeocystis are known to be mixotrophs, suggesting a role for bacterivory in forging a high number of interactions between protists and bacteria. Understanding these potential keystone microbes and their interactions is crucial for a greater understanding of ecosystem stability within the NGA."
"AbstractThe rising interest in essential oils (EOs) as antimicrobial agents demands evaluation frameworks that move beyond anecdotal efficacy and toward structured, reproducible assessment. In this study, we examined the strain-dependent response of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to Pharmacopoeia-grade Thyme Essential Oil (TEO) or polyhexamethylene biguanide antiseptic (PHMB), using a panel of ten genetically diversified strains in planktonic and biofilm form and by complementary in vitro models. Despite uniform test conditions, we observed striking inter-strain variability: TEO Minimal Inhibitory Concentrations (MICs) differed by up to 1000-fold, and biofilm susceptibility profiles ranged from full tolerance to near-complete eradication. Notably, strains with low metabolic activity and sparse cell populations--but high matrix biomass--exhibited reduced responsiveness to TEO, while susceptibility to PHMB was more consistent, though not absolute. These findings highlight the critical influence of both microbial phenotype and agent formulation on antimicrobial outcomes. Rather than framing EOs as superior or inferior alternatives, our results advocate for their integration into a stewardship paradigm--one that values standardization, model-based evaluation, and informed formulation. In this context, we position essential oil stewardship not as a constraint, but as a necessary evolution for their credible inclusion in antimicrobial strategies."
"Hyphal formation is a critical virulence trait in Candida species, contributing significantly to host tissue invasion, immune evasion, and disease progression. The morphological transition from yeast to hyphal form is therefore a key target for antifungal intervention. However, conventional hyphal induction media are often complex, expensive, and poorly standardized. In this study, we developed a simplified and cost-effective medium (MF8) containing peptone (0.16%), dextrose (0.4%), and bovine serum albumin (BSA; 0.25%), which supported moderate hyphal growth under nutrient-limited conditions. The addition of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) markedly enhanced filamentation. Using a Design of Experiments (DOE) approach via JMP software, we evaluated the effects of GlcNAc and magnesium sulfate (MgSO) on hyphal induction. GlcNAc was identified as a significant enhancer (p < 0.05; R{superscript 2} = 0.26), while MgSO had no significant impact (p > 0.05). Under optimized conditions (30 mM GlcNAc, 1 mM MgSO), RT-qPCR analysis revealed strong upregulation of HWP1 (100-fold at 4 h; 85-fold at 6 h) and HGC1 (>6-fold; p < 0.05). A concurrent pH shift from alkaline to acidic during 1-6 hours correlated with hyphal induction and gene activation, suggesting that acidification may serve as an additional cue regulating morphogenesis.

IMPORTANCECandida species are highly adaptable opportunistic fungi that persist in diverse host niches due to numerous virulence factors. While typically commensal, they can transition to pathogenic forms, with hyphal formation being a key virulence trait. This yeast-to-hypha switch facilitates tissue invasion, immune evasion, and disease progression, making it a major target in antifungal research. Conventional hyphal induction media are often complex and costly. Developing a simplified, cost-effective, and reproducible medium would enhance studies on morphogenesis and pathogenesis, support drug screening, and potentially reveal novel virulence mechanisms under alternative environmental cues."
"Methylation of CpG dinucleotides is essential for silencing genomic repeats such as LINE-1 retrotransposons (L1s) in the germline and soma. Evolutionarily-young L1s are transcribed in human pluripotent stem cells, but how CpG methylation is patterned to these L1s upon exit of pluripotency is unknown. Here we investigate the critical functions of chromatin regulator MORC2 in epigenome reprogramming of the repetitive genome in early human neurodevelopment. We find that reversible ATP-dependent dimerization is required for MORC2 accumulation over L1s but not gene promoters. Mutation of the MORC2 ATPase module, causative for neurodevelopmental disorders, severely disrupts the distribution of MORC2 chromatin binding, leading to simultaneous loss of L1 transcriptional control and hyper-repression of clustered ZNF genes in human pluripotent stem cells. Upon neural differentiation these phenotypes persist due to striking, targeted defects in CpG methylation patterning. Together our results define the vital role of MORC2 in safeguarding the somatic human genome upon exit of pluripotency by directing CpG methylation patterning over transcriptionally-active retrotransposons in a manner analogous to the piRNA pathway in the germline."
"Sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (S-AKI) is a grave clinical condition with a poor prognosis. Prior studies have observed a potential correlation between copper (Cu) and S-AKI, though the underlying mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. The present study aims to investigate the underlying mechanism between Cu and renal dysfunction under sepsis conditions. Utilizing a cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) murine model, we observed a substantial upregulation of inflammatory factors and deteriorated renal function (p<0.05), concomitant with an augmented mortality rate (p<0..05). Concurrently, the renal tissue exhibited a series of pathological manifestations, including fibrosis and cell death. Concurrently, the expression of the cuproptosis-regulating protein FDX-1 (p<0.05) was found to be elevated in CLP mice. Collectively, these data indicated the activation of cuproptosis in CLP-induced S-AKI. Intriguingly, the application of abscisic acid (ABA), a FDX-1 inhibitor, led to a substantial alleviation of mortality rate and inflammatory factor level (p<0.05). Furthermore, a significant alleviation was observed in renal pathology and biofunction (p<0.05). Collectively, these observations suggest that ABA exerts a protective effect on renal function during cuproptosis promoted S-AKI. Consequently, it can be concluded that ABA has the potential to reverse cuproptosis in S-AKI by inhibiting FDX-1."
"Current cell therapies are limited by the lack of tools for controlling gene expression using humanized systems responsive to non-toxic stimuli. Starting from nanobodies that homodimerize in response to caffeine, we computationally designed inducible heterodimers and humanized the best-performing pairs. We used the resulting caffeine-inducible domains in engineered cytokine receptors for caffeine-inducible STAT3 signaling and in split transcription factors (caff-TFs) containing human-derived zinc-finger proteins. Heterodimerization of split transcription factors drastically enhanced their performance compared to homodimerization. We demonstrate that caff-TFs are compatible with lentiviral and retroviral delivery to Jurkat T-cells and enable inducible expression of therapeutic genes such as chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) in response to caffeine concentrations consistent with normal coffee consumption. By using the common, non-toxic molecule caffeine, and exclusively humanized protein components, these systems promise to be a safer alternative to existing systems and may be used in synthetic biology applications and for safer, more effective cell therapies."

"Hyperactive enzymes drive the pathology of several diseases, and classically, ""occupancy-driven"" drugs (e.g., active site or allosteric inhibitors) are used to target these enzymes. However, the stoichiometric nature of such inhibitors and the emergence of resistance highlight the need for new modalities. Here, we report a Phosphorylation-Inducing Chimeric Small molecule (PHICS) that rewires the hyperactivity of an oncogenic kinase, BCR-ABL, to phosphorylate its active site residue. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest this phosphorylation inhibits BCR-ABL by inducing electrostatic rearrangements of its active site. This ""event-driven"" mechanism selectively induces apoptosis of BCR-ABL-dependent cancer cells at substoichiometric concentrations (vs. stoichiometric concentrations of occupancy-driven drugs). Furthermore, PHICS is effective on other oncogenic ABL fusions or clinically observed resistance mutations, including to occupancy-driven drugs with the same binding site as PHICS, pointing to the orthogonality of their resistance mechanisms. These studies lay the foundation for electric-field and ""event-driven"" modalities to control hyperactive enzymes with orthogonal resistance mechanisms to occupancy-driven modalities."
"Women are at greater lifetime risk for Alzheimers disease (AD), potentially due to midlife fractional anisotropy (FA) and lower mean diffusivity in fornix and corpus callosum, indicating more densely organized white matter. Perimenopausal women were the exception, with white matter profiles closely resembling those of men. Perimenopausal women exhibited minimal or absent fiber cross-section and FDC sex differences and a reversal of the fornix FA advantage observed in pre- and postmenopausal women. These cross-sectional results are consistent with sex differences in white matter organization. Importantly, the perimenopause emerges as a critical window of neural reorganization in the female midlife aging brain characterized by temporary convergence toward male-like white matter organization. Longitudinal analyses are key to identifying women who do or do not revert to a premenopausal profile, which may inform AD risk."
"The ricefield eel (Monopterus albus), an economically important aquaculture species in China, is the only freshwater teleost fish that exhibits protogynous hermaphroditism. While progress has been made toward understanding the sex determination and differentiation of this species, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here we show that warm temperature promotes gonadal transformation by up-regulating testicular differentiation genes such as dmrt1/sox9a in ovaries. Trpv4, a Ca2+-permeable cation channel expressed in gonads, is highly sensitive to ambient temperature and mediates warm temperature-driven sex change of ricefield eel. In female fish reared at cool temperature, injection of Trpv4 agonist into the ovaries leads to significant up-regulation of testicular differentiation genes, and in female fish exposed to warm temperature, Trpv4 antagonist administration or trpv4 siRNA knockdown inhibits temperature-induced male gene expression. pStat3 signaling is downstream of Trpv4 and transduces Trpv4-controlled calcium signaling into the sex determination cascades. Inhibition of pStat3 activity prevents the up-regulation of male genes by warm temperature treatment and ovarian injection of Trpv4 agonist, whereas activation of pStat3 is sufficient to induce the expression of male genes, even in the presence of Trpv4 antagonist. pStat3 binds and activate jmjd3/kdm6b, an activator of the male gene dmrt1. Consistently, ovarian injection of Kdm6b inhibitor blocks the up-regulation of male genes by warm temperature treatment. We propose that environmental factors such as warm temperature promote gonadal transformation of ricefield eel via the Trpv4-pStat3-Kdm6b axis. Our results provide new insights into the molecular mechanism underlying natural sex change of ricefield eel, which will be useful for sex control in aquaculture.

Highlights[bullet] Warm temperature promotes gonadal transformation of ricefield eel

"Progress in malaria control in sub-Saharan Africa is stalling, partly due to the spread of insecticide resistance in Anopheles vectors. Monitoring the evolution of insecticide resistance alleles and their spatial heterogeneity is important for malaria control programmes, and genomic surveillance has emerged as a pivotal tool for this purpose. Earlier genomics research has typically employed convenience-based sampling, and research has yet to be performed to optimise sampling regimens for malaria vector genomics. In an earlier study, we developed a spatially explicit sampling framework that considers the underlying ecology to enable sampling mosquitoes with reduced bias. We applied this framework to sample and perform whole-genome sequencing on 485 individual specimens of An. gambiae s.l mosquitoes from Obuasi, central Ghana, an area with extensive gold mining activities. In this region, An. gambiae s.l have been documented as highly resistant to multiple insecticides, including pyrethroids used for the treatment of bed-nets. High resolution of fine-scale population structure enabled the detection of isolation-by-distance in An. coluzzii in Obuasi, whilst finding that at this scale, geographic distance, rather than the underlying habitat, drives population structure. We examine methods to estimate mosquito kinship, demonstrating that polymorphic chromosomal inversions significantly confound established analytical tools, while revealing how the mosquitos chromosome architecture generates high variance in genetic relatedness among kin. Using genome-wide selection scans and clustering, we discover the novel mutations Gste2-F120L and Cyp9K1-N224I in detoxification enzymes that are driving selective sweeps, likely in response to insecticidal pressure. We find that the frequencies of some resistance variants are associated with artisanal-gold mines, and elucidate the continued evolution of the Voltage-gated sodium channel, the target of pyrethroid insecticides. Overall, we show that sampling vectors strategically may enhance our ability to perform effective genomic surveillance."
"Transcription is regulated through the sequence-specific binding of transcription factors (TFs) to cis-regulatory regions (CRRs). Although scattered along the genome, multiple CRRs are brought in close spatial proximity to the genes they regulate through the formation of DNA loops. The sequence component of transcriptional regulation suggests that DNA variants in CRRs could disrupt TF-DNA interactions and gene regulatory networks through a cascading effect. To date, only a few cases of recurrent cis-regulatory variants have been described. As an alternative to variant recurrence, some methods utilize genomic annotations that indicate the functional impact (FI) of a variant and the CRRs of each gene to detect the enrichment of high-impact cis-regulatory variants (CRVs). However, the agreement across the different associations and FI scoring methods remains unexplored. This work demonstrates that gene-CRR and FI scoring methods exhibit little consensus, highlighting the impact of the choice of a specific CRR-score combination in a given analysis. In addition, we demonstrate that cancer genes exhibit a higher frequency of FI variants compared to non-cancer genes. Based on this, we developed HiFIseek, a Snakemake pipeline exploring the enrichment of FI variants in associated genomic regions using all region-score combinations and two enrichment detection methods. We apply HiFIseek to detect genes exhibiting high FI CRVs in eight cancer cohorts and a set of breast cancer risk-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In the cancer cohorts, we observe a small degree of agreement across CRR-score combinations. Although HiFIseek detected known cancer-related genes with FI CRVs, most of them did not show significant changes in their expression. In the SNPs cohort, HiFIseek found small consensus across CRR-score combinations. However, one of the combinations returned 18 known cancer-related genes, including BRCA1, showing an enrichment of high-impact CRVs."
"The phage shock protein A (PspA), a bacterial member of the ESCRT-III superfamily, forms rod-shaped helical assemblies that internalize membrane tubules. The N-terminal helix 0 of PspA (and other ESCRT-III members) has been suggested to act as a membrane anchor, the detailed mechanism, however, of how it binds to membranes and eventually triggers membrane fusion and/or fission events remains unclear. By solving a total of 15 cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of PspA and a truncation lacking the N-terminal helix 0 in the presence of EPL membranes, we show in molecular detail how PspA interacts with and remodels membranes: binding of the N-terminal helix 0 in the outer tubular membrane leaflet induces membrane curvature, supporting membrane tubulation by PspA. Detailed molecular dynamics simulations and free energy computations of interactions between the helix 0 and negatively charged membranes suggest a compensating mechanism between helix/membrane interactions and the energy contributions required for membrane bending. The energetic considerations are in line with the membrane structures observed in the cryo-EM images of tubulated membrane vesicles, fragmented vesicles inside tapered PspA rods, and shedded vesicles emerging at the thinner PspA rod ends. Our results provide insights into the molecular determinants and a potential mechanism of vesicular membrane remodeling mediated by a member of the ESCRT-III superfamily.

SummaryThe rods of bacterial ESCRT-III protein PspA internalize and thin membrane tubules by overcoming the required bending energy through progressive membrane binding of the N-terminal helix in the PspA assembly."
"Turing patterns are a well-studied model of reaction-diffusion equations for developmental patterning. Their applicability has often been limited by the difficulty in identifying candidate molecules that satisfy the requisite criteria for patterning. Here, we build on recent work on geometric models to describe Turing patterning as a potential flow. We use the mathematics of normal form theory to capture the universal dynamics of Turing patterning, largely independent of the underlying reaction-diffusion equations. We apply our framework to three-component systems and demonstrate that we can accurately capture the dynamics of any given component. We extend our framework to larger networks and to models of Turing patterns coupled with external morphogens that provide positional information. Our normal form equations constitute a quantitative description of the dynamics of chosen markers, and we apply them to the dynamics of SOX9 expression during digit patterning."
"Sequentially structured and temporally compressed reactivation of episodes of experience plays a key role for memory and learning in the mature mammalian brain. This type of neural coding, known as replay, could also drive the enormous progress in sequential learning seen in human early life. Rodent models, however, suggest that replay emerges slowly and still refines in the juvenile phase. To test whether this prediction holds in humans, we introduced a novel fast event-related stimulation paradigm for infants undergoing non-invasive electroencephalography. Leveraging time-resolved decoding techniques we discovered replay of visual objects already in infants as young as 10 months. Reactivation responses revealed a forward sequential structure and temporal compression of the learnt sequence by a factor of 6 to 7. These results demonstrate that human replay develops considerably earlier than in rodents. Our insights stimulate future research exploring how replay contributes to the development of fundamental human cognitive capacities including language processing and action planning."

"We frequently encounter linguistic information in multiple modalities, such as text and speech, simultaneously. In such cases, we understand the information by selectively attending to one of the modalities. Previous research has shown that selective attention to a specific stimulus modality modulates cortical activity patterns. However, it remains unclear which aspects of linguistic information are selectively modulated by attention and how such modulation influences the decodability of semantic content. To address this question, we constructed decoding models of latent semantic features from the functional magnetic resonance imaging data of six participants in both unimodal (either visual or auditory) and bimodal conditions (simultaneously visual and auditory, with participants attending to a single modality at a time). In unimodal conditions, we successfully decoded the semantic contents from the brain activity. Decodable features were consistent across modalities in both intra-modal and cross-modal decoding. For bimodal conditions, decoding accuracies for the attended stimuli were higher than for the ignored when training and test stimuli belonged to the same modality. Furthermore, decodable features were more consistent across modalities with attended than ignored stimuli in both intra-modal and cross-modal decoding. These results indicate common decodable semantic features regardless of the presentation modality and that selective attention enhances the semantic representations contributing to such decodability."
"Behavioral Timescale Synaptic Plasticity (BTSP) is a form of synaptic plasticity in which dendritic Ca2+ plateau potentials in hippocampal pyramidal neurons drive rapid place field formation. Unlike traditional learning rules, BTSP learns correlations on the timescales of seconds and rapidly changes single-unit activity in only a few trials. To explore how BTSP-like learning can be integrated into network models, we propose a generalized BTSP rule (gBTSP), which we apply to unsupervised and supervised learning tasks, in both feedforward and recurrent networks. Unsupervised gBTSP mirrors classical frameworks of competitive learning, learning place field maps (in the feed-forward case), and attractive memory networks (in the recurrent case). For supervised learning, we show that plateau events can reduce task error, enabling gBTSP to solve tasks such as trajectory matching and delayed non-match-to-sample. However, we find that credit assignment via gBTSP becomes harder to achieve with increased network depth or CA3-like recurrence. This suggests that additional features may be needed to support BTSP-mediated few-shot learning of complex tasks in the hippocampus."
"Coat protein complex II (COPII) mediates anterograde trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). While the core COPII machinery is well-characterized, how cells regulate COPII to accommodate large cargoes, including collagens, remains incompletely understood. Here, we show that the cargo-selecting COPII subunit Sec24D is modified by site-specific O-linked {beta}-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) in its N-terminal intrinsically disordered region upon induction of collagen transport. These glycosylations are required for collagen trafficking in human cells and developing zebrafish. Crosslinking proteomics demonstrated that each O-GlcNAcylation influences the Sec24D interactome in a distinct way, revealing novel mediators of COPII function. In particular, Sec24D glycosylation is required for its interaction with myoferlin, which unexpectedly facilitates fusion of ER exit sites (ERES) and the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) to enable collagen transport. Our results establish Sec24D O-GlcNAcylation as a dynamic regulator of COPII protein-protein interactions and collagen trafficking and identify myoferlin as a novel mediator of this process."
"Social interactions are crucial for individual health and ultimately fitness, making the choice of social partners particularly important. Previous research has shown that individuals who succeed in foraging tasks often receive increased affiliation from group members. Similarly, in a social learning context, individuals who possess valuable information become more attractive social partners. Thus, an individuals role in a foraging context-specifically, whether it is a successful producer-can influence its social relationships. Therefore, we examined the interplay between social learning, producing and scrounging behavior, and social relationships in four groups of wild redfronted lemurs (Eulemur rufifrons). We conducted an open diffusion experiment with food boxes that required animals to learn one of two techniques to open them. 27 out of 29 individuals participated in the experiment, 24 interacted with the boxes and 16 learned to open them. Initial success was better predicted by use of individual than social information, i.e., manipulating the food boxes vs. time spent watching successful individuals or scrounging. Older males were less successful than females. Scrounging occurred in about 26% of events, with on average 1.3 individuals scrounging. The technique used, age and sex of the producer did not predict scrounging frequency. Learners and males scrounged more often than non-learners and females. Among learners, less successful individuals scrounged more often and this effect was more pronounced in males. More successful individuals and those that were scrounged more often received more affiliative behavior. Thus, cognitive skills and scrounging tolerance may strengthen social relationships in this primate species."
"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWA central challenge in comparative biology is linking present-day trait variation across species with unobserved evolutionary processes that occurred in the past. In this endeavor, phylogenetic comparative methods are invaluable for fitting, comparing, and selecting evolutionary models of varying complexity and biological meaning. Traditionally, evolutionary studies have relied on conventional statistical approaches to assess model fit and identify the one that best explains variation in a given trait. Here we explore an alternative strategy by applying supervised learning to predict evolutionary models via discriminant analysis. We formally introduce Evolutionary Discriminant Analysis (EvoDA) as an addition to the biologists toolkit, offering a suite of new methods for studying trait evolution. We evaluate the performance of EvoDA alongside conventional model selection through a series of fungal phylogeny case studies, each targeting increasingly challenging analytical tasks. These results showcase the strengths of EvoDA, with substantial improvements over conventional approaches when studying traits subject to measurement error, which likely reflect realistic conditions in empirical datasets. To complement our simulation-based benchmarking, we explore the application of EvoDA for tackling a notoriously difficult task: predicting the mode and tempo of gene expression evolution. This empirical analysis suggests that stabilizing selection acts on a majority of genes, with bursts of expression evolution in a handful of genes related to stress, cellular transportation, and transcription regulation. Collectively, our findings illustrate the promise of EvoDA for predicting trait models across a range of evolutionary and experimental contexts, establishing a new methodological framework for the next era of comparative research.

SO_SCPLOWIGNIFICANCEC_SCPLOW SO_SCPLOWTATEMENTC_SCPLOWTo make sense of biodiversity, evolutionary studies have historically relied on conventional statistical procedures to evaluate competing hypotheses about the mode and tempo of trait evolution. Here, we introduce new supervised learning methods that substantially outperform traditional techniques for correctly assigning trait models across a range of evolutionary and experimental conditions. We find that these methods are highly robust to measurement noise expected from realistic trait data and offer new insights into a central question in comparative genomics: what are the evolutionary forces shaping variation in gene expression across species?"
"Madagascar is a megadiverse island with exceptionally high levels of endemism, which resulted mainly from allopatric speciation promoted by the islands complex physical geography and paleoclimatic cycles. Northeastern Madagascar is uniquely suited to test the relative importance of river barriers, topography and climatic conditions for lemur genetic differentiation. Based on restriction site-associated DNA sequences, we inferred phylogeny, population structure, genetic diversity and rates of gene flow in four mouse lemur (genus Microcebus) and two woolly lemur (genus Avahi) species. In addition, we employed isolation-by-resistance models to test the importance of topography, river barriers, climate and forest cover in restricting intraspecific gene flow. Our results show that significant differences in genetic diversity and connectivity can be explained by varying responses to landscape features and species-specific phylogeographic histories. Rivers present a general barrier to gene flow, and dispersal between inter-river systems is predominantly mediated through high-elevation headwater regions. While this led to high connectivity and genetic diversity in M. lehilahytsara and A. laniger, gene flow among M. jonahi populations is limited by low climatic niche suitability at higher elevations. In addition, topographic complexity promotes connectivity among Microcebus populations, potentially by buffering impacts of seasonal or historic changes in climatic conditions. Finally, the more restricted distributions of M. macarthurii, A. mooreorum and, to some extent, M. simmonsi likely resulted from refugial dynamics and sea level fluctuations which led to geographic isolation, microendemism and secondary contact zones. Our findings generated informed hypotheses regarding the colonization history of the studied species while also having important implications for their conservation."
"Social determinants of health (SDOH) data are often excluded from genetic models of human traits. We use individual-level data from the All of Us Research Program to assess whether SDOH survey variables alter heritability estimates. Incorporating SDOH summaries decreases heritability significantly for 4 of 18 anthropometric and metabolic traits in individuals whose self-reported race is ""White"" (n=67,545). There are no such significant changes in individuals whose self-reported race is ""Black or African American"" (n=6,538), likely reflecting reduced statistical power. Incorporating genetic principal components consistently lowers heritability estimates in both groups, whether or not SDOH summaries are included. These findings demonstrate that survey-derived SDOH summaries can change heritability estimates and should be considered along with genetic summaries."
"Bilingualism research has long been challenged by a lack of a unified approach to quantifying language dominance and degree of multilingualism. While numerous questionnaires (e.g., LHQ, BLP, LEAP-Q, and LUQ) provide valuable data on language background variables, they lack a standardized formula to compute key measures from it. We introduce two formulas that synthesize critical linguistic variables to efficiently calculate language dominance and a multilingualism score that ranges from perfect monolingualism to native-like proficiency in multiple languages. Validation across two large datasets shows our dominance measure closely aligns with more complex PCA methods while being simpler and more efficient."
"How the brain organizes semantic information is one of the most challenging and expansive questions in cognitive neuroscience. To shed light on this issue, prior studies have attempted to decode how the brain represents concepts. We instead examined how relational information is encoded, which we pursued by submitting texts to a contemporary large language model and extracting relational embeddings from the model. Using behavioral data (N = 636), we found these embeddings capture independent information about scenes and objects, along with relational information on their semantic links. Turning to fMRI data (N = 60), we leveraged these embeddings for representational similarity analysis: The occipitotemporal cortex represents concepts in isolation, whereas the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia principally encode relational information. Relational coding within prefrontal and striatal areas also tracks how participants reason about scenes and objects. Altogether, this research maps how information progresses from concept-level to integrative forms and how this translates into behavior."
"Damage of collagen fibril network in articular cartilage plays a key role in post-traumatic osteoarthritis but the main underlying mechanobiological mechanisms of fibrils degeneration early after injury are not fully understood. This study explores the hypothesis that injurious loading leads to cellular damage that triggers the release of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), resulting in loss of collagen content in cartilage. To investigate this, we developed a computational mechano-signaling model simulating spatial collagen loss in bovine cartilage. In the model, the injurious loading causes excessive shear strains in tissue matrix, leading to cell damage and subsequent release of MMPs. The model was compared to ex vivo cartilage explant experiments over 12 days post-injury where collagen content was assessed via Fourier-transform infrared microspectroscpy. By day 12, the simulated collagen loss aligned with our experimental findings along most of tissue depth ([~]30% bulk average loss in the model vs. [~]35% in the experiment). The results suggest that injury-related cell damage and the downstream MMP activity could partly explain the depth-wise collagen content loss in early days after ex vivo cartilage injury. Ultimately, combining the current approach with joint-level computational models could enhance the prediction of the onset and progression of cartilage degeneration.

Author SummaryKnee injuries can initiate an irreversible degeneration of articular cartilage which can later lead to the development of post-traumatic osteoarthritis over the years. Currently, there is no cure or effective intervention to repair degenerated cartilage or halt disease progression. Yet, opportunities for intervention depend on a thorough understanding of mechanisms that govern the very early changes in cartilage tissue composition such as the collagen fibrils. In this work, we developed a finite element computational modeling framework to simulate cartilage following injurious loading, focusing on the early loss of collagen content. The model aims to capture the role of injury-induced cellular damage in elevating proteolytic activity within the tissue, which could rapidly degrade collagen fibrils and result in significant collagen loss. This model framework offers a tool for studying the degradation of the collagen fibril network, testing hypotheses involving cell-driven mechano-signalling pathways and evaluating potential treatment interventions aimed at preventing collagen loss."
"Interactions among receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), particularly HER2, are critical in driving the growth of certain breast cancer subtypes. However, the mechanisms of HER2 dependency and resistance to targeted therapies remain unclear. Using photocatalytic micromapping ({micro}Map) proximity labeling, we profiled the HER2 interactome across human breast cancer lines. We identify galectin family proteins as uniquely enriched in trastuzumab-resistant models, and show that genetic and pharmacological inhibition of galectins restores trastuzumab sensitivity. Mechanistically, galectin inhibition destabilized HER2 and other RTKs and enhanced antibody-mediated receptor degradation. Galectin inhibition in combination with trastuzumab triggered mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum stress pathways, revealing new mechanisms underlying HER2 signaling, dependency, and resistance in breast cancer. We also identified protein tyrosine phosphatase F (PTPRF) as a pan-cancer HER2 interactor, which is broadly upregulated and whose knockdown suppresses proliferation in HER2-low cancers. This work provides an extensive new interactomic resource and underscores the utility of proximity labeling for mapping complex cancer networks and identifying new therapeutic targets."
"Urosepsis is a life-threatening condition most frequently caused by E. coli expressing important virulence factors, including -haemolysin (HlyA). The pore-forming exotoxin HlyA releases ATP upon its insertion into cellular membranes, and the majority of the biological effects of HlyA are mediated through ATP-dependent P2-receptor activation, including the HlyA-mediated thrombocyte activation. We have recently shown that uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) bind to thrombocytes immediately after entering the blood, and the following hepatic clearance leads to early thrombocytopenia during bacteraemia. Here, we demonstrate that P2Y2-deficient mice had markedly shorter survival (LD50 of 185 minutes) compared to wildtype (340 minutes), a response paralleled in mice infused with the P2Y2 receptor antagonist AR-C118925XX. The P2Y2-/- mice exhibited a blunted sepsis-induced thrombocytopenia compared to wildtype and sepsis-induced reduction in mature neutrophils in the blood. Strikingly, the P2Y2-deficient mice had inadequate hepatic clearance of UPEC, resulting in the accumulation of bacteria in the lungs, while thrombocytes were mainly sequestered in the kidneys. Hence, it is likely that the insufficient hepatic elimination of UPEC is responsible for the reduced survival in the P2Y2-/- mice. Taken together, we show that the lack of functional P2Y2 receptors is essential for fast and proper hepatic clearance of UPEC and the survival time during urosepsis. Moreover, the data support the notion that an early reduction in circulating thrombocytes is important for a relevant host response to acute bacteraemia."
"Studying cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow can reveal physiological and neural drivers of potential importance in brain clearance. CSF flow may be acquired in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans by considering the inflow effect in an edge-slice. Such measurements have large potential considering the broad availability of fMRI, and the already extensive databases focusing on e.g. aging and dementia. However, limiting factors are that the measurements are not quantitative and can rarely separate contributions from different driving mechanisms due to insufficient sampling rate. Here, we present a method that translates fMRI CSF signals into quantitative flow rates associated with cardiac, respiratory and slow-vasomotion cycles, by modeling the spin-history of an oscillating ensemble of molecules. Phantom experiments showed excellent correlations between estimated and true velocities for cardiac- and respiratory-like frequencies, and moderate correlations for a slow vasomotion-like frequency (r = 0.94, 0.97, 0.58 respectively). We also applied the method in a cohort of 48 subjects from the population (68-82 years, 19 women) to characterize CSF flow at the foramen magnum at resting state. These measurements showed a CSF stroke volume of 0.86 [0.61, 1.17] mL for the cardiac, 0.44 [0.25, 0.94] mL for the respiratory, and 0.28 [0.14, 0.45] mL for the slow vasomotion cycle. In conclusion, the method presented here enabled quantitative assessments of CSF flow compatible with typical fMRI acquisitions and showed that the cardiac cycle is a dominant driver of CSF flow."
"Giant viruses represent key ecological players in aquatic ecosystems, yet their evolutionary dynamics in response to environmental change remain poorly understood, particularly in freshwater environments. We leveraged an unprecedented 20-year time series (2000-2019) of 471 co-assembled metagenomes from Lake Mendota (USA) to reconstruct 1,512 high-quality giant virus metagenome-assembled genomes (GVMAGs), providing a unique framework to track viral genome evolution across decades. Viruses in the order Imitervirales dominated the Lake Mendota virome, exhibiting consistent presence across all seasons and years. We identified gene duplication (23% of genes) and horizontal gene transfer (29% of genes) as drivers of genomic innovation in giant viruses. Co-occurrence network analysis between viral DNA polymerase B and eukaryotic 18S rRNA sequences revealed significantly increased virus-host associations following the 2009 invasion of a predatory zooplankton. Genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism analysis demonstrated predominantly purifying selection across viral genes, but revealed a significant increase in positively selected genes post-invasion, including in functions related to host infection (such as protein translation). Comparative evolutionary analyses revealed that giant viruses exhibit genome-wide substitution rates similar to co-occurring bacteria but significantly slower than smaller dsDNA phages, positioning them as evolutionary intermediates with bacterial-like genomic stability but virus-like adaptive capacity. By analyzing a vicennial (20-year) time series, we show that freshwater giant viruses employ sophisticated evolutionary strategies. They broaden their host range without abandoning established partners and maintain stable genomic backbones while rapidly adapting infection-related genes. These dynamics highlight their critical yet previously underappreciated role in freshwater ecosystem dynamics and resilience to environmental change."
"The human body comprises many different microenvironments, each with their own challenges for microorganisms to overcome in order to survive, and possibly cause infection. The human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae is notoriously flexible in this regard, and can adapt to a wide range of host niches, including the nasopharynx, lungs, and cerebrospinal fluid. However, the molecular and genetic underpinnings of this ability remain largely obscure. In this work, using infection-mimicking growth conditions we demonstrate that niche adaptation imposes genome-wide changes on multiple levels, including gene essentiality, expression and membrane lipid composition. In general, we show that gene expression and fitness profiling couple orthogonal sets of genes to environmental stimuli. For instance, N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) import (manLMN) and catabolism (nagAB) genes were required for growth on this sugar, but not differentially expressed in its presence, whereas other amino sugar metabolism pathways were upregulated, but not essential. Surprisingly, we found that pneumococci do not necessarily prefer glucose over GlcNAc and that uptake of GlcNAc in absence of subsequent catabolism was toxic. Moreover, we identified a previously overlooked fatty acid saturation regulator, FasR, controlling membrane composition, rendering it important during heat stress. A fundamental understanding of how genes contribute to bacterial niche adaptation, including nutrient availability or temperature fluctuations, is crucial for understanding successful antibiotic therapy and vaccination strategies and the development of novel anti-infectives."
"Microbial contamination of surface waters remains a significant public health concern, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and urban settings affected by combined sewer overflows (CSOs). Standard culture-based methods for monitoring fecal indicator bacteria (FIB)-- including membrane filtration (MF) and most probable number (MPN) assays--typically require laboratory infrastructure, do not provide same-day results, and systematically underestimate total FIB loads due to their inability to accurately quantify aggregate-bound bacteria.

This study evaluates ALERT, an automated rapid method for culturable FIB quantification, as a viable field-deployable alternative to conventional laboratory techniques. ALERT employs a whole-sample approach that comprehensively captures both planktonic and aggregate-bound E. coli, thereby addressing critical limitations of traditional methods. Three instrument variants were assessed: the in-situ ALERT System V2, the portable ALERT LAB, and the handheld ALERT One, designed for single-sample analysis in resource-limited environments.

Comparative field and laboratory trials conducted in Germany, France, and the UK demonstrate that ALERT delivers accuracy and precision equivalent to MPN methods, while providing faster results directly in the field and enabling high-frequency sampling. Use cases included storm event monitoring, CSO impact evaluation, and on-site validation and optimization of point-of-use water potabilization treatments. ALERT One was also successfully used by citizen scientist volunteers, highlighting its suitability for decentralized community-based monitoring.

By enabling rapid, accurate, and comprehensive microbial water quality assessments, ALERT qualifies as a robust field alternative to laboratory testing. It supports enhanced water safety, empowers community-based surveillance and public engagement, and facilitates data-driven decision-making in both LMICs and high-income countries."
"In this study, we successfully cloned the fluorescent proteins eGFP and DsRed in-frame with the antimicrobial peptide epinecidin-1 (FIFHIIKGLFHAGKMIHGLV). The cloning strategy involved inserting the fluorescent reporters into the expression vector, followed by screening of positive clones through visual fluorescence detection and molecular validation. The visually identified fluorescent colonies were found positive with PCR and plasmid migration assay confirming successful cloning. This fusion of fluorescent reporters with a short antimicrobial peptide enables real-time visualization and monitoring of the peptides mechanism of action on membranes and within cells, both in vivo and in vitro. The fusion of eGFP and DsRed to epinecidin-1 did not impair the expression or fluorescence of the reporter protein."
"Explaining the origin of molecular systems composed of cooperating polymer sets that confer both metabolic and information processing functions is a key challenge in origins-of-life research. A related puzzle is the emergence of polymers of sufficient length to confer complex functions such as the RNA-dependent RNA polymerization with proofreading. Addressing these issues using computational models of template-guided replicating polymer systems is generally constrained by the exponential increase in diversity as the length of polymers increases. In this study, inspired by the computer game Tetris(R) and the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) technique, we developed an abstract computational model of cooperative replicating polymer systems that avoids tracking all potential sequences. Using this model, we explored cooperative chemical ecosystems consisting of catalytic polymers conferring functions analogous to kinases, ligases, and mutation inhibitors. We show that prebiotic environments with micro-compartments with local exchanges enable multilevel selection that facilitates the survival of cooperating polymers. The ability of cooperative systems to persist is sensitive to intrinsic properties of catalysts such as catalytic efficiency and extrinsic factors such as dilution rate. These results provide a roadmap for future studies that look not just at persistence but also at the stepwise, de novo emergence of chemical ecosystems with both metabolic and information-processing capabilities."
"Delivery of gene therapy vectors targeted to any somatic cell remains a key barrier for the development of genetic medicines. While rodent models provide insights into vector biodistribution and cellular tropism, their anatomical and physiological differences from humans limit their translational potential and studies in large animal models are often required. In this study, we developed a swine reporter model (SRM-1) to evaluate both viral and nonviral vector delivery in a large animal system. The SRM-1 model harbors a Cre- and CRISPR-activated tdTomato reporter at the Rosa26 locus that allows for tracing of cell-specific delivery and expression of gene therapy vectors in vivo. To evaluate this model, we administered adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) and lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) carrying mRNA systemically and found successful in vivo reporter activation across a variety of tissues. Intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of LNP-Cre mRNA was also performed and demonstrated localized activation in cortical brain cells. In addition to biodistribution studies, this model has utility for testing safety and clinically relevant administration methods, surgical and non-surgical, of delivery vectors. Our findings support the SRM-1 model as a valuable tool for advancing gene therapies from preclinical testing to clinical application."
"Psychological trauma is associated with significant alterations of biological functions and is correlated with epigenetic changes specifically of DNA methylation. Trauma therapy is aiming at relieving the impact of trauma and is in initial studies also correlated with changes in DNA methylation. In this study we explored the changes in whole blood DNA methylation of participants of a program focusing on individual, ancestral and collective trauma processing and meditation in a large group setting of 1.6 years duration. Based on accompanying questionnaires, training participants report slight improvements in anxiety, depression and overall life satisfaction and some mystical experiences. 3227 CpGs and 253 genes were found to be differentially methylated during the training. Although these genes are not involving any of the known trauma related genes and relevant gene ontology terms, they comprise a large number of genes involved in the nervous function, as well as in cellular and developmental functions, the immune system and metabolism. Also, epigenetic aging is predicted to slow down during training. In summary this pilot study yielded additional findings showcasing the potential correlation of trauma therapy and alterations of DNA methylation."
"Deubiquitylases (DUBs) are a family of specialized proteases that hydrolyze the isopeptide bond between a lysine and the C-terminal carboxylate of Ubiquitin. DUBs are involved in a myriad of cellular processes and many are attractive drug targets. However, it has proven extremely difficult to develop selective inhibitors due to the high degree of homology between DUB active sites. Targeted protein degradation using a proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) that recognizes the DUB in a less conserved region outside of the catalytic domain constitutes an attractive alternative strategy for selectively inhibiting a given DUB. Such ligands are unlikely to block the catalytic activity of the enzyme, raising the concern that auto-deubiqtuiylation will make DUBs inherently poor substrates for PROTACs of this type. Since drug-like ligands that engage DUBs outside of the active site are extremely rare, this issue is difficult to address in a straightforward fashion. In this study we establish a generally applicable chemical genetics workflow to evaluate the degradability of DUBs by a PROTAC. The data indicate that some DUBs are readily degradable and some are not. In particular, USP11, an attractive drug target in various cancers and Alzheimers disease, is shown to be rapidly degradable, while its paralogs, USP4 and USP15 resist degradation through auto-deubiquitylation.

SignificanceThe development of selective inhibitors of Deubiquitylase enzymes (DUBs) is difficult due to a high level of homology in the active sites of the {approx} 100 such enzymes in the human proteome. A potentially attractive strategy to achieve this goal would be to develop PROTACs or molecular glues that engage the target DUB in a less conserved region outside of the catalytic domain. However, this raises the concern that auto-deubiquitylation would make DUBs poor substrates for this modality. Here we describe a chemical genetics system to evaluate this issue. We find that some Dubs are readily degradable via the Ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and some are not. Of the latter category, some resist turnover through auto-deubiquitylation and some are simply poor proteasome substrates.

HighlightsO_LISome active DUBs, including USP11 are vulnerable to targeted protein degradation by a PROTAC.
C_LIO_LIOther DUBs, including USP4 and USP15, resist PROTAC-mediated degradation via auto-deubiquitylation.
C_LIO_LISome DUBs are poor substrates for targeted degradation because they are processed inefficiently by the proteasome.

"Molecular dynamics (MD) has become a popular simulation tool in recent years. However, its application is often limited by a timescale problem, due to its femtosecond-level integration timestep. To address this challenge, various enhanced sampling methods have been developed to accelerate system dynamics. Here, we introduce a novel enhanced sampling approach: Kinetically Accelerated Molecular Dynamics (KAMD). By combining the atomic-level accuracy of MD with the diffusive behavior of Brownian dynamics (BD), KAMD significantly improves sampling efficiency on domain/motif level while preserving equilibrium properties. We showed that KAMD is particularly effective in simulating two types of processes: large-scale conformational changes and ligand unbinding events."
"The neuroendocrine ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channel comprises four pore-forming subunits (Kir6.2), and four modulatory sulfonylurea receptor subunits (SUR1). ATP/ADP binding to Kir6.2 inhibits KATP, whereas MgATP/MgADP binding to two sites on SUR1 promotes activation. As SUR1 is part of the ABC transporter family, it can hydrolyze MgATP to MgADP. Whether or not enzymatic activity is required for KATP activation remains controversial. Non-hydrolyzable ATP analogs do not activate KATP, which may reflect an inability of these compounds to bind to SUR1, their inability to promote a conformational change in SUR1 that leads to channel activation, or a requirement for ATP hydrolysis during channel gating. To explore this, we synthesized a fluorescent trinitrophenyl (TNP) derivative of the non-hydrolyzable ATP analog {beta},{gamma}-methyleneadenosine 5-triphosphate (AMP-PCP). Synthesis was verified by UV-visible absorbance, fluorescence, 1H NMR, and mass spectrometry. Purity was assessed using TLC and reversed-phase HPLC. We can measure real-time binding of fluorescent nucleotide derivatives to intact KATP channels in cell membranes using FRET between channels labeled with a fluorescent, non-canonical amino acid and TNP-nucleotide derivatives. This technique provides us with sufficient spatial resolution to discriminate between binding to each site on KATP. Using this approach we measured TNP-ATP binding to nucleotide binding site 1 on SUR1 in fluorescently labeled Kir6.2/SUR1 channels in unroofed membranes of HEK293T cells. TNP-AMP-PCP binds to both nucleotide binding sites on SUR1 in the absence of Mg2+. AMP-PCP was able to compete with TNP-ATP for binding to NBS2, suggesting that it, too, binds NBS2. We conclude that the failure of non-hydrolyzable ATP analogs to activate KATP does not stem from an inability of these nucleotides to bind to the channel, leaving open the possibilities that they are unable to induce an activating conformational change in SUR1 or that nucleotide hydrolysis by SUR1 is a prerequisite for channel activation.

SUMMARYRubio et al. synthesize, purify, and characterize a novel, fluorescent non-hydrolyzable ATP derivative and use it to probe the nucleotide-binding sites of KATP."
"{beta}-arrestins ({beta}arr) regulate the signaling and trafficking of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in numerous physiological processes and have been implicated in various diseases. Structural and kinetic insights into how ligand-mediated GPCR activation drives {beta}arr coupling and activation remain limited, with the binding mechanism of the phosphorylated GPCR C-terminal tails, such as that of the vasopressin receptor-2 (V2Rpp), and the conformation of the entire {beta}arr tail in the active state still unknown. Here, we simulated both the basal and V2Rpp-bound states of {beta}arr1 with temperature replica-exchange molecular dynamics (TREMD) simulations to probe the activation mechanism of {beta}arr1. Compared to conventional MD, our TREMD simulations, employing an unprecedented 200-replica setup, significantly broadened conformational sampling while preserving the basal state. Our analysis showed that, without the bound Fab30 antibody fragment, the main body of V2Rpp-bound {beta}arr1 tended to transition toward the basal conformation; however, binding of V2Rpp in the N-domain groove allosterically oriented the finger loop to point upward for core engagement with a GPCR. Furthermore, V2Rpp dissociation events suggest that its binding involves a sliding movement along the N-domain groove, during which its phosphorylated residues p3 and p4 transiently occupy the S5 site to facilitate repositioning of p5 into the S5 site, thereby triggering a zippering process of p1 to p3. The dynamic 62-residue {beta}arr1 tail explored a vast conformational space, forming transient secondary structures, and could favorably anchor on the main bodys back side and within the central crest crevice. These findings elucidate key mechanistic steps underlying {beta}arr1 activation."
"The low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) plays a critical role in development and transport across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), yet until now, its molecular architecture remained unresolved due to the absence of an experimentally determined structure. Using homology modeling and neural network-based structure prediction algorithms, complemented with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we propose a comprehensive model of LRP1 structures. We observe a natural dimerization mechanism and provide insight into the dynamic behavior of its flexible domains under physiological conditions. We investigated the stability of non-covalent interactions keeping LRP1s  and {beta} chains linked together, and found the energy required to break the link is 180{+/-}2 kT. The MD characterization highlights the fundamental role of glycans in the creation of LRP1s quaternary structure, increasing the number of intra-dimeric contacts. This study opens new avenues for targeted drug design strategies, enhancing our molecular understanding of LRP1s receptor-mediated transport in the brain and the key mediation of glycosylation in protein-protein interactions."

"Aberrant activation of the RAS/MAPK signaling limits the clinical efficacy of several targeted therapies in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In FLT3-mutant AML, the selection of clones harboring heterogeneous RAS mutations drives resistance to FLT3 inhibitors (FLT3i). RAS activation is also associated with resistance to other AML targeted therapies, including the BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax. Despite the critical need to inhibit RAS/MAPK signaling in AML, no targeted therapies have demonstrated clinical benefit in RAS-driven AML. To address this unmet need, we investigated the preclinical activity of RMC-7977, a multi-selective inhibitor of GTP-bound active [RAS(ON)] isoforms of mutant and wild-type RAS in AML models. RMC-7977 exhibited potent antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic activity across AML cell lines with MAPK-activating signaling mutations. In cell line models with acquired FLT3i resistance due to secondary RAS mutations, treatment with RMC-7977 restored sensitivity to FLT3i. Similarly, RMC-7977 effectively reversed resistance to venetoclax in RAS-addicted cell line models with both RAS wild-type and mutant genetic backgrounds. In murine patient-derived xenograft models of RAS-mutant AML, RMC-7977 was well tolerated and significantly suppressed leukemic burden in combination with gilteritinib or venetoclax. Our findings strongly support clinical investigation of broad-spectrum RAS(ON) inhibition in AML to treat and potentially prevent drug resistance due to activated RAS signaling."
"Plasmid DNA (pDNA) is a cost-driving reagent for the production of gene therapies and DNA vaccines. Improving pDNA production in the most common production host (E. coli) has faced obstacles arising from the complex network of genes responsible for pDNA synthesis, with the specific enzyme(s) limiting pDNA yield remaining unidentified. To address this challenge, we employed an inducible genome-wide mutagenesis strategy, combined with fluorescent screening, to isolate E. coli NEB 5 strains with enhanced pDNA production. Following selection, we successfully isolated an E. coli strain (M3) with elevated plasmid copy numbers (PCNs) across multiple origin types. Specifically, we observed a 5.93-fold increase in PCN for the GFP reporter plasmid, a 1.93-fold increase for the gWiz DNA vaccine plasmid, and an 8.7-fold increase for the pAAV-CAGG-eGFP plasmid, all of which contain pUC origins. In addition, plasmids with p15A and pSC101 origins showed 1.44-fold and 1.68-fold increases in PCN, respectively. Whole-genome sequencing of the adapted strain M3 identified 85 mutations, including one in recG, which encodes an ATP-dependent DNA helicase. Replacement of the mutant recG with its wild-type counterpart in the mutant strain resulted in a 63% reduction in PCN, but the recG mutation alone was insufficient to increase PCN in the wild-type strain. These findings suggest that the recG mutation plays a synergistic role with other genomic mutations to drive PCN increases. Taken together, this study presents the development of a pDNA hyperaccumulating E. coli strain with promising applications in industrial and therapeutic pDNA production, while also offering important insights into key genes involved in pDNA production."
"Virus-like particles (VLPs) are self-assembling nanoparticles derived from viruses with potential as scaffolds for myriad applications. They are also excellent testbeds for engineering protein superstructures. Engineers often employ techniques such as amino acid substitutions and insertions/deletions. Yet evolution also utilizes circular permutation, a powerful natural strategy that has not been fully explored in engineering self-assembling protein nanoparticles. Here, we demonstrate this technique using the MS2 VLP as a model self-assembling, proteinaceous nanoparticle. We constructed, for the first time, a comprehensive circular permutation library of the fused MS2 coat protein dimer construct. The strategy revealed new terminal locations, validated via cryo-electron microscopy, that enabled C-terminal peptide tagging and led to a stable protein encapsulation strategy via covalent bonding - a feature the native coat protein does not permit. Our systematic study demonstrates the power of circular permutation for engineering new features as well as quantitatively and systematically exploring VLP structural determinants."
"Aging is associated with a decline in immune function termed immunosenescence, characterized by accumulation of senescent-like immune cells and chronic inflammation, known as inflammaging. While senescence-associated {beta}-galactosidase (SA-{beta}Gal) activity is a well-established senescence marker, its functional significance and the precise cellular subsets affected within the T cell compartment remain unclear. Here, we identify and characterize a previously unrecognized subset of naive CD4 and CD8 T cells displaying high SA-{beta}Gal activity that significantly increases with age. Despite exhibiting hallmark features of senescence such as DNA damage, nuclear envelope disruption, loss of heterochromatin, and pronounced dysregulation of autophagy and lysosomal pathways, these SA-{beta}Gal-high naive T cells notably lack the canonical senescence marker p21CIP1 and retain robust proliferative capacity upon activation. Remarkably, naive CD4 SA-{beta}Gal-high T cells acquire cytotoxic properties including NK-like features, granzyme secretion, and the ability to induce paracrine DNA damage in endothelial cells. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that impaired autophagic flux contributes significantly to this phenotype. Our findings address critical knowledge gaps regarding the nature and functional plasticity of senescence-like states in naive T cells, highlighting a novel link between lysosomal-autophagic dysfunction, cellular stress adaptation, and inflammaging. Understanding this unique T cell population provides important insights into immune aging and offers potential targets to mitigate age-associated immune dysfunction and chronic inflammation."
"The female sawfly (Insecta: Hymenoptera, Symphyta) uses a double reciprocating saw-like ovipositor to cut into plant tissue, laying its eggs within the cut. We have identified a passive selective cutting mechanism in which the saw discriminates between material properties of the plant tissue without active sensing or external control. The mechanism balances effective cutting with minimal collateral damage to either the plant or the saw. Scaled-up models of the saw cutting into experimental substrates (agar and ballistic gelatine) across a range of stiffnesses reveal an ultimate stress threshold above which substrates are displaced rather than incised. This depends on the interaction between the shape of the saw teeth and the substrate properties and is consistent across multiple species of sawfly. These findings suggest a novel surgical tool design with high selectivity of cutting and reduced collateral damage."
"Mapping protein-protein interactions (PPIs) in living systems is critical for understanding dynamic biological processes. While proximity-labeling enzymes like LOV-TurboID and APEX2 are widely used, their dependence on external light, reactive chemicals, or large fusion domains limits in vivo applications, especially in deep tissues.

Here, we introduce LucID (Light-free Unifying Catalytic Integrated Domain) - a compact, self-contained proximity-labeling system that functions independently of light or external ROS. LucID was engineered by embedding a minimal catalytic motif derived from TurboID into a NanoLuc scaffold, preserving bioluminescence while enabling spatially confined biotinylation. Upon luciferin addition, LucID leverages BRET (bioluminescence resonance energy transfer) to uncage the catalytic site and activate biotin transfer.

With a molecular weight of approximately 23.7 kDa (40% smaller than TurboID), LucID is optimized for delivery via mRNA-LNP platforms. Its modularity and light-independent activation make it a unique tool for real-time interactome mapping in live cells and deep tissues. LucID introduces a new paradigm in proximity labeling: compact, luminescent, and chemically programmable. By integrating catalytic motifs into a light-producing scaffold, LucID enables temporally precise, spatially confined interactome mapping in challenging biological contexts. This innovation holds promise for single-cell proteomics, in vivo interaction studies, and next-generation bioimaging tools.

"We present RWKV-IF, an efficient and controllable framework for RNA inverse folding based on the attention-free RWKV language model. By treating structure-to-sequence generation as a conditional language modeling task, RWKV-IF captures long-range dependencies with linear complexity. We introduce a decoding strategy that integrates Top-k sampling, temperature control, and G-C content biasing to generate sequences that are both structurally accurate and biophysically meaningful. To overcome limitations of existing datasets, we construct a large-scale synthetic training set from randomly generated sequences and demonstrate strong generalization to real-world RNA structures. Experimental results show that RWKV-IF significantly outperforms traditional search-based baselines, achieving higher accuracy and full match rate while greatly reducing edit distance. Our approach highlights the potential of lightweight generative models in RNA design under structural and biochemical constraints.

"An effective broadly reactive antibody response is crucial to prevent viral infections. A small number of people living with HIV (PLWH) develop broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) targeting multiple HIV strains. Although several viral and immune factors contribute to bNAb development, the genetic and environmental factors driving this response remain largely unknown. We performed combined cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and cell-free RNA (cfRNA) sequencing in 42 plasma samples from a longitudinal cohort of 14 PLWH (7 who develop bNAbs and 7 matched controls). This approach enabled us to non-invasively monitor the host transcriptome, viral genetic variation, and microbiome composition during HIV infection, and to identify molecular correlates of bNAb development. We find that development of bNAbs is associated with a transcriptomic signature of early immune activation that involves MHC class I antigen presentation. This signature is independent of viral load or CD4 count and declines over time. In addition to host features, we recovered sufficient viral reads to reconstruct HIV consensus sequences, supporting the utility of cfRNA for viral genotyping. Finally, we also identified an enrichment of several commensal microbiota in bNAb producers and increased coinfection with GB virus C. Our findings suggest a distinct early immune activation profile in PLWH who develop bNAbs. More broadly, we show that combined cfDNA/cfRNA sequencing can reveal relationships between a protective immunogenic response to HIV infection, the host immune system, and microbiome, highlighting its potential for biomarker discovery in future vaccine and therapeutic studies."
"Advancing protein design is crucial for breakthroughs in medicine and biotechnology. Traditional approaches for protein sequence representation often rely solely on the 20 canonical amino acids, limiting the representation of non-canonical amino acids and residues that undergo post-translational modifications. This work explores discrete diffusion models for generating novel protein sequences using the all-atom chemical representation SELFIES. By encoding the atomic composition of each amino acid in the protein, this approach expands the design possibilities beyond standard sequence representations. Using a modified ByteNet architecture within the discrete diffusion D3PM framework, we evaluate the impact of this all-atom representation on protein quality, diversity, and novelty, compared to conventional amino acid-based models. To this end, we develop a comprehensive assessment pipeline to determine whether generated SELFIES sequences translate into valid proteins containing both canonical and non-canonical amino acids. Additionally, we examine the influence of two noise schedules within the diffusion process--uniform (random replacement of tokens) and absorbing (progressive masking)--on generation performance. While models trained on the all-atom representation struggle to consistently generate fully valid proteins, the successfully generated proteins show improved novelty and diversity compared to their amino acid-based model counterparts. Furthermore, the all-atom representation achieves structural foldability results comparable to those of amino acid-based models. Lastly, our results highlight the absorbing noise schedule as the most effective for both representations. Data and code are available at https://github.com/Intelligent-molecular-systems/All-Atom-Protein-Sequence-Generation.

Scientific ContributionThis work introduces a discrete diffusion-based framework for protein sequence generation using an all-atom representation, enabling the incorporation of non-canonical amino acids and post-translational modifications. Additionally, it provides a comprehensive evaluation pipeline to assess the validity of generated proteins, demonstrating how noise schedules within the diffusion process impact sequence novelty, diversity, and structural foldability."
"BackgroundSystemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is characterized by dysregulated immune responses linked to immunometabolic perturbations. While mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in SLE, its cell-type-specific impact on immune subsets remains underexplored.

MethodsWe repurposed existing RNA-seq data from SLE patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells, with a focus on nuclear-encoded mitochondrial (NEmt) genes, as well as mitochondrial genes themselves, to identify differentially expressed genes compared to healthy controls. Mitochondrial stress tests were performed on freshly isolated CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, B cells, and monocytes from SLE patients and healthy donors to assess bioenergetic function.

ResultsRNA-seq revealed that both NEmt genes and mitochondrial genes were downregulated in the PBMC population of SLE patients. In situ mitochondrial stress tests revealed significant reductions in oxygen consumption rate (OCR), indicating impaired oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) across all immune subsets, while extracellular acidification rate (ECAR), a marker of glycolysis, remained unchanged. These findings highlight immune-cell-specific mitochondrial bioenergetic failure in SLE, without compensatory glycolytic adaptation.

ConclusionOur results position mitochondrial fitness as a novel therapeutic target in SLE. We propose leveraging high-throughput screening of mitochondria-targeted compounds, including FDA-approved agents, to enhance OXPHOS, regulate mitophagy, or mitigate oxidative stress.

This precision-based approach offers a paradigm shift from conventional immunosuppression to metabolic recalibration, with the potential to restore immune homeostasis in SLE.

"Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the causative pathogen of human tuberculosis and a leading cause of death worldwide attributed to a single infectious agent. While small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs) have emerged as key regulators of bacterial pathogenicity, their specific roles and mechanisms in M. tuberculosis remain poorly understood. Here, we employed label-free quantitative proteomics, parallel reaction monitoring, and sRNA-seq analyses to identify proteomic differences between the virulent H37Rv and attenuated H37Ra strains. Bioinformatic analysis revealed significant enrichment of differentially expressed proteins involved in lipid metabolism and fatty acid biosynthesis, key pathways linked to M. tuberculosis virulence. We identified a novel sRNA, ASpks2, which was significantly downregulated in H37Rv. Functional validation demonstrated that ASpks2 directly targets the polyketide synthase 2 (pks2), modulating its expression to enhance M. tuberculosis survival in human macrophages THP-1 cells. By correlating the omics data with functional studies, this study identified a novel sRNA and its regulatory network in M. tuberculosis, which provides novel insight into the molecular pathogenesis of M. tuberculosis and may serve as a basis for the development of targeted therapies."
"Tauopathies are pathologies wherein phosphorylated insoluble tau aggregates in neurons, leading to dysfunction and degeneration. Positron emission tomography (PET) enables measurement of in vivo tau, with second-generation radiotracers such as [18F]MK6240 showing high tau affinity with minimal off-target binding. While tauopathies are commonly linked to age-related neurodegenerative diseases, notably Alzheimers disease (AD), evidence suggests pathophysiological cascades may begin long before clinical onset. Increasingly, tau is recognized in pathologies affecting younger individuals, including autosomal dominant AD, Niemann-Pick disease type C, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, and epilepsy, thus highlighting the importance of normative data in non-geriatric populations. Here, we present a dataset of 33 young to middle-age healthy adults (mean age 34.0{+/-}10.4 years, 12 female) with [18F]MK6240 PET data and T1w magnetic resonance imaging. Longitudinal data are also available in a subset of 9 participants with a minimum follow-up time of 1 year. Our dataset aims to support imaging biomarker studies on younger individuals potentially at risk for AD and to advance work in tauopathies affecting non-geriatric populations generally excluded from neurodegeneration studies."
"The age-class distribution of forests is a key indicator of both carbon stock potential and biodiversity conservation, playing a vital role in sustainable forest management. In Norway, birch (Betula spp.) is the most abundant tree species, covering 42% of the forest area. Understanding the factors that shape the age structure of birch is essential for developing management practices that balance timber production, carbon sequestration, and biodiversity conservation. Using data from the Norwegian National Forest Inventory (NFI), we examined the age-class distribution of birch trees across various site conditions. Our analysis revealed that middle-aged trees (50-100 years) were prevalent in most regions, while older trees were notably scarce, particularly in highly productive areas. This pattern reflects management strategies prioritizing younger, fast-growing trees to maximize economic returns. In contrast, less productive sites, which are often managed less intensively, tend to support older trees. Additionally, younger birch trees revealed significantly greater radial growth than older generations when evaluated at the same biological age (e.g., at 10 years old), particularly under favorable site conditions. These findings underscore the combined effects of site productivity, forest management, and environmental factors on growth dynamics and age-class distribution."
"Artificial light at night (ALAN), a growing consequence of global urbanisation, disrupts natural light cues that regulate biological rhythms across taxa. However, the behavioural pathways linking ALAN exposure to broader ecological impacts remain poorly understood. Here, we experimentally introduced ALAN into nestboxes of a long-distance migratory bird, the collared flycatcher (Ficedula albicollis), breeding in Gotland, Sweden, to assess ALAN effects on development and reproductive ecology. Nestlings were exposed to ALAN from two days post-hatching until fledging, and we video-recorded parental and nestling activity over 24 hours on day 8 post-hatching. From a high-resolution behavioural dataset (32,100 nestling and 3,709 parental events), we found that ALAN-exposed nestlings begged more frequently and for longer at night compared to dark controls, revealing disrupted nocturnal behaviour. These effects cascaded to parental care: both females and males in ALAN nests extended their daily activity, initiating feeding earlier and terminating later, but traded off this extension by reducing their hourly feeding counts compared to parents in dark conditions. Consequently, nestlings under ALAN fledged at an older age and had a lower fledging rate after day eight post-hatching, despite no difference in total fledging numbers compared to controls. Our findings provide the first comprehensive experimental evidence that ALAN alters the behaviour of both parents alongside their offspring and reduces reproductive success in a long-distance migrant, a species group that increasingly encounters light pollution during nocturnal migration. ALAN, though directly affecting mainly nestlings and females in nestboxes, triggered socially-mediated responses that altered the circadian behaviour of entire bird families. This study underscores the need to consider behavioural disruption as a critical mechanism underlying the ecological impacts of ALAN in natural populations.

"Precise in vivo gene delivery to specific cell types remains a significant challenge in gene therapy, particularly for cancer immunotherapy applications. Here, we rationally engineered AAV9 to become a modular, receptor-targeted vector for selective in vivo gene delivery. We first identified the N272A and W503A mutations as effective in ablating the native tropism of AAV9. Subsequently, designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins) were inserted into the GH2/3 capsid loop, redirecting vector specificity towards defined cellular receptors without compromising capsid integrity or yield. As a proof of concept, HER2-targeted DART-AAV9 vectors demonstrated highly selective transduction of HER2-positive tumor cells in vitro and in vivo, in both, subcutaneous and orthotopic glioblastoma models, with negligible transduction of off-target organs including liver, heart, and kidney. When equipped with immunomodulatory genes (anti-PD-1 or IL-2) HER2-DART-AAV9 mediated secretion of functional therapeutic proteins from transduced tumor cells. Additionally, our modular platform facilitated rapid generation of CD8-targeted DART-AAV9 vectors, enabling selective transduction of human CD8+ T cells. Importantly, the engineered vectors exhibited favorable resistance to neutralization by human serum and retained their specificity and potency in human blood, underscoring their potential for clinical translation. Together, these findings establish DART-AAV9 as a versatile, precise, and clinically promising gene delivery platform for cancer immunotherapy."
"Subclonal diversity within a tumor is highly relevant for tumor evolution and treatment. This diversity is often referred to as intratumoral heterogeneity and is known to complicate the interpretation of single-test biomarkers. Microsatellite instability (MSI) is one such biomarker, which is used to help guide immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment through the classification of samples as either having high microsatellite instability (MSI-H) or as being microsatellite stable (MSS). One area that has yet to be addressed in depth is whether MSI itself is a heterogeneous phenomenon, such that only some subclones are MSI-H. To investigate heterogeneity in MSI status, we curated and analyzed data from several single-cell RNA sequencing studies that had paired clinical MSI status and developed a computational pipeline to infer MSI-H cells and quantify heterogeneity In MSI status. We found evidence of heterogeneity in MSI status both in individuals originally classified as MSI-H and MSS. Out of 49 individuals, 15 showed evidence of divergence in MSI status between distinct clusters of cancer cells and most had distinct MSI-H and MSS subclones. These results raise questions about the current practice of treating MSI as a binary biomarker, ignoring heterogeneity between cancer subclones. Accounting for heterogeneity may lead to improved biomarker performance and, potentially, help explain reports of intrinsic treatment resistance and low overall responder rate in MSI-H cancers. Further studies are warranted to determine the frequency of heterogeneity in this biomarker at the population level, and whether the presence of both MSI-H and MSS subclones can have clinical implications."
"Mass spectrometry-based proteomics enables high-throughput profiling of protein expression across tissues but interpreting complex or sparse datasets remains challenging. We here present MLMarker, a machine learning-based tool trained on healthy human tissue proteomic data to compute continuous tissue similarity scores for new datasets. Using a Random Forest model trained across 34 tissue types, MLMarker predicts probabilistic tissue scores and explains these predictions using SHAP values at the single protein level for biological interpretability. To address missingness, a penalty factor can be used to correct for absent proteins contributing to predictions.

We demonstrate MLMarkers utility across three public datasets: (i) cerebral melanoma metastases, where brain-like proteomic profiles were linked to poor treatment response and invasive phenotypes, revealing 241 differentially expressed proteins; (ii) a pan-cancer FFPE dataset, where tissue origin predictions reached 79% accuracy using broad tissue mappings despite the absence of cancer-specific training data; and (iii) cerebrospinal fluid and plasma, where the model identified brain and pituitary origin in biofluid samples.

MLMarker offers an explainable, robust framework for hypothesis generation in proteomics, applicable across tumours, biofluids, and multi-tissue studies. It is available as a Python package and Streamlit GUI at https://mlmarker.streamlit.app."
"Advancements in the life sciences have always been built upon our collective understanding of life on Earth. Now, the rise of generative biology - the use of AI foundation models to design, generate, and annotate proteins, pathways and therapeutics - is creating unprecedented demand for large, diverse biological sequence datasets. While a limited subset of such data can be generated in clinical or laboratory settings, the vast majority of the training data for unsupervised models must be sourced from the natural world - the product of nearly four billion years of evolutionary history.

However, the public databases that currently supply this data, while foundational to research, were established to aggregate results from academic experiments, not as training datasets for machine learning. Their human-centric data structure limits model performance due to redundancy, taxonomic and geographic bias, limited biological context, and inconsistent provenance. With 68% of all sequence data in the SRA database coming from just 5 species, this is one of the most severe class imbalance problems ever encountered in AI. Legal and infrastructural constraints further exacerbate this bottleneck.

To address these limitations and support scalable model training, we introduce BaseData: the largest and fastest-growing biological sequence database ever built, and the first purpose-built for training foundation models. As of late 2024, BaseData contained 9.8 billion novel genes, representing more than a 10-fold expansion in known protein diversity after accounting for redundancy. BaseData also contains more than 1 million species not represented in other genomic databases. Its partnership-driven data supply chain across 26 countries and autonomous regions enables growth of up to 2 billion novel genes per month, far exceeding public repositories. All data is collected under benefit sharing agreements using standardized protocols and structured using graph-based, ontology-rich metadata that preserves evolutionary context.

BaseData represents a new, ethically-grounded infrastructure for training biological foundation models, complementing public efforts and enabling the next era of generative biology.

Short AbstractProgress of AI in biology is now being limited by the availability of high-quality biological sequence data from nature. To get past this data wall, we introduce BaseData, a new biological database built on top of a global, scalable biodiscovery pipeline. As of 2024, BaseData had already expanded the known protein universe by over 10x."
"Tumor heterogeneity plays a central role in treatment resistance, disease progression, and diagnostic uncertainty. However, it may be overlooked by traditional 2D histology. Accurate 3D assessment of tumor microarchitecture is therefore essential for capturing its spatial complexity. Micro-CT, an emerging imaging modality that offers high-resolution 3D virtual histology of soft tissues, provides a promising alternative. Combined with radiomics--a computational approach for interpretable quantification of tissue phenotypes--this technique enables a deeper understanding of tumor biology beyond visual inspection. In this study, we analyzed a large cohort of thyroid tumors (418 patients) using micro-CT imaging of next-generation tissue microarrays, from which we extracted radiomics features. We achieved robust classification of (i) neoplastic versus non-neoplastic thyroid tissues, (ii) papillary versus follicular thyroid carcinoma, and (iii) BRAF V600E mutation status. Feature interpretation using Shapley additive explanations revealed key visual traits driving these classification decisions. Preliminary results also indicated radiomic patterns associated with TERT promoter mutations, suggesting the existence of potential surrogate imaging biomarkers. Overall, micro-CT radiomics shows strong potential as a complementary tool for improving diagnostic and prognostic accuracy in thyroid cancer and offers a novel platform for quantitative pathology into the 3D spatial complexity of neoplastic tissues."
"Neuronal network resilience, the ability of brain circuits to maintain and recover functional connectivity following perturbation, is fundamental to cognitive stability and adaptability. Using human cerebral organoids and multi-electrode arrays (MEAs), we investigated how mechanical stress disrupts network stability and identified key mechanisms regulating recovery. Blast overpressure exposure destabilized small-world network (SWN) organization, increasing network fragmentation and reducing overall integration. Merged SWNs, which exhibit high connectivity, were particularly vulnerable, while fragmented and single SWNs persisted for extended periods, indicating a shift toward less resilient network states. Optogenetic stimulation promoted network recovery, reducing the persistence of fragile states and facilitating transitions toward more cohesive network structures. GABAergic signaling emerged as a critical regulator of network resilience, with pharmacological inhibition exacerbating fragmentation and impairing network reorganization. These findings reveal fundamental principles of how inhibitory networks regulate circuit stability, with implications extending beyond mechanical injury to broader conditions characterized by network dysfunction, including anxiety, depression, PTSD, and neurodegenerative disorders. Understanding the mechanisms governing network adaptation and resilience could inform new therapeutic strategies aimed at stabilizing disrupted neural circuits across a range of neurological conditions.

Significance statementNeuronal networks must dynamically adapt to maintain function in the face of disruption, yet the mechanisms that govern network resilience remain poorly understood. Using human cerebral organoids, we demonstrate that primary blast overpressure destabilizes small-world networks, increasing fragmentation and reducing overall connectivity. Critically, GABAergic signaling emerges as a key stabilizer, with inhibition of GABA receptors amplifying network fragmentation and impairing recovery. These findings provide fundamental insight into how neural circuits resist and recover from mechanical stress, bridging gaps between basic neuroscience, injury pathology, and potential therapeutic interventions. By identifying inhibitory signaling as a regulator of network resilience, our work informs not only traumatic brain injury treatment strategies but also broader efforts to restore functional connectivity in neurological disorders, from epilepsy to neurodegeneration."
"Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases have been extensively studied over the years. However, CSF samples are routinely centrifuged, and the resulting sediment or pellet is typically discarded to remove cellular debris and high-density particles. This standard practice raises a critical question: could these discarded sediments harbour potential biomarkers relevant to the diagnosis and prognosis of certain brain diseases? In this study, we analysed CSF pellets from various cases and identified, entrapped among undetermined remnants, brain-derived structures such as wasteosomes and psammoma bodies. Furthermore, we observed that disease-relevant proteins can become deposited in the sediment, as is the case for both tau and A{beta}42 in Alzheimers disease or tau in progressive supranuclear palsy disease. These findings suggest that some potential biomarkers might accumulate or be hidden in the sediment and, taken as a whole, the results underscore the need to broaden the scope of biomarker research.

"The brain coordinates multiple parallel motor programs, ensuring synergy and preventing interference during movements. Yet, performance often degrades when brain-machine interfaces are used during concurrent tasks or ongoing movements. We suggest that latent neural representations may represent a strategy to solve this issue. In this study, we addressed this question using neural signals from a tetraplegic individual with partial residual motor function, implanted with a wireless epidural electrocorticography (ECoG) device. By adapting dimensionality reduction techniques, we found that motor execution and motor imagery span partially overlapping subspaces in mesoscale neural signals, shaped by specific frequency band contributions. Despite substantial shared variance, we show that identifying orthogonal, condition-specific dimensions enables successful decoding of executed and imagined movements, even when performed simultaneously. These findings show that ECoG signals can expose separable neural subspaces, allowing executed and imagined actions to be harnessed independently and in concert. This opens a promising avenue to develop brain-machine interfaces that can simultaneously control multiple external devices or operate alongside natural movements."
"Entropy rate (ER) and sample entropy (SE) are two metrics that have been used to quantify the syntactic complexity of electroencephalography (EEG) microstate sequences. We here present a theoretical and numerical comparison of these two metrics and apply them to a resting-state EEG dataset from individuals with Alzheimers disease (AD) and a control group.

We first derive theoretical entropy rate and sample entropy estimates for first-order discrete Markov processes, providing a null hypothesis for statistical testing of higher-order syntax properties. Under the first-order syntax null hypothesis, we find a close mathematical relationship between both metrics that can be expressed by the microstate transition probability matrix. An inequality is derived that shows entropy rate to be an upper bound to sample entropy under the Markov approximation.

We quantify accuracy and precision of the theoretical ER and SE estimates on EEG microstate sequences from the healthy control group. We then show that ER and SE identify significant higher-order syntax properties in microstate sequences from the control and AD groups. Group comparison demonstrates that continuous microstate sequences from the AD group have lower entropy values (ER, SE), whereas jump sequences from the AD group have higher entropy values compared to control. Finally, we introduce a new syntax metric that normalizes ER and SE values with respect to their first-order syntax levels, to assess differences that only depend on syntax order. This metric revealed no differences between control and AD groups for either continuous or jump microstate sequences.

This study provides further insights into higher-order microstate syntax and how it can be quantified with respect to the underlying first-order syntax. Similarities and differences between ER and SE as syntax metrics are highlighted and exemplified on experimental data. Our results show that (i) EEG microstate sequences from control and AD subjects show higher-order syntax properties across the tested syntax levels, (ii) continuous and jump sequences from control and AD groups are syntactically different, and (iii) differences between the control and AD groups disappear when higher-order syntax properties are normalized to the group-specific Markov level."
"Continuous flash suppression (CFS), where a dynamic masker presented to one eye suppresses the conscious perception of a stimulus shown to the other eye, has been extensively used to study visual consciousness. Various studies reported high-level visual and cognitive functions under CFS, which, however, has more recently been questioned and at least partially attributed to low-level stimulus. A key but unsettled issue is the extent to which the responses of V1 neurons, where inputs from two eyes first merge, are affected, as severely suppressed V1 responses would not sustain high-level processing. Here, we used two-photon calcium imaging to record the responses of V1 neurons to a grating stimulus under CFS in awake, fixating macaques. The results revealed that CFS substantially suppressed V1 orientation responses. Ocularity-wise, it nearly completely eliminated the orientation responses of V1 neurons preferring the masker eye or both eyes, while also significantly suppressing the responses of those preferring the grating eye. Modeling analyses suggest that, under CFS, the brain retains the ability of classifying coarse orientations, but may become less capable of reconstructing the grating stimulus. Consequently, while CFS-suppressed orientation information still supports low-level orientation discrimination, it may not suffice for high-level visual and cognitive processing."
"Sexual dimorphisms are present across brains. Male and female brains contain sets of cell types with differences in cell number, morphology, or synaptic connectivity between the two sexes. These differences are driven by differentially-expressed transcription factors, which set the stage for disparate sexual and social behaviors observed between males and females, such as courtship, aggression, receptivity, and mating. In the Drosophila brain, sexual dimorphisms result from differential expression of two transcription factors, Fruitless (Fru) and Doublesex (Dsx), and genetic reagents driven by enhancers for Fru and Dsx label sexually-dimorphic neurons in both male and female brains. The recent release of the first whole-brain connectome for Drosophila provides a unique opportunity to study the connectivity between these neurons as well as their integration into the larger brain network. Here, we identify 91 putative Fru or Dsx cell types, comprising [~]1400 neurons, within the whole-brain connectome, using morphological similarity between electron microscopic (EM) reconstructions and light microscopic (LM) images of known Fru and Dsx neurons. We discover that while Fru and Dsx neurons are highly interconnected, each cell type typically receives more inputs from and sends more outputs to non-Fru/Dsx neurons. We characterize the connectivity in the Fru/Dsx networks to predict the function of cell types not previously characterized, we measure distances to the sensory periphery and uncover multisensory interactions, and we map connections to descending neurons that drive behavior. All Fru and Dsx labels reported here are shared within FlyWire Codex (codex.flywire.ai; gene==Fruitless or Doublesex); this work is a critical first step towards deciphering the neural basis of sexually-dimorphic behaviors and for making comparisons with future connectomes of the male brain."
"During wake, sound-evoked and spontaneous neural activity of the auditory cortex evolve in distinct subspaces whereas anesthesia disrupts sound responses and merges these spaces. To evaluate if similar modifications of the sound representation geometry explain sensory disconnection during sleep, we followed large neural populations of the mouse auditory cortex across slow wave sleep and wakefulness. We observed that sleep dampens sound responses but preserves the geometry of sound representations which remain separate from spontaneous activity. Moreover, response dampening was strongly coordinated across neurons and varied throughout sleep spanning from fully preserved response patterns to population response failures on a fraction of sound presentations. These failures are more common during high spindle-band activity and more rarely observed in wakefulness. Therefore, in sleep, the auditory system preserves sound feature selectivity up to the cortex for detailed acoustic surveillance, but concurrently implements an intermittent gating mechanism leading to local sensory disconnections."
"Adaptive sensorimotor transformation is essential for animal survival in dynamic environments. The optic tectum (OT), homologous to the mammalian superior colliculus, serves as a central hub for visuomotor processing. To elucidate how OT circuits discriminate visual inputs and generate relevant behavior outputs, we leveraged the mesoscopic connectome of zebrafish OT to build a biophysically constrained reservoir computing network that models visuomotor transformations. In silico lesion revealed that the accuracy and robustness of sensorimotor outputs are governed by different combinations of tectal interneuron (TIN) subtypes. Furthermore, specific lamina-projecting serotoninergic subsystems distinctly bias network output toward either escape or orienting behaviors via regulating TIN activities. Our findings establish a mesoscopic connectome-based reservoir for vertebrate sensorimotor processing, where TINs control accuracy and robustness, highlighting TINs as a tunable gate and serotoninergic neurons as a context-dependent modulator of behavioral flexibility."

"S100 proteins are highly versatile calcium-binding proteins from vertebrates. Following extracellular release, they become instrumental in immune and antimicrobial defenses, initiating the inflammatory response through receptor signaling and providing direct control of bacterial invaders via nutritional immunity. While mammalian S100s have been extensively studied, very little is known about the more recently discovered S100 proteins from teleost fish, including those with no strict orthologs in mammals. Comparable functioning between both clades would allow to expand their study into the highly popular zebrafish model, particularly suited for live imaging and mechanistic exploration of immune and inflammatory processes. To fill the gap of knowledge on teleost S100s, we here provide a detailed structural and biochemical characterization of S100i1 and S100i2 from Danio rerio, two teleost-specific S100s absent in mammals. We demonstrate that they nevertheless share conserved tertiary and quaternary organization with mammalian S100s. In addition, they exhibit comparable calcium binding properties and undergo a similar calcium-dependent activation mechanism. Furthermore, they display analogous expression pattern, being enriched in tissues highly exposed to the environment like gills and skin, the latter constituting an important reservoir of S100 proteins in mammals. Finally, our results show, for the very first time, that s100i2/i2 gene expression is differentially modulated in sterile disease conditions associated with sustained inflammation or high hypoxic state. Altogether, these findings underline the strong parallelism existing between mammalian and teleost-specific S100 proteins despite their divergent evolution, opening up new avenues to explore their biology in the zebrafish model."
"The cyanosphere consists of heterotrophic microorganisms residing within the exopolysaccharide sheath of cyanobacteria, acting as a crucial interface between the cyanobacteria and their surrounding environment. Understanding the interactions between cyanobacteria and their cyanospheres is essential for predicting the success of terrestrial cyanobacteria in providing ecosystem services in nutrient-poor environments. However, knowledge of the microbial diversity within the cyanosphere remains limited.

In this study, we employed metagenomic sequencing to reconstruct 410 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from cyanosphere-associated microbes linked to 56 unialgal terrestrial cyanobacteria cultures, representing 12 distinct cyanobacteria orders. Our findings revealed that the composition of cyanosphere microbial communities was unique to each cyanobacterial host and was significantly shaped by environmental factors such as habitat, precipitation, and temperature from which the cultures were originally obtained. Notably, three microbial genera, Brevundimonas, Devosia, and Sphingopyxis, were present in over 30% of the cyanospheres, forming a core cyanosphere microbiome. Functional gene analysis showed a distinction between the cyanobacteria and their associated cyanospheres, with dissimilatory nitrate reduction being the dominant pathway in the cyanosphere, while nitrogen fixation was more common in the cyanobacteria. Three cyanospheres also contained nitrogen fixation genes of which two hosts were nitrogen fixation capable themselves. The cyanosphere harbored genes for polysaccharide lyases, indicating a possible link to the exopolysaccharides produced by the cyanobacteria. Given the observed variability in microbial community composition and function across different cyanobacterial hosts, future ecological assessments and restoration efforts involving cyanobacteria should not only focus on the cyanobacteria themselves but also consider their associated microbial communities.

ImportanceOur study identifies members of a highly understudied, and potentially under-valued, microbial community -- the cyanosphere. We used a diversity of terrestrial cyanobacteria to understand how the cyanosphere composition and predicted functions were influenced by the host cyanobacterium and environmental factors using metagenomics. This is a new approach to study the cyanosphere and provides insights into the diversity of terrestrial microbial communities. Importantly, our results underscore the need to consider microbial consortia when assessing the ecological potential of cyanobacteria in terrestrial restoration."
"AimSpatial autocorrelation (SAC), also known as aggregation, is a notable property of species distributions and diversity; it reflects species niche and dispersal, has conservation significance, and affects ecological models. Yet, we know little about spatial and temporal patterns of SAC in empirical data. Here, we assess SAC in both observed species distributions and species richness, quantifying its magnitude and prevalence over large extents and across spatial resolutions. We also assess its dynamics over the past 50 years.

LocationCzechia, Europe, New York State, Japan

Time period1972 - 2017

Major taxa studiedBirds

MethodsWe analyzed four temporally replicated gridded bird atlases, each aggregated to multiple grain sizes. To measure SAC in species distributions, we used the Join count statistic (JC) and its deviation from the expectation under a random distribution. We assessed temporal changes in JC and their relationship with changes in occupancy, given their close association. We used Morans I to measure SAC in species richness.

ResultsBoth species distributions and diversity were positively autocorrelated across all regions, periods, and grains, and the magnitude of autocorrelation mostly decreased with increasing grain. We found that the temporal change of JC varied across species and regions, with zero average trends in Morans I, JC, and occupancy. However, when JC and occupancy were considered jointly, we found systematic temporal shifts: contracting species became more aggregated (compact) while expanding species became more fragmented (disjoint).

Main conclusionsStronger SAC at finer grains suggests greater predictability of diversity and distributions at these scales. Despite zero average change in occupancy or SAC, their coupled shifts highlight the importance of considering both jointly. We found long-distance dispersal (rather than advancing edge) and vulnerability of isolated populations to extinction as the major drivers of range dynamics in temperate birds."
"Noctilionoid bats went through one of the most extensive ecomorphological diversifications among mammals. Dietary ecology has been identified as a driver of noctilionoid morphological diversification. However, the macroevolutionary trajectories of changes dental morphology remain understudied. Studies indicate that variation in dental traits correlate with specialisation to different diets, implying differing patterns in phenotypic variability. We compared macroevolutionary trajectories across dental features quantifying five different traits using metrics of dental topography and size. Studying a sample of 110 species, we reconstructed the mode and tempo of dental evolution. We found multiple bursts of dental diversification through time, each involving different dental traits. Trait diversification was associated with different dietary radiations and could be traced to different nodes. Shifts in adaptive regimes were found in four traits, all of them concentrated within family Phyllostomidae. Evolutionary rate covariation differed across traits. We found low evolutionary covariation between measures of dental size and topography. Evolutionary modelling indicated dental traits evolved under different modes, signalling independent evolutionary trajectories. Support for diet-based models of stabilising and stochastic evolution across traits highlights the overarching effect of diet during dental evolution in Noctilionoidea. Our results support a complex and multifaceted model of evolution during noctilionoid dental morphological diversification."
"Cis regulatory elements (CREs) interact with their target promoters over long genomic distances and can be identified using chromatin conformation capture (3C) assays. Their regulatory activity can be functionally characterized in a high-throughput manner using massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) that generally test an enhancer alongside a minimal promoter. Here, we developed a novel technology called Capture-C MPRA (ccMPRA) that combines both technologies and can simultaneously obtain chromatin interactions and measure CRE activity alongside their target promoters. We utilized ccMPRA to analyze the regulatory activity of 650 promoters interacting with 42,719 sequences. As C-based techniques also capture isolated promoters, we were able to obtain promoter baseline activity, enabling the identification of both enhancers and silencers. Analysis of CREs interacting with more than one promoter showed significant activity differences depending on the promoter. In summary, ccMPRA can simultaneously characterize chromatin interactions and regulatory activity, allowing to further dissect regulatory grammar."
"Biomolecular condensates exhibit a wide range of viscoelastic properties shaped by their molecular sequence and composition. Coarse-grained molecular models of intrinsically disordered proteins are widely used to complement experiments by revealing the structure and thermodynamics of condensates. However, fully flexible chain representations of inherently disordered proteins often fail to capture their complex viscoelastic behavior, instead predicting purely viscous responses. In this work, we demonstrate that introducing sequence-dependent chain rigidity enables the accurate reproduction of the elastic and viscous moduli for experimentally characterized condensates of A1-LCD and its numerous mutants. Furthermore, we show that the frequency-dependent loss factor can be described by a single parameter that universally correlates with viscosity across different sequences and variations of the coarse-grained molecular energy function. Our results also reveal that increased chain rigidity, indicated by a larger gyration radius, expands the condensates elastic regime. Finally, we elucidate the microscopic origins of sequence-encoded viscoelasticity by showing how it can be tuned through sequence rearrangements that promote sticker cluster formation."
"In living cells, biomolecules operate in a crowded 3D milieu and are subjected to complex multi-axial stress environment. These mechanical forces are fundamental regulators of biomolecular structures and functions. However, most single-molecule force spectroscopy techniques primarily exert force along a single axis, thereby failing to recreate the mechanical environments experienced by biomolecules in cells. Here, we present a molecular tool comprising a multi-axial entropic spring tweezer along rigid DNA origami (MAESTRO), which utilizes ssDNA entropic springs to apply forces in the piconewton (pN) range and is designed to examine the dynamics of biomolecules under defined multi-axial tensions. Combining MAESTRO, single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) and Bayesian non-parametric FRET (BNP-FRET) enables high-throughput study of biomolecules under different complexities of multi-axial tension forces. We demonstrate our tension-inducing molecular tool on Holliday junction (HJs)--intermediate DNA structures important in the homologous recombination process. Instead of faster kinetics under tension, we discovered [&ge;] 5x slower kinetics of the HJ conformations under multi-axial tension than under tension-free conditions, which in turn permits direct observations of intermediate open and unstacked HJ conformations. Notably, under four-way tension, we observed clear evidence of inter-conversion between several different kinetic patterns in many individual HJs, previously believed to be non-interconverting owing to the rugged energy landscape of the system. In addition to controlling conformational dynamics, we show that the tension experienced by HJ also mechanically tunes the functional outcome of T7 endonuclease I, a junction-resolving enzyme that recognizes HJ and catalyzes two cleavage sites within the junction. By overcoming the limitations of single-axial force spectroscopy, we envision that MAESTROs versatile multi-axial tension capability will enable high-throughput investigation of complex, previously unseen dynamics and probe the mechanoregulation of many biomolecules."
"High-content, high-throughput (HCHT) screening platforms are essential for drug discovery, yet conventional 2D assays lack physiological relevance, and current 3D spheroid systems often face challenges to scalability, uniformity, and the analytical efficiency required for statistically robust screening. Here, we present a fully integrated 3D HCHT platform that synergizes tumor spheroid arrays generated from a bioinert inverted colloidal crystal (iCC) hydrogel frame-work with an automated, high-speed image analysis pipeline for rapid and spatially resolved therapeutic profiling. The iCC framework enables spontaneous self-assembly of highly-ordered tumor spheroid array at high spheroid density ([~]79.8 spheroids{middle dot}mm-2) with tight size uniformity (<10% standard deviation), supporting reproducible and high-content imaging ([~]40 spheroids{middle dot}image-1). The automated image-processing algorithm achieves robust region-of-interest segmentation, fluorescence-weighted centroiding, and multi-parametric spatial analysis in <5 seconds per image--markedly faster than conventional well-plate (5 min per 96 throughput) or single-spheroid analysis workflows methods ([~]1 sec per spheroid). Using this platform, we capture dose-dependent diffusion of doxorubicin, tumor penetration profile of small extracellular vesicles, and cell-type-specific infiltration behaviors of monocytes versus macrophages. Comparative viability profiling across chemotherapeutics further reveals distinct spatial toxicity signatures, highlighting the importance of spatial context in drug response assessment. Collectively, this platform enables rapid, reproducible, and spatially informative screening in 3D, offering a powerful tool for drug discovery, tumor modeling, and immunotherapeutic development."
"Ultrasensitive transcriptional switches are essential for converting gradual molecular inputs into decisive gene expression responses, enabling critical behaviors such as bistability and oscillations. While cooperative binding, relying on direct repressor-DNA binding, has been classically regarded as a key ultrasensitivity mechanism, recent theoretical works have demonstrated that combinations of indirect repression mechanisms--sequestration, blocking, and displacement--can also achieve ultrasensitive switches with greater robustness to transcriptional noise. However, these previous works have neglected key biological constraints such as DNA binding kinetics and the limited availability of transcriptional activators, raising the question of whether ultrasensitivity and noise robustness can be sustained under biologically realistic conditions. Here, we systematically assess the impact of these factors on ultrasensitivity and noise robustness under physiologically plausible conditions. We show that while various repression combinations can reduce noise, only the full combination of all three indirect mechanisms consistently maintains low noise and high ultrasensitivity. As a result, biological oscillators employing this triple repression architecture retain precise rhythmic switching even under high noise, and even when activators are shared across thousands of target genes. Our findings offer a mechanistic explanation for the frequent co-occurrence of these repression mechanisms in natural gene regulatory systems.

AUTHOR SUMMARYCells must make accurate decisions in noisy environments using limited molecular resources. One essential tool for this is the ultrasensitive transcriptional switch, which enables sharp transitions in gene expression. While cooperative binding has long been viewed as the primary mechanism behind ultrasensitivity, it is highly sensitive to molecular noise. Our study explores how cells overcome this limitation by combining three indirect repression mechanisms: sequestration, blocking, and displacement. We show that this triple-repression architecture not only generates ultrasensitivity but also ensures noise robustness under physiologically realistic conditions--even when a single pool of transcription factors regulates thousands of genes. These findings reveal a biologically feasible strategy for noise-resilient transcription and offer a mechanistic explanation for why these repression strategies frequently co-occur in natural systems."

"While humans and other primates are generally quite good at remembering the images they have seen, they systematically remember some images better than others. Here, we leverage the behavioral signature of ""image memorability"" to resolve a puzzle around how the brain transforms seeing into familiarity. Namely, the neural signal driving familiarity reports is thought to be repetition suppression, a reduction in the vigor of the population response in brain regions including inferotemporal cortex (ITC). However, within ITC, more memorable images evoke higher firing rate responses than less memorable ones, even when they are repeated. These two observations appear to conflict: if reduced firing leads to stronger memory signaling, then why are the images that induce greater firing more memorable? To resolve this paradox, we compared neural activity in ITC and the hippocampus (HC) as two rhesus monkeys performed a single-exposure image familiarity task. We found evidence that the paradox is resolved in HC where neural representations reflected an isolated memory signal that was larger for more memorable images, but HC responses were otherwise uncorrupted by memorability. Memorability behavior could not be accounted for by trivial computations applied to ITC (like thresholding). However, it could be decoded from ITC with a linear decoder that corrects for memorability modulation, consistent with the hypothesis that ITC reflects familiarity signals that are selectively extracted through medial temporal lobe (MTL) computation. These results suggest a novel role for the MTL in familiarity behavior and shed new light on how the brain supports familiarity more generally."
"BackgroundAccurately predicting animal movement across broad ecological contexts is vital for effective wildlife management, yet most models are developed for specific locations and fail to generalize across diverse landscapes. New approaches are needed to scale individual-level movement processes in a way that accounts for ecological variation.

MethodsWe developed a modeling framework to predict movement distance and habitat selection across large geographic areas using GPS telemetry data from 564 wild pigs collected in 25 studies across the United States. Movement distances were modeled using gamma distribution parameters, and habitat selection was modeled using integrated step selection analysis. We used gradient-boosted regression models with nested cross-validation to optimize predictions and reduce overfitting. To account for spatial non-stationarity in habitat preference, individuals were grouped by habitat availability.

ResultsOur framework captured broad-scale spatial and temporal variation in movement behavior. Mean daily movement distances ranged from 152 to 1,404 meters, with the greatest seasonal variation observed in northern populations. Habitat selection models revealed consistent preference for wetlands and avoidance of croplands, with variation in other land types depending on the local ecological context. Leave-one-out sensitivity analyses indicated greater model reliability in subsets with more individuals, sites, and land types.

ConclusionsThis framework offers a scalable approach to predicting animal movement across heterogeneous landscapes. It enables estimation of movement parameters in regions lacking local telemetry data, supporting more informed decision-making for invasive species management, disease control, and conservation planning."
"Understanding the genetic basis of rapid adaptation is key to predicting species evolutionary responses to environmental change. However, it is still debatable whether many small-effect mutations or a few large-effect mutations underlie rapid adaptation, and how this knowledge can predict population survival or extinction. To address this question, we performed a series of ecologically grounded forward-in-time genetic simulations to study rapid adaptation and extinction with increasing magnitudes of environmental change. These simulations were seeded with genomic variation of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana to have a realistic genomic structure, with one (monogenic) to 1,000 (polygenic) variants with varying heritabilities contributing to an environmental adaptive trait. Our results revealed two distinct scenarios of rapid adaptation and population rescue. Under small to moderate environmental shifts, high polygenic traits increased evolutionary rescue probability. Under extreme environmental shifts, high polygenic traits lead predictably to extinction, yet monogenic traits sometimes produce one-off winning adaptive genotypes. We interpret our rapid evolutionary rescue findings in terms of the fundamental theorem of natural selection, where monogenic and polygenic traits differ in how they create stable versus skewed fitness variance (Vw) and how they respond to environmental shifts. These results highlight the insights genomics gives us into the (un)predictability of species evolutionary responses to global change, with management implications for assisted adaptation conservation."
"Predicting host phenotypes from shotgun metagenomic data is essential for translating microbiome research into clinical practice. Despite the development of numerous computational tools for this task, researchers often default to traditional machine learning methods such as Random Forest. This hesitancy to adopt newer methods stems from their complexity as well as the lack of standardized evaluations, as most tools are assessed on different datasets and compared against a limited set of methods. To address this, we introduce PHLAME, a standardized benchmark for evaluating host phenotype prediction methods using gut metagenomic data. PHLAME features a diverse range of prediction tasks and enables consistent, comparative assessments across prediction tools. Our systematic evaluation of existing tools shows that microbiome-based phenotype prediction remains a challenging problem. However, we find that classic machine learning methods perform competitively, offering both ease of use and state-of-the-art results. PHLAME is publicly available for ongoing benchmarking at https://phlame.yassourlab.com/."
"During metastasis, tumour cells drain to nearby lymph nodes, the first of which are named the sentinel lymph node(s) (SLN). SLN biopsy (SLNB) determines if metastasis has occurred. Traditionally, SLNB involves injecting a Technetium-labeled tracer peritumourally, pre-operative imaging with SPECT to locate the SLN, and surgery guided by a gamma probe to remove them. Limitations include short tracer half-life which can make scheduling the SLNB difficult, and radiation dose to patients and healthcare workers. Alternatively, magnetic localization, with superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) as the tracer and a magnetometer to detect SPIONs in the SLN during surgery can be used, however, this lacks pre-operative imaging.

Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI) is a new imaging modality that directly detects SPIONs, holding potential for pre-operative imaging in magnetic SLNB. SPIONs for SLNB should have rapid drainage, high SLN accumulation, and high specificity to the SLN. For MPI Lymphography (MPIL), high particle sensitivity is also important. This study assesses the in vivo pharmacokinetics for SLN mapping with MPIL in a murine model, using five commercially available SPIONs of varying iron core sizes and surface coatings. We show that some SPIONs provide higher MPI signal at the SLN and show the potential to detect higher echelon nodes (HENs). PEGylation of SPIONs and mannose targeted SPIONs increase clearance from the injection site and the mannose targeted SPION reduces flow to HENs."
"Voltage-gated Ca{superscript 2} channels (VGCCs) are regulated by four CaV{beta} subunits (CaV{beta}1-CaV{beta}4), each showing specific expression patterns in excitable cells. While primarily known for regulating VGCC function, CaV{beta} proteins also have channel-independent roles, including gene expression modulation. Among these, CaV{beta}1 is expressed in skeletal muscle as multiple isoforms. The adult isoform, CaV{beta}1D, localizes at the triad and modulates CaV1 activity during Excitation-Contraction Coupling (ECC). In this study, we investigated the lesser-known embryonic/perinatal CaV{beta}1 isoforms and their roles in neuromuscular junction (NMJ) formation, maturation, and maintenance. We found that CaV{beta}1 isoform expression is developmentally regulated through differential promoter activation. Specifically, CaV{beta}1A is expressed in embryonic muscle and reactivated in denervated adult muscle, alongside the known CaV{beta}1E isoform. Nerve injury in adult muscle triggers a shift in promoter usage, resulting in re-expression of embryonic/perinatal Cacnb1A and Cacnb1E transcripts. Functional analyses using aneural agrin-induced AChR clustering on primary myotubes demonstrated that these isoforms contribute to NMJ formation. Additionally, their expression during early postnatal development is essential for NMJ maturation and long-term maintenance. These findings reveal previously unrecognized roles of CaV{beta}1 isoforms beyond VGCC regulation, highlighting their significance in neuromuscular system development and homeostasis."
"O_LIPhylogenetic distance is a key measure used to develop species lists for host specificity tests that delimit the fundamental and realised host range of candidate weed biocontrol agents to meet the assumptions of the centrifugal phylogenetic method. Plant pathogens and insects, even those with broad host ranges, exhibit some degree of phylogenetic conservatism in their host plant associations. Thorough host-specificity testing is crucial to minimise the risk of off-target damage by biocontrol agents to native and economically important plant species. To facilitate this, host test lists need to be developed from an understanding of evolutionary relationships, usually visualised as a phylogenetic tree generated from genetic data, together with plant functional traits and geospatial information. Currently, the process of obtaining a host test list is not standardised, and the manual steps are time-consuming and challenging.
C_LIO_LIWe introduce a user-friendly visualisation tool called PhyloControl to aid researchers in their decision-making during biocontrol risk analysis. PhyloControl integrates taxonomic data, molecular data, spatial data, and plant traits in an intuitive interactive interface, empowering biocontrol practitioners to summarise, visualise and analyse data efficiently.
C_LIO_LIComprehensively sampled phylogenetic trees are often unavailable, and older published phylogenies often lack branch resolution and support, which increases uncertainty. PhyloControl includes a workflow implemented through Quarto notebooks in R that allows users to download publicly available DNA sequences and perform phylogenetic analyses. The modular workflow also incorporates species distribution modelling to predict the current and potential extent of target weed species.
C_LIO_LIPhyloControl will streamline the development of biocontrol host tests lists to support risk analysis and decision making in classical weed biological control.

"Color provides an important dimension for object detection and classification. In most animals, color- and motion-vision are largely separated throughout early stages of visual processing. However, accumulating evidence indicates crosstalk between chromatic and achromatic pathways. Here we investigate the spectral sensitivity of the butterfly motion-vision pathway at the level of pre-motor descending neurons (DNs), which connect the brain to thoracic motor centres. Butterflies engage in fast agile flight within often-colorful visual ecologies, which may heighten evolutionary pressure to integrate color- and motion-vision. Indeed, we observed a separation of spectral sensitivities that matches the functional properties of butterfly DNs, such that wide-field optic flow-sensitive DNs involved in stabilisation reflexes have effectively broadband spectral responses, whilst target-selective DNs involved in target-tracking are comparatively narrowband and match conspecific wing coloration. Our findings demonstrate an integration of color- and motion-vision within a pre-motor neuronal bottleneck that controls behavior."
"Attachment theory offers an important clinical framework for understanding and treating negative effects of early life adversity. Attachment styles emerge during critical periods of development in response to caregivers ability to consistently meet their offsprings needs. Attachment styles are classified as secure or insecure (anxious, avoidant, or disorganized), with rates of insecure attachment rising in high-risk populations and correlating with a plethora of negative health outcomes throughout life. Despite its importance, little is known about the neural basis of attachment. Work in rats has demonstrated that limited bedding and nesting (LB) impairs maternal care and produces abnormal maternal attachment linked to increased pup corticosterone. However, the effects of LB on attachment-like behavior have not been investigated in mice where additional genetic and molecular tools are available. Furthermore, no group has utilized home-cage monitoring to link abnormal maternal care with deficits in attachment-like behavior. Using home-cage monitoring, we confirmed a robust increase in maternal fragmentation among LB dams. Abnormal maternal care was correlated with elevated corticosterone levels on post-natal day seven (P7) and a stunted growth trajectory that persisted later in life. LB did not alter maternal buffering at P8 or maternal preference at P18, indicating that certain attachment-like behaviors remain unaffected despite exposure to high levels of erratic maternal care. However, LB pups vocalized less in response to maternal separation at P8, did not readily approach their dam at P13, and exhibited higher anxiety-like behavior at P18, suggesting that LB induces avoidant-like attachment deficits in mice.

Significance StatementThe impoverished conditions of limited bedding and nesting (LB) cause erratic maternal care and elevated corticosterone levels in rat and mouse pups. The increase in corticosterone levels causes attachment-like deficits in rat pups; however, it remains unclear whether similar deficits are observed in mice, where additional genomic and molecular tools are available. Using continuous home-cage monitoring, we confirmed a substantial increase in erratic maternal care and elevated corticosterone levels in 7-day-old mouse pups. LB mouse pups exhibited attachment-like deficits in some, but not all, tests, underscoring the robustness of this evolutionarily conserved bond. Despite some similarities, the attachment abnormalities observed in mice differed from previous reports in rats, paving the way for in-depth mechanistic studies in mice."
"Deciphering how neural populations encode, integrate, and dynamically transform information to generate predictive neural dynamics remains a fundamental pursuit in systems neuroscience. Although information is processed and represented across distributed neural ensembles, a critical question remains: How do these populations accumulate information and interact over time to form stable, coherent representations? The cortex comprises ensembles of interacting populations that cooperate to enable thought. However, an open challenge is to map how each population evolves its internal context in response to incoming information and crucially, how this evolving context shapes what each population communicates to other populations. To address this, we employ a customized variant of the Graph Echo State Network (Graph ESN) architecture that involves specialized populations. This formulation enables the model to disentangle and represent multi-scale oscillatory patterns in neural data, offering a more biologically plausible and task-relevant alternative to traditional ESNs. By leveraging the rich hidden-state dynamics of this architecture, we illustrate how neural ensembles iteratively interact and converge toward stable, temporally evolving representations of information. We further investigate the distinct contributions of individual populations in this collaborative process of representational stabilization. Mapping this temporally unfolding, cooperative structure sheds light on the neural mechanisms underlying distributed representation and inter-population coordination--processes that may ultimately support organized cognition."
"Cues such as fast-food advertisements associated with food can provoke food cravings which may lead to unhealthy overeating. To effectively control such cravings, we need to better understand the factors that reduce food cue reactivity and reveal corresponding  anti-craving brain mechanisms. We previously reported that access to environmental enrichment (EE) that provides cognitive and physical stimulation in mice reduced cue-evoked sucrose seeking and prelimbic cortex (PL) neuronal reactivity.

To date, the phenotype of PL neurons that undergo EE-induced adaptations has not been fully elucidated. Therefore, we used brain slice electrophysiology to investigate how EE modulated intrinsic excitability in the general population of PL interneurons and pyramidal cells. Additionally, we used retrograde tracing and the neuronal activity marker  Fos to investigate how EE modulated cue-evoked recruitment of pyramidal cells projecting to the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) and nucleus accumbens core (NAc).

Before the cue-evoked sucrose seeking test, EE enhanced the general, baseline excitability of inhibitory interneurons, but not pyramidal cells, thereby promoting inhibitory  overdrive. During cue-evoked sucrose seeking, EE suppressed recruitment of PVT-, but not NAc-projecting, neurons thereby selectively promoting corticothalamic, but not corticoaccumbens, excitatory  underdrive. Collectively, we further illuminate EEs  anti-food seeking actions whereby EE promotes both cell type-specific (inhibitory interneuron  overdrive) and circuit-specific (excitatory corticothalamic  underdrive) neuroadaptations in the PL."
"Plumage pigmentation plays critical roles in survival and reproductive success in birds, from providing camouflage and thermoregulation to mediating elaborate mating displays. The genetic and developmental origins of diverse plumage pigmentation patterns remain incompletely understood in part due to limited intraspecific variation and high levels of genetic divergence between distantly related species. Domestic avian species are more tractable models for understanding the genetic architecture of plumage pigmentation, but the relevance of domestic phenotypes to plumage patterns observed in the wild is not clear. Here, we used comparative genomic approaches to examine coding variation in EDNRB2, a candidate gene associated with loss of plumage melanin in several species, in representative genomes from a diverse array of wild and domestic birds. We found widespread coding variation in EDNRB2 and in other pigmentation genes with limited pleiotropic roles in development. We also found that EDNRB2- mediated melanin loss may play a critical role in establishing bright non-melanin plumage colors. This work highlights EDNRB2 as a key candidate gene for mediating the development of both interspecific and intraspecific plumage variation and demonstrates the applicability of findings in domestic species to understanding avian plumage patterning more broadly."
"GBA1 is a risk gene for multiple neurodegenerative diseases, including Lewy Body Dementia and Parkinsons disease, and biallelic pathogenic variants in the gene result in the lysosomal storage disorder Gaucher disease. GBA1 encodes the enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase), and alterations in the gene result in reduced enzymatic activity, which affects lysosome function downstream. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are a useful tool for testing the functional consequences of gene variants in an isogenic setting. Additionally, they can be used to perform multiomic studies to explore biological effects independent of disease mechanisms. Using CRISPR-edited isogenic KOLF2.1J iPSC lines containing pathogenic GBA1 variants D409H (p.D448H), D409V (p.D448V) and GBA1 knockout line generated by the iPSC Neurodegenerative Disease Initiative (iNDI), we examined potential molecular mechanisms and downstream consequences of GCase reduction. In this study, we confirm that this isogenic series behaves as expected for loss of function variants, despite the known difficulties with GBA1 editing. We identified that there are limited overlapping results across cell types suggesting potential different downstream effects caused by GBA1 variants. Additionally, we note that RNA-based quantitation may not be the best method to characterize GCase mechanisms, but protein and metabolomic analyses may be used to evaluate differences across genotypes."
"MINFLUX fluorescence microscopy is a recently introduced super-resolution approach for studying cellular structures and their dynamics with highest detail. Iterative MINFLUX (iMFX) performs Single Particle Tracking (SPT) at runtime. The ad hoc signal interpretation necessary to sustain the method relies on several parameters, which need to be optimized in relation to the sample under study, such as fluorescent lipid analogues in membranes, to ensure the fidelity of the measurement. We propose a parameter optimization strategy, an overview of the most important parameters, present a theoretical upper limit for trackable diffusion rates, and demonstrate iMFX-enabled SPT of fast ([&lt;]DMSD[&gt;] = 2.5m2/s) lateral Brownian motion of lipids in membranes."
"In multicellular organisms, germ cells transformation into haploid gametes requires that they transition from mitosis to meiosis, whereby they stop mitotic cycling and enter the meiotic cell cycle. In mammals, transcriptional activator STRA8-MEIOSIN mediates the decision to enter the meiotic cell cycle by triggering the G1-to-meiotic S phase transition. However, the molecular basis by which mammalian germ cells prevent continued mitotic cycling before entering the meiotic cell cycle remains unclear. Here, we investigate MEIOCs role in the mitosis-to-meiosis transition during mouse oogenesis by analyzing proliferation, cell cycle transcriptomics, and cell cycle-associated protein expression. MEIOC was previously shown to destabilize mRNA and repress the mitotic program after meiotic entry. Here, we demonstrate that MEIOC prevents continued mitotic cycling prior to meiotic entry in oogenic cells. We find that the mitosis-to-meiosis transition involves the repression of G1/S cyclin CCNA2 at the transcript and protein levels, and that MEIOC downregulates CCNA2 protein expression. In addition, MEIOC promotes entry into meiotic S phase by increasing Meiosin transcript abundance and consequently activating the STRA8-MEIOSIN transcription factor. Given that STRA8- MEIOSIN upregulates Meioc expression, MEIOC and STRA8-MEIOSIN form a positive feedback loop to reinforce timely meiotic initiation. We also demonstrate that BMP signaling halts mitotic cycling and promotes meiotic entry by upregulating MEIOC. We conclude that, in mouse oogenic cells, the transition from mitosis to meiosis occurs as two molecularly regulated steps- (i) halt of mitotic cycling and (ii) entry into the meiotic cell cycle - and that MEIOC modifies the cell cycle program to facilitate both steps in this transition."
"Knowledge about protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is crucial for our understanding of cellular functions. An important contribution to these comes from experimental high-throughput techniques such as yeast two-hybrid (Y2H), which provide evidence for direct, binary PPIs. Consequently, although protein function often emerges from interactions within multi-protein assemblies, most PPI networks focus on binary relationships. Higher-order motifs, such as protein triplets, can reflect cooperative or competitive binding events crucial for cellular function. However, distinguishing these interaction types systematically from a network of binary PPIs remains challenging. To address this issue, we present a computational framework to predict cooperative and competitive interactions among protein triplets in the human Protein Interaction Network (hPIN). By embedding the hPIN into two-dimensional hyperbolic space using the LaBNE+HM algorithm, we extracted latent geometric coordinates for each protein. Combined with topological features and biological annotations, these were used to train a Random Forest classifier on structurally validated triplets from Interactome3D. Our model achieved strong performance (AUC = 0.88), identifying angular and hyperbolic distances as two of the most predictive features. Cooperative triplets were characterized by longer common proteins and a lower frequency of paralogous partners, indicating distinct structural and evolutionary features compared to competitive cases. Structural evaluation using AlphaFold 3 confirmed that cooperative triplets exhibit distinct binding sites, whereas competitive ones share overlapping interfaces. Hyperbolic embeddings, in combination with machine learning, offer a powerful approach to characterize higher-order interaction motifs in protein networks. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into the organization of protein complexes and a predictive framework to support future studies in network biology."
"Ferns are crucial to ecosystem functioning and biodiversity conservation, yet there is a significant gap in comprehensive data regarding its diversity and distribution in Amurum forest reserve. This research unveils the distribution and diversity of ferns in Amurum forest reserve. Systematically, 20 plots of 10 m x 10 m were established in the study sites with each plot 50 m away from each other and three sub-quadrants were established in every 10 m x10 m plots making a total of 60 sub-quadrants. Ferns species within reach were counted, photographed, recorded and identified. Coordinates of each plot were recorded using GPS (Global Positioning System). Seven species belonging to five families were recorded in the study sites with a Shannon-Weiner diversity Index of 0.6325. Nephrolepis undulate was the most abundant ferns species. All fern species recorded in this study were found and distributed only in the gallery forest of the Amurum forest reserve and not the other habitat types. The study has revealed a rich and varied fern flora during early rainy season, with significant ecological and conservation value in Amurum forest reserve. The study underscores the importance of preserving fern-rich habitats, particularly in the face of environmental change. By collaborating with conservation authorities and conducting further research, we can better understand and protect these ancient plants, ensuring their continued contribution to the regions biodiversity."
"Cell-surface conjugation has enormous therapeutic and research potential. Existing technologies for cell-surface modification are usually reversible, non-specific, or rely on genetic editing of target cells. Here we present the NanoBondy, a nanobody modified for covalent ligation to an endogenous protein target at the cell-surface. The NanoBondy utilizes the 20 naturally occurring amino acids, harnessing NeissLock chemistry engineered from Neisseria meningitidis. We evaluated binding and specificity of a panel of nanobodies to CD45, a long-lived surface marker of nucleated hematopoietic cells. We demonstrated conversion of existing nanobodies to covalently reacting NanoBondies using a disulfide clamp to position the self-processing module of FrpA close to the nanobody antigen-binding site. Addition of calcium induces anhydride formation at the NanoBondy C-terminus and proximity-directed ligation to surface amines on CD45. We optimized NanoBondy reaction by fine-tuning linkers and disulfide clamp sites to modulate anhydride positioning. Tandem mass spectrometry mapped reaction sites between the NanoBondy and CD45. NanoBondy ligation was robust to buffer, pH and temperature and was detected within 2 minutes. We established reaction specificity of NanoBondies to endogenous CD45 at the surface of NK cells and T cells. NanoBondy technology provides a modular approach for targeted, inducible and covalent cell-surface modification of immune cells."
"Defects in brain endothelial cells (brainECs) can cause severe cerebrovascular malformations, including arteriovenous malformation (AVM) and cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM). The lack of appropriate tools for cerebrovascular disease modeling and local genetic manipulation of the brain vasculature hinders research on cerebrovascular malformations. Here we develop a recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) tool miniBEND (rAAV-based mini-system for brain endothelial cells, rAAV-miniBEND), which combines a minimal promoter and an optimized cis-acting element (cis-element) isolated from the mouse gene Tek. This system achieves gene expression specifically in mouse and rat brainECs. Using rAAV-miniBEND, we achieve high-efficiency and high-specificity gene expression in brainECs through intracranial injection at various developmental stages and through intravenous administration at all postnatal stages in mice. Furthermore, we use rAAV-miniBEND to model sporadic CCMs mediated by MAP3K3I441M and AVMs mediated by BrafV600E. We demonstrate that somatic expression of BrafV600E in brainECs induces an AVM phenotype, and that brainEC proliferation are important for AVM development. Thus, our rAAV-miniBEND system provides a valuable and widely applicable tool for cerebrovascular disease modeling and local or global brainEC gene delivery."
"{Delta}Np63 is a master regulator of epithelial development, driving the expansion of progenitor cells in stratified epithelia. Mutations in {Delta}Np63 are linked to squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) and basal cell carcinomas (BCCs), as well as to ectodermal dysplasia syndromes such as ectrodactyly-ectodermal dysplasia-clefting (EEC) and ankyloblepharon-ectodermal dysplasia-clefting (AEC). Although {Delta}Np63 functions as a nuclear transcription factor, the mechanisms underlying its nuclear import remain incompletely understood. By combining imaging, biochemical, structural and functional assays, we have thoroughly characterized {Delta}Np63 nuclear import, as mediated by the importin (IMP) /{beta}1 heterodimer. We also show here that {Delta}Np63 has evolved a peculiar strategy to ensure mutation tolerant nuclear localization, which is essential for DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. Despite a canonical bipartite NLS formed by two stretches of basic amino acids was identified between the DNA binding and oligomerization domains, each of them in sufficient to bind both IMP binding sites upon homodimerization. Therefore, in contrast to most known bipartite NLSs, only simultaneous substitution of both basic stretches of amino acids ablated nuclear localization, interaction with IMP, and decreased transcriptional activity. Since several {Delta}Np63 isoforms which lack the N-terminal basic stretch of amino acids have been described, and a number of mutations in the {Delta}Np63 NLS region have been identified in the Genome Aggregation Database, {Delta}Np63 has specifically evolved to tolerate mutations in its NLS without significantly compromising its ability to localize in the nucleus.

"This study investigated the role of mitochondrial function in aortic aging. As the aorta ages, it becomes stiffer and less compliant, increasing the risk of aneurysmal disease, hypertension, and diastolic dysfunction. Given the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in non-age related aortopathies and as a hallmark of aging, we investigated its contribution to the aging aorta. Both male and female young (5-6 month) and aged (24-25 month) C57Bl/6J mice received mitochondrial-targeted peptide elamipretide (ELAM; SS-31) for 8 weeks. ELAM restored complex II-linked respiration in aged mice to values seen in young mice, while also improving relative phosphorylative flux. ELAM treatment also reduced inflammatory MMP9 expression and elastin breaks in aged mice. Bulk RNAseq analysis revealed that ELAM treatment significantly affected the aortic transcriptome in an age-dependent manner, reducing the expression of senescent and associated pro-inflammatory genes. Mitochondrial dysfunction thus drives aortic aging and is a potential therapeutic target for future study.

TeaserLoss of mitochondrial function with age drives degeneration of the aging aorta, and thus is a potential target for therapy."
"The Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC) plays critical roles in regulating mitotic fidelity and progression. Here, we utilized a SAC-deficient cell line lacking the full-length Cdc20 translational protein isoform (Cdc20 {Delta}FL) to define its differential genetic interactions using CRISPR/Cas9-based gene targeting. Cdc20 {Delta}FL cells display synthetic lethal relationships with gene targets required for proper chromosome segregation, highlighting the critical role of the SAC in error surveillance. Surprisingly, we found that the checkpoint component Mad2 becomes dispensable for viability in Cdc20 {Delta}FL cells. Prior work suggested that Mad2 acts as an essential mitotic ""timer"" to control mitotic duration in unperturbed cells. Instead, our functional analysis indicates that the mitotic timer depends on the interdependent and overlapping actions of: (1) Mad2 inhibition of APC/C-Cdc20, (2) Cdk1-mediated phosphorylation of Cdc20, and (3) total Cdc20 protein levels. Simultaneously perturbing these pathways results in near immediate mitotic exit and catastrophic chromosome mis-segregation."
"The broadly conserved ParB protein performs crucial functions in bacterial chromosome segregation and replication regulation. The cellular function of ParB requires it to dimerize, recognize parS DNA sequences, clamp on DNA, then slide to adjacent sequences through nonspecific DNA binding. How ParB coordinates nonspecific DNA binding and sliding remains elusive. Here, we combine multiple in vitro biophysical and computational tools and in vivo approaches to address this question. We found that the five conserved lysine residues in the C-terminal domain of ParB play distinct roles in proper positioning and sliding on DNA, and their integrity is crucial for ParBs in vivo functions. Many proteins with diverse cellular activities need to move on DNA while loosely bound. Our findings reveal the detailed molecular mechanism by which multiple flexible basic residues enable DNA binding proteins to efficiently slide along DNA."
"Immune checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized cancer therapy, yet their efficacy is frequently limited by primary and acquired resistance. This underscores the need for novel immune regulatory targets that can improve or broaden patient responsiveness to immunotherapy. Among these, immunoglobulin (Ig) domain-containing proteins play central roles in immune signaling and tumor immune evasion, but many remain underexplored as therapeutic targets. Although recent advances in RNA sequencing, single-cell technologies, and multi-omics have expanded our understanding of gene and protein expression, integrating these data into actionable therapeutic insights remains a major challenge.

Recent developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly in natural language processing and large language models (LLMs), offer a promising solution. Models such as GPT-4o, Llama 3.1-8B, and Gemini 1.5 Flash have demonstrated exceptional reasoning capabilities in biomedical applications. However, their use in immunotherapy biomarker discovery has yet to be fully realized.

In this study, we introduce a novel AI-based framework that employs a multi-LLM approach to systematically identify and prioritize candidate biomarkers from a curated set of Ig-domain-containing genes. By integrating multi-omics data with structured prompt engineering and comparative model reasoning, our platform enhances the robustness, reproducibility, and interpretability of gene selection while minimizing bias inherent to single-model predictions. To our knowledge, this is the first study to apply a multi-LLM strategy to immunotherapy biomarker discovery. Our findings support the broader utility of LLMs in precision oncology and highlight their potential to accelerate the identification of novel, clinically actionable targets."
"We present a correlated light and electron microscopy (CLEM) dataset from a 7-day-old larval zebrafish, integrating confocal imaging of genetically labeled excitatory (vglut2a) and inhibitory (gad1b) neurons with nanometer-resolution serial section EM. The dataset spans the brain and anterior spinal cord, capturing >180,000 segmented soma, >40,000 molecularly annotated neurons, and 30 million synapses, most of which were classified as excitatory, inhibitory, or modulatory. To characterize the directional flow of activity across the brain, we leverage the synaptic and cell body annotations to compute region-wise input and output drive indices at single cell resolution. We illustrate the datasets utility by dissecting and validating circuits in three distinct systems: water flow direction encoding in the lateral line, recurrent excitation and contralateral inhibition in a hindbrain motion integrator, and functionally relevant targeted long-range projections from a tegmental excitatory nucleus, demonstrating that this resource enables rigorous hypothesis testing as well as exploratory-driven circuit analysis. The dataset is integrated into an open-access platform optimized to facilitate community reconstruction and discovery efforts throughout the larval zebrafish brain."
"Bladder pain significantly impacts millions worldwide, severely affecting their quality of life and posing a major clinical challenge. Understanding the mechanisms underlying persistent bladder pain is critical for developing better therapeutic strategies. In this study, we investigate the effects of cyclophosphamide (CYP)-induced persistent bladder sensitization to explore the lateralized contribution of amygdala calcitonin gene-related peptide receptors (CGRP-Rs) on pain-like changes in mice. We demonstrate that CYP induces hypersensitivity lasting up to 14 days post-injury (DPI) in the urinary bladder distention assay and up to 21 DPI when assessing abdominal mechanical sensitivity. Despite persistent pain-like changes, no significant bladder histological changes were observed. Based on previous findings that CGRP signaling from the parabrachial nucleus contributes to central amygdala (CeA) lateralization, we hypothesized that CGRP-Rs play a key role in driving visceral bladder pain-related hemispherical differences. We show that inhibiting CGRP-R activity with the antagonist CGRP8-37, in the right CeA attenuates bladder pain-like behavior, whereas left CeA inhibition sustains CYP-induced hypersensitivity. Electrophysiological recordings revealed increased firing frequency in CGRP-R positive cells in the right CeA 7 DPI. In vivo single photon calcium imaging demonstrated increased Ca transients in CGRP-R-positive cells in the right CeA, upon the presentation of a stimulus at 0 DPI, and overall at 2DPI, further confirming the pronociceptive role of CGRP-Rs in the right CeA. Taken together, these findings provide a crucial foundation for understanding pain-induced CeA lateralization and for further studies identifying how targeting CGRP signaling could provide bladder pain relief."
"Membraneless organelles (MLOs) formed by liquid-liquid phase separation contribute to intracellular compartmentalization of specific biological functions. The dynamic regulation of MLOs is critical for RNA metabolism, stress response, and signal transduction. While the number and size of MLOs serve as valuable indicators of cellular states, leveraging their spatial distribution and diverse quantitative characteristics to infer cellular conditions has posed significant challenges. Here, we present processing body (PB)-scope: an unsupervised deep learning-based framework designed for imaging-based phenotypic screening of PB, one representative MLO. The model was trained on a substantial dataset comprising over 400,000 single-cell confocal microscopy images from a colon cancer cell line treated with 280 compounds. PB-scope enabled precise drug classification based on their effects on PB characteristics, including number and size. This artificial intelligence framework offers insights previously obscured by the dynamic and subtle nature of PBs. Notably, PB-scope identified drugs with a shared function in the JAK signaling pathway, a previously unrecognized regulator of PB dynamics. PB-scope holds the potential for adapting to the study of other MLOs, offering broad applicability in this emerging field of cell biology."
"Previous studies of the tight junction protein occludin (OCLN) suggest that multiple phosphorylation sites on the carboxy-terminal domain contribute a regulatory role in vascular barrier properties. However, gene deletion studies failed to identify a clear functional role for OCLN, despite multiple phenotypic alterations. Importantly, previous studies targeting exon 3 allowed expression of a splice variant starting at exon 4, (isoform 4) that expresses the full carboxy-terminal tail. Here we show that the OCLN carboxy-terminus forms a complex with the light intermediate chain (LIC) of dynein to link tight junction cargo to the minus end directed motor protein. Mutational analysis revealed S471 phosphorylation is required for binding to the LIC while S490 phosphorylation is required for trafficking. Expressing OCLN S490A mutant prevented endothelial cell proliferation and collateral angiogenesis. OCLN gene deletion targeting exon 5, preventing full length and isoform 4 expression, resulted in embryonic lethality. In summary, OCLN links tight junction cargo to the dynein motor, regulating trafficking in a phosphorylation dependent manner and contributing to both VEGF-induced vascular permeability and collateral angiogenesis."
"Advances in spatiotemporal single-cell imaging have enabled detailed observations of cell population dynamics and intercellular interactions. However, translating these rich data sets into mechanistic insight remains a significant challenge. Agent-based models (ABMs) are a bottomup computational framework for investigating the emergent behavior of cell populations that can arise from rules defining the interactions between individual neighboring cells, while topological data analysis (TDA) provides robust descriptors of spatial organization. We present TOPAZ (TOpologically-based Parameter inference for Agent-based model optimiZation), a computational pipeline that integrates TDA with approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) and Bayesian model selection to identify biologically plausible ABMs from spatiotemporal cellular data. TOPAZ uses persistent homology to quantify spatial features of cell trajectories and combines this topological information with parameter inference via ABC and model comparison using the Bayesian Information Criterion. We validate TOPAZ using simulations of collective fibroblast movement, demonstrating its ability to accurately recover model parameters and distinguish between a baseline ABM and an extended model that incorporates alignment interactions. Our results and open-source code demonstrate the utility of TOPAZ as a generalizable framework for mechanistic inference and model discrimination in spatial single-cell analysis."
"Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors are widely used for in vivo gene therapy, but their clinical effectiveness and scalable production remain limited by gaps in our understanding of AAV biology. In particular, the host-virus interactions that regulate AAV gene expression and replication are not fully defined, yet they hold key insights for engineering improved recombinant AAV (rAAV) vectors. Here, we identify the PP4:SMEK1/2 phosphatase complex as a host restriction factor that suppresses wildtype AAV replication. Active replication and Rep expression correlates with hyperphosphorylation of KAP1S824 and RPA2S4/8/33, known PP4 substrates. Rep proteins directly bind the HEAT/Arm domain of the SMEK1 regulatory subunit of PP4. We further reveal that the KAP1:SMEK1 interaction is mediated by a MAPP short linear motif (SLiM) that interacts with the substrate recruitment groove of the SMEK1 EVH1 domain. Rep68 disrupts this interaction and interferes with substrate recruitment by the PP4:SMEK1/2 complex, leading to substrate hyperphosphorylation. We also uncover a multifunctional complex containing PP4:SMEK1 and PP1:NIPP1, both implicated in KAP1S824 dephosphorylation. Together, these findings reveal a substrate-recruitment interference mechanism by which AAV Rep proteins inhibit host phosphatase activity. This mechanistic insight provides a blueprint for enhancing rAAV vector potency and production in gene therapy applications."
"Iron deficiency is a globally prevalent nutritional disorder with significant socio-medical impacts, yet the mechanisms by which different cell types adapt to iron restriction remain poorly understood. Splenic red pulp macrophages (RPMs) manage the highest iron flux in the body by recycling aged red blood cells (RBCs) through erythrophagocytosis. In this study, we investigated the adaptive mechanisms employed by RPMs under systemic iron deficiency. We found that RPMs from mildly anemic, dietary iron-deficient (ID) mice exhibit a surprising enhancement in erythrophagocytic capacity, accompanied by elevated cytoplasmic labile iron levels, reduced iron stores, and increased iron-export capacity via ferroportin (FPN). Proteomic profiling, validated by flow cytometry, revealed increased mass and activity of both lysosomes and mitochondria in RPMs from ID mice, along with upregulated expression of apoptotic cell receptors. Further assays identified a marked increase in mitochondrial respiration in ID RPMs, a unique response that contrasts with prior reports of impaired mitochondrial function in iron-deficient cells. These responses occurred independently of classical M2 polarization markers. Using both in vivo and cellular models, we identified the low hepcidin-high FPN axis as a key driver of the phagocytic and metabolic rewiring in RPMs. Additionally, calcium signaling emerged as a likely mediator of this axis. Pharmacological inhibition of calcium signaling effectors pinpointed SYK kinase as a molecular switch governing the high-FPN-induced functional reprogramming of macrophages. Short-term SYK inhibition reduced the enhanced erythrophagocytic function of RPMs during iron deficiency, impairing iron utilization for extramedullary splenic erythropoiesis. Together, our findings highlight metabolic reprogramming in RPMs as a strategic adaptation that optimizes their iron recycling and utilization capacity in response to systemic iron scarcity."
"Lipids are integral to ion channel function yet delineating mechanisms by which they affect function remains challenging. Within the K2P family of leak potassium channels1-3, observation of tubular densities interpreted as alkyl chains occupying lateral fenestrations linking the pore and bilayer4-8 raised the possibility that lipid access from the bilayer acts as a regulatory mechanism4-7. Here, we present cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of the human leak potassium channel K2P6.1 (TWIK2)9-11 and mutants in nanodisc and detergent environments that reveal an unusual conformation in the first selectivity filter (SF1) and a pair of two-chain lipids within the channel cavity (denoted the  lipid plug). The chains of each plug lipid occupy separate binding sites that laterally extend to the bilayer from the channel cavity. One, the upper leg, matches the previously identified alkyl chain binding site4-8,12. The second, the lower leg, occupies a fenestration common with K2P1.1 (TWIK1)13. Together, they demonstrate a bidentate means to coordinate each plug lipid that offers a reinterpretation of previous observations. Structures of a K2P6.1 (TWIK2) mutant that directs the channel to the plasma membrane14 and an R257A mutant that increases function yield plugged and unplugged forms. Notably, the R257A plugged form shows a change in lipid plug position, indicating a key role for this residue in lipid binding. Together, our data suggest that occupation of the central cavity by the lipid plug serves as a mechanism to render the TWIK channels inactive and points to the importance of lipid plug removal to create an ion permeable pore. Such a mechanism could provide a potent way for limiting the leak function of K2Ps based on cellular location or other contextual factors."
"Cep104 is a conserved protein essential for centriole and cilia function, with mutations linked to Joubert Syndrome. We investigated its role in Xenopus embryonic development, revealing that Cep104 is crucial for neural tube closure (NTC) through regulating apical constriction. We show that the role of Cep104 in cilia and hedgehog signaling cannot alone explain the elicited defects. We go on to show that Cep104 localizes to the ends of cytoplasmic microtubules, influencing their stability. Downregulation of CEP104 led to microtubule instability and defects in multiciliated cell intercalation, a process dependent on stable microtubules. Our findings demonstrate that Cep104 functions beyond cilia, playing a significant role in cytoplasmic microtubule dynamics, suggesting that both ciliary and non-ciliary roles are important for neurodevelopment and the pathogenesis of ciliopathies."

"Members of the evolutionarily conserved homeodomain-interacting protein kinase (Hipk) family play a critical role in regulating essential signalling pathways involved in growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. While vertebrates have multiple hipk genes, Drosophila contains a single hipk ortholog, what facilitates functional analysis. We find that hipk is necessary for the stabilization of the initiator caspase Dronc, thus enhancing the two Dronc activities in apoptotic scenarios: the induction of the caspase cascade, and the reinforcement of JNK signalling pathway. Conversely, our data suggest that Dronc also raises the expression levels of Hipk, thereby reinforcing the apoptotic response. These findings significantly enhance our understanding of caspase regulation and position Hipk as a promising target for modulating caspase activity in a variety of biological contexts."
"The oscillatory movements of the pinnae in constant-frequency (CF) bats have long been documented, yet their role in actively transforming echo signals has remained underexplored. Inspired by Perrines foundational description of Doppler effects in oscillating receivers, I hypothesised that bat ear oscillations could serve as dynamic signal modulators, introducing time-varying Doppler shifts to received echoes. I tested this hypothesis using both computational simulations and controlled experiments. In the simulations, each ear was modelled as an angularly oscillating structure receiving echoes from a CF pulse, with motion parameters systematically varied across frequency (5-50 Hz) and excursion angle (15-45{degrees}). The received echoes were synthesised as composite signals comprising delayed, Doppler-shifted components based on instantaneous ear segment velocities. Results showed pronounced spectral broadening, instantaneous frequency fluctuations, and binaural disparities that scaled with tip velocity. These effects were then validated using a subwoofer-driven oscillating reflector that emulated the ears motion while reflecting a stable 80 kHz tone. Recordings showed consistent bandwidth expansion to over 1.2 kHz at 30 Hz, with phase warping evident in the time-domain waveforms. These findings confirm that oscillatory motion alone, without source modulation or target motion, can dynamically restructure the spectral and temporal profile of echoes. I argue that in CF bats, such echo transformations represent an active encoding strategy, enabling spatial and temporal contrast enhancement within the auditory fovea. This reconceptualises ear motion not as passive filtering, but as a means of dynamically enriching incoming sensory information."
"Associative conditioning is a fundamental learning paradigm that links salient stimuli to appropriate behavior. The vinegar fly is an important memory model that can associate odors with rewarding or punishing reinforcement stimuli via distinct sets of dopaminergic neurons. While much is known about learning, a crucial question remains: is the simple co-activation of sensory and neuromodulatory dopaminergic neurons sufficient to induce memory formation? To address this, we systematically replaced natural stimuli, namely odor-evoked activity, punishment, and reward signals, with optogenetic activation of corresponding neurons, both individually and in combination. In all cases, including a full-substitution paradigm where both olfactory activity and reinforcement dopamine signals were replaced, optogenetic activation successfully implanted synthetic memories. These findings provide a clear answer: simple coincident, rectangular-pulse sensory and neuromodulatory stimulation can instruct associative memory formation. We conclude that associative memory does not have strict requirements for temporal or ensemble activity patterns in olfactory or dopaminergic neurons that are specific to natural stimuli (e.g. odorants, sugar, or pain); rather, simple coincidence is an effective driver of memory inception. These findings open new avenues for manipulating and studying memory formation with all-optical control."
"Associative learning models have traditionally simplified contingency learning by relying on binary classification of cues and outcomes, such as administering a medical treatment (or not) and observing whether the patient recovered (or not). While successful in capturing fundamental learning phenomena across human and animal studies, these models are not capable of representing variability in human experiences that are common in many real-world contexts. Indeed, where variation in outcome magnitude exists (e.g., severity of illness in a medical scenario), this class of models are, at best, approximate the outcome mean with no ability to represent the underlying distribution of values. In this paper, we introduce one approach to incorporating a distributed architecture into a prediction error learning model that tracks the contingency between cues and dimensional outcomes. Our Distributed Model allows associative links to form between the cue and outcome nodes that provide distributed representation depending on the magnitude of the outcome, thus enabling learning that extends beyond approximating the mean. Comparing the Distributed Model against a Simple Delta Model across four contingency learning experiments, we found that the Distributed Model provides significantly better fit to empirical data in virtually all participants. These findings suggest human learners rely on a means of encoding outcomes that preserves the continuous nature of experienced events, advancing our understanding of causal inference in complex environments."
"Reinforcement learning (RL) is a normative computational framework to account for reward-based learning. However, widely used RL models, including Q-learning and its variants, fail to capture some key behavioral phenomena observed in animal experiments, particularly the dynamic switch between model-free and model-based control in the two-step task. A fundamental discrepancy is that learning is restricted to experienced outcomes in the models, whereas biological agents may generalize learning to unvisited options based on internal world models, so-called fictive learning. We propose a simple, brain-inspired fictive learning rule and conduct the rodent two-step task to examine whether fictive learning could explain the observed behavior. The learning rule uses a generalized reward prediction error to update both experienced and non-encountered states and actions. The factual prediction error is scaled by the event correlation inferred from the internal model for fictive update. The generalized reward prediction error might be supported by brain-wide dopaminergic broadcasting. Through simulations, we show that this model reproduces key behavioral traits in the two-step task, including stay probabilities and regression analysis, which common RL models fail to explain. Model fitting validates its superior fit over existing alternatives. Furthermore, the model replicates dopaminergic dynamics observed in the same task. This framework bridges normative RL theory and biological learning, offering new insights into adaptive behavior."
"In many laser scan engines, mechanical inertia imposes a tradeoff between mirror diameter (mass) and scan speed (cycle time) and/or scan angle amplitude. Ultimately, this limits the field-of-view and/or scan speed in multiphoton and confocal imaging, laser-based manufacturing, and other applications. To push parameters past this inertia limit, we present a non-inertial (stationary) add-on unit that doubles the scan angle amplitude while preserving both the beam size and cycle time, thus doubling the etendue (optical invariant) and overall system throughput. We demonstrate its use in two-photon calcium imaging of neural activity in living mice. We also adapt the approach to present a phase doubling unit that doubles the maximum range of phase modulators. Finally, we describe further variants including generalizing the approach to Nx scan angle multiplication (N = 2, 3, 4, ...) with diffraction limited performance across a wide scan angle range and over a broad wavelength bandwidth. These non-inertial scan angle multipliers (called Nisam2x, 3x, ...) can expand the capabilities of a range of technologies including imaging, adaptive optics, sensing, marking, and manufacturing."
"Despite a growing interest in Amniotic Epithelial Cell (AEC)-based therapies, the immune responses triggered by AEC transplantation in vivo remain poorly characterized. In particular, how direct exposure to AECs within the central nervous system (CNS) shapes the local immune environment is currently unknown. Herein we describe a novel CNS- specific immunoregulatory pathway induced by intracisternal delivery of human AECs. Local immune responses induced by AECs in the brain led to recruitment of immunosuppressive Arginase 1+ (ARG1+) macrophages and a novel population of myeloid-derived suppressor cells with eosinophilic characteristics, which we term Eo- MDSCs. We further demonstrate that Eo-MDSCs produce Maresin 2 (MaR2), a specialized pro-resolving mediator (SPM) involved in the resolution of inflammation. In a mouse model of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), treatment of established disease with AECs induced immunological responses that resulted in reduced numbers of pathogenic macrophages and T helper (TH)17 cells, increased anti-inflammatory T cell subsets, and enhanced myelin phagocytosis, all of which led to functional recovery. These findings suggest that AEC therapy has the potential to target CNS-intrinsic inflammatory processes in MS, providing a strong rationale for translation into the clinic."
"The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) plays a central role in sensorimotor control, performing visuomotor transformations, supporting planning, and providing visual feedback. However, it is unknown how the neural populations in different PPC areas organize their activity during this process. It has been proposed that PPC activity reflects population-level dynamics rather than distinct subpopulations, raising the question of how the population flexibly reorganize between the two main phases of motor control, planning and execution. To address this question, we analyzed neural dynamics in three PPC areas (PE, PEc, V6A) in the context of a delayed reaching task, applying dimensionality reduction techniques. This approach allows identifying whether activity in each area is organized into independent or partially overlapping dynamics across task phases. We found evidence of area-specific population subspaces, distinct for movement planning and execution. Specifically, the analysis revealed that in PE, which is a predominantly somatomotor area, neural activity occupied nearly orthogonal subspaces between the two phases, suggesting independent dynamics for movement planning and execution. In contrast, in V6A and PEc, which are involved in visuomotor transformations, we identified both shared and exclusive subspaces, indicating a more flexible representation of motor information in these areas. Overall, our findings suggest that parietal circuits combine both separation and sharing of neural representation to support computations during the different movement stages, providing new insights into the role of the PPC in generating flexible motor behavior .

Significance StatementThe posterior parietal cortex (PPC) plays a central role in sensorimotor control. How neural ensembles in the PPC transition from planning to executing goal-directed movements remains poorly understood. Using dimensionality reduction on macaque electrophysiological data from delayed reach tasks, we identify an anteroposterior gradient: posterior visuomotor areas exhibit both overlapping and segregated subspaces for planning and execution, whereas anterior somatomotor regions show predominantly orthogonal dynamics. This organizational gradient reflects persistent posterior encoding of action goals and posture, and more distinct anterior representations of body state across planning and execution. The topographical and functional shift from visuomotor to somatic coding aligns with hierarchical predictive coding accounts of sensorimotor control and advances our understanding of sensorimotor transformations in the PPC."
"BackgroundSlow-wave sleep has been proposed to facilitate the removal of proteins, implicated in neurodegeneration, from the brain. While mechanistic evidence from animal models is accumulating, direct human data on how slow-wave sleep shapes cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteostasis remain limited, constraining our understanding of physiological resilience to neurodegenerative disease.

MethodsTwelve healthy adults (aged 20-40 years) underwent CSF sampling following three controlled sleep conditions in a randomized crossover design; (1) one night of sleep followed by afternoon CSF sampling, (2) one night of sleep followed by morning CSF sampling, and (3) one night of total sleep deprivation followed by morning CSF sampling.

Sleep and wakefulness were verified using polysomnography and actigraphy, with >4-week washout periods between conditions.

Measured CSF biomarkers included Alzheimers disease-related proteins: beta-amyloid isoforms (A{beta}38, A{beta}40, and A{beta}42), total and phosphorylated tau, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and neurofilament light, as well as orexin, albumin (also measured in serum), and osmolality. Differences between conditions were assessed using Friedman tests with Dunns post hoc correction.

ResultsCSF levels of A{beta} and tau tended to be consistently lower after sleep compared with both afternoon sampling and post-sleep deprivation. Concurrently, CSF albumin levels increased after sleep, while neurofilament light and GFAP remained unchanged. Orexin levels rose markedly during sleep deprivation but showed no circadian variation.

ConclusionsThese findings support a model in which slow wave sleep enhances CSF turnover, reducing concentrations of specific proteins, including A{beta} and tau. Understanding how sleep regulates the homeostasis of neurodegeneration-related proteins may inform strategies to mitigate disease progression."
"Coleoid cephalopods (octopuses, squids, and cuttlefish) produce venoms in their posterior salivary glands. Despite venoms importance in cephalopod evolution and ecology, its regulation and secretion processes remain unresolved. Here, we performed multimodal histological profiling and live imaging to map the glandular architecture and innervation patterns across multiple coleoid species. Micro-computed tomography and tetrachrome alongside hematoxylin and eosin stains verified the proposed differentiation of gland tubular structures into (i) secretory tubules - for venom production - and (ii) striated tubules - potentially propelling venom towards the salivary duct. By tracing five neuronal markers, including nicotine acetylcholine receptors and synapsin, we observed dense neural networks intimately associated with localized muscular signals surrounding the tubules. These findings reveal a spatially distinct organization of venom production and release sites and strongly indicating that neuromuscular signals coordinate venom release into the salivary duct. Although the precise neural circuitry remains to be mapped, our results offer novel understanding of venom gland regulation in marine venomous invertebrates.

TeaserVenom producing posterior salivary glands in octopus, squid and cuttlefish underlie neuromuscular control for focal venom release."
"In many animals, primordial germ cells are transiently segregated outside the somatic-cell cluster that forms the embryos body during early embryogenesis. This physical segregation of germline from the soma has been long believed to be crucial for germline development, but the mechanisms controlling this segregation and its developmental significance remain unclear. Here, in Drosophila, we show that somatic gene silencing in the germline is essential for maintaining this segregation. We showed that primordial germ cells (pole cells) lacking the Nanos- and Polar granule component (Pgc)-dependent dual repression mechanism caused misexpression of widespread somatic genes. They formed abnormal cellular protrusions, invaded adjacent somatic epithelium, and intermingled with somatic cells. These mislocalized pole cells ultimately underwent cell death, whereas properly segregated cells survived. Notably, the knockdown of miranda (mira), one of the somatic genes expressed ectopically in the pole cells lacking this repression mechanism, rescued these phenotypes. Our findings provide the first evidence that somatic gene silencing in germline is essential for preserving the physical segregation between germline and soma, highlighting its role in ensuring germline viability during early development."
"This study evaluates the association between ambient temperature exposure during pregnancy and newborn birthweight, using a penalized generalized additive model (GAM) framework with distributed lag non-linear models (DLNM) to identify sensitive windows of exposure. The analysis includes 238 participants from the SHIP study with complete temperature exposure and birthweight data. Weekly maximum temperatures during pregnancy were estimated using Daymet data, and the impact of temperature on birthweight was assessed, adjusting for maternal age, pre-pregnancy BMI, gestational age, race, smoking, diabetes status, and infant biological sex. The model incorporated a crossbasis function for temperature exposure across 42 gestational weeks and allowed penalization for smoother, data-driven lag estimation. Results from the combined-sex model indicated that higher ambient temperatures during the third trimester, particularly in the final weeks of pregnancy, were associated with increased birthweight. Stratified analyses suggested that this association was more pronounced in male infants. These findings highlight the importance of considering prenatal temperature exposures and timing when evaluating determinants of newborn health."
"Mammalian oocytes and embryos have distinct epigenomes that undergo major transitions essential for transmitting life to the next generation. Here, we provide the first genome-wide maps of the histone variant H2A.Z during six different stages of mouse oogenesis. Utilizing picogram- scale chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (picoChIP-seq), we reveal major waves of H2A.Z incorporation occurring early in growing oocytes. We identify distinct patterns of H2A.Z signal at oocyte-specific, embryo-specific, and constant H2A.Z loci. Late oocyte-specific loci precede reduced formation of lamina associated domains and early replication timing in the maternal compared to the paternal genome of 2-cell embryos. While constant H2A.Z is strongly associated with CpG islands (CGIs) and H3K4me3 near transcription start sites (TSS) of active genes, tens of thousands of oocyte- and embryo-specific H2A.Z incorporation sites exist independently of CGIs and TSSs. These TSS-distal H2A.Z sites are frequently enriched at transposable elements (TEs), and an intriguing inverse relationship exists between H2A.Z and H3K4me3 in low CpG environments, such as MTA and MTB retrotransposons (RTs). The existence of changes in H2A.Z distribution that persist across related developmental stages enable preservation of epigenetic information despite major concurrent changes in H3K4me3, H3K27me3, and DNA methylation. Altogether, this reveals new layers of regulation advancing our understanding of how histone variants contribute to the epigenetic landscape during mammalian oogenesis and preimplantation embryo development."
"The late-stage development of the blastocyst before implantation is a unique feature of ungulates. During this period, the epiblast proliferates and remains pluripotent for several days before gastrulation begins. Simultaneously, extra-embryonic tissues undergo significant growth, elongating to several tens of centimeters. However, the mechanisms that regulate and synchronize these processes remain poorly understood. In this study, we analyzed transcriptomic and epigenomic data at the single-cell level from early and late porcine blastocyst cells, spanning from the hatched blastocyst stage (E7) to early (E9) and late ovoid blastocyst (E11). We characterized 15,370 blastocyst cells, clustering them into distinct embryonic and extra-embryonic populations with specific chromatin accessibility landscapes. For each population, we inferred gene regulatory networks based on enhancer-driven gene regulation modules (eRegulons) and validated them through motif occupancy visualization. Our findings reveal strong dynamics in gene regulatory module activity within extra-embryonic tissues at the onset of blastocyst elongation, while gene regulatory activity in the epiblast remains relatively stable."
"Over a century of research has demonstrated that pollinators, such as bees, associatively learn diverse flower cues, including tactile, visual, and olfactory cues, to find food rewards. However, floral cues are not always reliable, as flowers of different plant species often differ in terms of the qualities of their food rewards, even when flower types resemble each other. At the same time, some non-floral traits, such as leaf shape, differ reliably among plant species and might be associatively learned by bees to improve foraging success. In this laboratory study, we tested whether generalist bees (Bombus impatiens) can (1) associatively learn differences in leaf shape to discriminate rewarding from unrewarding flowers and (2) rely more on differences in leaf shape when a flower color cue is harder to discriminate. We therefore assigned bees to either of two treatments: in one treatment, rewarding and unrewarding artificial targets ( flowers) differed greatly in petal color, and in the other treatment, they differed little; each treatments targets differed in leaf shape in the same way. As expected, bees learned significantly faster when flower petal colors were more dissimilar and thus relatively easier to discriminate. These bees also learned and recalled the correct combination of petal color and leaf shape. Yet when petal colors differed relatively little, bees had a much harder time learning petal color and did not show evidence of having remembered leaf shape. Our results demonstrate that leaf shape is a cue that foraging bees can learn to associate with a pollen food reward. However, leaf shape may be learned secondarily to, or only in combination with floral cues (such as petal color). We discuss evidence of compound learning and overshadowing and implications of our results for pollinator-mediated selection on non-floral plant traits."
"The matching law, which posits that animals allocate their responses in proportion to the rate of reinforcement, has been supported across diverse animal taxa. Although originally formulated in the context of operant choice, matching also applies to time allocation in foraging and to Pavlovian responses, indicating its generality across behavioral domains. However, empirical evidence has thus far been largely limited to vertebrates and arthropods. Addressing the broader applicability of this principle requires extending investigations beyond these taxonomic groups, across a wider phylogenetic spectrum. Here, we examined phototactic behavior in the acoel flatworm Praesagittifera naikaiensis, a species that acquires nutrients through photosynthesis by symbiotic algae and exhibits positive phototaxis. Using a custom-designed T-maze in which the number of illuminated LEDs varied across arms, we found that the animals distributed themselves in proportion to relative brightness, consistent with matching behavior. Moreover, prior exposure to light for twenty-four hours attenuated this pattern. This manipulation was intended to induce a state of nutritional sufficiency, and the resulting decline in phototactic responses suggests that internal physiological states can modulate even seemingly reflexive locomotor behaviors."
"How do precision of movement and proprioception influence motor control and adaptation? Several theories--such as the exploration-exploitation hypothesis--propose that variability plays a key role in motor performance and learning. However, empirical measures of motor and proprioceptive precision are often limited by small sample sizes, and proprioceptive estimates, especially those relying on efferent signals, are difficult to isolate and quantify. In this study, we leveraged a large dataset of 270 participants--including a subsample of older adults (ages 54-84)--to assess the precision of hand movements and proprioceptive estimates, and to examine whether these factors predict individual differences in motor learning and adaptation. We found that baseline reach variance did not predict learning or changes in hand localization. Although active hand localization (which includes efferent contributions) was slightly more precise--showing an 8.6% reduction in variance--this suggests that unseen hand estimates rely primarily on proprioception. Neither motor nor sensory precision varied with age. However, reach aftereffects were modestly associated with proprioceptive precision before training and proprioceptive recalibration after training. No other measure of learning or variance was reliably associated. These findings suggest that reach aftereffects may partly reflect changes in hand proprioception, but overall, we identified no predictors of adaptation to a rotated visual cursor."
"Emotional experience shapes not only how we perceive the present but also how the past influences our judgments. In this study, we examined how emotional arousal and valence modulate serial dependence in time perception--a phenomenon in which prior experiences bias current estimates. Using a duration reproduction task, participants viewed affective images drawn from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) to induce high-arousal (positive or negative) or low-arousal (neutral) emotional states. We found that participants consistently overestimated durations in high-arousal conditions compared to those in low-arousal conditions, regardless of valence. Crucially, serial dependence effects were significantly amplified during high-arousal states. This effect was strongest when high-arousal trials were preceded by similar high-arousal trials, indicating a state-dependent intensification of sequential bias. Emotional valence, by contrast, had no significant effect on either temporal distortion or serial dependence. These findings suggest that emotional arousal, rather than valence, plays a key role in shaping the temporal integration of past and present, offering new insight into how affective states shape temporal cognition and serial dependence."
"It is established that epilepsy patients can exhibit 24-hour rhythms in seizure severity and occurrence. While the pathways underlying seizure rhythmicity remain poorly understood, it seems likely that a contribution from the biological clock is involved. A better understanding of any such contribution may translate to better treatments. Here, the influence of the 24 h circadian rhythm on seizure activity in Drosophila melanogaster is investigated. Seizure-susceptible bang-sensitive julius seizure (jus) mutants were subjected to mechanically induced seizure at six different zeitgeber points. A clear sex- dependent phenotype was observed, with seizure severity showing a greater time-of-day effect in females, than males. The temporal pattern of seizure recovery time was bimodal, exhibiting both a morning and an evening peak. Rearing flies in constant light, which renders the molecular clock dysfunctional, abolished the seizure rhythm. Conversely, female seizure mutants reared in constant darkness, allowing free running of the circadian clock, continued to exhibit a bimodal rhythm of seizure severity. These findings support a role for the biological clock in seizure activity, at least in female Drosophila. Thus, this study validates Drosophila as a potential model for the identification of mechanisms modulating seizure rhythmicity, with the potential to aid future treatment of epilepsy."
"Background & AimsLocalised acidification from immune cell infiltration and heightened glycolysis contributes to colitis pathology by activating acid-sensing receptors such as GPR68, a proton-sensing GPCR expressed on immune and stromal cells. Single-cell RNAseq analysis revealed GPR68 is also expressed in colonic sensory neurons, prompting us to investigate its role in acid-induced colonic nociception.

MethodsExpression of GPR68 in colonic nociceptors and tissue from people with colitis was confirmed by in silico analysis of our RNAseq databases. Its contribution to disease activity was assessed using the acute dextran sulphate sodium (DSS) model of colitis. Acid-evoked sensory signalling was evaluated via colonic afferent recordings and Ca{superscript 2} imaging in DRG neurons from wild-type and GPR68-/- mice, supported by pharmacological studies using Ogerin (a GPR68 positive allosteric modulator) and Ogremorphin (a GPR68 antagonist).

ResultsRNAseq analysis showed GPR68 is robustly expressed in Trpv1 colonic nociceptors and upregulated in tissue from people with inflammatory bowel disease, consistent with reduced disease activity in DSS-treated GPR68-/- mice. Genetic deletion of GPR68 abolished colonic afferent responses to acid, which were also attenuated by Ogremorphin and enhanced by Ogerin. In Ca{superscript 2}-free buffer, DRG neurons from GPR68-/- mice or those pre-treated with Ogremorphin showed significantly reduced acid-evoked intracellular Ca{superscript 2} responses. By contrast the colonic afferent and DRG Ca2+ response (in Ca2+-containing buffer) to capsaicin was comparable between tissue from wild-type and GPR68-/- mice highlighting the involvement of divergent proton-dependent cellular signalling cascades.

ConclusionsThese findings identify GPR68 as a key mediator of acid-induced colonic nociception and highlight its potential as a therapeutic target for the treatment of pain in colitis.

SynopsisWe demonstrate that the proton-sensing receptor GPR68 mediates acid-induced signalling in colonic sensory neurons. Genetic and pharmacological modulation confirms GPR68s role in visceral nociception and supports its potential as a therapeutic target for pain management in colitis."
"Associating unfamiliar stimuli with appropriate behavior through experience is crucial for survival. While task-relevant information has been found to be distributed across multiple brain regions, how regional nodes in this distributed network reorganize their functional interactions throughout learning remains to be elucidated. Here, we performed chronic, large-scale single-unit recording across 10 cortical and subcortical regions using ultra-flexible microelectrode arrays in mice performing a visual decision-making task and tracked mesoscale functional network dynamics throughout learning. Task learning reshaped interregional functional connectivity, leading to the emergence of a subnetwork involving visual and frontal regions during the acquisition of correct No-Go responses. This reorganization was accompanied by a more widespread representation of visual stimulus across regions, and a regions network rank strongly predicted its peak timing of visual information encoding. Together, our findings reveal that mesoscale networks undergo dynamic restructuring during learning, with functional connectivity ranks influencing the propagation of sensory information across the network."
"Pruriception is crucial for defense against external stimuli but can lead to chronic pruritus, a debilitating condition affecting millions worldwide. Our understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms behind the sensation of itch has been hindered by the lack of functional human models. Here, we address this limitation by developing a protocol to generate induced pruriceptors (iPruriceptors) from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). We compared two differentiation approaches: a direct method via forced expression of transcription factors (TFs) in hPSCs, and a 2-step process through expression of TFs in hPSC-derived neural crest cells (NCCs). The 2-step protocol proved superior in inducing a transcriptional program that closely resembles that of human pruriceptors. Our optimized protocol employs forced expression of NGN1 and ISL1 to drive differentiation from NCCs into pruriceptors, enhancing the expression of known pruritogen receptors such as IL31RA, which pairs with OSMR, and HRH1. The induction of this transcriptional program leads to functional maturation of iPruriceptors. Accordingly, iPruriceptors exhibit robust responses to itch stimuli and in vivo-like itch pharmacology such as treatment with ABT-317, a JAK1 inhibitor tool compound, similar to those targeting intensive pruritus in atopic dermatitis (AD). Importantly, iPruriceptors can be generated without viral vectors or safe-harbor gene editing, using a PiggyBac-based transfection method that simplifies scalability. Our protocol offers a robust platform for investigating itch biology, modeling chronic pruritus, and enabling high-throughput screening for therapeutic target discovery.

"Substance use disorder (SUD) is associated with maladaptive alterations in behavior. Drug-seeking behavior has been associated with neuronal ensembles, defined here as a small group of neurons exhibiting coordinated activity patterns, in the prelimbic prefrontal cortex (PL) and nucleus accumbens core (NAcore). Most SUD preclinical research focuses on the effects of single-reward exposure on the general population of neurons within the reward pathway, rather than on poly-reward exposure. Here, we seek to characterize and compare the ensembles linked to cocaine and chocolate using a within-subject approach. We used Ai14xFos2A-iCreER (c-Fos-TRAP2) transgenic mice to tag neuronal ensembles in a novel dual cocaine and chocolate conditioned place preference (CPP) model, where each chamber was associated with a different reward, either cocaine or chocolate. We found that, after successful dual conditioning and in the absence of the rewards, mice preferred cocaine over chocolate. Additionally, in mice exposed to both cocaine and chocolate, cortical and accumbal ensembles linked to each reward were comparable in size to reward ensembles in mice exposed only to one reward. However, reward-seeking ensembles were larger than ensembles tagged in homecage control mice across groups. We also found that ensemble size does not correlate with the level of reward seeking across single and dual CPP models. These results offer a new paradigm for studying drug-related neuronal ensembles in comparison to natural rewards in non-contingent behavioral models."
"Experiences reshape our internal representations of the world. However, the neural and cognitive dynamics of this process are largely unknown. Here, we investigated how sequence learning reorganizes neural representations and how sleep-dependent consolidation contributes to this transformation. Using high-density electroencephalography and multivariate decoding, we found that learning temporal sequences of visual information led to the incorporation of successor representations during a subsequent perceptual task, despite temporal information being task-irrelevant. Importantly, individuals with better sequence memory performance exhibited stronger successor incorporation during the perceptual task. Representational similarity analyses comparing neural patterns with different layers of a deep neural network revealed a learning-induced shift in representational format, from low-level visual features to higher-level abstract properties. Critically, both the strength and transformation of successor representations correlated with the proportion of slow-wave sleep during a post-learning nap. These findings support the idea that sequence learning induces lasting changes in visual representational geometry and that sleep strengthens these changes, providing mechanistic insights into how the brain updates internal models after exposure to environmental regularities."
"Fiber photometry is a neuroscience technique that can continuously monitor in vivo fluorescence to assess population neural activity or neuropeptide/transmitter release in freely behaving animals. Despite the widespread adoption of this technique, methods to statistically analyse data in an unbiased, objective, and easily adopted manner are lacking. Various pipelines for data analysis exist, but they are often system-specific, only for pre-processing data, and/or lack usability. Current post hoc statistical approaches involve inadvertently biased user-defined time-binned averages or area under the curve analysis. To date, no post-hoc user-friendly and assumption-free tool for a standardised unbiased analysis exists, yet such a tool would improve reproducibility and statistical reliability for all users. Hence, we have developed a user-friendly post hoc statistical analysis package in Python that is easily downloaded and applied to data from any fiber photometry system. This Fibre Photometry Post Hoc Analysis (FiPhoPHA) package incorporates a variety of tools, a downsampler, bootstrapped confidence intervals (CIs) for analyzing peri-event signals between groups and compared to baseline, and permutation tests for comparing peri-event signals across comparison periods. We also include the ability to quickly and efficiently sort the data into mean time bins, if desired. This provides an open-source, user-friendly python package for unbiased and standardised post-hoc statistical analysis to improve reproducibility using data from any fiber photometry system."
"Parental care is critical for the survival of altricial young and is mediated by neural circuits that are well characterised in adult rodents. Although adults can exhibit caregiving even before becoming parents, the developmental origins of this so-called alloparental behaviour remain unclear. Here, we show that alloparental behaviour in mice emerges abruptly between postnatal day (P)14 and 15, independently of prior social experience. This behavioural transition coincides with the onset of pup-specific activity in galanin-expressing medial preoptic area (MPOAGal) neurons, which are essential for parental behaviour in adulthood. Chemogenetic silencing of MPOAGal neurons abolishes caregiving in juveniles, suggesting that similar circuits control parenting across life stages. Viral trans-synaptic tracing and whole-cell recordings reveal extensive input remodelling of MPOAGal neurons between P14 and 15, marking a rapid transition from a highly connected, immature network to a sparser, adult-like circuit configuration. We identify microglia as key mediators of this process, as their ablation prevents both synaptic reorganisation and the emergence of alloparenting. Together, these findings uncover a previously unrecognised, microglia-dependent developmental switch that enables caregiving in juveniles through rapid circuit reconfiguration."
"Neuronal signaling requires high rates of ATP production via the oxidative metabolism of glucose. The American bullfrog is intriguing, as this species has typical brain energy requirements for an average vertebrate but modifies synaptic physiology and metabolism after hibernation to maintain function during hypoxia and ischemia. Given the importance of the respiratory system in restoring metabolic homeostasis during emergence from underwater hibernation, work to date has addressed this response in the brainstem respiratory network. Thus, metabolic plasticity has been interpreted as an adaptation used to restart respiratory motor behavior under hypoxic conditions during the transition from skin breathing to air breathing. It remains unclear whether these improvements are specific to the brainstem regions critical for breathing versus a global response within the central nervous system (CNS). To address this question, we recorded neural activity from the spinal cord, forebrain, and brainstem respiratory network in vitro. As expected, hypoxia disrupted the function of each network in control animals. After hibernation, each network improved its activity in hypoxia compared to controls. These results suggest that plasticity that improves neural function during energy stress following hibernation reflects a global response that may impact many behaviors controlled by the CNS and is not limited to regions involved in metabolic homeostasis."
"Pavlovian biases reflect the notorious influence of hard-wired, evolutionarily conserved cue- response tendencies on instrumental action selection: people show automatic action invigoration in face of potential rewards, but action suppression in face of potential punishments. The neural origin of these biases is unclear. Past evidence suggests dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and anterior insula (aIns) as part of a ""reset network"" that rapidly responds to salient information and might contribute to these biases. We used transcranial ultrasonic stimulation (TUS) in 29 healthy participants to interfere with neural activity in these regions and test their causal role in a within-subject, counter-balanced design across three sessions (sham, TUS-dACC, TUS-aIns). Computational modelling revealed a double dissociation, with distinct roles of both regions in learning from feedback: while TUS to the aIns changed peoples tendency to overly take credit for rewards following action and to ignore punishments following inaction, TUS to dACC reduced participants tendency to take cue valence as a reinforcer signal. Although the dACC and aIns are part of the same network and often co-activate during decision-making tasks, TUS interference reveals their distinct roles: the dACC selects feedback signals from the environment to inform subsequent choices while the aIns infers whether these signals were caused by ones own actions."
"Structured AbstractO_ST_ABSINTRODUCTIONC_ST_ABSThe Pathogen Infection Hypothesis proposes that {beta}-Amyloid (A{beta}) functions as an antimicrobial peptide, with pathogen-induced aggregation potentially contributing to Alzheimers disease (AD) pathology.

METHODSWe used human iPSC-derived 2D neurons and 3D cerebral organoids from wild-type and familial AD (PSEN1/2 mutant) lines to model acute infections with HSV-1 and TBEV and A{beta} aggregation. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses were conducted to assess molecular responses.

RESULTSHSV-1, but not TBEV, induced robust A{beta} clustering, which was, however, dependent on extracellular amyloid peptides. Transcriptomic profiling revealed widespread HSV-1-induced changes, including activation of neurodegeneration-related pathways. Proteomic profiling confirmed enrichment of neurodegeneration- and senescence-associated secretome signatures. PSEN1/2 mutations did not alter the acute infection response. Reanalysis of independent datasets confirmed our findings and revealed a limited protective effect of acyclovir.

DISCUSSIONResults directly support the Pathogen Infection Hypothesis and suggest that preventing viral infections via vaccinations may represent a feasible approach to reducing AD risk."
"Predicting tasks or cognitive domains based on brain activation maps has remained an open question within the neuroscience community for many years. Meta-analytic functional decoding methods aim to tackle this issue by providing a quantitative estimation of behavioral profiles associated with specific brain regions. Existing methods face intrinsic challenges in neuroimaging meta-analysis, particularly in consolidating textual information from publications, as they rely on limited metrics that do not capture the semantic context of the text. The combination of large language models (LLMs) with advanced deep contrastive learning models (e.g., CLIP) for aligning text with images has revolutionized neuroimaging meta-analysis, potentially offering solutions to functional decoding challenges. In this work, we present NiCLIP, a contrastive language-image pretrained model that predicts cognitive tasks, concepts, and domains from brain activation patterns. We leveraged over 23,000 neuroscientific articles to train a CLIP model for text-to-brain association. We demonstrated that fine-tuned LLMs (e.g., BrainGPT models) outperform their base LLM counterparts. Our detailed evaluation of NiCLIP predictions revealed that performance is optimized when using full-text articles instead of abstracts, as well as a curated cognitive ontology with precise task-concept-domain mappings. Our results indicated that NiCLIP accurately predicts cognitive tasks from group-level activation maps provided by the Human Connectome Project across multiple domains (e.g., emotion, language, motor) and precisely characterizes the functional roles of specific brain regions, including the amygdala, hippocampus, and temporoparietal junction. However, NiCLIP showed limitations with noisy subject-level activation maps. NiCLIP represents a significant advancement in quantitative functional decoding for neuroimaging, offering researchers a powerful tool for hypothesis generation and scientific discovery."
"The brain is complementarily assembled by the sensorimotor and neuromodulatory (NM) pathways. Mapping the neural connectome is essential for elucidating the synaptic organization principles of this bi-pathway architecture. However, most electron microscopy (EM) reconstructions provide limited information about cell types, in particular NM neurons. Here we present a synapse-level, multiplexed molecular annotated reconstruction of an intact larval zebrafish brain, comprising over 170 thousand cells and 25 million synapses. Noradrenergic, dopaminergic, serotonergic, hypocretinergic/orexinergic, and glycinergic neurons were identified using subcellular localization of APEX2, while glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons were inferred from the Zebrafish Mesoscopic Atlas. NM neurons with varying indegree scale-distinctly innervate various sensory - motor brain regions, exhibiting heterogeneity in synapse number and strength. As a critical NM system, individual locus coeruleus noradrenergic (LC-NE) neurons integrate extensive brain-wide inputs displaying modality-specific spatial organization. Motor-related and sensory-related inputs preferentially target proximal and distal dendrites of these neurons, respectively. While the majority of inputs are one-to-one, approximately 16% synapse onto multiple targets, forming one-to-many connections. Notably, these shared input patterns extend across different monoaminergic systems, serving as a structural basis for coordinated neuromodulation. Our results demonstrate the organization principles of the NM systems input architecture, particularly within the LC-NE system. This brain-wide, multiplexed molecular annotated microscale reconstruction of a vertebrate brain, combined with multi-modal mesoscopic datasets, offers a reliable resource for the precise identification of diverse neuronal types within EM connectomes, and provides critical reference for elucidating the synaptic architecture principles underlying sensorimotor and NM pathways in the vertebrate brain."
"Desert Hedgehog (Dhh) mutations cause male infertility, testicular dysgenesis and Leydig cell dysfunction. However, the mechanisms by which Dhh regulates Leydig lineage commitment through receptor selectivity, transcriptional effector specificity, and steroidogenic coupling remain elusive. In this study, we identified a Dhh-Ptch2-Gli1-Sf1 signaling axis that is essential for the differentiation of stem Leydig cells (SLCs) by using CRISPR/Cas9-generated dhh/ptch2 mutants of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) and SLC transplantation. The loss of Dhh recapitulated mammalian phenotypes, characterized by testicular hypoplasia and androgen insufficiency. Rescue experiments with 11-ketotesterone and a Dhh agonist, in conjunction with SLC transplantation, demonstrated that Dhh regulates the differentiation of SLCs rather than their survival. In vitro knockout experiments of ptch1 and ptch2 in SLCs indicated that Patched2 (Ptch2), rather than Ptch1, serves as the receptor for Dhh in SLCs. Furthermore, in vivo genetic rescue experiments indicated that while the ptch2 mutation did not affect testicular development, the Ptch2 mutation fully rescued the developmental disorders of the testes caused by the dhh mutation, thereby further corroborating Ptch2 as the receptor for Dhh in SLCs. Additionally, the Glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1 (Gli1, but not Gli2 or Gli3) functions as the transcriptional effector that drives the expression of steroidogenic factor 1 (sf1). Transcriptomic and functional analyses further established that Dhh signaling directly couples Sf1 to SLC differentiation. This study provides mechanistic insights into Dhh-related Leydig cell dysfunction and presents novel targets for regenerative therapies.

"Animal personality is characterized by consistent behavior within individuals linked to consistently variable behavior among individuals in a population across time and contexts. Genetic determination, transgenerational effects, and personal experience are major pathways shaping animal personalities. Among these pathways, little attention has been paid to environmental factors in the parental generation affecting offspring personality. Here we tested the effects of the maternal diet on offspring personality in the plant-inhabiting predatory mite Amblyseius swirskii. Mated females and males, whose mothers were fed during egg production on either cattail pollen, two-spotted spider mites, or thrips, were subjected to a battery of three to five tests each for exploration, activity, and boldness. Movement activity was assessed in the mites familiar environment. Exploration was quantified by the latency to leave and reach novel sites or objects. Boldness was evaluated by residence in risky and benign sites. Mean behaviors were analyzed by generalized estimating equations, repeatability was assessed by intraclass correlation coefficients. On average, offspring from spider mite-fed mothers were the most active and those from pollen-fed mothers were the shiest. Offspring from thrips-fed mothers were more repeatable in activity than offspring from pollen-and spider mite-fed mothers. Consistently little and highly active personalities produced more eggs than inconsistent, flexible types. Only offspring from pollen-fed mothers were repeatable in boldness. Maternal diet did not influence offspring personality in exploration. Taken together, our study suggests that the maternal diet critically influences both mean behavioral trait expression and behavioral repeatability of offspring. The ability of mothers to respond to short-term diet changes during internal egg production allows to adaptively adjust the behavior and personalities of daughters and sons within local and regional groups."
"Identifying macromolecular complexes in situ using cryo-electron tomography remains challenging, with low signal-to-noise ratios and heterogeneous backgrounds among the key limiting factors. By integrating prior knowledge on macromolecular localization, such as the preferred orientations of membrane-associated proteins, detection can be improved by constraining searches to biologically feasible orientations. However, previous approaches integrating such constraints fail to achieve both computational scalability to large and curved systems and accurate detection. To resolve this, here we present rejection sampling, a novel approach for integrating translational and rotational constraints into template matching. Using simulated influenza virus-like particles, we demonstrate that rejection sampling outperforms existing methods in terms of precision and recall. Our approach can uniquely integrate constraints at voxel resolution while being compatible with imaging filters such as the contrast transfer function, essential for accurate macromolecular localization. Rejection sampling thus provides a practical solution for macromolecular detection in large and curved systems."
"The protein hydration shell is a key mediator of processes such as molecular recognition, protein folding, and proton transfer. How surface-exposed amino acids shape the hydration shell structure is not well understood. We combine molecular dynamics simulations with explicit-solvent predictions of small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) curves to quantify the contributions of all 20 proteinogenic amino acids to the hydration shell of the globular GB3 domain and the intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) XAO. We focus on two quantities encoded by SAXS curves: the hydration shell effect on the radius of gyration and the electron density contrast between protein and solvent. We derive an amino-acid-specific contrast score, revealing that acidic residues generate the strongest contrast with 1 to 1.5 excess water molecules relative to alanine, followed by cationic and polar residues. In contrast, apolar residues generate a water depletion layer. These trends are consistent across simulations with different water models. Around the XAO peptide, the hydration shell is generally far weaker compared to the globular GB3 domain, indicating unfavorable water-peptide packing at the IDP surface. The hydration shell effect on the radius of gyration of the IDP is strongly conformation-dependent. Together, the calculations show that the composition and spatial arrangement of surface-exposed amino acids govern the hydration shell structure, with implications for a wide range of biological functions and for hydration-sensitive experimental techniques such as solution scattering.

SignificanceHydration shells of biomolecules constitute a large fraction of the water in crowded cellular environments and play key roles in biological functions such as enzymatic reactions and conformational transitions. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) has shown that hydration shells differ in density from bulk water, yet how surface-exposed amino acids and protein surface geometry shape the hydration shell is not well understood. We combined molecular dynamics simulations with explicit-solvent SAXS predictions to quantify how surface-exposed chemical moieties and protein geometry drive variations in hydration shell density. Notably, the hydration shell of a globular protein differs markedly from that of an intrinsically disordered protein. Our study offers a comprehensive characterization of protein hydration and informs the interpretation of hydration-sensitive experimental techniques."
"Photosystem I (PSI) is a multi-subunit pigment-protein supercomplex responsible for light driven electron transport in photosynthesis. Its structural plasticity under natural environmental stress remains poorly understood. Here, we present a 2.1 [A] cryo-EM structure of the PSI-LHCI supercomplex from Avicennia marina, a halotolerant, dominant mangrove species native to the Arabian Gulf that thrives in harsh coastal environments. Unlike structures derived from laboratory grown specimens, our analysis captures PSI directly from wild-grown plant leaves, offering an in-situ snapshot of plant adaptation. The core architecture comprising twelve protein subunits and four Lhca antenna proteins coordinating 157 chlorophylls, 36 carotenoids and 24 lipids is highly conserved relative to model angiosperms yet exhibits subtle shifts in antenna core coupling and pigment organization. Red-shifted chlorophylls in Lhca3, conserved among far red adapted plants, suggest an ancestral photoprotective mechanism retained in high light, high-salinity environments. Lipid mediated stabilization at interfaces likely counteracts salinity-induced membrane fluidity changes enhancing resilience under fluctuating light and salt stress. Comparative analysis with PSI structures from other vascular plants highlights both evolutionary conservation and distinct ecological tuning of LHCI organization and cofactor binding in mangroves. These insights reveal molecular strategies enabling A. marina to maintain efficient photosynthesis under extreme conditions, offering strategies for engineering photosystems in crops."

"Birds exhibit monotonic trends in their flight kinematics across a broad range of scales. For example, in 10g to 10kg birds flight speed increases with scale while wingbeat frequency decreases. Existing hypotheses propose that aerodynamic and biomechanical factors may drive these trends. Predictive simulation models have used these drivers to computationally synthesize flying birds. However, only a small number of species have been simulated and so this approach has not explained the kinematic trends observed across different scales of birds.

This work uses predictive models to synthesize flight across all scales and shows that profile drag of the avian aerofoil is the key physical driver of self-selected kinematics. Profile drag causes the monotonic increase in flapping speed across scales and the near-constant ratio of flapping speed to flight speed (Strouhal number). The most efficient kinematics minimize Strouhal number to minimize the cost of transport, with the minimum cost of transport being bounded by the aerofoil maximum lift-to-drag ratio. The decrease of wingbeat frequency and increase of wing elevation amplitude with scale are attributable to balancing induced drag and the lateral component of profile drag.

The modular models presented provide transparency in understanding how modelling choices influence flight predictions. The work provides a platform for developing higher fidelity flight energetics models that address the scale limits of flying birds."
"In the vestibular system, upon transduction of head motion, ionic currents from type I sensory hair cells alter [K+] and electrical potentials in an extended synaptic cleft formed by a calyx terminal of the associated afferent neuron. During excitatory stimuli, these changes in turn modulate post-synaptic currents across the calyx inner face to depolarize the afferent and initiate action potentials. Within the tightly packed columnar vestibular sensory epithelium, electrical currents from the hair cell and calyx must also traverse non-synaptic extracellular spaces and generate local extracellular potentials before dispersing into the perilymph beneath the basement membrane. Here we show that such dynamic electrical potentials enhance action potential generation by reducing outward K+ currents on both the inner and outer faces of the calyx. This effect also influences adjacent calyces and may explain the abundance of calyx terminals in amniotes where there is a need for rapid recognition of changes in head orientation and acceleration."
"Precise alignment between internal circadian clocks and environmental light cycles is essential for physiological homeostasis and survival. However, the molecular mechanisms that preserve this synchrony across central and peripheral tissues remain poorly defined. Here, we uncover an unexpected role for the core clock gene Period1 (Per1) as a systemic modulator of circadian stability, regulating light-induced re-entrainment across the brain and body. In Per1-deficient mice, we show that loss of Per1 accelerates clock realignment, influencing transcriptomic, metabolic, hormonal, and behavioral indicators of circadian realignment across multiple organ systems, including the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and peripheral tissues such as the liver, adipose tissue, and adrenal glands. Notably, this accelerated adaptation confers protection against jetlag-induced sleep disturbances, weight gain, and metabolic imbalance, underscoring a systemic role for Per1 in maintaining circadian network stability. Mechanistically, unbiased spatial transcriptomics identified reduced expression of the arginine vasopressin (AVP), a key neuropeptide mediating SCN intercellular coupling, as the driver of circadian network instability. Weakened SCN synchrony permits enhanced flexibility of peripheral oscillator responses, expediting whole-body adaptation to shifted light-dark schedules. These findings position Per1 as a critical regulator of circadian robustness, a buffer against light over-responsiveness, identifying a potential molecular target for mitigating circadian misalignment in contexts such as jetlag, shift work, and metabolic disease.

TeaserWhat if beating jetlag was as simple as switching off a gene? Researchers show that disabling Per1, a core circadian regulator, accelerates body clock realignment and protects against sleep and metabolic disruption--highlighting new therapeutic possibilities for jetlag and shift work."
"Astrocytes play pivotal roles in maintaining neural architecture and function. However, their pronounced heterogeneity, especially in reactive states where distinct subtypes can adopt potentially opposing functions (e.g., neuroprotective vs. neuroinflammatory), complicates our understanding of their net contributions to neurological disorders. A critical challenge arises because these functionally distinct subpopulations often coexist, and the lack of precise tools to separately monitor or manipulate them has significantly hindered efforts to dissect their specific roles in disease progression. Here, we address this gap by developing and optimizing fluorescent RNA sensors mediated by endogenous adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) for application in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived astrocytes. We employed a streamlined screening methodology to enhance sensor specificity and functionality for complement component 3 (C3), a key marker predominantly associated with neuroinflammatory astrocytes, thus enabling subtype-specific tracking and providing a crucial tool for distinguishing these cells within heterogeneous populations. By integrating the biological complexity of astrocytes with the technological precision of ADAR-mediated sensing, this study establishes a robust framework for investigating astrocyte dynamics."
"Simultaneous TMS-fMRI holds significant opportunities for advancing basic and translational neuroscience. However, current configurations face technical limitations, particularly the need to accommodate TMS hardware within the MRI environment. Previous solutions have used low numbers of radio-frequency (RF) channels, limiting fMRI data quality and whole-brain coverage. Here, we introduce a novel 22-channel ""Taco"" TMS-fMRI configuration that re-purposes flexible RF coils, wrapping them around both the participants head and the TMS coil to preserve whole brain signal reception. Guided by precision fMRI principles, we optimized acquisition protocols to achieve to achieve high temporal signal-to-noise ratio (tSNR) across the cortex. Data from three pilot participants demonstrate robust signal quality, including in regions proximal to the TMS coil. This setup offers a relatively simple and cost-effective approach to integrating precision fMRI into TMS-fMRI research."
"The majority of brain-machine interface (BMI) studies have focused on decoding intended movements based on neural activity of primary motor (M1) and dorsal premotor cortex (PMd). The ventral premotor cortex (PMv), and more specifically area F5c, has been implicated in object grasping and action observation, and may represent an alternative for motor BMI control due to its phasic modulation during action observation. Using chronically implanted Utah arrays in F5c, PMd, and M1 in two male macaques, we compared the efficacy of controlling a motor BMI based on neural activity of each area. PMv decoding reached similar or even higher success rates than M1 and PMd in a 2D cursor control task, especially when controlling for the number of motion selective channels that were used by the decoder. We found similar results during a 2D robot avatar control task in a simulated 3D environment. At both the multi-unit and the population level, neural responses were highly similar during the training phase (passive observation of cursor movements) and the online decoding phase, and only a small subset of neurons modulated its selectivity for the direction of motion. Thus, ventral premotor area F5c may represent an alternative for online motor BMI control.

Significance statementWe present the first study on online cursor and robot avatar control using neural activity of ventral premotor cortical area F5c. Known for decades for the presence of mirror neurons, which are active during both action execution and action observation, area F5c can support online BMI control with performance comparable to that of dorsal premotor and primary motor cortex. The population dynamics in all three areas were highly similar between the training phase and the online decoding phase."
"Neurons that are active during action execution and action observation (i.e. Action Observation/Execution Neurons, AOENs) are distributed across the brain in a network of parietal, motor, and prefrontal areas. In a previous study, we showed that most AOENs in ventral premotor area F5c, where they were discovered three decades ago, responded in a highly phasic way during the observation of a grasping action, did not require the perception of causality or a meaningful action, and even responded to static frames of the action videos. To assess whether these characteristics are shared with AOENs in other areas of the AOE network, we performed the first large-scale neural recordings during action execution and action observation in multiple frontal areas including dorsal premotor (PMd) area F2, primary motor (M1) cortex, ventral premotor area F5p, frontal eye field (FEF) and 45B. In all areas, AOENs displayed highly phasic responses during specific epochs of the action video and strong responses to simple movements of an object, similar to F5c. In addition, the population dynamics in PMv, PMd and M1 showed a shared representation between action execution and action observation, with an overlap that was as large as the overlap between action execution and passive viewing of simple translation movements. These results pose important constraints on the interpretation of action observation responses in frontal cortical areas."
"Respiration is increasingly recognized as a coordinator of neural activity across widespread brain regions and behavioral states. Even during sleep, respiration rhythms modulate sleep-related oscillations. While the basal ganglia are known to play roles in both sleep and respiratory regulation, their interaction with respiration rhythms remains poorly understood. Here, we examined respiration-neural couplings in the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), a major output nucleus of the basal ganglia, and the primary motor cortex (M1) across multiple states in mice, including non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, quiet wakefulness, and anesthesia. Simultaneous recordings of local field potentials (LFPs) from M1 and SNr along with diaphragm muscle activities revealed state-dependent, region specific patterns of respiration-neural coupling. Coupling strength in both SNr and M1 was attenuated during NREM sleep compared to REM sleep and quiet wakefulness. However, under ketamine/xylazine anesthesia, coupling was markedly enhanced in the SNr, but not in M1, indicating region-specific sensitivity to arousal and anesthesia state. Notably, respiration-neural coupling was systematically related to delta sub-band power; coupling strength was reduced with increased slow delta (0.5-2 Hz) and decreased fast delta (2.5-4 Hz) powers. In addition, slow delta was associated with SNr-M1 synchronization, suggesting that inter-regional communication during deep sleep may suppress respiration locking. Together, these findings highlight dynamic, state-dependent modulation of respiration-neural couplings in cortico-basal ganglia circuits, underscoring its potential role in coordinating body-brain interactions during sleep and anesthesia.

Significance StatementNeural oscillations are known to couple with respiration rhythms across various brain areas; however, this coupling in the SNr, a major output hub of the basal ganglia, remained unexplored. Current study fills this gap with several novel findings, revealing state-dependent coupling to respiration rhythms in the SNr and M1 of mice. In particular, the strength of respiration-neural coupling varied across multiple states, including NREM sleep, REM sleep, quiet wakefulness, and anesthesia, and was directly related to the delta power, a hallmark of NREM sleep. These findings provide new insight into how respiratory rhythms interact with cortico-basal ganglia circuits and demonstrate that coupling changes dynamically within and across multiple states."
"We investigated, using temporally delayed linear modelling (TDLM) and magnetoencephalography (MEG), whether items associated with an underlying graph structure are replayed during a post-learning resting state. In these same data, we have previously provided evidence for replay during on-line (non-rest) memory retrieval. Despite successful decoding of brain activity during a localizer task, and contrary to predictions, we did not detect evidence for replay during a post-learning resting state. To better understand this, we performed a hybrid simulation analysis in which we inserted synthetic replay events into a control resting state recorded prior to the actual experiment. This simulation revealed that replay detection using our current pipeline requires extremely high replay densities to reach significance (>1 replay sequence per second, with ""replay"" defined as a sequence of reactivations within a certain time lag). Furthermore, when scaling the number of replay events with a behavioural measure we were unable to experimentally induce a strong correlation between sequenceness and this measure. We infer that even if replay was present at plausible rates in our resting state dataset we would lack statistical power to detect it with TDLM. We discuss ways for optimizing the analysis approach and how to find boundary conditions under which TDLM can be expected to detect replay successfully. We conclude that solving these methodological constraints is likely to be crucial to optimise measuring replay non-invasively using MEG in humans."
"Goal-directed object manipulation and problem-solving, which are necessary to evolve tool use behaviors, have long been linked to the expansion of the telencephalon in mammals and birds. Here, we show that goal-directed object manipulation in cichlid fish is driven by a non-telencephalic brain structure, the inferior lobe. Using manganese-enhanced MRI (MEMRI) on an ultra-high field 17.2 Tesla MRI system, we show that the inferior lobe is activated during a puzzle-box opening task. Furthermore, magnetic resonance (MR)-guided High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) lesions profoundly impair fine motor coordination during this task without affecting general locomotion or motivation. These results reveal that cortex-like cognitive functions can arise from non-telencephalic brain structures in teleosts. With no homolog in tetrapods, the inferior lobe is a critical hub for flexible behavior in teleost fish. Our findings highlight the existence of alternative neural architectures for the emergence of complex cognition."
"Memories are consolidated into a distributed neocortical network for long-term storage. Long-term memory retrieval relies on cells that are active during learning and undergo necessary plasticity. However, remote memory retrieval activates a broader circuit, with learning-activated cells representing only a small subset. What are the rules and cell-types governing memory trace reorganization? We identified a class of prefrontal projection neurons that are gradually recruited to a memory trace through synaptic activity of learning-activated cells. This population, which projects to the temporal association area (TEa), progressively strengthens its encoding of memory-induced behaviors, mirroring increases in TEa activity. Notably, the prefrontal-TEa pathway is required for remote but not recent memory retrieval. Our findings reveal a cell type-specific mechanism underlying memory trace reorganization during consolidation."
"In clinical settings, the virtual dissection of white matter tracts represents an informative source of information for monitoring neurological conditions or to support the planning of a treatment. The automation of this task using data-driven approaches, and in particular deep learning models, provides promising evidence of good accuracy when carried out on healthy individuals. However, the lack of large clinical datasets and the profound differences between healthy and clinical populations hinder the translation of these results to patients. Here, we investigated for the first time the effectiveness of transfer learning in adapting a deep learning architecture trained on a healthy population to glioma patients. Importantly, we provided the first thorough characterization of domain shift and its complexity, distinguishing systematic (i.e. measurement and pre-processing related) from tumor specific components. Our results suggest that (i) models trained on a large normative healthy population have a significant performance drop when the inference is carried out on patients; (ii) transfer learning can be an effective strategy to overcome the shortage of clinical data and to manage the systematic shift; (iii) fine tuning of the learning model cannot accommodate large white matter deformations induced by the tumor. The results were coherent across the five white matter bundles and three different input modalities tested, highlighting their robustness and generalizability. Our work provides valuable insights for advancing automated white matter segmentation in clinical populations and enhancing clinical transfer learning applications.

"Thousands of languages are used worldwide as the primary means of human thought communications. While both similarities and variations in word meaning (semantics) across different languages are well recognized, the underlying mechanisms remain enigmatic without a coherent theoretical model for semantic representation. Given that semantic representation is a product of the human brain, we address this issue through the lens of neurocognitive theories, with the consensus framework that semantics are derived from sensory experiences, with a set of dimensions being identified as biologically salient in neuroscientific studies. We operationalized word semantic representations with this set of specific dimensions, using computational models (53 languages word embedding data; Study 1), human behavioral ratings (253 subjects, 8 languages; Study 2), and brain activity data (86 subjects, 45 languages; Study 3), and analyzed the similarity and variation patterns of concepts across different languages. These three approaches converge on the finding that, across diverse language samples, word semantic representations along the neurocognitive dimensional structures exhibit strong commonalities, with variations along this structure being significantly and uniquely explained by climate, beyond sociocultural-centered variables. These results present a universal, biologically constrained semantic structure that is adaptive to environmental inputs, reconciling the classical universality and relativity debate."
"Long-term action video game (AVG) playing has been linked to improved response times ([~]190 ms) without accuracy tradeoffs in time-sensitive visuomotor decisions, but how it reshapes neural circuits that enable this behavioral advantage is unclear. In this study, Cognitive Resource Reallocation (CRR) is introduced as a candidate mechanism for how sustained engagement with AVGs drives behaviorally relevant neuroplasticity through neuroplastic refinement. Using the AAL3 structural connectivity atlas, we apply structural constraints to functional connectivity (SC-FC) and directed functional connectivity (SC-dFC) in gamers and non-gamers. Our results provide strong support for the CRR hypothesis and demonstrate that the brain plausibly reallocates cognitive resources over time to optimize task-relevant networks in high-demand environments such as AVGs, enhancing the integration of contextual information and refining motion processing, which may be a key mechanism in explaining more efficient visuomotor decision-making. These findings position action video games as powerful tools for studying experience-driven neuroplasticity, with implications for cognitive training, rehabilitation, and optimizing real-world visuomotor decisions."
"The basal ganglia and midbrain dopaminergic systems are critical for motor control, reward processing, and reinforcement learning, with dysfunction in these systems implicated in numerous neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. To enable precise genetic targeting of key neuronal populations, we generated and characterized five knock-in mouse lines: Drd1-Cre, Adora2a-Cre, Drd1-FlpO, Adora2a-FlpO, and DAT-FlpO. These lines allow for Cre-or FlpO-mediated recombination in dopamine D1 receptor-expressing spiny projection neurons (SPNs), adenosine A2a receptor-expressing SPNs, and dopamine transporter (DAT)-expressing neurons in the midbrain. Histological analyses confirmed recombinase activity in expected brain regions, and whole-cell electrophysiological recordings validated the intrinsic excitability profiles of each neuronal subpopulation. These tools provide high specificity and reliability for studying basal ganglia circuitry and dopaminergic neurons. By enabling targeted manipulations, these openly available knock-in lines will advance research into the neural mechanisms underlying motor control, reward, and neuropsychiatric diseases."
"The vagus nerve relays critical metabolic information between the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and the brain. Recent findings highlight a role for vagus nerve-mediated gut-brain signaling in regulating higher-order cognitive processes, although the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that nutrient consumption promotes hippocampal-dependent memory function via vagus nerve-mediated acetylcholine (ACh) release in the dorsal hippocampus (HPCd) from medial septum (MS) neurons. In vivo analyses reveal that HPCd ACh release is engaged during nutrient consumption, and that this response is abolished in animals that received MS cholinergic neuron ablation, subdiaphragmatic vagotomy (SDV), or early-life Western Diet (WD) maintenance. MS cholinergic neuron ablation, SDV, and early-life WD also impaired memory for meal location, suggesting that this gut-brain pathway functions to encode memories for eating events. Collectively, results identify a neurobiological mechanism whereby nutrient consumption promotes memory function, and reveal that disruption of this vagal-brain signaling system mediates WD-associated memory impairments."
"Old patients are more likely to experience memory dysfunction than young patients after a stroke. It has been reported that brain astrocytes and microglia cause excessive removal of synapses at the acute and subacute stages of stroke, and inhibition of their phagocytosis improved neurobehavioral outcomes. We hypothesized that memory dysfunction in old subjects is associated with increased synapse removal by inflammatory cells. Ischemic stroke was induced in young (2-month-old) and old (15-18-month-old) mice. Memory functions were analyzed by the Y-maze test weekly for 8 weeks and the novel object recognition (NOR) test at 7 days before and 8 weeks post-stroke. We have also created a tibia fracture 6 hours before stroke injury in young mice, to test if the activation of 7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAchRs) reduces inflammatory cells and synapse elimination. Brains were collected 8 weeks after the induction of ischemic stroke. Transcriptome changes, neuronal injuries, neuroinflammation, synapse removal, and neurite outgrowth were analyzed. We found that old mice developed long-term memory dysfunction after ischemic stroke, which was not seen in young mice. Old mice showed larger infarct volume, higher neuroinflammation, and more synapses engulfed by microglia/macrophages and astrocytes in the peri-atrophic region and hippocampi than young mice. More synapse-engulfing astrocytes than microglia/macrophages were present in the peri-atrophic region and the ipsilateral hippocampi, suggesting that reactive astrocytes contributed more than activated microglia/macrophages in synapse removal. Activation of 7-nAchRs in mice subjected to tibia fracture 6 hours before ischemic injury reduced synapse removal by microglia/macrophages and astrocytes in the hippocampi. Our study indicated that an increase in synaptic elements by inflammatory cells contributes to the long-lasting memory deficit after stroke in old mice. Astrocytes may contribute more than microglia/macrophages in synapse removal. Inhibition of neuroinflammation by activating 7-nAchRs can reduce synapse loss and thus may improve post-stroke memory function."
"The thalamus, traditionally viewed as a sensory relay station, is now recognized for its critical role in higher-order cognitive functions, including memory. While most research has focused on its distinct nuclei, the thalamus also contains crucial white matter tracts, such as the mammillothalamic tract (MTT), part of the Papez circuit. Despite its established role in memory, the MTT remains underappreciated in studies on the cognitive role of the thalamus, increasing the risk of misattributing memory functions to nearby thalamic nuclei. This study investigates the memory impact of thalamic strokes by considering disruption to the MTT.

We examined 40 patients with chronic ischemic thalamic lesions and 45 healthy controls using neuropsychological assessments, focusing on the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (FCSRT) and high-resolution structural neuroimaging. Advanced imaging techniques, such as symptom mapping and disconnectome analyses, were employed to analyze the relationships between lesion sites, tract disconnections and cognitive outcomes. Additionally, the expression of calbindin-rich matrix cells and parvalbumin-rich core cells was examined to assess how the connectivity property of thalamic cells, and its disruption, can relate to cognitive deficits following a thalamic stroke.

Patients with left-sided thalamic lesions, especially those involving the MTT, showed significant memory impairments. Symptom mapping identified a specific cluster of lesioned voxels in the left anterior-lateral thalamus, including the MTT, as being strongly associated with poorer memory performance. Disconnectome analysis confirmed that verbal memory deficits were associated with disruption of the MTT. Furthermore, a striking overlap was observed between the critical regions linked to memory deficits and calbindin-rich thalamic areas. However, this calbindin-rich region was also disrupted in patients without memory impairment, revealing that MTT disruption, and not lesions to this region, induced memory deficits in these patients. The identified FCSRT deficit cluster overlapped with brain regions consistently linked to memory processes following fMRI meta-analytic mapping of memory-related keywords.

These findings challenge the traditional focus on thalamic nuclei and connector hubs, indicating a need to reappraise the importance of the MTT in memory impairment after a thalamic stroke. This study advocates for a shift in thalamic research, emphasizing the need to investigate tract-specific contributions and disruptions of the MTT but also of other tracts such as the interthalamic adhesion or amygdalo-fugal pathway, rather than holding only to a ""nuclei-centric"" view of the thalamus."
"Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) is a promising non-invasive method to modulate motivation, cognition, and affect. According to a recent meta-analysis, pulsed taVNS induces larger pupil dilation (vs. sham), but sensory aspects of the stimulation may contribute to these differences. Moreover, included studies were often small and stimulation was only applied to the left ear, so that questions about the robustness and generalization remain. Here, we investigated the effects of pulsed taVNS (1s, 20Hz, 400{micro}s pulse width) at the right ear on phasic pupil dilation using a randomized crossover design in 94 participants (47 women). We initially calibrated the stimulation amplitude to match the perceived sensation across conditions and tracked sensation over time. Contrary to our hypothesis, taVNS did not elicit greater pupil dilation versus sham (b = -0.42, 95% CI [-1.30; 0.46], p = .35). However, taVNS effects were larger if sham was perceived as less intense despite the initial matching (b = 3.39, 95% CI [0.62; 6.17], p = .017). Differences in intensity ratings were mainly associated with sham-induced pupil dilation (r = -.25, 95% CI [-.43; -.05], p = .013). To summarize, our results recapitulate the findings of other studies using fixed amplitudes by showing that right-sided pulsed taVNS only induced larger pupil dilation against sham if differences in sensation arose. These findings highlight the challenge of establishing a suitable sham condition since both taVNS and sham affect sensory nerves, potentially leading to confounding effects."
"Psychedelics are emerging as a promising treatment option for a range of neuropsychiatric disorders, including substance use disorders. One potential mechanism underlying their therapeutic benefits may involve a reversal of maladaptive plasticity induced by drug exposure. Here, we identify physiological, behavioral, and epigenetic impacts of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) on morphine-treated male and female mice. Morphine was selected due to the high leverage capacity to address the opioid epidemic. A single treatment of LSD, or 4 microdoses of LSD, cause accelerated extinction of morphine-induced conditioned place preference. Whole-cell electrophysiology revealed that excitatory synaptic plasticity, which was eliminated in VTA GABA neurons following morphine exposure, was restored 24 hours after a single high dose of LSD. To explore the impact of LSD treatment on potential epigenetic changes, whole-brain DNA methylation analysis in morphine-treated mice that received either saline or LSD post-morphine treatment revealed significant differences in methylation profiles associated with LSD treatment. Collectively, these findings suggest that LSD may reverse or prevent morphine-induced changes in reward circuit plasticity and attenuate measures of morphine-preference."

Ocean is thought to be one of the ultimate environments where ARGs gathered. Marine ecosystems represent vast reservoirs of ARGs, yet their dynamics in open-ocean environments remain poorly characterized. Through large-scale metagenomic profiling of the Kuroshio Extension, a hydrographically dynamic region in the Northwest Pacific, we identified a striking enrichment of ARGs (1.81 x 10-3 ppm) at a frontal zone site (S30). The ARG abundance at this site exceeded coastal levels by 90-fold. Notably, multidrug resistance genes dominated this hotspot, with efflux pumps contributing 62% of the resistance mechanisms, a pattern distinct from the target-alteration strategies prevalent in other regions. The site exhibited unique microbial consortia, including pathogenic Acinetobacter (30.2% abundance) carrying clinically critical determinants (blaOXA-23, adeJ). Co-occurrence networks revealed horizontal transfer risks, linking pelagic Sphingobium to terrestrial-derived {beta}-lactamase variants. Crucially, we discovered three novel plasmid-borne resistance genes circulating in >15% of microbial populations, demonstrating open-ocean ARG diversification independent of direct anthropogenic inputs. These findings redefine oceanic frontiers as crucibles of resistance evolution, demanding urgent integration into global antimicrobial stewardship strategies."
"Short abstractO_ST_ABSPurposeC_ST_ABSBlocking the Activin receptor type IIA and B (ActRIIA/IIB) has clinical potential to increase muscle mass and improve glycemic control in obesity, cancer, and aging. However, the impact of blocking ActRIIA/IIB on strength, metabolic regulation and insulin action remains unclear.

MethodsHere, we investigated the effect of short- (10 mg/kg once, 40h) or long-term (10 mg/kg twice weekly, 21 days) antibody targeting ActRIIA/IIB (ActRIIA/IIBab) in lean and diet-induced obese mice and engineered human muscle tissue.

ResultsShort-term ActRIIA/IIB administration in lean mice increased insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle by 76-105%. Despite this, ActRIIA/IIB-treated mice exhibited 33% elevated fasting blood glucose and glucose intolerance. Moreover, long-term ActRIIA/IIB treatment increased average muscle mass (20%) and reduced fat mass (-8%) in obese mice but did not change insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle or adipose tissue, yet induced marked glucose intolerance, and increased hepatic glucose output in response to pyruvate. Concomitantly, long-term ActRIIA/IIBab treatment increased strength (30%) in mouse soleus muscle and prevented activin A-induced loss of tissue strength in engineered human muscle tissue. Surprisingly, long-term ActRIIA/IIBab treatment lowered volitional running (-250%).

ConclusionOur findings demonstrate that, in accordance with human studies, ActRIIA/IIB blockade holds promise for increasing muscle mass, strength, and insulin sensitivity. However, contrary to the improved glycemic control in humans, ActRIIA/IIB blockade in mice causes severe glucose intolerance and lowers voluntary physical activity. Our study underscores the complex metabolic and functional consequences of ActRIIA/IIB blockade, and highlight species differences on glycemic control, which warrant further investigation."
"US28 is a human cytomegalovirus-encoded chemokine receptor homologue that has high agonist-independent activity, internalizes constitutively, and plays an oncomodulatory role in glioblastoma. As G protein signaling was originally believed to strictly occur at the plasma membrane, it has been assumed that US28s constitutive Gq/11 signaling is mediated by a minor population at the plasma membrane. However, accumulating evidence shows that some GPCRs activate G proteins from intracellular organelles, such as endosomes. Importantly, endosomal rather than plasma membrane G protein signaling has been associated with transcriptional activity. Here, we demonstrate that the endosomal US28 population robustly activates Gq/11, and thus, provides the major contribution of Gq/11 signaling. Surprisingly, US28 signaling at the plasma membrane rather than from endosomes primarily drives upregulation of gene expression involved in cell proliferation and inflammatory responses that are associated with glioblastoma and cancer. Our findings highlight the crucial role of receptor signaling location in cellular responses."
"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe abundance and distribution of ant colonies can be explained by several processes occurring before and after colony establishment, which potentially associate with natural and anthropogenic factors varying in time and space. We analyzed how the abundance and spatial arrangement of Pheidole bergi colonies varied according to habitat heterogeneity at two spatial scales and long-term environmental changes in the central Monte desert. Densities of active P. bergi colonies were similar in permanent grids within a protected algarrobal (open woodland) and on disturbed dirt roads crossing that habitat but showed a >50% reduction in the 2001-2025 period. There were also significant variations in colony density along some dirt roads, and they were 40-50% lower on those crossing other habitats (sand dunes and livestock-grazed algarrobal). Colonies within the algarrobal were not arranged randomly. The best-fitted of several spatial point process models proposed maximum probability of active colonies at the inter-patch borders of vegetation, decreasing 56% faster into the vegetated patches than towards the open patches. Further distance-related pairwise interactions between colonies were slightly positive in 2001, resulting in clumped distributions, and became strongly negative by 2019, when densities were less than a half, favoring more random and overdispersed spatial patterns. Pheidole bergi, a highly abundant and potentially ecologically significant ant species in the central Monte desert, seems flexible enough to establish colonies in different habitats and microhabitats although with distribution and population dynamics still shaped by environmental conditions such as soil texture, vegetation cover or resource availability. The strong decline in colony density along the years and associated changes in spatial distribution suggest that both direct and indirect effects of environmental variability, including prolonged drought, play a key role in the establishment and survival of its colonies. Furthermore, the shifting relevance of inter-colony interactions or density-dependent competition highlights the complex interplay between environmental constraints and intraspecific dynamics in the population ecology of P. bergi."
"The spectacular diversity of flowers is strongly driven by pollinator-mediated selection that favors attractive flowers and effective pollen transfer. We tested how urbanization affected the genetic and plastic components of flower morphology of Impatiens capensis across four Canadian cities, accounting for changes in abiotic conditions and pollinator communities. Urbanization altered the species composition of pollinator communities and bumblebee size - the main pollinator, but the size effect varied among cities. Urbanization also impacted flower size through both genetic and plastic responses. In particular, the genetic component of the sepal size - a tubular floral organ in which pollinators enter to access the nectar - correlated positively with bumblebee size. These results suggest that urbanization, by changing pollinator communities, drives evolutionary changes in flower morphology."
"Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is a chronic condition characterized by per-sistent intestinal inflammation in children and adolescents. Despite a rising global incidence, the underlying causes and optimal management strategies for pediatric IBD are still not fully understood. Compared to adult IBD, pediatric IBD frequently presents with distinct disease phenotypes, and is more commonly linked to rare monogenic variants that cause intestinal epithelial barrier dysfunction or affect the function of mucosal immune cells. While more than 100 genes have been associated with early-onset IBD, the roles of many of these genes in the intestinal epithelium and the mechanisms by which genetic variants contribute to disease remain poorly defined.

Here we aimed to improve our understanding of intestinal epithelium dysfunction in early-onset IBD by conducting extensive molecular and cellular characterization to gain insights into patient-specific epithelial phenotypes and identify therapeutic targets. We generated intestinal epithelial organoids (IEOs) from 94 pediatric IBD patients, representing diverse clinical characteristics and including those with monogenic variants (BTK n=4, TTC7A n=3, IL10RA n=1, LRBA n=1, STXBP2 n=1, TTC37 n=1, TRNT1 n=1, PLCG2 n=1, DKC1 n=1, POLA1 n=1), and 46 non-IBD controls. This effort resulted in the largest RNA-seq dataset of pediatric IBD intestinal epithelial organoids to date, encompassing both baseline conditions and post-immunological stimulation, serving as a valuable resource for future research.

We observed that IEOs effectively initiate inflammation upon stimulation with bacterial lysate, regardless of disease status, origin, or mutation status. Inflammatory stimulation triggered single-gene upregulation of IBD-linked SERPINA1 and LIFR across the IBD population compared to controls, suggesting their role in intestinal epithelial innate immune responses. However, co-expression network analysis showed no consistent transcriptional signatures across the entire IBD group at the systems level. Instead, differences emerged between controls and specific genotypes (TTC7A, STXBP2, LRBA), with STXBP2 and LRBA sharing an upregulated transcriptional response of IL-1 and SLC30-mediated zinc trafficking pathways.

These findings underscore the potential of IEOs as a valuable model for studying IBD and offer key insights that could guide the development of targeted therapies for both monogenic and non-monogenic forms of IBD.

We generated intestinal epithelial organoids (IEOs) from 94 pediatric IBD patients, representing diverse clinical characteristics and including those with monogenic variants (BTK n=4, TTC7A n=3, IL10RA n=1, LRBA n=1, STXBP2 n=1, TTC37 n=1, TRNT1 n=1, PLCG2 n=1, DKC1 n=1, POLA1 n=1), and 46 non-IBD controls. This effort resulted in the largest RNA-seq dataset of pediatric IBD intestinal epithelial organoids to date, encompassing both baseline conditions and post-immunological stimulation, serving as a valuable resource for future research.

We observed that IEOs effectively initiate inflammation upon stimulation with bacterial lysate, regardless of disease status, origin, or mutation status. Inflammatory stimulation triggered single-gene upregulation of IBD-linked SERPINA1 and LIFR across the IBD population compared to controls, suggesting their role in intestinal epithelial innate immune responses. However, co-expression network analysis showed no consistent transcriptional signatures across the entire IBD group at the systems level. Instead, differences emerged between controls and specific genotypes (TTC7A, STXBP2, LRBA), with STXBP2 and LRBA sharing an upregulated transcriptional response of IL-1 and SLC30-mediated zinc trafficking pathways.

These findings underscore the potential of IEOs as a valuable model for studying IBD and offer key insights that could guide the development of targeted therapies for both monogenic and non-monogenic forms of IBD.

"Menopause not only affects fertility but also has widespread impact on systemic health. Yet, the molecular mechanisms underlying this process are not fully understood, partly due to the absence of robust, age-relevant preclinical models with comprehensive molecular and phenotypic characterization. To address this, we systematically compared three candidate mouse models of menopause: (1) intact aging, (2) chemical ovarian follicle depletion using 4-vinylcyclohexene diepoxide (VCD) administered at multiple ages, and (3) Foxl2 haploinsufficiency, a genetic model based on a transcription factor linked to human premature ovarian failure. Through histology, serum hormone profiling, single-cell transcriptomics and machine-learning approaches, we uncovered both shared and model-specific features of follicle loss, endocrine disruption, and transcriptional remodeling. The VCD and Foxl2 haploinsufficiency models revealed distinct patterns of hormonal and immune alterations not captured by intact aging alone. This comparative framework enables informed selection of context-appropriate preclinical rodent models to study menopause and the broader physiological consequences of ovarian aging."
"We introduce a high-affinity split-HaloTag comprised of a short peptide tag (Hpep, 14 residues) and a large, inactive fragment (cpHalo{Delta}3). Hpep binds to cpHalo{Delta}3 spontaneously with nanomolar affinity, enabling subsequent labeling with fluorescent HaloTag ligands. The small size of Hpep facilitates cloning-free endogenous protein tagging using CRISPR/Cas9 and the complementation of Hpep-tagged proteins can be achieved in live cells through co-expression with cpHalo{Delta}3 and in fixed cells through incubation with cpHalo{Delta}3. The approach is compatible with advanced microscopy techniques such as expansion microscopy and live-cell STED imaging. Additionally, variants of Hpep that modulate the spectral properties of labeled fluorophores enable simultaneous imaging of two different Hpep-tagged proteins via fluorescence lifetime microscopy. In summary, our high-affinity split-HaloTag is a robust and versatile tool for live-cell imaging and diverse applications in chemical biology."
"In meiosis, ploidy reduction is driven by a complex series of DNA breakage and recombination events between homologous chromosomes, orchestrated by meiotic HORMA domain proteins (HORMADs). Meiotic HORMADs possess a central chromatin binding region (CBR) whose architecture varies across eukaryotic groups. Here, we determine high-resolution crystal structures of the meiotic HORMAD CBR from two diverged aquatic holozoa, Schistosoma mansoni and Patiria miniata, which reveal tightly-associated PHD and winged helix-turn-helix (wHTH) domains. We show that PHD-wHTH CBRs bind duplex DNA through their wHTH domains, and identify key residues that disrupt this interaction. Combining experimental and predicted structures, we show that the CBRs PHD domains likely interact with the tail of histone H3, and may discriminate between unmethylated and trimethylated H3 lysine 4. Finally, we show that holozoa Hop1 CBRs bind nucleosomes in vitro in a bipartite manner involving both the PHD and wHTH domains. Our data reveal how meiotic HORMADs with PHD-wHTH CBRs can bind chromatin and potentially discriminate between chromatin states to drive meiotic recombination to specific chromosomal regions."
"BackgroundAxolotls can regenerate entire limbs, recapitulating mammalian developmental processes. During development, mechanosensitive ion channels such as TRPV4, PIEZO1, and PIEZO2 regulate tissue morphogenesis by transducing mechanical signals. Their roles in regeneration, however, have yet to be thoroughly explored. To investigate this, we assessed the expression of these channels during limb regeneration using single-cell RNA sequencing dataset, hybridization chain reaction fluorescence in-situ hybridization, and immunofluorescence. Additionally, functional relevance was tested by pharmacological inhibition of TRPV4 and PIEZO1/2 mechanosensitive ion channels during limb regeneration.

ResultsWhile PIEZO1 expression was undetected, we observed TRPV4 and PIEZO2 expression in uninjured cartilage and at both the mid-bud and palette blastemal stages of limb regeneration. TRPV4 and PIEZO2 were highly expressed in chondrocytes, with PIEZO2 enriched in fibroblasts. Inhibition with GSK205, a TRPV4 antagonist, significantly reduced calcium influx and humeral length without inhibiting cartilage differentiation. Treatment with gadolinium chloride, a broad spectrum mechanosensitive ion channel inhibitor, had no significant morphological impact.

ConclusionsTRPV4 and PIEZO2 are dynamically regulated during axolotl limb regeneration. Selective TRPV4 inhibition altered final limb morphology, but chondrogenesis was unaffected. This suggests a role for these genes in shaping tissue architecture during limb regeneration. These findings underscore the importance of ion channel-mediated mechanotransduction in regenerative patterning.

"Recent advances in computation pathology have seen the development of various forms of foundational models that have enabled high-quality, generalpurpose feature extraction from tissue patches. However, most of these models are somewhat limited in their ability to capture cell-to-cell spatial relationships essential for understanding tissue microenvironments. To address this issue, self-supervised learning (SSL) applied to cellular graph models is a promising avenue of investigation as this would afford one the ability to capture cell-level interpretability of the tissue microenvironment and learn relationships from the cellular topology. Compared to SSL on tissue patches, developing cellular graph models requires considerable computation and algorithmic effort, starting with accurate cell detection/segmentation from tissue and then subsequently requiring adequate cell-level feature extraction. In this study, we demonstrate that a pretrained tissue patch encoder, originally trained in the context of the token used in conventional vision transformer frameworks can also serve effectively as a cellular graph encoder for cellbased patches. We report three key findings: 1) the pretrained tissue patch encoder acts as a powerful graph-level feature extractor for cellular graphs in tissue patches; 2) it also can function as a celllevel feature extractor, allowing each cell to be contextualized within its local tissue microenvironment environment; 3) the cell patch size and positional embeddings are critical factors for high-quality cellular graph feature extraction. To validate and support these insights, we evaluate our approach on various tissue region classification tasks from three different types of cancers. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves performance comparable to the current state-of-the-art foundation models in computational pathology. These results highlight the potential of pretrained tissue patch encoders in cellular graph modeling, which can enable insights into how the cellular features and topology are related to various biological processes and phenomena."
"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is a severe form of fatty liver disease and a recognized cardiovascular risk factor, yet the mechanisms linking hepatic pathology to vascular dysfunction remain poorly understood. We aimed to investigate whether MASH impairs endothelial function via nitric oxide (NO)-dependent mechanisms and to identify potential liver-derived mediators involved in this process.

Endothelial function was assessed in two murine MASH models, Foz mice fed a high-fat diet and C57BL/6JRj mice fed a western diet with fructose, by using wire myography, while blood pressure was monitored via telemetry. NO pathway was further investigated through eNOS expression and activation and Hb-NO measurements. ADMA metabolism was analyzed in both liver tissue and plasma by LC-MS and gene expressions. Additionally, bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) were treated with mouse plasma to measure the circulating factors effects on eNOS activation and the role of oxidative stress.

Both models exhibited impaired NO-dependent vasorelaxation without evidence of atherosclerosis. In Foz mice, this impairment was associated with reduced eNOS expression and activation. Surprisingly, plasma Hb-NO levels did not reflect vascular NO deficiency, likely due to elevated hepatic iNOS expression. In both models, hepatic and plasma ADMA levels were increased, concomitant with hepatic upregulation of Prmt1. BAECs exposed to plasma from MASH mice showed reduced eNOS activation independent of oxidative stress.

Our findings reveal that MASH is consistently associated with NO-dependent endothelial dysfunction, with ADMA emerging as a key liver-derived mediator. The PRMT1/ADMA/NO axis may represent a mechanistic link between liver pathology and vascular impairment, positioning ADMA as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for cardiovascular risk associated with MASH.

"Understanding the molecular architecture of peripheral sensory neurons is critical as we pursue novel drug targets against pain and neuropathy. Sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) show extensive compartmentalization, thus understanding each compartment - from the peripheral to central terminals - is key to this effort. To systematically profile this spatial complexity, we generated a TurboIDfl/fl transgenic mouse line (ROSA26em1(TurboID)Bros), enabling targeted proximity labelling and deep proteomic profiling of DRG neuron compartments via AdvillinCre. Our data reveal distinct proteomic signatures across neuronal compartments that reflect specialized neuronal functions. We provide proteomic insights into previously inaccessible nerve terminals both in the periphery (innervating the skin) and in the spinal cord. Further, using a DRG explant model of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), we uncovered novel and discrete proteome changes, highlighting neuronal vulnerability. Together, our findings provide a unique proteome atlas of the sensory neuron proteome across anatomical domains and demonstrate the utility of proximity labelling proteomics for detecting compartment-specific molecular alterations in a disease model. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for mechanistic studies of sensory neuron function and pathology."
"Humans can react remarkably quickly to novel or displaced visual stimuli when time is of the essence. Such movements are thought to be initiated by a subcortical fast visuomotor network, but it is unclear how this network declines with age. Past work in the upper limb has detailed delayed reaching corrections to jumped visual stimuli in the elderly, but the underlying mechanisms contributing to these changes of the fast visuomotor network are poorly understood. Conversely, work in the lower limb has reported delayed muscle recruitment during obstacle avoidance, but such findings may be confounded by age-related challenges in postural control. The output of the fast visuomotor network can be quantified by measuring express visuomotor responses (EVRs), which are the earliest and very short-latency bursts of muscle activity that follow visual target presentation. Here, we compare the prevalence, latency, and magnitude of EVRs in elderly (58-80 years old) and younger (18-25 years old) participants performing visually-guided reaches. We also investigated the impact of postural stability by having participants reach either while seated on a stable chair, or on a wobble stool. Both the elderly and younger cohorts expressed EVRs, but EVRs in the elderly were comparatively less frequent, and had longer latencies and smaller magnitude. Postural instability had no effects on these outcomes. Our results suggest age-related declines in the fast visuomotor network, potentially resulting from deterioration of underlying circuits and a prioritization of stability over speed. This study serves as an important standard for future research investigating clinical populations.

"Mammalian STE20-like kinases MST1 and MST2 are the conserved Hippo kinases known for their importance in organ development and tumor suppression. Notably, humans and mice lacking these kinases have increased susceptibility to infection, indicating a role of MST1/2 in immunity. In macrophages that play a critical role in host immunity, MST1/2 are proteolytically cleaved to coordinate different forms of programmed cell death, including apoptosis and pyroptosis. This cleavage event occurs when the innate immune sensors, inflammasomes, are activated by the bacterial pathogen, Legionella pneumophila, or damage-associated molecular patterns. In this report, we determine MST1/2 cleavage in macrophages under various inflammatory conditions and challenges with pathogenic bacteria. The sterile molecules ATP and nigericin induce MST1/2 cleavage and apoptosis when the NLRP3 inflammasome and GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis are activated. Remarkably, in conditions without NLRP3 or GSDMD activation, MST1/2 are still cleaved by caspases to promote cell death in macrophages treated with these sterile molecules. During infection, wildtype macrophages trigger MST1/2 cleavage and apoptosis against L. pneumophila and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis but preferentially activate GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella enterica Typhimurium. Interestingly, GSDMD knockout macrophages opt to cleave MST1/2 and undergo apoptosis in response to P. aeruginosa and S. enterica, suggesting an interplay between GSDMD and MST1/2. Together, macrophages funnel apoptotic death signals through MST1/2 cleavage upon stimulation of the inflammatory molecules and pathogens, which illustrates the broad implications of the host Hippo kinases in infections and sterile inflammation."
"Microbial communities have evolved diverse strategies to metabolize similar substrates, shaped by environmental pressures and interspecies interactions. Comparative analyses across extreme and host-associated ecosystems are essential for uncovering novel microbial diversity, functional adaptations, and enzymes with industrial relevance. Here, we present a comparative metagenomic analysis of two ecologically distinct environments, highly alkaline-saline soda lakes, and the host-associated rumen to investigate microbial diversity, metabolic potential, and carbohydrate-active enzyme (CAZyme) repertoires. Taxonomic profiling revealed distinct microbial signatures: soda lake microbiomes were dominated by Proteobacteria, particularly Halomonas, and Nitrincola, while the rumen was enriched in Bacteroidota, Fibrobacteres, and Firmicutes, with Prevotella and Fibrobacter as key taxa. The soda lake MAGs exhibit greater evolutionary divergence, suggesting the presence of novel microbial lineages. Codon usage profiling revealed distinct patterns of GC3 bias, suggesting divergent translational optimization strategies shaped by environmental constraints. CAZyme profiling uncovered ecosystem-specific glycoside hydrolase repertoires, with the rumen enriched in plant fiber-degrading enzymes and soda lakes exhibiting broader GH diversity adapted to high salinity and alkalinity. These findings highlight distinct microbial and enzymatic strategies for carbon cycling and position soda lakes as promising reservoirs of extremophile-adapted enzymes for biotechnological applications."
"The ends of linear chromosomes require protection from host repair machinery that otherwise will mistake them for damaged DNA. The E. coli bacteriophage N15 harbors a linear genome with covalently closed hairpin ends formed by the phage-encoded telomere resolvase TelN. The double-strand break repair complex Mre11-Rad50 (MR) specifically targets DNA termini, posing a direct threat to N15 genome integrity, yet how hairpin telomeres evade host nuclease degradation in bacteria remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that TelN is essential and sufficient to protect hairpin telomeres from MR processing in E. coli. Using a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches, we show that this protective function requires both TelN sequence-specific DNA binding and species-specific protein- protein interactions. Notably, we found that protection is independent of TelNs resolution activity and does not require the C-terminal domain of TelN. Our findings reveal a potentially broad mechanism of telomere protection, providing insights into a conserved regulation of MR activity at chromosome ends across the tree of life."
"Spatial transcriptomics experiments greatly benefit from brighter signals that improve detection efficiency and shorten imaging times. Here, we introduce a new enzyme-free signal amplification method inspired by the kinetic proofreading principle, in which short oligonucleotide probes are iteratively deposited at their target site and covalently photo-crosslinked to the cell, forming highly stable DNA assemblies. The method results in more than 500-fold signal amplification and supports multiplex readout capabilities."
"Tandem repeats (TRs) are pervasive in eukaryotic genomes and play key roles in genome organization, evolution, and function, particularly in complex regions such as centromeres and subtelomeres. Although long-read sequencing technologies have improved the resolution of these regions, existing methods remain limited in their ability to systematically and accurately characterize large-scale TRs. Here, we introduce VAMPIRE, a k-mer-based computational tool for comprehensive TR discovery, annotation, and quantification. Unlike previous methods, VAMPIRE enables reference-free, fine-grained decomposition of both simple and complex TRs, capturing motif variation in sequence, length, and structure with high sensitivity and scalability. Applied to complete telomere-to-telomere (T2T) human and nonhuman primate (NHP) genome assemblies, VAMPIRE reveals previously unrecognized high-order repeat inversions within human centromeres--an underappreciated evolutionary mechanism contributing to centromere diversity. Additionally, the tool identifies lineage-specific and expanded TRs, including human-specific STR/VNTR expansions and NHP-specific subtelomeric heterochromatin (e.g., pCht/StSat), underscoring their dynamic turnover and structural complexity. VAMPIRE provides a robust and scalable framework for TR analysis in the era of long-read sequencing, with broad utility across human genetics, evolutionary biology, and the study of complex TRs in non-model organisms."
"SignificanceMacroscopic Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging (MFLI) is a powerful, non-invasive imaging modality that offers robust, physiologically relevant contrast largely independent of fluorophore concentration, excitation intensity, and tissue signal attenuation. However, accurately determining the depth of signal origin remains challenging, potentially leading to ambiguity in biological interpretation. Here, we present a novel optical correction method that effectively eliminates surface signal bias, such as that from skin in preclinical imaging, without the need for chemical clearance. This advancement supports the robust applicability of MFLI in translational research.

AimEstablishment of a High Spatial Frequency-Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging (HSF-FLI) framework to selectively isolate subsurface fluorescence (deeper signals) from surface fluorescence, while preserving the accuracy of lifetime estimation.

ApproachA modulation transfer function (MTF) that relates spatial frequency to penetration depth was derived using Monte Carlo eXtreme (MCX) simulations (for physics-based modeling) and validated with agar-based capillary phantoms on a time-gated ICCD-DMD system. Depth-independent fluorescence was decomposed into surface and subsurface components through structured three-phase sinusoidal illumination, and nonlinear least squares fitting was applied to recover lifetime or lifetime based parameters maps. HSF-FLI was demonstrated in vivo in mouse models bearing tumor xenogratfs and was cross validated with ex vivo measurements.

ResultsWe extensively characterized the performance of High Spatial Frequency-Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging (HSF-FLI) through simulations and tissue-mimicking phantoms. The approach was further validated in vivo by assessing drug delivery in preclinical models using MFLI-FRET (Forster Resonance Energy Transfer).

ConclusionBy coupling structured illumination with physics-based depth modeling, HSF-FLI delivers accurate, depth-selective lifetime readouts, setting the stage for robust and fast FLI implementation in translational studies."
"BackgroundPregnancy affects almost every organ and system, including the microorganisms that resides in the gastrointestinal track, the gut microbiota. Pregnancy hormones, such as progesterone and estradiol, alter the composition of the maternal gut microbiota, directly and indirectly, and in turn, the gastrointestinal microorganism can modify the activity of reproductive hormones. While the levels of pregnancy hormones depend on the fetal sex, the role of fetal sex in the maternal gut microbiota composition and function has not been explored yet.

MethodsUsing publicly available microbial sequencing data from a cohort of 485 pregnant women in Guangzhou, China, we identified taxonomical and predicted metabolic signatures associated with fetal sex and gestational age using zero-inflated Gaussian models and linear models, respectively, correcting for pre-pregnancy BMI, maternal age, parity, and residency status. Further, we determined sex-specific co-abundance microbial networks using SPIEC-EASI.

ResultsWe observed higher diversity levels in male than in female pregnancies and identified multiple microbial species and predicted microbial enzymes that were differentially abundant between the fetal sex groups, such as increased levels of Tyzerrella and {beta}-glucuronidase in female pregnancies, respectively. {beta}-glucuronidase deconjugates glucuronide-bound estrogens into free estrogens and glucuronic acid. Further, the microbial co-abundance networks between the male and female pregnancies were distinct, with efficient information transfer being representative of the female network while the male network was characterized by a larger number of competitive or exclusion interactions between microbial species. While the two networks had similar core communities, there were distinct connections between hormone metabolizing microbes, with {beta}-glucuronidase expressing microbes being more highly connected in the female network.

ConclusionsOur study suggests that differences in the maternal-fetal interactions, such as fetus/placenta-produced hormone levels, may affect and be affected by the composition of the gut microbiota of pregnant individuals in a sex-specific manner. A better understanding of the relationship between fetal sex and the maternal gut microbiota may improve maternal health and fetal outcomes.

Plain English SummaryThe adequate functioning of the microbial communities that reside in the maternal gastrointestinal tract is essential for normal fetal development and their abnormal behavior has been associated with multiple conditions such as preterm birth, gestational diabetes, or depression. Yet, male and female fetuses interact differently with the maternal systems, in part due to the differences in fetal/placental-produced sex hormones. As studies outside pregnancy have shown that estrogen and progesterone metabolites can affect and be affected by the gut microbiota, fetal sex may have direct and indirect effects on maternal outcomes. Understanding these differences could enable better tailoring of prenatal care.

"AMPA-subtype glutamate receptors (AMPARs), composed of subunits GluA1-4, mediate fast, excitatory synaptic transmission in the brain. After glutamate binding, AMPAR ion channels exhibit multiple subconductance states that tune neuronal responses to glutamate. GluA4 is the rarest subunit in the brain but is enriched in interneurons. Rising evidence points to the role of GluA4 AMPARs in the development of neurological diseases, but the structural mechanisms of GluA4 function have remained enigmatic. Here, from bilayer recordings and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), we report the unique features of GluA4 AMPARs that tune receptor function. We find that GluA4 AMPARs have a canonical ""Y"" shaped architecture where local dimer pairs are domain-swapped between the amino terminal domain (ATD) and ligand binding domain (LBD), both of which comprise the extracellular domain. All four LBDs are glutamate bound yet open the GluA4 ion channel by asymmetric hinging in all channel helices. We observe that the glutamate-saturated LBD has conformational plasticity, and the different conformations of the LBD tune the ion channel gate below. These data provide a framework for understanding how channel subconductance can occur during conditions of saturating glutamate, outline the unique properties of GluA4, expand our understanding of conformational plasticity in AMPARs, and will inform therapeutic design."
"Rigidity sensing enables cells to detect and respond to extracellular matrix stiffness, directing survival and apoptotic decisions. Tropomyosin 2.1 (Tpm2.1), a key actin-binding protein, is essential for this process and is frequently downregulated in cancer. While Tpm2.1 overexpression restores rigidity sensing and suppresses malignant growth, the downstream pathways governing cell fate remain poorly defined. Here, we show that Tpm2.1-mediated rigidity sensing represses anchorage-independent growth by downregulating oncogenic networks, including PI3K-Akt and EphA2 signaling. Unexpectedly, a majority of Tpm2.1-overexpressing cells remained viable in suspension, revealing a previously unrecognized decoupling between rigidity sensing and anoikis. Transcriptomic profiling of apoptotic and non-apoptotic cells in suspension identified compensatory survival programs marked by PI3K-Akt activation and induction of cell-cell adhesion genes. These findings uncover a dominant anoikis-resistant state that persists despite cytoskeletal normalization, suggesting that rigidity sensing alone is insufficient to reestablish anchorage dependence in cancer cells."
"The cytoskeleton""s ability to contract and propagate forces is the fundamental mechanism behind cell morphology, division and migration. This can only occur if the network is sufficiently connected, yet a rigorous description of the connectivity requirements has never been provided. In this work we focused on the polarity-sorting contraction mechanism and showed that connectivity is not determined by the spatial distribution of filaments alone, but by the interconnectivity between the dual network of filaments and motors. We developed a method to quantify filament-motor connectivity as a function of motor length, filament length distributions, and the densities of each component. Using this framework, we derived a general theory that predicts when a network is sufficiently connected to allow global or local contraction. We validated our predictions with computer simulations and introduced a novel metric to distinguish between these outcomes. Our findings show that the conditions for local and global contraction in the presence of fiber dynamics correspond, respectively, to the pulsatile and steady-state contraction behaviors observed in vivo. All results are independent of filament rigidity, making our conclusions applicable to both actin and microtubule networks. Lastly, we discuss how those outcomes are affected by the introduction of crosslinking proteins, which - despite not actively generating forces of their own - can promote global contractility at small concentrations even in networks made of short and/or rigid filaments."
"Summary paragraphViruses are obligate intracellular parasites and viral infections lead to massive host cell rearrangement to support the rapid generation of progeny. Host take-over and remodelling include formation of viral-induced compartments for viral genome replication and/or assembly. While viruses infecting bacteria, bacteriophages or phages, have been extensively characterized in vitro, the molecular mechanisms underlying the viral cycle inside the crowded cytoplasm remain unclear. Here, we investigate the spatial reorganization of SPP1-infected bacteria under near-native conditions by electron cryo tomography. The most prominent feature is the formation of a large viral DNA (vDNA) compartment from which ribosomes are excluded. In SPP1 infection, there is no membrane nor proteinaceous shell surrounding these compartments. Also, we identified novel key intermediates in virus assembly: open precursors of procapsid lattice were found at the cytoplasmic membrane in a process that requires expression of the portal protein. Next, DNA-free procapsids relocate inside the vDNA compartment where vDNA is packed in a stepwise manner. Finally, DNA-filled capsids segregate to the periphery of the compartment for assembly completion and storage. Collectively, we provide comprehensive mechanistic insights into the complete viral assembly pathway of SPP1 directly in cellula and show how specific steps are coordinated inside the reorganized bacterial cell."
"Understanding biological systems requires observing features and processes across vast spatial and temporal scales, spanning nanometers to centimeters and milliseconds to days, often using multiple imaging modalities within complex native microenvironments. Yet, achieving this comprehensive view is challenging because microscopes optimized for specific tasks typically lack versatility due to inherent optical and sample handling trade-offs, and frequently suffer performance degradation from sample-induced optical aberrations in multicellular contexts. Here, we present MOSAIC, a reconfigurable microscope that integrates multiple advanced imaging techniques including light-sheet, label-free, super-resolution, and multi-photon, all equipped with adaptive optics. MOSAIC enables non-invasive imaging of subcellular dynamics in both cultured cells and live multicellular organisms, nanoscale mapping of molecular architectures across millimeter-scale expanded tissues, and structural/functional neural imaging within live mice. MOSAIC facilitates correlative studies across biological scales within the same specimen, providing an integrated platform for broad biological investigation."
"SummaryStatistical methods that quantify the selection coefficient associated with alleles provide critical insights into the evolutionary processes underlying organismal adaptation. Among these approaches, CLUES2 was recently developed to estimate selection coefficients for alleles using a statistical framework that captures the maximum amount of information present in genomic data, making it a state-of-the-art method for identifying variation under selection. However, before executing this approach, users first need to apply Relate, a genealogy-based approach, to their data to generate the input files for CLUES2. Moreover, completing this pre-processing step inherently assumes that users have sufficient expertise to successfully run the Relate software. Here, we present the CLUES2 Companion package, which contains user-friendly pipelines that seamlessly apply Relate to multiple sites within a target genomic region and then execute the CLUES2 software to estimate selection coefficients for these sites. CLUES2 Companion also has the capability to present the output of CLUES2 analyses in tabular and graphical formats. In addition, as a new feature, we adapted Relate and CLUES2 to estimate the age of onset of a selective sweep of derived variation, expanding the functionality of our package.

ResultsTo demonstrate the utility of our approach, we applied CLUES2 Companion to polymorphisms in the MCM6 gene on Chromosome 2 (including the known variants associated with lactase persistence) in the European Finnish, Middle Eastern Bedouin, and East African Maasai populations from the 1000 Genomes Project, the Human Genome Diversity Project (HGDP), and the haplotype map (HapMap) Project Phase 3, respectively. Our analyses uncovered significant selection coefficient estimates at the persistence-associated T-13910 allele (rs4988235; s = 0.09986, CI: 0.08678 - 0.11294) in the Finnish, the G-13915 allele (rs41380347; s = 0.09981, CI: 0.06515 - 0.13448) in the Bedouin, and the C-14010 allele (rs145946881; s = 0.09981, CI: 0.08799 - 0.11163) in the Maasai, indicative of a classic selective sweep. Furthermore, we inferred the age of onset of selection at these alleles to be 9,100 years ago (CI: 6,552 - 10,612 years ago) in the Finnish, 7,700 years ago (CI: 1,864 - 8,064 years ago) in the Bedouin, and 4,900 years ago (CI: 3,864 - 5,936 years ago) in the Maasai, respectively, which coincide well with other estimates based on genetic and archaeological data. To further validate our dating method, we simulated several datasets containing SNPs with known ages of onset of selection, s estimates, and genomic positions using a selective sweep framework implemented in msprime and then applied CLUES2 Companion to the simulated datasets. Using this approach, CLUES2 Companion produced similar estimates of selection onset as the ones specified in the simulations, corroborating the dependability of our method. Overall, CLUES2 Companion is a versatile package that enables users to efficiently explore, interpret, and report evidence of selection in genomic datasets, complementing the CLUES2 software.

"Advances in fluorescence microscopy have enabled high-resolution tracking of individual biomolecules in living cells. However, accurate estimation of diffusion parameters from single-particle trajectories remains challenging due to static and dynamic localization errors inherent in these measurements. While previous studies have characterized how such errors affect mean-squared displacement (MSD) analysis, practical guidelines for minimizing them during data acquisition and correcting them during analysis are still lacking. Here, we combine theoretical modeling and simulations to evaluate how exposure time and sampling rate influence the accuracy of MSD-based inference under fractional Brownian motion (FBM), a canonical model of anomalous diffusion. We demonstrate that decoupling exposure and sampling times enables escape from the error-prone regime, thus improving inference accuracy, and that incorporating an offset in nonlinear MSD fitting substantially improves the estimation of the anomalous diffusion exponent. We validate this framework using trajectories of cytoplasmic particles in Escherichia coli, recovering consistent diffusion parameters across multiple data sets. Our findings offer practical strategies to improve both experimental design and data analysis in single-particle tracking of live or synthetic systems."
"Profiling of miRNAs is important to understand how they regulate biological pathways and contribute to diseases. With current technological advancements leading to capture of voluminous biological data, it is interesting and challenging to explore new methods that can discover disease-data associations and provide better insights into the underlying mechanisms of diseases. Such understanding may also help prevent severe pathogenesis of the disease and contribute to knowledge required for effective drug development. This paper proposes a unified approach, D-CoMEx, to mine miRNA biomarkers from dysregulated pathways associated with Parkinsons disease (PD) and Breast Cancer (BC). The approach integrates a co-expression network (CEN) module extraction technique with a differential analysis method to capture interactions between miRNAs and dysregulated pathways. Our method identifies more statistically and biologically significant dysregulated pathways compared to DCGL, MODA, and DiffCoEx. We present three evidence-backed recommendations supporting strong associations between miRNAs and dysregulated pathways, demonstrating that D-CoMEx extracts biologically relevant miRNA biomarkers linked to disease progression."
"ObjectiveTo investigate the effects of Lycium barbarum polysaccharides (LBP) on neurobehavioral impairments in mice with ischemic stroke and explore the underlying mechanisms.

MethodsA middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model was established using the filament occlusion method to evaluate the therapeutic effects of LBP on pathological brain tissue damage after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (I/R). Mice were randomly divided into three groups: sham surgery (Sham), I/R, and I/R + LBP. Behavioral tests, including the Y-maze test, rotarod test, and balance beam test, were systematically conducted to assess the impact of LBP on neurobehavioral impairments. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to quantify peripheral blood levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), reflecting inflammatory status.

ResultsLBP significantly ameliorated neuroinflammation and oxidative stress in mice with cerebral I/R injury, demonstrating marked protection against I/R-induced neurofunctional damage. LBP notably improved motor and memory deficits caused by ischemic stroke. Compared to the I/R group, LBP improved neuroinflammation and oxidative stress levels post-I/R injury.

ConclusionThis study demonstrates that LBP alleviates ischemic stroke-induced neurological damage by attenuating inflammatory responses."
"Assessing the functional role of species in a changing world is critical for effectively preserving ecosystems. Intuitively, this role should relate to how the loss of a species impacts a function. We develop a general approach to define the functional contribution of a species that interacts with others. Using experimental data from a ciliate microcosm experiment, we infer species dynamic contribution based on the observed functional impact of their removal. Using both model simulations and empirical data, we demonstrate that dynamic contributions are generically unrelated to their biomasses and traits associated with the function, but rather reflect a species overall effect on others, and the level of functioning in the community without that species. Our novel characterization of the functional contribution of species reveals that, due to biotic interactions, rare species that do not possess unique functional traits are just as likely as any other species to be functionally important."
"Canalization, or the maintenance of trait values regardless of environmental or genetic variability, is fundamentally important for maintaining developmental stability. While this concept was described decades ago, we still know relatively little about how canalization is influenced by environmental stress, how it is shaped by natural selection, and the genetic underpinnings of canalization. In this study, we examined natural selection on microenvironmental canalization in rice (Oryza sativa) in wet and dry field conditions. We measured developmental stability in genetically identical replicates obtained from geographically widespread Indica and Japonica rice accessions, providing precise estimates of canalization in thousands of plants. We found that drought stress decreased canalization, showing that stress can increase instability. We also found evidence that canalization can evolve, given that canalization of several traits was heritable and under selection. We further uncovered specific genes underlying canalization, with genetic mapping and functional genetic experiments showing that the bZIP transcription factor-encoding gene OsTGA5/rTGA2.3, which is part of a module that balances stress response and plant growth, regulates canalization of several traits in an environment-dependent manner. At a genome-wide scale, canalization was associated with lower gene expression stochasticity at an earlier life stage, indicating that expression variation can reduce canalization and increase instability. Trait canalization was also positively correlated to temperature at accessions source environments, suggesting that selection on canalization can vary among environments. Overall, our study provides novel insights into the molecular genetic basis of environmental differences in developmental stability and how it might be shaped by selection.

SignificanceMechanisms stabilizing organismal development in response to genetic mutations or environmental stressors (canalization) have been reported for numerous animals and plants, but their underlying genetic basis and whether they may be shaped by selection remain unclear. Here, we report patterns of drought-induced trait decanalization in populations of rice (Oryza sativa) grown in field environments. We determined that trait canalization is heritable and can evolve separately from trait means. We identified the gene OsTGA5, part of a regulatory module shaping trade-offs between growth and stress responses, as impacting trait canalization. Plants with less noisy gene expression and evolving in warmer environments display greater developmental stability, contributing to the notion that canalization in rice may be adaptive."
"The processing of materials at aqueous interfaces has enabled the generation of compartmentalization structures with broad biomedical interest. Controlling the porous structure of soft materials to create micro-sized pores that enable cell migration is crucial for tissue development and regeneration. This work presents liquid-core soft compartments formed via interfacial polyelectrolyte complexation between alginate and {varepsilon}-poly-L-lysine, which membrane physical properties are tailored by adjusting the composition of the prototypical aqueous two-phase system. The additional interfacial dynamics provided by the presence of the immiscible polymer phases promoted the organization of porous architectures in the membrane. Fiber-shaped tubular structures enable adhesion and migration of mesenchymal stem cells to surrounding fibrin matrices and its invasion, behavior that was significantly improved in conditions of higher membrane porosity. While preserving the single-step approach of the established technology, the interfacial materials with tailorable porosity can be processed for applications in tissue engineering and regeneration."
"Difficulty in resolving spatially overlapping barcodes is a major bottleneck for imaging-based spatial genomics methods. Here, we present an approach for untangling overlapping barcodes by using strong encoding and global optimization to reduce spurious solutions resulting from recombinations of barcodes. We demonstrate experimentally that cellular regions with average local densities of 127 barcodes per {micro}m2 can be decoded with an estimated FDR of less than 4%, enabling a new type of super-resolution microscopy by coding."
"The origin of life is one of the most compelling questions in science. While experimental prebiotic chemistry has produced a wide range of reactions and plausible pathways, the resulting data remain fragmented across numerous publications and disciplinary journals. Here, we introduce ChemOrigins, an open-access, community-curated knowledge graph that organizes experimentally supported prebiotic reactions. By representing molecules, reactions, conditions, and literature sources as interconnected nodes, ChemOrigins enables modular grouping of reactions and supports complex, query-driven exploration via a graph database architecture. We demonstrate the utility of this framework through text-based searches, reaction network expansions, and the interactive visualization of user-annotated chemical modules. Unlike generative models, ChemOrigins prioritizes curated, evidence-based content and fosters community contributions through expert annotations and a user-friendly interface. As a structured resource, ChemOrigins is designed to complement existing chemical databases and serve as a foundation for computational, educational, and theoretical research in the origins-of-life field."

"GDT - Gene Dictionary Tool - is a protocol for the creation and implementation of a gene dictionary across any type of annotated genomes. The final output, a gene dictionary (.gdt file), is meant to be not only comprehensive, but also versionable, Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR). The protocol is divided in a Python library and Jupyter notebooks that permit users to investigate their datasets incrementally. Here, we showcase GDTs functionalities by creating a gene dictionary of organelle genes."
"To meet the needs of a large pharmaceutical organization, we set out to create S3Mirror - an application for transferring large genomic sequencing datasets between S3 buckets quickly, reliably, and observably. We used the DBOS-Transact durable execution framework to achieve these goals and benchmarked the performance and cost of the application. S3Mirror is an open source DBOS Python application that can run in a variety of environments, including DBOS Cloud Pro where it runs as much as 40x faster than AWS DataSync at a fraction of the cost. Moreover, S3Mirror is resilient to failures and allows for real-time file-wise observability of ongoing and past transfers."
"Myriad studies support the claim that active learning improves student academic performance in STEM, yet lecture remains the dominant form of instruction. Faculty offer multiple reasons for not using active learning with many expressing confusion as to what active learning is. Contributing to that confusion is the fact there are a multitude of named active learning methods and varied implementations of each. In an effort to better understand how specific elements of active learning might contribute to enhanced academic performance, we used a more fine-grained classroom observation tool, PORTAAL, to observe teaching practices across 157 STEM courses. We used a principal component analysis to reduce the observed teaching practices to specific sets of practices. We found a continuum of implementation of teaching practices that ranged from instruction-centered to learner-centered. The instruction-centered practices included high Blooms level questions, students working alone, instructors answering and explaining questions, and providing alternative answers. The learner-centered practices were volunteer or randomly-called students explaining answers, instructors prompting students logic, and instructors giving positive feedback. Using a linear regression to analyze the data from all courses, we found medium and medium-high levels of learner-centered teaching practices correlated with higher student exam performance compared to instruction-centered practices. We observed a similar pattern when analyzing data only from introductory courses. We also analyzed interactions of both binary gender and first generation status with learner-centered teaching on exam scores.

We propose that when instructors use the learner-centered practices, they shift the responsibility of the intellectual work of the problem-the learning-to the students, which may result in improved exam performance. Even moderate levels of these learner-centered practices have a positive correlation with exam performance. Faculty can incorporate these key elements of learner-centered practices into their own teaching based on their comfort level, course content, and abilities of their students."
"Spontaneous epimutations--stochastic changes in cytosine methylation--can persist across generations in plants and are thought to contribute to phenotypic variation. Although epimutations are increasingly studied for their potential long-term effects, it remains unclear why their accumulation varies across genotypes. Here, we tracked DNA methylation across ten generations in [~]400 mutation accumulation lineages derived from [~]70 Arabidopsis Ler x Cvi recombinant inbred lines. Treating epimutation rates as quantitative molecular traits, we mapped a major QTL to a Cvi-derived deletion near VIM2 and VIM4, two genes involved in CG methylation (mCG) maintenance. We show that this deletion rapidly reduces genome-wide methylation to a lower steady-state and compromises mCG maintenance fidelity across generations, resulting in a [~]1.5-fold increase in epimutation rates. Genotypes with elevated rates exhibited accelerated epigenetic drift and phenotypic divergence. Our findings support a punctuated-equilibrium model of mCG evolution, in which sudden disruptions to methylation homeostasis can destabilize epigenetic inheritance over longer time-scales."
"The rate and spectrum of somatic mutations can diverge from that of germline mutations. This is because somatic tissues experience different mutagenic processes than germline tissues. Here, we use nanorate sequencing (NanoSeq) to identify somatic mutations in Arabidopsis shoots with high sensitivity. We report a somatic mutation rate of 3.6x10-8 mutations/bp, [~]4-5x the germline mutation rate. Somatic mutations displayed elevated signatures consistent with oxidative damage, UV damage, and transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair. Both somatic and germline mutations were enriched in transposable elements and depleted in genes, but this depletion was greater in germline mutations. Somatic mutation rate correlated with proximity to the centromere, DNA methylation, chromatin accessibility, and gene/TE content, properties which were also largely true of germline mutations. We note DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility have different predicted effects on mutation rate for genic and non-genic regions; DNA methylation associates with a greater increase in mutation rate when in non-genic regions, and accessible chromatin associates with a lower mutation rate in non-genic regions but a higher mutation rate in genic regions. Together, these results characterize key differences and similarities in the genomic distribution of somatic and germline mutations."
"BackgroundCircadian regulation enables plants to coordinate cellular processes with daily environmental cycles, yet the dynamics and hierarchy of the clock across cells and tissue types remains poorly understood.

ResultsWe developed a 24 hour single nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) circadian time course of the mature Arabidopsis thaliana leaf to characterize circadian regulation across tissues. We captured [~]30,000 nuclei across seven circadian time points, recovering all major leaf cell types. We identified over 7,400 genes with cluster-resolved circadian regulation, and used coexpression analysis to define five major temporal expression clades shared across all cell types. We leveraged these assignments to identify genes with cell type-specific temporal shifts in expression. Single cell gene regulatory networks (scGRNs) were generated for each cluster through GENIE3, identifying many shared and unique transcription factor (TF) target interactions across clusters. A close examination of CCA1 targets identified Photosystem II repair components in a subset of mesophyll cells and a large number of auxin-associated genes in only a handful of clusters despite robust expression in other clusters, suggestive of cell type-specific CCA1 target regulation.

ConclusionsOur results demonstrate the extent to which circadian transcriptional regulation is present in the mature Arabidopsis leaf, and highlight the immense complexity in cell type specific regulation. This dataset provides a high-resolution resource for dissecting circadian gene regulation at cellular resolution and advances our understanding of tissue-specific clock dynamics in plants."
"Infilitration of Agrobacterium tumefaciens into Nicotiana benthamiana has become a foundational technique in plant biology, enabling efficient delivery of transgenes in planta with technical ease, robust signal, and relatively high throughput. Despite transient expressions prevalence in disciplines such as synthetic biology, little work has been done to describe and address the variability inherent in this system, a concern for experiments that rely on highly quantitative readouts. In a comprehensive analysis of N. benthamiana agroinfiltration experiments, we model sources of variability that affect transient expression. Our findings emphasize the need to validate normalization methods under the specific conditions of each study, as distinct normalization schemes do not always reduce variation either within or between experiments. Using a dataset of 1,813 plants collected over three years, we develop a comprehensive model of variation in N. benthamiana transient expression, using power analysis to determine the number of individual plants required for a given effect size. Drawing on our longitudinal data, these findings inform practical guidelines for minimizing variability through strategic experimental design and power analysis, providing a foundation for more robust and reproducible use of N. benthamiana in quantitative plant biology and synthetic biology applications."
"Numerous RNA modifications are known in prokaryotes, but their dynamics and function in regulation remain largely unexplored. In Escherichia coli, three methyltransferases catalyze the 5-methylcytosine (m5C) modification in ribosomal RNA. Here, we introduce m5C-rolling circle loop-mediated isothermal amplification (m5C-Rol-LAMP) as a novel qPCR-based method that offers high sensitivity and site- specific resolution to detect and quantify mC in total RNA. When applying m5C-Rol-LAMP to E. coli under heat stress (45 {degrees}C), we observe a site-specific increase of mC at position 1407 of 16S rRNA from 77% to 89%, while m5C levels at positions 967 (16S) and 1962 (23S) remain unchanged. In recovered cells (at 37{degrees}C), the m5C abundance partially returns to the no stress level. Under oxidative stress, the level of mC1407 also increases, but remains high in recovered cells. These results demonstrate for the first time a reversible, stress-dependent and site-specific change in the rRNA modification level of a bacterium. m5C-Rol-LAMP is a powerful and easy-to-use tool for studying m5C in all RNA species, allowing the quantitative and site-specific detection of this modification."
"In most Bacillus thuringiensis strains, the insecticidal cry genes are transcribed during sporulation by RNA-polymerases containing sigma factors E or K, leading to the formation of an insecticidal crystal within the mother cell along spore development. Some strains, such as the kurstaki HD1, a parent of commercial strains, also release insecticidal proteins Cry1I and Vip3A in the extracellular medium. vip3A gene expression is activated by the transcriptional regulator VipR at the onset of the stationary phase. Here, we expanded the VipR regulon to all the insecticidal-encoding genes of strain HD1 by identifying the VipR-binding box and conducting transcription assays. Unexpectedly, a VipR box was located in the promoter region of a putative N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase gene upstream cry1Ac in strain kurstaki HD73, closely related to the HD1 but devoid of vipR. We demonstrated that introducing a functional vipR in this strain leads to the expression of the amidase-cry1Ac operon, resulting in an early and increased production of Cry1Ac. Investigating this phenotype, we showed that Cry1Ac was produced in a VipR-dependent manner in an HD73 {Delta}spo0A mutant. Similarly, an HD1{Delta}spo0A strain forms insecticidal crystals and produces all the insecticidal proteins encoded in its genome, including cry2Ab previously considered unexpressed in strain HD1. Finally, a genomic analysis revealed the presence of putative VipR-binding sequences upstream from insecticidal protein-encoding genes in several biopesticidal strains. Overall, our results break the dogma on the regulation of cry1A and cry2A genes and provide evidence of sporulation-independent Cry toxin production in biopesticidal Bt strains.

ImportanceBacillus thuringiensis is a remarkably efficient entomopathogen due to its ability to produce various insecticidal proteins, such as Cry or Vip. This property has made it a highly effective biopesticide used worldwide. Our work breaks the dogma of cry1 and cry2 genes being regulated solely by sporulation-specific sigma factors and thus exclusively expressed during this process. Indeed, we demonstrated that the VipR regulator controls the transcription of all the insecticidal protein genes encoded by a strain closely related to that of commercial biopesticides and turns on their expression at the beginning of the stationary phase, leading to the production of insecticidal crystals independently of sporulation. By providing new knowledge on the regulation of insecticidal protein genes, these findings bring new insight for the genetic improvement of Bt strains used as commercial biopesticides."
"In this study, we conducted an X-ray crystallographic fragment screening against protein kinase A (PKA) utilizing a library of natural product-like fragments. We resolved 36 fragment-bound structures, corresponding to a hit rate of 41%. Nine fragments bound within the ATP site, nine peripherally, and 18 interacted with both the ATP and peripheral sites. One fragment binds to the same site as the approved allosteric kinase inhibitor asciminib, while another induces an unexpected conformational change. Systematic database mining revealed that both the fragments and their natural product parents have not been previously associated with PKA or kinase activity. A scaffold/chemotype analysis further underscored their novelty. Cheminformatics analyses confirmed that these fragments occupy a distinct chemical space, enriched in saturation, spatial complexity and molecular three-dimensional character compared to kinase binders from reference datasets. These properties have previously been linked to increased selectivity, reduced CYP450 inhibition, and higher overall clinical success rates.

"The Bow River (Alberta, Canada) has a well-documented decline in its rainbow trout fishery, with several stressors attributed to this decline including whirling disease (WD). This study evaluated whether anglers could detect recruitment failure in WD-impacted areas of the Bow River drainage using a smartphone app-based citizen science initiative. Anglers reported age 1 and 2 rainbow and cutthroat trout identified by size distribution, estimated from a provincial database, across 4 sub-watersheds with varying densities of Myxobolus cerebralis actinospores (TAMs), a known predictor of WD severity. TAM densities ranged from undetectable (0 TAMs/L - Waiparous Creek) to moderate (< 0.01 TAMs/L - Sheep and Highwood Rivers) and high (> 0.01 TAMs/L - Jumpingpound Creek). No fish were captured in Jumpingpound Creek over 20.2 angling hours. The Highwood and Sheep Rivers had catch rates of 0.4 and 0.2 age 1 and 2 trout per hour over 30.6 and 27.7 hours, respectively. Waiparous Creek, where WD was absent, had a significantly higher catch rate of 2.2 trout per hour over 20.3 hours. These findings suggest that self-reported angler data can potentially help identify recruitment losses in WD-impacted areas, demonstrating a novel application of citizen science in fisheries research."
"DNA nanostructures are promising materials for drug delivery due to their unique topology, shape, size control, biocompatibility, structural stability and blood-brain-barrier (BBB) penetration capability. However, their cellular permeability is hindered by strong electrostatic repulsion from negatively charged cellular membranes, posing a significant obstacle to the use of DNA nanostructures as a drug delivery vehicle. Recent experimental studies have shown enhanced cellular uptake for the conjugate binary mixtures of DNA Tetrahedron (TDN) with cationic lipid N-[1-(2,3-dioleyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium chloride (DOTMA) compared to TDN alone. However, the cationic DOTMA lipids binding mechanism with the TDN nucleotides is still elusive. Using fully atomistic MD simulations, we aim to understand the molecular interactions that drive the formation and stability of the TDN-DOTMA binary complexes in a physiological environment. Our results uncovered that lipid concentration plays a crucial role in the energetics of the TDN-DOTMA association. We also report that distinct timescales are associated with the self-assembly of cationic DOTMA lipids first, followed by the complexation of self-assembled DOTMA lipid clusters with the TDN nucleotides, where electrostatics, hydrophobicity, and hydrogen bonding are the key interactions that drive the formation and stability of these complexes. These results provide molecular insights into TDN-DOTMA interactions, highlighting the lipid self-assembly dynamics, complex stability, and morphology, paving the way for the better rational design of cationic lipid functionalized DNA nanostructures for efficient drug delivery and transfection."
"Rapid volumetric rewarming methods are needed to enable the effective cryopreservation and recovery of large volumes of biological cells for therapy and banking of tissues and organs. Ultrasonic rewarming is currently under development, but its effect on cells and their post-rewarming viability has not yet been established. Here, we compare ultrasonic rewarming with the gold-standard 37{degrees}C water bath using cryovials containing cryopreserved alginate encapsulated liver spheroids. Mean rewarming rates are used to establish the exposure time to rewarm to 5{degrees}C for higher power (100 W) and lower power (20 W) ultrasonic rewarming. These electrical powers correspond to free-field pressures along the central cryovial axis of 2.8 MPa and 1.3 MPa, respectively. Ultrasonic rewarming is faster than the gold-standard (120 {+/-}5 s), taking 88 s (36% faster) and 34 s (350% faster) to rewarm to 5{degrees}C with the lower and higher powers. We measure post-rewarming liver spheroid viability and viable cell number across the 96-hour recovery period. The lower power improves viability by 1% and the higher power reduces viability by 2% on average, relative to the gold-standard. There were no significant differences in viable cell number between rewarming methods. Our findings will serve as a foundation for ultrasonic cryovial rewarming and demonstrates potential for scaling to larger volumes."
"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as key regulators in cancer, influencing gene expression, chromatin remodeling, and signaling. Evidence from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and other datasets supports their role in tumor progression. Although the human genome harbors thousands lncRNA genes, only a small subset has been validated in cancer. In this study, we used the LncBook catalog ([~]95,000 lncRNAs) to identify [~]12,500 lncRNAs with expression evidence across major TCGA cancer types. These were stratified by clinical annotations, including cancer stage (I-IV) and metastatic state (M0/M1). Using significant differential expression (z-score >|3|) for consecutive transitions, we identified a set of influential transitional lncRNAs (Tr-lncRNAs) that signify cancer transitions. Analyzing seven transitions revealed that over 70% of Tr-lncRNAs were cancer-type specific, while only 2-4% were shared across 17 major cancers. Each cancer type had 30-80 Tr-lncRNAs, with more than half uniquely expressed in one type. Most Tr-lncRNAs were previously uncharacterized. A pan-cancer analysis revealed 14 shared Tr-lncRNAs, including known ones such as XIST and H19. Our findings highlight distinct lncRNA expression patterns during cancer progression and provide new insights into cis-regulatory antisense mechanisms. We discuss the potential of Tr-lncRNAs as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets in cancer."
"The epithelium of the human gastrointestinal tract is key for controlling the absorption of small molecules and for forming a tight barrier between the gut microbiota and the host, thereby maintaining metabolic homeostasis. Both the microbiota and the barrier function of the intestinal epithelium have a role in pharmacokinetic variability of medical drugs. In this study, we developed a high-throughput workflow to assess the absorption of bacterially produced (drug) metabolites by intestinal epithelial cells through the combination of anaerobic bacterial cultures and human-intestine derived Caco2 cell cultures in a transwell system. To functionally monitor the barrier integrity during the experiments, we introduced a panel of marker compounds, whose concentration kinetics on either side of the epithelial monolayer indicates barrier integrity and transport. We employed this workflow to systematically probe the effect of different gut bacterial species on the epithelial absorption of 482 drugs and their 172 bacterially produced metabolites. While we could recapitulate known bacterial drug biotransformation reactions and expected drug metabolite absorption profiles, we also identified 33 new bacteria-drug pairs for which bacterial biotransformation alters epithelial permeability. Further, we combined the developed experimental workflow with untargeted metabolomics analysis to systematically study epithelial permeability of metabolites naturally produced by gut bacteria. Tracking the absorption kinetics of 397 bacterially produced metabolites revealed that the majority (>79%) of these metabolites do not pass the Caco2 monolayer, illustrating its role as a physical and metabolic barrier. In summary, we present a highly adaptable high-throughput workflow to quantitatively study the metabolic interactions at the intestinal microbiota-host interface which can impact pharmacokinetics, toxicokinetics, and human physiology."
"Enhancing regulatory T cell (Treg) function offers a compelling therapeutic strategy for autoimmune disease. Engineered IL-2 muteins selectively expand functional Tregs with minimal impact on other immune cells, but their potential to compromise antiviral immunity remains largely unexplored. Here, we used a murine model of Influenza A virus (Flu) infection to determine how IL-2 mutein shapes T cell responses to respiratory virus infection. IL-2 mutein administration prior to infection suppressed Flu-specific (Flu-sp) CD8 T cell responses and altered their localization and phenotype within the lungs, without affecting bystander CD8 T cells. This suppression correlated with reduced antigen presentation molecule expression on conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) early after infection but did not impact Flu-sp CD8 T cell priming. In contrast, administering IL-2 mutein during infection exacerbated disease and drove CD25-dependent expansion of Flu-sp CD8 T cells. Despite these opposing effects on effector responses, Fc.Mut24-treated mice generated robust antibody responses and protective T cell memory which were maintained for at least 170 days. These findings reveal that Fc.Mut24 has temporally distinct effects on antiviral immunity, dampening early effector responses when given before infection, but enhancing effector expansion and disease severity when delivered during infection. Our results provide critical context for the therapeutic application of IL-2 muteins and highlight the importance of treatment timing in balancing immune modulation with protective immunity."
"Regular physical exercise has been shown to improve physical and psychological well-being through a variety of mechanisms; however, the degree to which different individuals respond to exercise varies depending on sex and genetic factors. Drosophila has been used as a model organism to further understand the molecular mechanisms that underlie exercise adaptation. Essential for flies ability to adapt to exercise, octopamine is a hormone and neurotransmitter found in invertebrates that is analogous to norepinephrine. Interestingly, octopamine is also crucial for female post mating responses, and no studies to date have explored the interaction between exercise response and reproductive state in females. Here, we investigated the sexual dimorphism in exercise response by exercising male and female flies of multiple Drosophila Genetics Reference Panel (DGRP) lines and measuring fitness traits such as climbing ability and starvation resistance. Further, we were interested in how mating status might affect females ability to adapt to exercise, and whether the stress of exercise would affect fertility. Our findings show that while male flies are naturally faster climbers than female flies, females tend to be better suited to resist starvation. Additionally, we found that mating status has a significant impact on female flies climbing performance and lifespan, and exercise can have negative effects on lifespan and fertility. Surprisingly, we found that exercise has little effect on stored triglycerides, protein levels, or gene expression. DGRP genetic line was also a significant factor that influenced most phenotypes we measured, underscoring the importance of studying multiple genotypes in conjunction with other experimental variables. Results from our study suggest that female flies may experience evolutionary tradeoffs between physical activity, survival, and fertility, and whether the female has mated or not dictates how they respond to physiological stressors such as exercise."
"Schizophrenia is a complex neuropsychiatric disorder with strong genetic underpinnings, yet the molecular mechanisms linking genetic risk to disrupted brain development remain poorly understood. Transcription factors (TFs) and chromatin regulators (CRs) are increasingly implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders, where their dysregulation may disrupt neurodevelopmental programs. Despite this, systematic functional interrogation in human models has been limited. Here, we combine pooled CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screens with high- throughput single-cell multiomic profiling in hiPSC-derived neural progenitors and neurons to functionally assess 65 schizophrenia-associated genes. Based on public datasets and literature review, we selected 55 TFs and CRs, along with ten additional risk genes whose loss-of-function has been linked to schizophrenia. Our single-cell CRISPRi readouts revealed that perturbations in TFs and CRs converge on disrupting neurodevelopmental timing. CRISPRi of several factors delayed neural differentiation, whereas others, such as the knockdown of MCRS1, drove precocious neural commitment. Validation screens combined with cell cycle and metabolic indicators confirmed the differentiation-restricting or -promoting roles of these TFs and CRs.

Multimodal trajectory analysis uncovered discrete transcriptional and epigenomic states representing delayed and accelerated neurodevelopment, enriched for schizophrenia GWAS loci and disease-relevant pathways. Gene regulatory network (GRN) inference identified TCF4 and ZEB1 as critical mediators opposing the neural differentiation trajectory. Functional overexpression of these TFs followed by chromatin profiling demonstrated that TCF4 restrains, while ZEB1 promotes, neural differentiation in a stage-specific and competitive manner. Furthermore, we show that MCRS1 represses ZEB1 expression, positioning MCRS1 as a key brake on premature neurodevelopment.

Together, our study establishes a scalable framework that integrates genetic perturbation, single- cell multiomics, and GRN modeling to functionally annotate disease-linked genes. We reveal convergent regulatory axes that underlie altered neurodevelopmental timing in schizophrenia, offering mechanistic insights into how chromatin misregulation contributes to disease pathogenesis."
"Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genetic variation is the strongest genetic risk factor for late onset Alzheimers disease (LOAD). Studies on APOE genotype dependent changes have largely focused on amyloid beta (A{beta}) aggregation, disease pathology, and lipid metabolism. Recently, there has been increased interest in the relationship between metabolic function and APOE genetic variation. In this study, we examined how APOE genotype can alter metabolism in the brains of young male and female APOE3 and APOE4 targeted replacement (TR) mice. In combination with this, we also examined cell type-specific differences using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived astrocytes and neurons. We found sex and genotype dependent changes to metabolism in the brains of young APOE TR mice. Specifically, APOE4 mice show signs of metabolic stress and compensatory mechanisms in the brain. Using proteomics and stable isotope tracing metabolomics, we found that APOE4 iAstrocytes and iNeurons exhibit signs of inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, altered TCA cycle and malate-aspartate shuttle activity, and a metabolic shift toward glycolysis. Taken together, this data indicates APOE4 causes early changes to metabolism within the central nervous system. While this study establishes a relationship between APOE genotype and alterations in bioenergetics, additional studies are needed to investigate underlying mechanisms."
"SWI-SNF ATPase Brahma and Notch signalling are known to interact during development, but how this interaction is executed molecularly is not fully understood. We have investigated the molecular mechanism of Brm-Notch interaction in the context of Hox-dependent neural stem cell (NSC) apoptosis in the developing Central Nervous System (CNS) of Drosophila. Our results suggest a multi-tier regulation of NSC apoptosis by Brahma, first by regulating the expression of Drosophila CBP/p300 (Nejire) and the molecular triggers of cell death (Hox, bHLH factor Grainyhead, and Notch signalling pathway). The second mode of regulation is by direct binding of Brahma to the apoptotic enhancer and modulation of the Notch signalling pathway to regulate the RHG family of apoptotic genes, grim and reaper. Our data support a model where, in response to the apoptotic trigger, Brahma and CSL-Su(H)/Mastermind complex recruit CBP/p300 onto the apoptotic enhancer, thereby increasing the H3K27ac marks on the nucleosomes to facilitate apoptotic gene transcription."
"The rapid expansion of massively parallel sequencing technologies has enabled the development of foundation models to uncover novel biological findings. While these have the potential to significantly accelerate scientific discoveries by creating AI-driven virtual cell models, their progress has been greatly limited by the lack of large-scale high-quality perturbation data, which remains constrained due to scalability bottlenecks and assay variability. Here, we introduce ""Fix-Cryopreserve-ScRNAseq"" (FiCS) Perturb-seq, an industrialized platform for scalable Perturb-seq data generation. We demonstrate that FiCS Perturb-seq exhibits high sensitivity and low batch effects, effectively capturing perturbation-induced transcriptomic changes and recapitulating known biological pathways and protein complexes. In addition, we release X-Atlas: Orion edition (X-Atlas/Orion), the largest publicly available Perturb-seq atlas. This atlas, generated from two genome-wide FiCS Perturb-seq experiments targeting all human protein-coding genes, comprises eight million cells deeply sequenced to over 16,000 unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) per cell. Furthermore, we show that single guide RNA (sgRNA) abundance can serve as a proxy for gene knockdown (KD) efficacy. Leveraging the deep sequencing and substantial cell numbers per perturbation, we also show that stratification by sgRNA expression can reveal dose-dependent genetic effects. Taken together, we demonstrate that FiCS Perturb-seq is an efficient and scalable platform for high-throughput Perturb-seq screens. Through the release of X-Atlas/Orion, we highlight the potential of FiCS Perturb-seq to address current scalability and variability challenges in data generation, advance foundation model development that incorporates gene-dosage effects, and accelerate biological discoveries."
"The effects of ongoing anthropogenic climate change are not well known in marine diatoms, a key group of primary producers. In particular, detailed characterizations of their carbon concentrating mechanisms (CCM) are lacking, which limits the understanding of how changing ocean carbonate chemistry will impact global primary production. While the model diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana has been widely studied, contrasting results have prevented the clear elucidation of its CCM. A quantitative proteomic analysis was therefore performed across three experimental treatments (low pCO2/high pH, high pCO2/low pH, low pCO2/low pH) to discern the specific roles of proteins that can be involved in CCMs as well as other cellular processes (e.g. pH and redox regulation). This analysis revealed a hybrid CCM consisting of both biophysical and biochemical steps that facilitate increased CO2 diffusion into the cell, the formation and transport of an organic carbon intermediate into the chloroplast, the subsequent decarboxylation of this intermediate, and the facilitated diffusion of inorganic carbon from the stroma into the pyrenoid-penetrating thylakoid. No evidence supporting alternative roles for the identified CCM proteins was found. As several aspects of this CCM require further investigation, common challenges inherent to CCM research are discussed and strategies to overcome them are suggested.

HighlightExperimental manipulation of carbonate chemistry allowed for the separation of the carbon concentrating mechanism in T. pseudonana from other processes that rely on the same proteins, revealing a hybrid CCM."

"Classic cadherins are instrumental for joining cells into tissues by producing cell-cell adhesions known as adherens junctions (AJs). These morphologically diverse structures are tailored to the specific cell sites, type of cells, and particular functions. The mechanism of AJ diversification remains unknown. Here we show that two members of the {delta}-catenin protein family, p120 and plakophilin 4 (pkp4), which interact with the juxtamembrane intracellular region of classic cadherins, promote distinct types of cadherin clustering thereby contributing to AJ specialization. The type controlled by p120 is driven by interactions between cadherin-associated protein, -catenin, and actin filaments. This ""canonical"" clustering mechanism results in formation of AJs that play a major role in overall cell-cell adhesion. The type promoted by pkp4 is driven by an -catenin-independent cadherin-F-actin interaction. It generates the so-called lateral spot AJs, which apparently function in processes other than cell-cell adhesion. Collectively, our study shows how {delta}-catenins regulate a balance between different types of AJs in epithelial cells."
"Branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolism is perturbed in patients with pancreatic cancer, but the contribution of systemic or pancreas-intrinsic BCAA catabolism to pancreatic carcinogenesis is unclear. We show here that pancreas-specific loss of DBT, the E2 subunit of the branched-chain keto-acid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) complex required for BCAA oxidation, strikingly exacerbates premalignant pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) lesions in KC (p48-Cre;KrasLSL-G12D/+) mice. However, deletion of upstream enzyme BCAT2 neither phenocopied nor rescued loss of DBT in KC mice, ruling out involvement of both upstream and downstream metabolites as mediators of PanIN promotion. Instead, we observed that DBT deficiency led to loss of the kinase BCKDK, a negative regulator of the BCKDH complex, and that, remarkably, pancreas-specific loss of BCKDK phenocopied DBT deficiency in accelerating PanIN formation. These data thus support a model in which pancreas BCKDK restrains tumorigenesis. In contrast, systemic treatment of KC mice with the BCKDK inhibitor BT2, which inhibits BCKDH phosphorylation across many tissues except the pancreas, reduced PanIN formation and preserved normal acinar area. Together the data reveal the promotion of BCAA catabolism systemically, but not within the pancreas, as a promising intervention strategy to suppress tumor initiation."
"Photosynthetic efficiency and plant viability rely on chloroplast protein homeostasis. While unfolded protein responses (UPRs) in the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria have been extensively characterized, the chloroplast UPR (cpUPR) remains less defined, partly due to the off-target effects of traditional stress-inducing methods. In this study, we provide direct evidence for the existence of the cpUPR by expressing engineered, folding-defective variants of ferredoxin-NADP reductase (FNR) in plant chloroplasts. The expression of aggregation-prone proteins inside the organelle triggered a robust upregulation of chloroplast quality control components, including CLPB3, CLPC1/C2, and HSP90C, as revealed by immunodetection and quantitative proteomics. The proteomic response scaled with the severity of the folding defect, with the fully insoluble FNR {Delta}20 variant inducing broader changes than the partially soluble {Delta}3 variant. Network analysis showed that most differentially abundant proteins were chloroplastic and clustered into functional groups related to proteostasis and photosynthesis. Comparative analysis with lincomycin-treated plants highlighted the specificity and advantages of using misfolded proteins to study the cpUPR. Expression of the folding variants conferred tolerance to heat treatment, suggesting that the response can enhance plant fitness. Taken together, our work establishes the cpUPR as a specific stress response in chloroplasts and provides new tools for its characterization."
"BackgroundAldosterone overactivity intensifies central sodium sensitivity and sympathetic output, driving salt-sensitive hypertension, but specific mechanisms remain incompletely defined. Herein, we aimed to explore the role of organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis glutamatergic neurons (OVLTGlut) and their hyperexcitability mechanisms in hyperaldosteronism-associated hypertension.

MethodsAdult age matched male TASK-/- mice (primary aldosteronism model) and wild-type controls (TASK+/+) mice were used. Neuronal excitability was assessed via patch-clamp techniques. Arterial blood pressure (BP) monitored via telemetry or carotid catheterization. Chronic drug delivery used minipumps. RNA-seq/qPCR profiled gene expression, and intracerebroventricular hypertonic saline tested sodium sensitivity.

ResultsIn TASK-/- mice, heightened OVLTGlut activity increased sympathetic outflow and hypertension, mitigated by OVLTGlut neuron ablation. Optogenetic activation of these neurons or their paraventricular nucleus (PVN) / rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) projections acutely elevated BP, with ablation reducing BP selectively in TASK-/- mice. Aldosterone dependence of OVLTGlut-PVN/RVLM neuron hyperactivity was evident in both TASK-/- mice and TASK+/+ mice with chronic aldosterone infusion. Aldosterone chronic infusion enhanced central sodium pressor effects, that were nullified by OVLTGlut-PVN/RVLM neuron lesioning. RNA-seq indicated that aldosterone-induced ion channel expression spectrum changes, including potassium channels and the epithelial sodium channel, underlie the neuronal hyperexcitability.

ConclusionOveractivation of OVLTGlut neurons contributes to hypertension in TASK-/- mice through regulation of OVLTGlut-PVN/RVLM circuits. The hyperexcitability of these neurons, possibly due to aldosterone-induced changes in ion channel expression spectrum, contribute to hypertension by amplifying central sodium sensitivity."
"The development of analytical methods allowing a fast and easy to perform chemical analysis of complex samples under non-laboratory conditions presents a considerable scientific challenge that requires attention. Many analytical tasks are performed using commercially available immunochemistry based lateral flow tests, where the results are detected via a direct observation of the color change of the test strip. However, these tests in many cases do not have the desired levels of selectivity and/or sensitivity or even in some cases introduce an unwanted degree of subjectivity and thus uncertainty. Here, we developed a novel lateral flow analysis test designed for easy-to-run and easily to-interpret detection implementing surface enhanced Raman scattering. The strip utilizes modular polymeric sections specifically engineered to simplify the separation of target analytes from complex biological samples. This separation relies on a series of carefully designed physicochemical interactions between the sample components and the polymeric materials embedded in the strip. A key feature of this detection method is an analytical area on the strip that incorporates plasmonic silver nanostructures with a possibility of further surface functionalization using various selectors. We evaluated this test on the selective detection of IgG through its antibody and Adenine, as representatives of proteins and low molecular compounds. This innovative test format combines modular design with advanced detection, offering significant potential for applications in biomedical research, diagnostic testing, and monitoring of immune function.

"CD8+ virtual memory T (TVM) cells are memory-like cells that rapidly respond to infection via antigen-independent bystander effector functions. While it is recognized that TVM cells arise independently of foreign antigen encounter, the mechanisms governing their development are not fully understood. Here, we identify the transcription factor Aiolos as a negative regulator of TVM cells. We observed higher quantities of TVM cells in the spleens of uninfected Aiolos-deficient (Ikzf3-/-) mice relative to wild-type (WT). Furthermore, Ikzf3-/- TVM cells produced higher levels of IFN-{gamma} and granzyme B. In addition, we found that Ikzf3-/- TVM cells accumulated to higher quantities in the lungs within 24 hours of influenza virus infection. In line with enhanced TVM functional capacity and lung trafficking, Aiolos-deficient mice cleared virus more rapidly and exhibited reduced morbidity relative to WT animals. Mechanistically, we observed that Aiolos represses the TVM transcriptional regulator Eomes and the IL-15R subunit CD122 (IL-15R{beta}/IL-2R{beta}), known contributors of TVM cell generation. Collectively, these findings establish Aiolos as a novel molecular repressor of TVM generation and function."
"Blow flies such as Lucilia sericata (Diptera: Calliphoridae) serve important ecological functions as decomposers. However, due to their close association with decaying organic matter they also play potential roles as reservoirs for pathogenic bacteria and antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs). In this study, we characterized the bacterial communities and resistome profiles of L. sericata specimens collected from six provinces across South Korea using 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding and targeted PCR screening. The microbiome was dominated by Dysgonomonas, Vagococcus, Pseudomonas, Ignatzschineria, and Providencia with geographic variation in community structure. Flies from Chungnam exhibited the lowest microbial diversity, while samples from Jeonnam and Gyeonggi showed greater richness and evenness. Beta diversity analyses confirmed geographic structuring of bacterial communities, with semi-urban, rural locations harboring more diverse taxa. Notably, opportunistic pathogens such as Proteus mirabilis and Providencia were detected, alongside a range of ARGs (blaTEM, ermB, sul1, aac(6')-Ib-cr, cat and mecA) and integron elements (intI and intII), suggesting that L. sericata may act as a reservoir of clinically important microbes and resistance genes.

ImportanceThe environment plays a significant role in shaping the microbiome of flies. Due to their motile nature and close association with decomposing matter blow flies of the species Lucilia sericata can harbor diverse bacterial communities, including potential pathogens that threaten human and animal health. Furthermore, due to their synanthropic lifestyle, this species is also exposed to bacteria that host antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Here we investigate the role of blowflies as reservoirs of potential pathogens and ARGs using metabarcoding. Our study revealed a diverse microbiome and resistome shaped by location and possible biotic or abiotic factors. These findings provide baseline information for wildlife surveillance and emphasize the importance of including synanthropic flies in strategies aimed at controlling the dissemination of antibiotic resistance."
"The mitochondrial FoF1-ATP synthase is a reversible nanomachine responsible for generating the majority of cellular ATP by oxidative phosphorylation. In various pathological contexts associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, this enzyme can reverse its function to maintain essential mitochondrial membrane potential at the expense of ATP. This reversal is regulated by the conserved protein Inhibitory Factor 1 (IF1). Here, we demonstrate that ATP synthase reversal also occurs under physiological conditions during the cellular differentiation of the unicellular parasite Trypanosoma brucei, which transitions between insect and mammalian hosts. Differentiation of the insect forms is marked by upregulation of alternative oxidase (AOX) along with decreased expression of trypanosomal IF1 (TbIF1), collectively creating a metabolic environment conducive to ATP synthase reversal. We show that this reversal is key for proper parasite differentiation: parasites lacking TbIF1 efficiently transitioned into the mammalian-infective form. In these TbIF1 knockout parasites, ATP synthase reversal was associated with an increased ADP/ATP ratio, activation of AMP-activated protein kinase, enhanced cellular respiration driven by elevated proline metabolism, and increased mitochondrial and cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), known signaling molecules. Conversely, parasites with inducible TbIF1 overexpression failed to reverse ATP synthase activity, showed no AMPK activation or ROS elevation, and remained locked in the initial insect stage. Our findings highlight the critical role of TbIF1 downregulation in enabling life cycle progression and underscore the unique function of the ATP synthase/IF1 axis in cellular signaling."
"Models of gene duplication often assume that loss-of-function mutations neutrally promote the return to the ancestral singleton state. They thus ignore the potential functional interference between duplicated proteins stemming from their physical interactions. Here, we show that for heteromerizing paralogs, such interference potentiates negative selection on loss-of-function mutations. This effect maintains genetic redundancy over longer timescales depending on the rate and severity of loss-of-function mutations. We experimentally estimate that around 6% of deleterious substitutions for a representative tetrameric protein interfere with a second copy. Interfering mutations typically disrupt either catalysis or the final step of protein complex assembly, with varying degrees of severity. Our work shows that paralog interference potentiates the negative effects of loss-of-function mutations, contributing to the preservation of genetic redundancy."
"Diatoms are ubiquitous aquatic microalgae critical to our planet, that were amongst the pioneer model organisms in cell biology for their large and transparent cell structure. However, their robust silica cell wall renders diatoms impermeable to many dyes and antibodies, and complicates the intracellular delivery of gene editing tools - driving in part the eventual decline of diatoms as mainstream model species despite their unique cellular physiology and remarkable ecological success. Here, we demonstrate that cryo-fixation combined with ultrastructural expansion microscopy (cryo-ExM) can overcome the silica barrier across diverse diatom species spanning over 80 million years of evolutionary time. We illustrate the potential of cryo-ExM to provide scalable, cost-effective volumetric imaging of diatom ultrastructure in laboratory cultures, as well as field-collected samples from the pan-European TREC expedition. We first reveal striking similarities in interphase microtubule organization across diverse diatom species by characterizing cytoskeletal arrangements throughout cell cycles and populations, uniting both pennate and centric morphologies under shared principles. We further unveil diatom photosynthetic diversity through qualitative and quantitative comparative analysis of chloroplast and pyrenoid morphologies, demonstrating that each diatom species architects unique photosynthetic machinery. Using cryo-ExM on environmental samples further exposes intricate diatom symbioses, revealing tight spatial organisation of ecological interactions. This methodology makes diatoms more accessible for modern and comparative cell biology research, providing new opportunities to investigate the cellular mechanisms of one of Earths most successful photosynthetic groups.

"A decline in tissue renewal and repair due to changes in tissue stem cells is a hallmark of aging. Many stem cell pools are maintained by interaction with morphologically complex local niches. Using the C. elegans hermaphrodite germline stem cell system, we analyzed age-related changes in the morphology of the niche, the distal tip cell (DTC), and identified a molecular mechanism that promotes a subset of these changes. We found that a long-lived daf-2 mutant exhibits a daf-16-dependent decline in number and length of long DTC processes. Surprisingly, the tissue requirement for daf-16(+) is non-autonomous and is independent of the longevity requirement: daf-16(+) in body wall muscle is both necessary and sufficient. We also determined that pre-formed DTC processes deteriorate prematurely when the underlying germline differentiates. We propose a reciprocal DTC-germline interaction model and speculate a mechanism by which reducing daf-2 activity prevents stem cell exhaustion. These studies establish the C. elegans DTC as a powerful in vivo model for understanding age-related changes in cellular morphology and their consequences in stem cell systems.

SUMMARYThe C. elegans germline stem cell niche morphology is markedly altered with age and is regulated non-autonomously from the muscle by insulin/IGF-like signaling. Results suggest reciprocal niche-germline regulation."
"A major priority for epidemiological research in a time of anthropogenic change is understanding how infectious disease dynamics respond to perturbations. Interventions to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 significantly disrupted the transmission of other human pathogens. As interventions lifted, whether and when respiratory pathogens would eventually return to their pre-pandemic dynamics remains to be answered. Here, we present a framework for estimating pathogen resilience based on how fast epidemic patterns approach their pre-pandemic, endemic dynamics and analyze relevant time series data from Hong Kong, Canada, Korea, and the US. By quantifying the resilience of common respiratory pathogens, we are able to predict when each pathogen will eventually return to its pre-pandemic dynamics. Our predictions closely match the observed deviations (or lack thereof) from the pre-COVID dynamics of respiratory pathogens. Discrepancies between predicted and observed dynamics indicate the long-term impacts of pandemic perturbations, suggesting that some pathogens may be converging to a different endemic cycle. Finally, we show that the replenishment rate of the susceptible population is a key determinant of pathogen resilience, which in turn determines the sensitivity of a system to stochastic perturbations. Overall, our analysis highlights the persistent nature of common respiratory pathogens compared to vaccine-preventable infections, such as measles."
"Synonymous codon usage can influence protein expression, since codons with high numbers of corresponding tRNAs are naturally translated more rapidly than codons with fewer corresponding tRNAs. Although translation efficiency ultimately depends on the concentration of aminoacylated (charged) tRNAs, many theoretical models of translation have ignored tRNA dynamics and treated charged tRNAs as fixed resources. This simplification potentially limits these models from making accurate predictions in situations where charged tRNAs become limiting. Here, we derive a mathematical model of translation with explicit tRNA dynamics and tRNA re-charging, based on a stochastic simulation of this system that was previously applied to investigate codon usage in the context of gene overexpression. We use the mathematical model to systematically explore the relationship between codon usage and the protein expression rate, and find that in the regime where tRNA charging is a limiting reaction, it is always optimal to match codon frequencies to the tRNA pool. Conversely, when tRNA charging is not limiting, using 100% of the preferred codon is optimal for protein production. We also use the tRNA dynamics model to augment a wholecell simulation of bacteriophage T7. Using this model, we demonstrate that the high expression rate of the T7 major capsid gene causes rare charged tRNAs to become entirely depleted, which explains the sensitivity of the major capsid gene to codon deoptimization."
"The brain can efficiently learn and form memories based on limited exposure to stimuli. One key factor believed to support this ability is sparse coding, which can reduce overlap between representations and minimize interference. It is well known that increased sparseness can enhance memory capacity, yet its impact on the speed of learning remains poorly understood. Here we analyze the relationship between population sparseness and learning speed -- specifically, how the learning speed that maximizes memory capacity depends on the sparseness of the neural code, and how this in turn affects the networks maximal capacity. To this end, we study a feedforward network with Hebbian and homeostatic plasticity and a two-state synapse model. The network learns to associate binary input-output pattern pairs, where sparseness corresponds to a small fraction of active neurons per pattern. The learning speed is modeled as the probability of synaptic changes during learning. The results presented in this manuscript are based on both network simulations and an analytical theory that predicts expected memory capacity and optimal learning speed. For both perfect and noisy retrieval cues, we find that the optimal learning speed indeed increases with increasing pattern sparseness -- an effect that is more pronounced for input sparseness than for output sparseness. Interestingly, the optimal learning speed stays the same across different network sizes if the number of active units in an input pattern is kept constant. While the capacity obtained at optimal learning speed increases monotonically with output sparseness, its dependence on input sparseness is non-monotonic. Overall, we provide the first detailed investigation of the interactions between population sparseness, learning speed, and storage capacity. Our findings propose that differences in population sparseness across brain regions may underlie observed differences in how quickly those regions adapt and learn.

Author summaryThe brain can efficiently learn and form memories based on limited exposure to stimuli. One key factor believed to support this ability is the way neural circuits encode and organize information about the external world. Population sparseness refers to the phenomenon in which, in many brain regions, only a small subset of neurons is active at any given time or in response to a particular stimulus. Sparse codes are believed to reduce overlap between representations and minimize interference and can thus enhance the storage capacity of a network. Here we investigate the effect of population sparseness on the speed of learning input-output associations in a network model with Hebbian learning. We find that the learning speed that yields the maximal capacity increases with increasing sparseness. The maximal capacity increases for sparser input and output representations but in the first case only up to a certain point before sparseness becomes destructive. These findings could contribute to explaining why some brain regions learn faster than others."

"The catecholamines octopamine and tyramine undoubtedly have a major impact on the life of an insect. A wide range of physiological processes and behaviours are regulated by these neurotransmitters/hormones. Octopamine and tyramine act homologous to the adrenergic system of vertebrates, primarily adapting the organism to the given situation, by switching between the states of alertness and rest. Interestingly, higher brain functions like learning and memory are also regulated by octopamine and tyramine. About 30 years ago, initial work in Drosophila has demonstrated that dopaminergic neurons signal punishment, while octopaminergic neurons signal reward during olfactory associative learning and memory. In the meantime, however, it has become clear that distinct types of dopaminergic neurons convey both reward and punishment signals to the mushroom bodies, a central brain region responsible for the formation and storage of associative memories. Although some conflicting data remain, these findings challenge the previously established model of functional segregation and may limit the proposed role of octopamine neurons as teaching neurons during memory formation. We have therefore re-examined the role of octopamine in learning and memory in Drosophila larvae. Through a combination of Ca2+ imaging, anatomical studies and gain-of-function and loss-of-function behavioural approaches, we demonstrate that octopamine signalling plays a crucial role in larval learning by modulating dopaminergic neurons across distinct cell clusters to orchestrate memory processes."
"Sighted people rely on vision to recognize and navigate the local environment. By adulthood, human cortex contains at least three regions that respond selectively to visual scene information, but it remains unknown when or how these regions develop. One hypothesis is that scene selectivity emerges gradually in regions that initially prefer certain low-level visual features (e.g., peripheral visual input, high spatial frequencies, rectilinearity), and then exposure to the visual statistics of natural scenes drives the emergence of scene selective responses. However, both aspects of this hypothesis remain to be tested: how early scene selectivity first arises in human development, and whether it is driven by passive exposure to visual statistics. We therefore collected functional magnetic resonance imaging data from awake 2-9-month-old infants while they watched videos of real-world scenes with ego-motion, as well as faces, objects, and scrambled videos. We found stronger responses to scenes than control conditions in the location of all three scene regions. Scene-selective responses could not be explained by low-level visual properties of the stimuli, and were found in infants as young as 2-5 months old, with no evidence of age-related change. We also measured infants experience independently navigating (e.g., crawling), which was not necessary for the development of scene-selectivity. In sum, cortical regions are scene-selective in human infants prior to independent navigation, and after only limited exposure to visual scene statistics.

Significance statementDespite extensive work on the functional organization of scene processing in the human adult visual cortex, little is known about the developmental origins of category selectivity for visual scenes. Here we used fMRI in awake human infants to discover that all three regions of the known visual scene processing system are present within the first few months of life - the youngest age yet detected. Scene-selective cortex therefore develops after only a few months of limited visual exposure, and prior to active experience using visual scene information to plan and guide independent navigation (e.g., by crawling). These findings provide a fundamental constraint on theories of how scene selectivity develops in high-level visual cortex."
"Timely resolution of inflammation is essential to prevent tissue damage and maintain homeostasis. Immunometabolism is critical for innate immunity and inflammation. However, how metabolic enzymes and metabolites contribute to inflammatory resolution remains largely unknown. To identify the key metabolic mediators of inflammation resolution, we generated an AAV9-Sleeping Beauty CRISPR library comprising 17090 sgRNAs targeting 2682 mouse metabolic genes. We then conducted an in vivo CRISPR screen in type II alveolar epithelial cells (AECIIs)-specifically expressing Cas9 mice and uncovered a very long chain fatty acid elongase, ELOVL5, that promoted the resolution of lung inflammation after influenza virus infection. Deficiency of Elovl5 in mouse lung epithelial cells impaired lung inflammation resolution and tissue repair phenotype both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, ELOVL5 bound to STING, inhibiting TBK1 interaction and translocation to the Golgi. These effects ultimately reduced STING-mediated inflammation and promoted AKT1-mediated tissue repair. In addition, ELOVL5 decreased eicosanoid levels in AECIIs to promote lung inflammation resolution. Supplement with ELOVL5 downstream products reversed the increased expression of inflammatory cytokines caused by Elovl5 deficiency. These results support an unrevealed mechanism for polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolism in the resolution of innate inflammation and provide paths toward treating inflammatory diseases through manipulating cellular lipid metabolism."
"Malaria, a mosquito-borne disease predominantly affecting sub-Saharan Africa, remains a significant global health challenge with 263 million cases in 2023. Although progress in vaccine development has recently occurred, insecticide resistance has reduced the effectiveness of the main stay method of traditional vector control and novel innovative vector control strategies against Anopheles mosquitoes is crucial to combat the spread of malaria. Wolbachia is an endosymbiotic bacterium that can invade mosquito populations and inhibit human pathogens. Historically Wolbachia was thought to not occur naturally within wild Anopheles An.) populations, but recent evidence has confirmed the presence of at least two strains in genuine symbiosis. Detection of Wolbachia strains has pre-dominantly relied on PCR amplification of Wolbachia genes and/or sanger and illumina sequencing. In this study, we assess the use of Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) for detecting bacteria within wild Anopheles mosquitoes and determine the ability to detect the endosymbiotc bacterium Wolbachia. We assessed Wolbachia detection from library preparations using the ONT Field sequencing kit for MinION sequencing on the Mk1C and found a pool size of 10 mosquitoes is required preventing individual mosquito analysis. There were roughly 13 times more Wolbachia reads in pooled Anopheles demeilloni compared to An. gambiae. Utilizing the more economical Flongle flow cells and Mk1B device, we further evaluated the effectiveness of two library preparation methods that are compatible: Rapid PCR Barcoding and 16S Barcoding kits. Our findings indicate that the 16S Barcoding Kit in conjunction with the Flongle flowcell effectively identified Wolbachia in both Anopheles demeilloni and Anopheles moucheti but we found no evidence of Wolbachia in Anopheles gambiae. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of developing ONT for field-based sequencing in malaria-endemic regions, providing a potentially lower cost and  field friendly method for monitoring mosquito populations and associated endosymbionts.

"The mutualistic symbiosis between Xenorhabdus bacteria and Steinernema nematodes has both ecological and practical importance. Their relationship co-evolved to make them dependent on each other in their life cycle where they kill, feed and reproduce within insect larvae together. This behavior has shed light on them as promising candidates to replace conventional pesticides. Despite the importance of the Xenorhabdus in insect-killing, the mechanisms by which the bacteria might sense and respond to the presence of their nematode host are not well understood. We performed an RNA-sequencing experiment on the bacterial partner, X. griffiniae, in close proximity, but not in direct contact with their host nematode, Steinernema hermaphroditum, to identify differentially regulated genes in these conditions, followed by genetic analysis to determine their functional significance. We show that X. griffiniae changes its transcriptomic profile in a small number of genes in the presence of axenic nematodes, but not in the presence of nematodes that are already colonized by X. griffiniae. We select the most differentially regulated gene, ymdA, for further investigation, and show that it plays a role in biofilm formation and affects host colonization efficiency. This work advances our understanding of bacterial sensing of nematodes and motivates future research in deepening our understanding of this underexplored ecological interaction.

ImportanceInteractions between different organisms in the soil environment are enabled by the ability to sense and respond to organisms nearby. In many cases, the underlying sensing mechanisms that mediate these ecologically important interactions are not known. Filling in the knowledge gap of how these interactions occur can help us understand how microbial populations organize themselves, establish symbiotic relationships, or compete with other species in complex environments. Furthermore, elucidating these mechanisms may inform the development of new tools in agriculture, such as improved biological control agents. Here we use the bacterial symbiont Xenorhabdus griffiniae of the entomopathogenic nematode Steinernema hermaphroditum to study whether symbiotic bacteria of nematodes are able to sense their presence. Our results suggest that X. griffiniae can sense the presence of its nematode host and respond by modulating the gene expression level of several genes, where at least one, ymdA, has implications for host colonization."
"Coral reefs, critically endangered by climate warming, urgently require innovative, scalable interventions. Probiotics offer promise, but stability and effectiveness need improvement. We introduce an evolutionary genomic framework for selecting so-called next-generation probiotics using host adaptation signatures. Targeting bacteria transitioning irreversibly to host dependency, we identify coral-sourced Ruegeria MC10, exhibiting insertion sequence proliferation and essential gene pseudogenization. In a proof-of-principle, coral model cnidarians showed increased thermal tolerance. Subsequent, real-world application of one-month nursery inoculations enabled Acropora pruinosa corals to retain MC10 for the monitored period (eight months) post-outplanting, including persistence through a natural bleaching event, with sustained coloration. MC10 colonized the gastrodermis, exhibited host flexibility, and minimally disrupted native microbiomes. This work pioneers a scalable, evolution-guided strategy for microbial-driven reef restoration, applicable to wildlife at large."
"Iron-sulfur [Fe-S] clusters are ubiquitous cofactors of a wide array of structural and functional diverse proteins. Acyl Carrier Protein (ACP) is the universal factor required for fatty acid (FA) synthesis. In this study in E. coli, we demonstrated that [Fe-S] and FA biosynthesis pathways are coordinated processes, driven by a physical interaction between ACP and the ISC [Fe-S] biogenesis machinery. Using bacterial two-hybrid assays, co-purification and biochemical analyses, we demonstrated a molecular interaction between ACP and IscS, the ISC machinery cysteine desulfurase that provides sulfur for [Fe-S] cluster formation. Structural modeling and directed mutagenesis pinpointed the ACP-binding site in a region of IscS shared for interactions with other components of the ISC [Fe-S] biogenesis system. At the cellular level, ACP depletion was found to disrupt ISC-dependent [Fe-S] cluster biogenesis, diminishing the activity of key [Fe-S]-dependent regulators (IscR, FNR, NsrR) and enzymes (aconitase, biotin synthase). Our findings underscore a functional link between [Fe-S] cluster biogenesis and fatty acid metabolism with far-reaching unexplored intricacies of metabolic coordination and cellular homeostasis. Comparison with eucaryotic systems highlight a strong evolutive driving force towards a link between [Fe-S] cluster and fatty acid biosynthesis in all living systems.

ImportanceCellular functions rely on interconnected metabolic pathways, yet many regulatory links remain unexplored. Iron-sulfur [Fe-S] clusters are co-factors of proteins driving fundamental cellular processes, from respiration to gene regulation. Our study uncovers a direct connection between [Fe-S] cluster biogenesis and fatty acid biosynthesis. We demonstrate the molecular connection between these two essential cellular processes to lie within the interaction between the acyl carrier protein (ACP), a shuttle of fatty acid biosynthetic intermediates and IscS, the source of sulfur for [Fe-S] cluster assembly. Intriguingly, similar interactions between ACP and [Fe-S] building cysteine desulfurase have been observed in yeast and human models, yet resting on different molecular determinants. This points out the existence of a strong evolutive driving force towards establishing a link between [Fe-S] cluster and fatty acid biosynthesis in all living systems with far-reaching implications for metabolic coordination and cellular homeostasis."
"The Uptake Signal Sequence (USS) receptor, facilitating acquisition of homologous DNA by natural transformation in Haemophilus influenzae and other Pasteurellaceae, remains unknown. Assuming extracellular USS-binding in accordance with experimental data and existing models of the transformation process, discriminating functional gene ontology assessment, cellular localization predictions and deep-learning structural modeling of protein-DNA complexes, a prepilin peptidase-dependent protein A (PpdA), was identified as the strongest USS receptor candidate in different Pasteurellaceae family members with divergent USS specificities. PpdA was the only orthogroup to be modeled to form specific protein-USS complexes significantly better than complexes with sequence-scrambled versions of USS by AlphaFold3. Further analyses of PpdA complexes, from ten different Pasteurellaceae with divergent USS-type enrichment, using geometric deep learning protein-DNA sequence specificity predictions and coevolution analyses were found to further support this USS receptor candidacy. PpdA was found to share overall structural domains with the non-sequence specific DNA receptor FimT in Legionella pneumophila and a particular {beta}-sheet transversing disulfide-bridge with ComP, the DNA uptake sequence receptor of the Neisseriaceae. In compliance with a previously given gene name, we propose ComN to be used for these PpdA orthologs which structurally and evolutionary were here predicted to be the USS-receptors in Pasteurellaceae."
"Actinomycetoma is a chronic infectious disease recognized by the World Health Organization as a neglected tropical disease. In the Americas, the most common etiologic agent is the Gram-positive bacterium, Nocardia brasiliensis. It is a facultative intracellular pathogen that can multiply and survive within macrophages, evading microbicidal mechanisms by inducing an immunosuppressive environment. Current antibiotic treatments are expensive, prolonged, and toxic, and bacterial resistance has been reported. Host defense peptides, known for their bactericidal and immunomodulatory effects, and their ability to induce poor bacterial resistance due to their direct effect on the bacterial membrane, represent a novel therapeutic approach. Recently, DMS-DA6, a dermaseptin isolated from the Mexican tree frog, Pachymedusa dacnicolor, has been shown to exert strong activity against Gram- positive bacteria, including multidrug-resistant strains. Our study evaluated the effects of DMS-DA6 in a N. brasiliensis-induced actinomycetoma mouse model in comparison with the ones observed with the conventional antibiotic linezolid. Infected mice were treated either twice a week with this peptide at a dose of 12.5mg/kg or every 12 hours with linezolid at a dose of 25 mg/kg over a three-week period. Our findings suggest that treatment with DMS-DA6 is more effective in resolving the disease than linezolid, as it induces a similar reduction in the volume of inflammation and bacterial load in the infected area at a lower dose and with fewer injections. These findings highlight the potential of DMS-DA6 as an innovative addition to current therapy.

Author SummaryActinomycetoma is a chronic infectious disease induced by Gram-positive bacteria and listed as a neglected tropical disease that produces severe tissue deformation, and family, social, and economic problems. Current treatment takes years, is expensive, and induces undesirable effects and bacterial resistance, leading to amputation of extremities in many cases. There is thus an urgent need to develop new therapeutics, and host defense peptides could be promising candidates. In the Nocardia brasiliensis actinomycetoma mouse model, we demonstrated that the host defense peptide DMS-DA6 was more effective than the classical antibiotic linezolid in decreasing the bacterial load and inflammation in the infected footpad, paving the way for its incorporation in human trials. We thus propose the use of DMS-DA6 as an alternative therapy before amputation of the infected extremity."
"The enteropathogen Shigella flexneri employs a Type Three Secretion System (T3SS) to colonize intestinal epithelial cells. Genes encoding the T3SS are located on a large IncFII virulence plasmid, pINV. T3SS expression comes at the expense of slowed Shigella growth and is therefore strictly controlled by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. Following up on a recent genome-wide screen, we here show that the chromosomal gene pcnB, encoding the poly-A polymerase I (PAP-I), slows Shigella growth at 37{degrees}C, while at the same time promotes early colonization of a human epithelial enteroid model. Proteomic profiling revealed that pcnB drives global increase of the Shigella T3SS virulence program. Accordingly, pcnB sustains pINV replication to a level optimal for Shigella virulence. This is achieved through increased degradation of the antisense RNA CopA, involved in plasmid replication control. The pcnB effect on pINV replication was found to also ensure longer-term intraepithelial expansion of Shigella following human intestinal epithelium invasion. Our findings exemplify how an optimal pINV level is necessary for the execution of Shigellas infection cycle.

AUTHOR SUMMARYBacterial infections represent a major global threat. Understanding the genetic determinants promoting infections is crucial to overcome this threat. Shigella is an intracellular bacterial pathogen that invades and disseminates in the intestinal epithelium, causing bacillary dysentery in humans. Shigellas ability to cause disease relies on the delivery of effector proteins into the host cells through an injection machinery, with most of the genes involved in this process located on a large virulence plasmid. Here we show that the chromosomal gene pcnB sustains an optimal virulence plasmid level. This is crucial for Shigella to maximize virulence protein expression and thereby efficiently invade, replicate and spread within the intestinal epithelium."
"Genome evolution in eukaryotes is predominantly driven by the dynamics of repetitive sequences, which vary widely in both copy number and sequence composition. The rate of repeat evolution changes between species and within a species and is likely modulated by both genetics and environment. To uncover the factors shaping the rate of genome content evolution, we analyzed 1,142 resequenced Arabidopsis thaliana genomes using a novel K-mer based approach. With this dataset, we characterized genome content variation and identified hypervariable regions that contribute to major differences in repeat abundance. We then treated repeat abundance as a quantitative trait and performed genome-wide association studies to map the genetic basis of copy number variation across more than 400 repeat families. We jointly analyzed these results using a meta-GWAS approach, revealing both cis-acting variants and over 50 trans-acting loci that regulate repeat abundance genome-wide. Finally, we found that purifying selection acts against mutations that increase the rate of genome content divergence, favoring alleles that limit repeat expansion. Together, our results provide new insights into the genetic architecture and evolutionary forces shaping genome evolution in plants."
"Breast cancer drugs including anthracyclines (ACs) and Trastuzumab increase the risk for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) such as atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure (HF) that ultimately affect the heart muscle. These CVDs are associated with hundreds of genetic variants in non- coding regions of the genome. However, how these drugs affect the regulatory potential of the non-coding genome of the heart and CVD risk loci is unknown. We therefore measured global chromatin accessibility across iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes from four individuals treated with the ACs, Doxorubicin, Epirubicin, and Daunorubicin, a related non-AC, Mitoxantrone, and the monoclonal antibody Trastuzumab, or a vehicle control for three and 24 hours. We identified 155,557 high-confidence regions of open chromatin across 48 samples where the major sources of variation are associated with drug type and time. Jointly modeling the data revealed three accessibility response signatures denoted as early-acute, early-sustained, and late that correspond to 67,329 regions that open or close in response to drug treatment. Sequences associated with drug-induced chromatin opening contain motifs for DNA damage-associated transcription factors including p53 and ZBTB14, and associate with increases in active histone acetylation and gene expression. 21 AF- and HF-associated SNPs directly overlap with regions associated with drug-induced opening. A shared intronic HF and AF SNP, rs3176326, that is also an eQTL for CDKN1A in heart tissue, associates with increased chromatin accessibility, histone acetylation, and CDKN1A expression in response to all ACs. Our results demonstrate large-scale changes in chromatin accessibility in cardiomyocytes treated with ACs, which correspond to several regions harboring CVD risk loci.

Author summaryAnthracyclines are a widely used class of breast cancer drugs that are linked to cardiac toxicity and the development of heart disease in some women. There are hundreds of genetic variants that associate with risk for heart disease; however their role and mechanism of action in drug- induced toxicity is unclear given that most reside in the non-coding genome. We therefore tested the effects of five breast cancer drugs on genome-wide chromatin accessibility using induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes. We found tens of thousands of chromatin regions that change in accessibility after drug treatment. Regions with increased accessibility contain sequences that have been shown to bind DNA damage-associated transcription factors, and associate with increases in nearby gene expression. We find 21 heart disease-associated genetic variants in regions that increase in chromatin accessibility following treatment. This suggests that cancer drugs have large effects on the non-coding genome of heart cells including at regions associated with heart disease. This research contributes to our understanding of how genetic variants associated with disease exert their effects."
"The monogamous California mouse (Peromyscus californicus) exhibits distinct behavioral changes during pair bond formation. Using a detailed temporal behavioral analysis over seven days, we found a rapid decrease in aggression within 24 hours of pair introduction in this highly territorial species. After this aggression reduction, the gradual increase in affiliative behaviors varied by type of affiliative behavior and ranged from one to seven days. We then measured neurobiological changes at three time points during this transition to uncover mechanisms that might govern this shift from aggressive to affiliative behavior, revealing novel sex differences that add to current research on biological mechanisms of social bonding. Specifically, we examined plasticity through mRNA expression of two perineuronal net (PNN) associated proteins, HAPLN and ACAN, in two brain regions implicated in affiliation, aggression, and social cognition: the ventral anterior cingulate cortex (vACC) and lateral septum (LS). The vACC in females exhibited higher expression levels of both of these PNN components relative to males. Additionally, we observed a decrease in ACAN mRNA expression in the vACC over the course of pair bond establishment, but no such change in the LS. Furthermore, oxytocin receptor (OXTR) and vasopressin receptor (AVPR) plasticity exhibited sex-specific patterns in the vACC during pair bond formation. Females displayed higher OXTR mRNA expression across the bonding period, whereas males expressed higher AVPR mRNA levels. In addition, our results uncovered a positive association between AVPR expression levels in the vACC and male-female nesting distance, a novel measure of affiliative behavior. We discuss how a decrease in PNNs could allow for an increase in receptor plasticity in the vACC as the pair bond is established. Moreover, we suggest that structural plasticity across this social transition may differ between males and females due to factors such as pre-pair sociality and aggression/territoriality changes.

Plain English SummarySome mammals, such as the monogamous California mouse, establish a long term partner with which they defend territories, forage, and raise young. This is a large behavioral shift, wherein these animals form a cooperative dyad. In order to behaviorally adjust to this social change, we expected to see neural changes that are indicative of this adjustment, such as changes in neurons that make them more flexible or responsive to social stimuli. While we detected an increase in neural plasticity across the pair bond for both sexes, we also noted important sex differences in cortical regions that were not expected. The anterior cingulate cortex, which is conserved across mammals, is a brain area associated with social decision making and empathy. Sex differences in both receptors and plasticity were detected in this area, indicating that the sexes may use different neural mechanisms to adjust to large social changes. Further exploration into how the sexes use different modes of neural plasticity to appropriately adjust behavior is needed to explain this novel finding.

"Scabies is a skin infestation caused by the Sarcoptes scabiei mite. It produces a substantial global health burden, which is exacerbated by emerging resistance to prominent treatments, such as ivermectin. An anionic pentameric ligand-gated ion channel (pLGIC) identified in the mite, termed as SsCl, shows unique pH-sensitivity and is significantly modulated by ivermectin. Here, we use cryo-EM and electrophysiology to explore the pH-sensing mechanisms of SsCl and the impact of ivermectin on channel activity. Structures of SsCl were resolved under various pH conditions to capture a closed (pH 6.5) and desensitized (pH 9) state, alongside ivermectin-bound conformations. The desensitized structure adopts an unexpected ""hourglass"" conformation, suggesting the gating mechanisms may be more related to cation-selective channels. Structure-based analysis and mutagenesis highlighted extracellular histidine and glutamate residues which act as pH-sensors, revealing the protonation-dependent gating mechanism. Ivermectin binds at transmembrane subunit interfaces, stabilizing an open-pore conformation through hydrophobic interactions. Ivermectin bound-structures reveal a pH-dependent modulation, enhancing open-state prevalence at pH 9 and enabling atypical activation at pH 6.5, consistent with electrophysiological data. These structural and functional insights elucidate SsCls unique pH sensitivity and ivermectins mode of action, providing a foundation for designing next-generation therapeutics targeting this pathogen-related ion channel."
"Copper (Cu) is an essential trace element required for mitochondrial respiration via its incorporation into cytochrome c oxidase (CuCOX), the terminal enzyme of the electron transport chain. In this study, we employed size-exclusion chromatography coupled with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (SEC-ICP-MS), UV-Vis spectroscopy, and immunoblotting to identify and validate a high-molecular-weight Cu-containing peak in SEC-ICP-MS chromatogram as representative of CuCOX activity. We demonstrate that this CuCOX peak is enhanced under metabolic conditions favoring oxidative phosphorylation, such as high Cu supplementation or galactose-containing media, and correlates with increased mitochondrial respiration. By tracing exogenously supplied 63Cu, we characterized the time- and dose-dependent incorporation of newly acquired Cu into CuCOX. Functional RNA interference (RNAi) experiments targeting key Cu transporters revealed that CuCOX formation is independent of the high-affinity Cu importer CTR1, but instead relies on alternative transporters including DMT1, LAT1, and the mitochondrial carrier SLC25A3. These findings offer new insight into the cellular pathways governing Cu trafficking and allocation to mitochondria under physiologically relevant conditions. Furthermore, our work establishes SEC-ICP-MS as a sensitive and specific method for quantifying CuCOX and assessing mitochondrial metabolism. This platform holds promise for the identification of Cu-related biomarkers and therapeutic targets, particularly in the context of diseases such as renal cell carcinoma (RCC), where dysregulated Cu homeostasis plays a critical role."
"Single-cell CRISPR activation/interference screens offer a direct route to causal gene-regulatory maps, yet existing deep-learning pipelines are GPU-intensive and yield hard-to-interpret latent factors. We introduce LazyNet, an explicitly Euler-integrated neural ODE whose paired log-linear-exp layer collapses multiplicative transcript interactions into a compact, mechanistically interpretable weight matrix. Training a three-replica ensemble on a 55k-cell, 30k-gene Perturb-seq dataset completes on a single CPU in <1 h, running 3 to 4 folder faster than transformer (scGPT) or state-space (RetNet) baselines while lowering global RMSE by {approx} 25 % and raising genome-wide Pearson r to 0.67. Averaged Jacobians, expanded in a 32*4 breadth-first search around seven ferroptosis seeds, recapitulated 15 of 27 benchmark regulators (56 % recall) within a 4 611 gene, 11 676 edge subgraph; 26.6 % of edges show ARCHS4 co-expression r [&ge;] 0.2 versus 5 % expected at random, and 523 overlap STRING interactions (hypergeometric p = 1.2e-5). Elasticity ranks uncover a previously unrecognized lysosomal-mitochondrial-immune module linking PSAP-mTOR, MFN2-TLR4 and ADCY10-SIRT3, generating experimentally testable hypotheses. By combining state-of-the-art predictive accuracy, laptop-level resource demands and one-to-one parameter interpretability, LazyNet democratizes causal network discovery from sparse two-snapshot screens, enabling small laboratories to move from large-scale perturbation data to mechanistic insight without GPUs or external pathway priors."
"Ultrasound-mediated blood-brain barrier (BBB) opening is promising for non-invasive, localized, and reversible drug delivery to the brain. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear, particularly at microscopic level in real time. Recently developed short-pulse ultrasound enhances safety by reducing side effects compared to conventional long-pulse ultrasound. Using vessel-mimicking microchannels cultured with brain endothelial monolayers, we directly observed bubble dynamics and cellular bioeffects under flow conditions. Intriguingly, cyclic jetting during stable cavitation occurs at long-pulse mode, accompanied by a few localized cell detachments and extensive sonoporation. In contrast, short-pulse ultrasound induced milder, uniform bubble dynamics, reversible sonoporation and calcium signaling, promoting safer BBB modulation. In vivo two-photon imaging and histology in mice confirmed these findings, showing that long-pulse ultrasound enabled higher drug delivery efficiency but caused localized endothelial damage, while short-pulse ultrasound facilitated uniform delivery and faster BBB recovery. The differential bubble dynamics and cellular responses correlated well between in vitro and in vivo models. This study establishes a cross-scale framework for real-time analysis of ultrasound-mediated BBB opening, revealing key biophysical factors governing safety and efficacy. The findings provide guidance for the optimization of ultrasound protocols for vascular drug delivery, with potential applications in treating brain tumors, neurodegenerative diseases, and other disorders."
"SHP2 is a phosphatase and a critical mediator of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)-driven RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. Despite promising preclinical data, SHP2 inhibitors have shown minimal clinical efficacy, with no defined clinical mechanisms of primary resistance. Here, we elucidate phosphorylation of SHP2 at tyrosine 62 (pY62) as a hotspot phosphorylation site in the proteome and RTK-driven tumor types in patients. We demonstrate that SRC family kinases directly phosphorylate SHP2 at Y62, downstream of but not directly phosphorylated by RTKs. Using biochemical and biophysical analyses, we show that SHP2 Y62D enforces an open, active conformation, resulting in constitutive phosphatase activation that is sufficient to activate MAPK signaling and confer resistance to allosteric SHP2 inhibitors. These findings establish that SHP2 pY62 is a phosphorylation hotspot phenocopying mutational activation, a mechanism of primary resistance to SHP2 inhibitors, and a cancer drug target distinct from wildtype SHP2.

Statement of significanceThis study identifies phosphorylation of SHP2 at tyrosine 62 (pY62) as a conserved mechanism of resistance to allosteric SHP2 inhibitors. By stabilizing an open, active SHP2 conformation, pY62 phenocopies oncogenic PTPN11 mutations and sustains MAPK signaling across cancer types. These findings redefine SHP2 inhibitor resistance as a phosphorylation-driven, target-intrinsic process, nominate pY62 as a potential biomarker for therapeutic response, and propose phosphorylated SHP2 as a distinct drug target."
"Floral transition and flower bud development during autumn and winter are common in plants inhabiting temperate and cold climates. However, our understanding of the natural variation and underlying molecular mechanisms of such life-history strategy remain largely limited to Brassicaceae model species. To address this gap, we investigated flowering time variation across a broad geographical and bioclimatic range in Fragaria vesca (woodland strawberry), a perennial herb from the Rosaceae family. We found that the timing of floral transition and subsequent flowering in F. vesca populations is primarily shaped by population structure, reflecting postglacial colonization patterns from distinct refugia, and is further modulated by adaptations to winter temperatures. The association of increasing expression of FvFT1, the strawberry ortholog of FLOWERING LOCUS T, with delayed flowering in accessions from diverse climatic and genetic backgrounds suggested FvFT1 as a major candidate gene regulating flowering time variation. We further demonstrated how distinct florigen and antiflorigen roles of FvFT1 are dependent on functional alleles of F. vesca TERMINAL FLOWER1 (FvTFL1) and how the epistatic relationship between FvFT1 and FvTFL1 controls adaptive flowering time variation by adjusting sensitivity to floral inductive photoperiod and vernalization. Our findings reveal a major molecular basis of how timing of floral transition has adapted to temperature in a Rosaceae model inhabiting multiple climatic zones and highlight lineage-specific adaptive mechanisms underlying convergent life-history strategy.

Significance statementMolecular mechanisms underlying flowering time adaptation have been primarily investigated in annual plants that transit to flowering in spring. However, many perennial plant species in temperate climates form flower buds in autumn and winter to flower in the following spring. We uncover wide geographical and climatic patterns of flowering time adaptation in the perennial model species woodland strawberry. We report that natural variation in the expression of strawberry FLOWERING LOCUS T (FvFT1) gene originating ice ages ago and further driven by local temperature adaptations control flowering time variation in this species. Finally, we show how FvFT1 may function as both flowering promoter and repressor depending on the genetic background, thus revealing a novel mechanism of flowering time adaptation."
"Single carbon (C1) substrates are gaining importance as future feedstocks for the production of bio-based chemicals. Carbon dioxide, a major greenhouse gas, offers a promising alternative to the traditional feedstocks to shift towards C1-based, sustainable processes. Here, we present a synthetic autotrophic Komagataella phaffii (Pichia pastoris) that is able to produce itaconic acid by the direct conversion of CO2, achieving final titers of approximately 12 g L-1 in bioreactor cultivations. We show that a combined approach that integrates balancing the flux between the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle and itaconic acid metabolism with process design was essential to enhance the production. Our study demonstrates the potential of K. phaffii as a microbial platform using CO2 as the direct carbon source, aligning with the future goals of establishing sustainable bioprocesses."
"Viral infection of living cells, exemplified by bacteriophage interaction with bacteria, is fundamental to biology and universal across living systems. Here, we establish an all-cell-free viral cycle where T7 phages infect synthetic cells, equipped with lipopolysaccharides on the outer leaflet of the lipid membrane while encapsulating a cell-free gene expression system. We track each cycle step to demonstrate T7 phage-specific adsorption onto the liposomes, genome ejection, replication, expression, and assembly of new infectious virions within the synthetic cells. We quantify key characteristics of the cycle, including the multiplicity of infection, replication efficiency, liposome size constraints, and phage rebinding dynamics. This work establishes a versatile, fully defined in vitro platform for reconstructing and investigating viral infections from individual molecular components."
"The ability to perturb multiple proteins simultaneously within the same cell is essential for understanding and re-engineering biological pathways. CRISPR-Cas12a mutants with inactivated DNAse but intact RNAse activity (dCas12a) retain the ability to process large CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) arrays, enabling them to target multiple genomic loci in parallel. When coupled with transcriptional effector domains, these properties make Cas12a a promising platform for multi-locus transcriptional perturbation. However, current Cas12a-based CRISPRi systems exhibit limitations in processing of multi-crRNA arrays and transcriptional regulation. Here, we combine molecular and circuit-level engineering to develop a programmable Cas12a- based CRIPSRi system capable of strong, tunable, and simultaneous knockdown of six or more genes in a single cell without genomic DNA cleavage. We demonstrate the utility of this system by systematically perturbing a partially redundant set of Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) receptors, enabling quantitative analysis of BMP signaling across diverse receptor configurations."
"The Spatial Atlas of Human Anatomy (SAHA) represents the first multimodal, subcellular-resolution reference of healthy adult human tissues across multiple organ systems. Integrating spatial transcriptomics, proteomics, and histological features across over 15 million cells from more than 100 donors, SAHA maps conserved and organ-specific cellular niches in gastrointestinal and immune tissues. High-resolution profiling using CosMx SMI, 10x Xenium, RNAscope, GeoMx DSP, and single-nucleus RNA-seq reveals spatially organized cell states, rare adaptive immune populations, and tissue-specific cell-cell interactions. Comparative analyses with colorectal cancer and inflammatory bowel disease demonstrate the power of SAHA to detect disease-associated spatial disruptions, including crypt dedifferentiation, perineural invasion, and therapy-resistant immune remodeling. All data are openly accessible through a FAIR-compliant interactive portal to support exploration, benchmarking, and machine learning model training. Through SAHA, we provide a foundational framework for spatial diagnostics and next-generation precision medicine grounded in a comprehensive human tissue atlas."

"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) severity correlates with airway microbial dysbiosis, yet bacteriophage roles remain unexplored. We characterised the lung virome by re-analysing 135 sputum metagenomes from 99 COPD patients and 36 healthy controls. We identified 1,308 viral operational taxonomic units, revealing progressively lower viral diversity correlating with disease severity. Whilst viral and bacterial diversity typically showed strong positive correlations, patients with frequent exacerbations uniquely exhibited decoupled viral-bacterial relationships, indicating disrupted ecological dynamics. Phages infecting anaerobic oral bacteria showed disproportionately lower abundance--Porphyromonas phages were 40-fold less abundant despite only 4-fold lower bacterial abundance--whilst pathogen-associated phages showed no significant differences. We detected virulence factor-encoding phages, including two neuA-carrying Haemophilus phages in 7.4% of Haemophilus-colonised patients, associated with 82-fold higher bacterial abundance. These findings establish altered bacteriophage ecology as an unrecognised feature of COPD pathobiology, with differential phage-bacteria relationships that reshape lung microbial ecosystems, offering new perspectives for microbiome-targeted interventions."
"tRNA 2-thiouridine synthesizing protein A (TusA), a sulfur-carrier protein, plays a crucial role in tRNA sulfur modification. Recent studies have reported that tusA deficiency affects iron-sulfur (Fe-S) homeostasis and cluster formation in Escherichia coli; however, its association with this phenotype remains unclear. In this study, we analyzed the phenotype of tusA-deficient E. coli ({Delta}tusA) and its underlying mechanisms using RNA sequencing. We observed that tusA deletion disrupted the expression of genes regulated by the ferric uptake regulator Fur or Fur-regulated transcription factors (flagellar transcriptional regulators D and C [FlhDC] and fumarate and nitrate reduction regulator [Fnr]). Increased expression of flhDC, which is the master regulator of flagellar genes facilitated flagella formation even under conditions in which the wild-type formed few flagella. Additionally, {Delta}tusA was resistant to cationic antibacterial agents, such as cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, cetylpyridinium chloride, and protamine sulfate. This resistance is associated with the increased expression of ompX or ompF, regulated by Fur and Fnr, respectively. Notably, both enhanced flagella formation and resistance to cationic antibacterial agents caused by tusA deletion were abolished in the fur-deficient background. These findings indicate that impaired expression of the fur regulon, possibly because of impaired Fe-S cluster formation, induces multiple phenotypic alterations in {Delta}tusA.

IMPORTANCETusA is a sulfur carrier protein involved in tRNA sulfur modification, and its effect on translation has been studied. Recent studies have reported that tusA deficiency affects Fe-S homeostasis and cluster formation in Escherichia coli; however, its association with the phenotype remains unclear. Based on RNA sequencing, we indicated that the altered gene expression in {Delta}tusA resulted from the disruption of fur regulation that is controlled by Fe-S clusters. We further demonstrated that enhanced flagella formation and resistance to cationic drugs were mediated by Fur-dependent gene expression alterations. Our data indicate that the regulation of sulfur allocation for tRNA modification by TusA affects the global gene expression in bacteria."
"Characterizing viral strategies for circumventing cellular defenses is critical to understanding the biology and therapeutic application of bacteriophages as antimicrobials. Many bacteriophages synthesize complex modifications (i.e., hypermodifications) to the nucleobases of their virion DNA in order to circumvent the endonuclease-based defenses of their hosts. To date, most hypermodified pyrimidines in viruses are synthesized via group transfer to a pre-existing hydroxyl moiety in DNA during the later stages of lytic development leading up to packaging of the viral chromosome into the capsid. Typically, these occur at hydroxymethylcytosine or hydroxymethyluracil. We find mono- and poly-arabinosylated cytidines completely replacing canonical cytidine in the native DNA of the Escherichia phage RB69 and Acinetobacter baumannii phage DLP3. In both cases, an arabinosyl moiety is connected directly to the pyrimidine through an ether linkage with the bridging oxygen originating from 5-hydroxycytosine (5hoC) in DNA. The 5hoC is synthesized as a mononucleotide by a virally encoded thymidylate synthase homolog. We find diverse virally encoded thymidylate synthase homologs, including the Rhizobium phage RL38J1, are capable of producing 5hoC suggesting this base modification is a starting point for glycodiverse cytosine derivatives. Characterizing these cytosine derivatives adds to our understanding of viral anti-defense mechanisms.

"Understanding the genetics of drug response in the protozoan Leishmania is critical for treatment strategies but is hindered by the parasites lack of RNAi and non-homologous end-joining. Here, we addressed this using CRISPR/Cas9 cytosine base editing for genome-wide loss-of-function screening in L. mexicana. The resulting datasets, accessible at www.LeishBASEeditDB.net, revealed numerous novel resistance and sensitivity biomarkers across five compounds: SbIII, miltefosine, amphotericin B, pentamidine, and the experimental arylmethylaminosteroid 1c. Key findings include transporter-linked cross-resistance, opposing drug responses among paralogs, and collateral sensitivities between sterol and sphingolipid metabolism. Among 41 validated candidates, we identified sterol defects in two novel amphotericin B resistance markers, discovered a regulator of tubulovesicular localization of the miltefosine transporter complex, and uncovered evidence for flagellar-mediated drug uptake. Parallel genome-wide fitness and motility screens mapped essential genes and revealed persister-like phenotypes. Our approach enables powerful reverse genetic screens across Leishmania species, advancing drug mechanism studies and guiding combination therapy designs."
"Trichosporon asahii is a dimorphic fungus that causes severe invasive fungal infections, particularly in patients with neutropenia. Depending on nutrient availability, T. asahii exists in yeast, hyphae, or arthroconidia forms. Autophagy, a cellular degradation pathway responsible for removing old or damaged organelles, is essential for the survival of Saccharomyces cerevisiae under nutrient-limited conditions. Atg1 is a key regulator of the early phases of autophagy, especially under nitrogen starvation. The role of Atg1 in regulating morphology, stress resistance, or virulence in T. asahii, however, remains poorly understood. Here, we generated three atg1 gene-deficient T. asahii mutants and investigated their phenotypic characteristics to reveal the role of Atg1 in T. asahii. The atg1 gene-deficient mutants exhibited no growth defects under high-temperature or various chemical stress conditions, including antifungal drugs. Under a nutrient-rich culture condition, the mutants exhibited an increased proportion of hyphal cells. On the other hand, no morphologic differences were observed between the parent strain and the atg1 gene-deficient mutants under a nitrogen-limited condition. The virulence of these atg1 gene-deficient mutants was maintained in a silkworm infection model. Furthermore, all three generated atg1 gene-deficient mutants exhibited consistent phenotypes. Our findings suggest that while Atg1 does not play a major role in stress tolerance or virulence in T. asahii, it plays a role in regulating its dimorphic morphologic changes."
"Aedes aegypti is a competent vector for a variety of mosquito-borne viruses including Zika, chikungunya, Mayaro, yellow fever, and dengue, which cause debilitating diseases in animals and humans. It is highly invasive and is widely distributed across Asia, Europe, Oceania, and the Americas. Climatic factors such as relative humidity (RH) can have substantial effects on mosquito biological characteristics and the dynamics of pathogen spread. Low RH leads to dehydration in mosquitoes causing modifications in behavioral and physiological responses pertaining to pathogen spread, such as host-seeking behavior and blood-feeding patterns. Here, we evaluated the effects of prolonged dehydration stress on Mayaro virus infection and vector competence in Ae. aegypti mosquitoes. Our findings suggest that prolonged dehydration stress following Mayaro virus infection alters viral dissemination dynamics in mosquitoes, indicating that humidity may modulate intra-vector viral dissemination potentially impacting vector competence and pathogen spread. The previously observed effects of higher feeding and altered survival and our current observations on altered vector competence suggest that the impact of dehydration on viral transmission is expected to be complex and will be crucial to understanding the dynamic disease patterns of mosquito-borne viruses across diverse climatic conditions."
"AAA+ proteins function as molecular machines that utilize ATP to perform diverse cellular functions, including protein homeostasis, stress regulation, and cell cycle/developmental processes. In this study, we identified a novel AAA+ ATPase BAS PrkA in B. anthracis Sterne 34F2 which has 88 % protein homology to Bacillus subtilis PrkA. Conserved domain analysis confirms BAS PrkA has an N-terminal AAA+ ATPase domain with characteristic Walker A and Walker B motifs and a conserved secondary region of homology (SRH) domain, along with a C-terminal cAMP-dependent protein kinase domain. Based on Alpha Fold3 predicted structure, we classified BAS PrkA as part of Clade III of the AAA+ superfamily. Contrary to the reported enzymatic activity in B. subtilis PrkA, we observed that BAS PrkA has negligible protease and kinase activity under in-vitro conditions. Nonetheless, BAS PrkA plays a significant role in regulating sporulation. It is temporally expressed during Stages II to VI during sporulation. A null mutant of BAS PrkA exhibits severe sporulation defects, with reduced spore viability, and down regulation of genes related to spore-coat formation. These phenotypes were restored in a complementation strain expressing BAS PrkA ectopically. Additionally, the null mutant strain showed compromised growth under ionic-osmotic stress conditions. Analysis of the BAS PrkA interactome revealed enrichment of two proteins, ProA and EzrA, that are implicated in osmotic stress response and the sporulation process, respectively. These findings show that BAS PrkA plays a critical role in sporulation and osmotic stress response in B. anthracis."
"The blood-retina barrier (BRB) protects retinal neuronal function and enables vision. A compromised, leaky BRB is a hallmark of vision-threatening retinal diseases such as diabetic retinopathy (DR) and wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) that affect millions of persons worldwide. Strategies to enhance BRB integrity hold promise as therapeutic interventions to prevent vision loss. Previous studies identified Netrin-1 (NTN1) as a key regulator of BRB stability and revealed reduced Netrin-1 signaling in DR patients, suggesting that Netrin-1 supplementation could help preserve BRB function and prevent disease progression. Herein, we used genetic NTN1 overexpression to investigate effects on BRB development and maintenance. We show that global NTN1 overexpression converted leaky vessels at the P5 angiogenic front into a non-leaky state. In pathological settings, NTN1 overexpression reinforced BRB integrity in oxygen- induced retinopathy (OIR), improving electroretinogram (ERG) amplitudes and rescued vascular leak in laser-induced choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Mechanistically, we determined that NTN1 overexpression minimally and transiently affected retinal angiogenesis in an Unc5b independent manner, while Netrins barrier stabilizing effects were Unc5b dependent. These findings establish Netrin-1 as a promising therapeutic target for preventing BRB breakdown in retinal vascular diseases and suggest that reinforcing the Netrin-1/Unc5b signaling pathway may provide a strategy to selectively stabilize the BRB."
"Protein quality control (PQC) systems are essential for cellular resilience to proteotoxic stress. Despite intensive study for decades, functional redundancies in the system obscure the contributions of the collectively important individual genes. Here, we leverage transposon sequencing across bacteria strains lacking key chaperones and proteases to reveal hidden determinants of stress response in protein homeostasis. By profiling fitness under multiple proteotoxic stresses, we uncover stress-specific vulnerabilities and reveal how major players of PQC mask correlations between transcriptomic responses and gene fitness. As an illustration of unexpected connections, we identify a heat-specific synthetic lethality between the disaggregase ClpB and DNA Polymerase I (PolA) mediated by persistent aggregation of the RecA recombinase and toxic persistence of the heat shock regulon. Our findings reveal that stress-induced aggregation is not broadly toxic. Rather, it becomes lethal in specific genetic or environmental contexts due to the depletion of components only needed in those specific circumstances. This work presents a framework to reveal normally hidden fragility in stress responses using gene fitness scores adaptable to a variety of systems."
"Emerging zoonotic parasites such as Plasmodium spp. in remote ecosystems demand rapid, field-deployable surveillance. We developed a drone-based environmental DNA (eDNA) sampling approach integrated with a portable quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay for in situ detection of Plasmodium DNA. Field trials confirmed malaria parasite DNA in canopy swabs, coinciding spatially with acoustic detection of howler monkeys (Alouatta sp.), suspected reservoir hosts. No Anopheles mosquitoes were captured in simultaneously deployed insect traps. The end-to-end workflow, from drone deployment to diagnostic readout, averaged 1.5 hours per assay, required only basic mobile-laboratory infrastructure, and bypassed cold-chain logistics. This rapid, non-invasive method delivers actionable surveillance data in real-time, enabling near-real-time trigger points for vector-control interventions and clinical response in remote settings. By merging environmental genomics with portable diagnostics, we establish a scalable One Health framework adaptable to diverse vector-borne parasites and ecosystems, with potential for early detection and spillover risk mitigation in under-monitored, high-risk environments."
"CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing has become an important and routine method in C. elegans research to generate new mutants and endogenously tag genes. One complication of CRISPR experiments is that the efficiency of single-guide RNA sequences can vary dramatically. One solution to this problem is to create an intermediate entry strain using the efficient and well-characterised dpy-10 guide RNA sequence. This ""d10 entry strain"" can then be used to generate your knock-in of interest. However, the dpy-10 sequence is not always suitable when creating an entry strain. For example, if your gene of interest is closely linked to dpy-10 on LGII or if you want to use the dpy-10 as a co-CRISPR marker for the creation of the entry strain then you can not use the dpy-10 sequence. This publication reports a synthetic guide sequence, GCTATCAACTATCCATATCG, that is not present in the C. elegans genome and can be used to create entry strains. This guide sequence is demonstrated to be relatively robust with a knock-in efficiency that varies from 1-11%. While this is lower than the efficiency observed with d10 entry strains, it is still sufficient for most applications. This guide sequence can be added to the C. elegans CRISPR toolkit and is particularly useful for generating entry strains where the standard dpy-10 guide sequence is not suitable."
"Accurate abundance estimates of fisheries resources are essential for sustainable fisheries management. In response to the growing need for developing more accurate and cost-effective biomass estimation methods, the analysis of environmental DNA (eDNA) has recently emerged as an alternative for fish abundance quantification. However, practical approaches for integrating eDNA data into fisheries assessment remain limited. Here, we introduce a Bayesian joint model that combines acoustic-trawl and eDNA data to estimate fish biomass. Utilizing 209 water eDNA samples and 196 acoustic transects, the model was applied to estimate the distribution and abundance of the European anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) in the Bay of Biscay. The joint model produced estimates consistent with known spatial patterns of anchovy, with eDNA data suggesting a broader distribution and potentially higher abundance. This research demonstrates the value of incorporating eDNA data as a complement to acoustic-trawl for stock assessment and illustrates the versatility of joint Bayesian models and their potential application to various species and datasets. Ultimately, our work opens new avenues for more holistic fisheries assessment, underscoring the growing role of eDNA in that context."
"We put forward a novel mechanism to account for the experimentally observed positional shifts of chromosomes within the cell nucleus, which appear to be driven by compositional alterations in the nuclear lamina [Science 7, eabf6251 (2021)]. By considering chromatin as a biomolecular condensate we demonstrate that the adsorption of the chromatin-binding proteins at the lamina leads to a wetting of the condensate while spreading of the chromatin on the lamina is avoided. This leads to the non-monotonous density profile of the polymer with respect to the surface which can be explained by the competition between the tendency of the protein component to wet the surface and the conformational restrictions of the polymer near the impenetrable surface. A change in the composition of the lamina can lead to repositioning of chromatin towards the center of the nucleus. We explore various mechanisms by which lamina compositional shifts could lead to the dewetting of the condensate. Our theory not only offers an explanation for specific chromatin conformation experiments, but also contributes to the broader understanding of wetting onto responsive surfaces in multi-component systems."
"Betalains are water-soluble pigments with two major classes: red-violet betacyanins and yellow-orange betaxanthins. These pigments are increasingly being sought after as natural replacements for synthetic pigments in the food industry. Traditionally, betalains are extracted from cultivated plants but, due to low native pigments, the process is inherently inefficient. Now, as consumer demand increases, scalable and sustainable production routes are needed. To address this challenge, we engineered a heterologous pathway for the production of betaxanthins into cyanobacteria. The pathway consists of the cytochrome P450 CYP76AD1 and the L-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase DODA1 from Beta vulgaris (beet). Introduction of the two-enzyme betaxanthin pathway in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 did not result in detectable betaxanthins. Subsequent metabolic adjustments to the shikimate pathway, using a feedback resistant AroGfbr from E. coli, led to an overaccumulation of the aromatic amino acids phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine, and the production of 0.11 mg L-1 phenylalanine-betaxanthin. Optimization of the cultivation conditions (i.e., growth in nutrient-rich medium and CO2-enriched air) increased titers almost 150 times and led to the production of phenylalanine-betaxanthin with a final titer of 15.3 mg L-1. Our work establishes a microbial system for photoautotrophic betaxanthin pigment production without the need for exogenous amino acid supplementation."

"Symptoms of developmental language disorder (DLD) may in part result from an underlying deficit in statistical learning (SL). This learning deficit may be related to the ability to extract probabilistic properties of events in the environment, which is based on the functions of cortical and subcortical brain regions underlying SL. Using a behavioral SL task and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we tested SL ability in the visual domain and its neural correlates in children with DLD and their typically developing (TD) peers. During fMRI, children performed SL tasks involving sequences of two types of stimuli: easy-to-name (EN) objects and difficult-to-name (DN) objects. The children underwent a pre-training fMRI, one week of behavioural training and a post-training fMRI. Similar task performance was observed in both groups during the experimental sessions, with an improvement in performance following training in the SL tasks involving both EN and DN objects. FMRI results revealed that, after training, the DLD group presented greater involvement of the frontal cortex and temporal pole for EN objects. Furthermore, in the TD group, the left putamen, globus pallidus (GP) and thalamus were involved in the early stages of SL, whereas in the DLD group, these areas were involved in SL after training. For DN objects, after training, the DLD group presented greater involvement of the parietal and precuneus regions in the SL task performance. Our results suggest that children with DLD may employ different cognitive processes in SL than TD children, possibly as a compensatory mechanism."
"Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), a mosquito-borne neurotropic virus, poses a significant threat to juvenile humans, while causing mild symptoms in pigs, except piglets. Pigs with high viremia are amplifier hosts, whereas humans with lower viremia are dead-end hosts. The molecular mechanisms behind the varying viremia levels in pigs and humans remain poorly understood. A comparative multi-omics study was conducted on JEV-infected macrophages, the early site of JEV replication in both species. We identified 24 key determinants potentially regulating viral growth. Functional validation of three antiviral factors - LGALS1, ssc-miR-133a-3p, and hsa-miR-3614-5p, and two proviral factors - MIF and VMP1, in macrophages showed that the upregulation of MIF and VMP1, and downregulation of ssc-miR-133a-3p, enhanced JEV replication in pigs. In contrast, the downregulation of MIF and VMP1 and upregulation of hsa-miR-3614-5p reduced JEV replication in human macrophages. These findings provide critical insights into JEV infection and its species-specific dynamics."
"Evolutionary ecology seeks to understand causes and consequences of evolutionary changes across time and space, and genomic data present novel opportunities to investigate these processes. Genomic prediction - that is, predicting individual genetic values from high-density marker data - has revolutionized breeding programs and medical genetics. In wild populations, however, genomic prediction has been used in only a handful of studies, and only within populations. There is still a lack of applications that predict across wild populations, which could provide answers to questions related to spatially varying evolutionary processes, such as local adaptation. A severe challenge for across-population genomic prediction, however, is the decrease in accuracy when models are trained on data from one population and predict genetic values in another. Here, we used genomic prediction to predict across wild house sparrow populations, and compared the accuracy to within-population prediction. Predictions across populations were less accurate and more variable than within populations. We also highlighted limitations of the current theory for general genomic prediction accuracy, and related across-population accuracy to several population differentiation measures. Our results underline the necessity of understanding why genomic prediction currently performs poorly across populations, and of developing methods that exploit genomic data in novel ways."
"Tip growth is closely tied to fungal pathogenicity. Spa2, a multi-domain protein and member of the polarisome, orchestrates tip growth in yeast and other fungi. We identified a conserved short linear motif in the RabGAPs Msb3 and Msb4, and the MAP kinase kinase Ste7, which mediates their interaction with Spa2. AlphaFold predictions suggest that these initially unstructured motifs adopt an alpha-helical conformation upon binding to the hydrophobic cleft of the N-terminal Spa2 domain. Altering key contact residues in either Spa2 or the motif reduces complex stability. Mutations disrupting these interactions lead to mislocalization of Msb3/4 and Ste7 within the cell. Deleting the motif in Msb3 or Msb4 abolishes tip-directed growth of the yeast bud. Protein assemblies that spatially confine secretion to specific membrane regions are a common feature of eukaryotic cells. Consistent with this, Spa2-motif complexes were predicted in orthologs and paralogs across selected Opisthokonta, including pathogenic fungi and humans."
"Lysosomal pH is frequently elevated in age-dependent neurodegenerations like Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD), Alzheimers Disease (AD), and Parkinsons Disease (PD). Tools that restore lysosomal pH to an optimal acidic range could enhance enzymatic degradation and reduce waste accumulation. Acidic nanoparticles offer a promising strategy for restoring lysosomal function, but accurate tracking of organelle delivery and long-term retention is needed to optimize dosage. To improve detection and enhance delivery, nanoparticles were synthesized from Poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) polymers covalently linked to the fluorescent Cyanine3 amine (Cy3) probe. Nanoparticle concentration and loading times were optimized to achieve >90% delivery to lysosomes in cultured induced pluripotent stem cell-derived retinal pigment epithelial (iPS-RPE) cells. Uptake was heterogeneous, varying between adjacent cells. Once loaded into lysosomes, the nanoparticles were stably retained, with no detectable changes in concentration, distribution, or size for at least 28 days. iPS-RPE cells internalized more nanoparticles than the ARPE-19 cell line or mouse optic nerve head astrocyte cultures. Functionally, PLGA nanoparticles restored an acidic pH and cathepsin D levels in compromised lysosomes. In summary, Cy3-PLGA nanoparticles enabled improved tracking and long-term delivery to lysosomes, supporting future in vivo applications to restore lysosomal pH in aging and degenerating tissues.

Graphical AbstractIncreased lysosomal pH reduces degradative enzyme efficiency and contribute to age-dependent neurodegeneration. This study describes synthesis of nanoparticles to restore an acidic lumen and degradative function. Nanoparticles were optimized for lysosomal delivery to astrocytes and iPS-derived retinal pigmented epithelial (RPE) cells. The fluorescent marker Cy3 was covalently bound to polymers for improved tracking to lysosomes. Particles were stably retained inside the lysosomal lumen for at least 28 days. Nanoparticles restored pH to compromised lysosomes to baseline levels and increased active Cathepsin D. The improved design will aid in vivo tracking and repair in models where lysosomal alkalinization contributes to pathology. Created in BioRender. Mitchell, C. (2025) https://BioRender.com/8hvj96m.

"Phase contrast electron microscopy is fundamental for visualizing unstained biological specimens. Advances in electron detection have not yet overcome the low contrast caused by weak scattering. Here, we demonstrate that an orthogonal pulsed laser-electron beam interaction produces a pronounced phase shift through ponderomotive defocusing. With focus-tracking external optics, pulsed-laser lensing of the electron beam has the potential to simultaneously enhance phase contrast and correct aberrations in cryo-electron tomography."
"BackgroundHyperosmotic shock and the resulting cell volume compression are commonly experienced by organs such as the kidneys, causing rapid formation of hyperosmotic phase separation (HOPS) condensates in the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm. Although the tight relationship between hyperosmotic shock and condensation has been characterized, the dynamics of biomolecular condensates in hyperosmotically compressed cells and their regulatory mechanisms remain largely unknown.

ResultsWe used live-cell single-particle tracking (SPT) across different time scales to systematically characterize the dynamics of HOPS condensates formed by model protein mRNA decapping enzyme 1A (DCP1A). We found that HOPS condensates predominantly exhibited sub-diffusion rather than free diffusion, whereas some ([~]2%) exhibited short super-diffusion. Using tools measuring spatial accessibility inside cells and fluorescence labels for specific cellular organelles, we further revealed the origins of sub-diffusion and super-diffusion as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) attachment and coupling to microtubule-dependent active transport, respectively. Further, we reconstructed an accessibility map of the hyperosmotically compressed cell from trajectories of genetically encoded multimeric nanoparticles (GEMs), revealing that the cytoplasm of a compressed cell remains highly accessible without significant local corrals.

ConclusionsIn contrast to prior portrayals of the cytosolic space as static and constrained, our data suggest that the cytosol of a hyperosmotically compressed cell remains dynamic and accessible. Meanwhile, hyperosmotic and potentially other condensates can be spatially organized through docking to membrane structures, with intermittent episodes of long-range transport. These insights broaden our understanding of the physical environment within cells under hyperosmotic shock and provide a model for spatiotemporal organization of condensates via docking or coupling to existing cellular structures and processes."
"Imaging flow cytometry using Fourier light-field microscopy enables high-throughput three-dimensional cellular imaging, capable of capturing thousands of events per second. However, volumetric reconstruction speed remains orders of magnitude slower than the acquisition speed. The current state of art uses Richardson-Lucy algorithm, restricted to just 5-10 reconstructed per second with GPU acceleration. This limitation hinders real-time applications such as cell sorting and thus has bottlenecked the widespread adoption of 3D imaging flow cytometry. We introduce patch deconvolution, an optimisation compatible with the Richardson-Lucy framework that significantly accelerates convergence, achieving over 100-200 reconstructions per second on standard GPUs, a 20-40 fold improvement over Richardson-Lucy. Validated on both simulated and experimental datasets, patch deconvolution achieves reconstruction quality comparable to Richardson-Lucy in both static and flow data. This supports rapid cell sorting based on spatial features and enables advanced applications, such as detecting rare spatial events in large cell populations, which would otherwise be indistinguishable in traditional flow cytometry."
"The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a critical focus for biomarker discovery and therapeutic targeting in cancer. However, widespread clinical adoption of TME profiling is hindered by the high cost and technical complexity of current platforms such as spatial transcriptomics and proteomics. Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based analysis of the TME from routine Hematoxylin & Eosin (H&E)-stained pathology slides presents a promising alternative. Yet, most existing deep learning approaches depend on extensive high-quality single-cell or patch-level annotations, which are labor-intensive and costly to generate. To address these limitations, we previously introduced HistoTME, a weakly supervised deep learning framework that predicts the activity of cell type-specific transcriptomic signatures directly from whole slide H&E images of non-small cell lung cancer. This enables rapid, high throughput analysis of the TME composition from whole slide H&E images (WSI) without the need for segmenting and classifying individual cells. In this work, we present HistoTME-v2, a pan-cancer extension of HistoTME, applied across 25 solid tumor types, substantially broadening the scope of prior efforts. HistoTME-v2 demonstrates high accuracy for predicting cell type-specific transcriptomic signature activity from H&E images, achieving a median Pearson correlation of 0.61 with ground truth measurements in internal cross- validation on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), encompassing 7,586 WSIs, 6,901 patients, and 24 cancer types, and a median Pearson correlation of 0.53 on external validation datasets spanning 5,657 WSIs, 1,775 patients and 9 cancer types. Furthermore, HistoTME- v2 resolves the spatial distribution of key immune and stromal cell types, exhibiting strong spatial concordance with single-cell measurements derived from multiplex imaging (CODEX, IHC) as well as Visium spatial transcriptomics, spanning 259 WSI, 154 patients, and 7 cancer types. Overall, across both bulk and spatial settings, HistoTME-v2 significantly outperforms baselines, positioning it as a robust, interpretable and cost-efficient tool for TME profiling and advancing the integration of spatial biology into routine pathology workflows."
"Cellular senescence is a stable form of cell cycle arrest that contributes to aging and age-associated diseases through the secretion of inflammatory factors collectively known as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). While senescence is driven by transcriptional and epigenetic changes, the contribution of higher-order genome organization remains poorly defined. Here, we present the highest-resolution Hi-C maps ([~]3 kb) to date of proliferating, quiescent, and replicative senescent (RS) human fibroblasts, enabling a comprehensive analysis of 3D genome architecture during senescence. Our analyses reveal widespread senescence-associated remodeling of chromatin architecture, including extensive compartment and subcompartment switching toward transcriptionally active states, and a dramatic increase in unique chromatin loops. These structural features correlate with local DNA hypomethylation and are largely independent of canonical CTCF binding. The altered 3D genome landscape supports expression of SASP genes, inflammation-related pathways, and neuronal gene signatures consistent with age-associated epigenetic drift. We further demonstrate that architectural changes at multiple levels, including compartments, subcompartments, and loops, facilitate the derepression of LINE-1 retrotransposons, linking 3D chromatin structure to activation of proinflammatory transposable elements. Interestingly, quiescent cells, commonly used as senescence controls, exhibited substantial overlap in inflammatory gene expression with senescent cells, raising important considerations for experimental design. Structural analysis of cell cycle genes showed distinct chromatin configurations in senescence versus quiescence, despite similar transcriptional repression. Together, our results establish a high-resolution framework for understanding how genome architecture contributes to the senescent state."
"Recent advances in biological sequence indexing have enabled the efficient querying of sequence presence across massive genomic data repositories. While presence queries have become tractable at petabyte scale, retrieving quantitative information such as sequence abundances remains a significant algorithmic challenge. Existing abundance-aware indexes are mostly static, difficult to scale, and often trade off completeness, precision, or updatability. We describe a novel discrete abundance index designed for scalability, dynamic updates, and tunable precision. We combine an inverted index with probabilistic and exact structures to support fast, memory-efficient construction and precise high-throughput queries across thousands of RNA datasets.

Our experiments demonstrate that our method REINDEER2 achieves one to two orders of magnitude speedup in construction compared to existing methods, while maintaining comparable or better memory use. Despite using approximate structures for scalability, REINDEER2 achieves sub-1% error on abundance recovery and correlates strongly with reference quantifiers like Kallisto. It also supports sequence-level queries in seconds over thousands of datasets.

"BackgroundEpigenetic modifications play a vital role in the pathogenesis of human diseases, particularly neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimers disease (AD), where dysregulated histone modifications are strongly implicated in disease mechanisms. While recent advances underscore the importance of accurately identifying these modifications to elucidate their contribution to AD pathology, existing computational methods remain limited by their generic approaches that overlook disease-specific epigenetic signatures.

ResultsTo bridge this gap, we developed a novel large language model (LLM)-based deep learning framework tailored for disease-contextual prediction of histone modifications and variant effects. Focusing on AD as a case study, we integrated epigenomic data from multiple patient samples to construct a comprehensive, disease-specific histone modification dataset, enabling our model to learn AD-associated molecular signatures. A key innovation of our approach is the incorporation of a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, which effectively distinguishes between disease and healthy epigenetic states, allowing for precise identification of AD-relevant epigenetic modification patterns. Our model demonstrates robust performance in disease-specific histone modification prediction, achieving mean area under receiver-operating curves (AUROCs) ranging from 0.7863 to 0.9142, significantly outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods that lack disease context. Beyond accurate modification site prediction, our framework provides important biological insights by successfully prioritizing AD-associated genetic variants, which show significant enrichment in disease-relevant pathways, supporting their potential functional role in AD pathogenesis. These findings suggest that differential modification loci identified by our model may represent key regulatory elements in AD.

ConclusionsOur framework establishes a powerful new paradigm for epigenetic research that can be extended to other complex diseases, offering both a valuable tool for variant effect interpretation and a promising strategy for uncovering novel disease mechanisms through epigenetic profiling."
"Behavioral modeling supports theory building and evaluation across disciplines. Leveraging advances in motion-tracking and computational tools, we present a virtual laboratory for Drosophila larvae that integrates agent-based modeling with multiscale neural control and supports analysis of both simulated and experimental data. Virtual larvae are implemented as 2D agents capable of realistic locomotion, guided by multimodal sensory input and constrained by a dynamic energy-budget model that balances exploration and exploitation. Each agent is organized as a hierarchical, behavior-based control system comprising three layers: low-level locomotion, optionally incorporating neuromechanical models; mid-level sensory processing; and high-level behavioral adaptation. Neural control models can range from simple linear transfer models to rate-based or spiking neural network models, e.g. to accomodate associative learning. Simulations operate across sub-millisecond neuronal dynamics, sub-second closed-loop behavior, and circadian-scale metabolic regulation. Users can configure both larval models and virtual environments, including sensory landscapes, nutrient sources, and physical arenas. Real-time visualization is integrated into the simulation and analysis pipeline, which also allows for standardized processing of motion-tracking data from real experiments. Distributed as an open-source Python package, the platform includes tutorial experiments to support accessibility, customization, and use in both research and education.

Author summaryLarvaworld was developed to address two key challenges in behavioral neuroscience and computational modeling. First, it responds to the growing call for closer collaboration between experimentalists and modelers by providing a shared platform -a virtual laboratory-where experimental data analysis and behavioral modeling can be seamlessly integrated. By standardizing dataset formats and ensuring identical, unbiased analysis pipelines for experimental and simulated data, Larvaworld facilitates methodological consistency and enables rigorous model evaluation.

Second, it aims to bridge a long-standing gap in theory building and computational modeling at the level of the individual behaving organism. Historically, neuroscience has focused on sub-individual processes, while ecology has concentrated on supra-individual dynamics, resulting in discontinuities among the respective modeling approaches. Recent advances, however, have begun to align these fields, with neuroscience incorporating slower homeostatic processes and ecology integrating faster neurally-mediated mechanisms. Larvaworld boosts this convergence by adopting a nested, multi-timescale modeling approach, thus achieving behavioral regulation within the normative homeostatic constraints as these dynamically unfold during larval development. By combining established modeling paradigms from neuroscience and ecology, it provides a novel and flexible platform for studying behavior at the level of the individual organism, promoting cross-disciplinary insights and advancing computational neuroethology [1]."

"Tissue-resident macrophages may be trained to confer enhanced response to heterologous re-stimulation, and thus foster versatile trained immunity (TI) against both infections and tumors. However, key priming signals that contribute to such functional versatility in trained macrophages remain not fully understood. Here we show that influenza A virus (IAV) infection in mice induces lasting transcriptional imprints of acute type-I interferon (IFN-I) signaling in lung-resident alveolar macrophages (AMs) that confer balanced anti-bacterial and anti-tumor TI responses. In both IAV-infected mice and an ex vivo cytokine-mediated training system, IFN-I signaling is found to be critical to developing anti-tumor TI functions, although it limits anti-bacterial TI functions in AMs. Moreover, human AMs carrying transcriptional imprints of IFN-I signaling are associated with anti-tumor immunity and immune activation in lung cancer tissues. Our findings highlight IFN-I as a key priming signal required to developing versatile TI functions in AMs with balanced anti-bacterial and anti-tumor potential."
"Although aquatic, aerial, and terrestrial habitats are often treated as separate ecological systems, these environments exist along a continuum of connectivity: flows of biomass and energy routinely create linkages across water and air, blurring traditional boundaries. Here, we use eDNA sequencing to illustrate and quantify the movement of trace genetic information between water and air. We collected 27 paired air-and-water samples from two urban-wildland interface sites using passive air sampling and active water filtering. Metabarcoding with the MiFish-U 12S marker recovered 35 vertebrate taxa, 40% of which were detected in both water and air, ranging from the strictly aquatic salmon to wholly terrestrial cottontail rabbit. This reciprocal relationship suggests that eDNA pools form within each partition (water or air), with the probability of transfer governed by DNA concentration. In this view, detecting aquatic eDNA in the air is not contamination or stochastic noise but an expected, repeatable phenomenon. Logistic models confirm that higher abundance in one medium predicts spillover into the other. For instance, peaks in Coho and Chinook salmon eDNA align within 24 hours, demonstrating that passive air sampling reflects the temporal abundance trends of the most common aquatic species. In contrast, low-read-abundance taxa appear only sporadically, implying that rare detections are the first to drop out of cross-medium transfer and therefore demand intensified sampling in their primary habitat. Together, our findings bridge the conventional separation of aquatic and airborne eDNA and establish a unified, non-invasive framework for holistic vertebrate monitoring at the land-water interface. This approach offers transformative potential for conservation, invasive-species early warning, and One Health surveillance."
"The transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) is essential for adaptive immunity, delivering peptide antigens from the cytoplasm into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) for loading onto MHC-I molecules. Previous studies have revealed the mechanism by which TAP selectively binds peptides while allowing for sequence diversity, but how the bound peptides are transported and released into the ER is not yet fully understood. Here, we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of human TAP in multiple functional states along the transport cycle. In the inward-facing conformation, ATP binding strengthens intradomain assembly. The transition to the outward-facing conformation is highly temperature-dependent and leads to a complete reconfiguration of the peptide-binding site, facilitating peptide release. ATP hydrolysis opens the consensus site, and the subsequent separation of the NBDs resets the transport cycle. These findings establish a comprehensive structural framework for understanding the mechanisms of peptide transport, vanadate trapping, and trans-inhibition."
"Electrostatic interactions play a key role in protein structure function. There is a large family of mesoscopic protein channels whose selectivity is mainly controlled by the protein electrostatic properties and ion specific channel interactions play a minor role. The knowledge of the charge state of the ionizable residues over a wide pH range, often summarized in their pKa, stands as the most valuable information for structure-function studies of many protein channels. However, experimental pKa determination is a difficult task, typically accomplished using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance only in a limited number of membrane proteins. Thus, the pKa calculation is the most frequently used alternative. Constant pH Molecular Dynamics (CpHMD) simulation provides arguably the most accurate pKa prediction method in proteins containing many charged residues since it captures the coupling between conformational dynamics and residue protonation. Here we study the charge state of a general diffusion porin, OmpF, in which protons exert a crucial regulation of the channel discrimination of small inorganic ions as well as antibiotic translocation. We examine the pKa prediction using different methods, with the CpHMD simulations as benchmarking, and discuss the somewhat unusual titration of several acidic residues. The most widely used pKa prediction methods, though useful for globular proteins, fail to capture the specificities of channel proteins embedded in biological membranes. This is the first attempt we know to use CpHMD to study the pH- dependent charge of a large multiionic channel (with over three hundred ionizable residues) embedded in a lipid membrane."
"Room-temperature (RT) X-ray diffraction experiments enable us to investigate protein dynamics, efficiently probe fragment binding, and perform time-resolved crystallography experiments. The Versatile Macromolecular Crystallography in-situ (VMXi) beamline at Diamond Light Source (DLS) in the United Kingdom specializes in the collection of RT X-ray diffraction data in situ directly from crystallization trays without any manipulation of protein crystals, improving crystal integrity for fragile crystals. While many X-ray sources are now equipped to grow crystals on site for in-situ experiments, to date there has been no comprehensive analysis that we are aware of on the effect of shipping crystals on plates at ambient temperature for RT data collection, while the equivalent methodology for cryo-cooled crystals is well established. Here we examine the impact of shipping on crystals grown on MiTeGen In Situ-1 plates at the University of Buffalo Hauptman Woodward Research Institute (UB-HWI) in Buffalo, NY, United States transatlantic to DLS in Didcot, United Kingdom. We utilized the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL) Blue Box Thermal Shipper (Blue Box), which can maintain temperature for up to 168 hours, to ship crystallization plates at room temperature from UB-HWI to DLS. We hypothesized that long-distance shipping might compromise data quality through mechanical stress or temperature fluctuations. Instead, we found that room-temperature data collected at VMXi showed no significant differences for crystals set up at UB-HWI and shipped relative to crystals set up on site in the UK. High-resolution structures were successfully determined for all proteins in the study, demonstrating that long-distance shipment of crystals at non-cryogenic temperatures is feasible without compromising diffraction quality. This study provides a proof-of-concept workflow for expanding access to room-temperature crystallography worldwide, enabling more researchers to leverage cutting-edge techniques without needing to grow crystals on site."
"Background and PurposePeptide toxins isolated from animal venom are potent and selective modulators of ion channels, and promising therapeutic leads. Due to intricate disulphide bridge patterns, they are often challenging to produce in standard laboratory settings, which limits engineering approaches to manipulate their structure-function properties. Given the low cost, wide accessibility, and versatility of recombinant expression systems for protein production, we set out to establish a straightforward high-yield strategy across a broad panel of peptide toxins from snakes, spiders and scorpions.

Experimental Approach13 toxin DNA sequences were genetically fused to the C-terminus of either bivalent or monovalent human IgG1 antibody fragment crystallisable (Fc) domain sequences and expressed recombinantly from mammalian Expi293F cells. Affinity-purified proteins were evaluated by SDS-PAGE and size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). Function was assessed by Ca2+ flux assays on CN21 cells, or whole-cell electrophysiology on human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, or dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. Immunocytochemistry using HEK293T cells and mouse DRG neurons assessed Fc-toxin fusion binding.

Key ResultsMonovalent Fc-toxin fusions consistently yielded 1-6 mg of pure, non-proteolytically cleaved protein from 20-70 ml cultures for several toxin types, including three-finger toxins from snakes, inhibitory cystine knot (ICK) toxins from spiders, and -toxins from scorpions, substantially surpassing the performance of unfused toxins or bivalent Fc-toxin fusions which gave low or no yield. Snake toxins targeting nicotinic acetylcholine receptors retained high single digit nanomolar inhibitory potency. Spider and scorpion toxins targeting the voltage-gated Na+ channel Nav1.7 retained pharmacological function and selectivity across a panel of five Nav subtypes, albeit with reduced potencies that did not exceed [~]70 nM.

Conclusions and ImplicationsWe present a strategy for straightforward robust production of pure, monodisperse, and functional animal venom-derived toxins. This lowers the barrier to toxin production in a standard laboratory setting for follow-on engineering purposes."
"Insect herbivory elicits rapid and complex signalling responses in plants, including membrane depolarization, cytosolic Ca2+ elevation and activation of jasmonate-mediated defense pathways in local and systemic leaves. These early events are orchestrated by calcium-permeable channels and regulatory components that generate stimulus-specific cytosolic Ca2+ signatures. However, the molecular mechanisms that generate long-distance Ca2+ propagation and systemic immune activation on herbivory remain poorly defined. Here, we identify CYCLIC NUCLEOTIDE GATED CHANNEL13 (CNGC13) as a novel plasma membrane-localized, phloem-expressed Ca2+ channel that is essential for systemic wound signalling and defense against lepidopteran pest, Spodoptera litura in Arabidopsis thaliana. CNGC13 is rapidly induced by wounding and herbivory, mediates cytosolic Ca2+ influx, and is required for efficient propagation of Ca2+ signals from wounded to distal leaves. Loss of CNGC13 compromises the thioglucosidase-dependent breakdown of aliphatic glucosinolates into aglucones/isothiocyanates within the vascular tissue, which are essential for wounding-induced systemic Ca2+ wave propagation. Consequently, cngc13 mutants display impaired systemic jasmonate accumulation in distal leaves, reduced glucosinolate levels and enhanced herbivore susceptibility. CNGC13 is also required for AtPep-induced Ca2+ elevation and Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) signalling and interacts with the receptor kinase, PEPR2, implicating it in DAMP-mediated immune responses. Although CNGC13 and CNGC19 function cooperatively in herbivore defense, they do not physically interact, suggesting independent but converging roles. Our study identifies CNGC13 as a vasculature-localized Ca2+-permeable channel that functions downstream of PEPR2 receptor, to sustain systemic signalling, operating in a distinct yet converging pathway alongside known glutamate receptor-like channels during long-distance wound responses.

SignificancePlants must detect and respond to insect herbivory rapidly by activating systemic immunity to trigger defense responses. Calcium (Ca2+) signalling plays a central role in this defense network, yet the identities and specific functions of Ca2+ channels involved in long-distance herbivory signalling remain poorly understood. Here, we identify the plasma membrane-localized channel CYCLIC NUCLEOTIDE GATED CHANNEL13 (CNGC13) as a key integrator of mechanical damage perception, ricca factor-mediated systemic signalling, and jasmonate-dependent defense against Spodoptera herbivory in Arabidopsis. CNGC13 facilitates systemic Ca2+ wave propagation, activates jasmonate and glucosinolate biosynthesis, and promotes the perception of damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) molecules to confer herbivore resistance. This work uncovers a previously uncharacterized calcium channel that plays a crucial dual role in systemic wound signalling."
"The evolutionary origins of fungal effector proteins remain poorly understood, particularly how structural changes reprogram antimicrobial enzymes into host-adapted immune suppressors. Here, we show that domain modularity drives ecological specialization in chitinase effectors of the beneficial root endophyte Serendipita indica. The GH18 chitinase SiCHIT, which carries a C-terminal carbohydrate-binding module (CBM5), is expressed during fungal competition and antagonizes the fungal pathogen Bipolaris sorokiniana in the rhizosphere, thereby protecting plant roots. Deletion of the CBM5 abolishes this antifungal activity, while fusion of CBM5 to the CBM5-lacking paralog SiCHIT2 restores pathogen inhibition. In contrast, SiCHIT2 is induced during root colonization and suppresses chitin-triggered reactive oxygen species production, promoting immune evasion and host compatibility. These results identify CBM5 as a modular determinant of effector function, switching chitinase activity between microbial antagonism and host immune suppression. Our findings support an evolutionary scenario in which effector function in planta arises through domain loss and transcriptional divergence from an antimicrobial precursor, consistent with transitions along the saprotrophy-to-symbiosis continuum.

Significance StatementEffector proteins play key roles in shaping fungal interactions with both plant hosts and microbial competitors, yet how these functions evolve remains unclear. Here, we show that structural domain modularity enables ecological specialization of two paralogous chitinases arising from gene duplication in the root endophyte Serendipita indica. Through domain deletion and fusion, we demonstrate that a carbohydrate-binding module (CBM5) determines whether a chitinase functions in microbial antagonism or immune evasion. Our findings provide mechanistic evidence for effector diversification via domain loss and transcriptional divergence, supporting an evolutionary trajectory from antimicrobial activity to host adaptation. This work advances our understanding of how modular architecture drives effector evolution and niche specialization in symbiotic fungi.

"O_LIPlant nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat receptors (NLRs) sense directly or indirectly effectors - proteins employed by pathogens during infection. While indirect recognition can be initiated by unrelated effectors targeting the same cellular component, direct recognition is restricted by conformational constraints of the pathogen protein and corresponding receptor.
C_LIO_LIRecognition of XopQ (Roq1) receptor confers resistance to bacteria expressing members of the highly conserved effector family comprising XopQ/HopQ1/RipB. The structure of the activated Roq1 was solved previously, revealing that LRR and C-JID domains of Roq1 are involved in XopQ binding.
C_LIO_LIIn this study, we found that Roq1 detects HopAG1, a member of a structurally different effector family. Presence of HopAG1 in Pseudomonas syringae reduced bacterial growth and symptoms development in wild-type but not in roq1 Nicotiana benthamiana plants. Moreover, HopAG1 co-immunoprecipitated with Roq1 indicating that both proteins associate. Based on deletion and structural analyses, we postulate that this interaction occurs via the Nudix domain of HopAG1 that binds to a similar receptor interface like XopQ.
C_LIO_LINudix fold is predicted in multiple pathogen effectors suggesting that Roq1 may recognize effector families other than XopQ and HopAG1. Accordingly, it is also conceivable that other TNLs may detect a broader range of effector families than supposed.

"Plant reproduction involves dynamic spatiotemporal changes that occur deep within maternal tissues. In ovules of Arabidopsis thaliana (A. thaliana), one of the two synergid cells degenerates at fertilization, while the fertilized egg cell (zygote) undergoes directional elongation followed by asymmetric division to initiate embryonic patterning. However, morphological analysis of these events has been hampered by the limitations of conventional cell wall staining, which fails to label cells lacking complete walls, and by the requirement for transgenic fluorescent reporters to visualize cell outlines. Here, we report that the membrane-specific fluorescent dye FM4-64 readily permeates ovules, allowing clear visualization of reproductive cell morphology both before and after fertilization. This staining method supports high-resolution time-lapse imaging and quantitative analysis of early embryogenesis in living tissues. Importantly, it is applicable not only to the angiosperm A. thaliana but also to the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha (M. polymorpha) and the fern Ceratopteris richardii (C. richardii), enabling the visualization of live reproductive cell structures within maternal tissues and revealing fertilization-associated morphological changes. This simple and robust method thus provides a valuable tool for spatiotemporal and quantitative analyses of reproductive processes across a broad range of plant species, without the need to generate transgenic lines."
"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) produced by Arabidopsis are highly heterogeneous in protein content. Specific EV subpopulations have been proposed to participate in plant immunity, particularly during plant-fungal interaction. To understand the origins of plant EV heterogeneity, we used a proximity labeling approach to identify proteins and pathways involved in the secretion of distinct EV subpopulations. Proximity labeling, co-immunoprecipitation, and fluorescence microscopy in Nicotiana benthamiana all indicated a general role in EV secretion for EXO70 proteins (a subunit of the exocyst complex) and the immune-related protein RPM1-INTERACTING PROTEIN 4 (RIN4), while the ER-localized VAMP-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 27(VAP27) was specifically associated with the EV marker protein TETRAPSANIN8 (TET8). Despite being secreted in separate EV populations, we found that TET8 and PENETRATION 1 (PEN1) co-localized in multivesicular body-like subcellular structures. Based on these results, we tested Arabidopsis mutants and identified several proteins involved in EV secretion, including members of the exo70 family, rin4, rabA2a, scd1 (a GTP-exchange factor for RabE GTPases), and vap27. We also uncovered a possible connection between trichomes and EVs, as the trichomeless mutant glabrous1 secreted approximately half the number of EVs as wild type. Furthermore, PEN1 MVB-like structures were prevalent in guard cells, suggesting that guard cells may contribute to secretion of PEN1+ EVs on the leaf surface. Lastly, we found that exo70 family mutants are more susceptible to infection with the fungal pathogen Colletotrichum higginsianum, underlining the importance of secretion for plant immunity. Together, our results unravel some of the complex mechanisms that give rise to EV subpopulations in plants."
"Telomere repeat binding (TRB) proteins are plant-specific proteins with a unique domain structure distinct from telomere-binding proteins in animals and yeast. While extensively studied in seed plants, their role in early-diverging plant lineages remain largely unexplored. Here, we investigate TRB proteins in a model moss, Physcomitrium patens, to assess their evolutionary conservation and functional significance. Functional analysis using single knockout mutants revealed that individual PpTRB genes are essential for normal development, with mutants exhibiting defects in the two-dimensional (protonemal) stage and, more prominently, in the formation of three-dimensional (gametophore) structures. Some double mutants displayed telomere shortening, a phenotype also observed in TRB-deficient seed plants, indicating a conserved role for TRBs in telomere maintenance. Transcriptome profiling of TRB mutants revealed altered expression of genes associated with transcriptional regulation and stimulus response in protonema. Subcellular localization studies across various plant cell types confirmed that PpTRBs, like their seed plant counterparts, localize prevalently to the plant nucleus and mutually interact. In bryophytes, TRBs form a monophyletic group that mirrors the species phylogeny, whereas in seed plants, TRBs have diversified into two distinct monophyletic groups. Our findings provide the first comprehensive characterization of TRB proteins in non-vascular plants and demonstrate their conserved roles in telomere maintenance, with additional implications for plant development and gene regulation across land plant lineages.

"Human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV-3) remains a major cause of respiratory illness particularly among young children, the elderly and immunocompromised individuals. Despite significant efforts in therapeutic discovery research, there is neither an effective antiviral nor a vaccine available against HPIV-3. Host cell glycosylation is known to play a pivotal role in virus entry and replication. While some host glycan-based cellular receptors for HPIV-3 have been identified, the dynamics of the host-cell glycome upon HPIV-3 infection has never been studied. Herein, we report the first mass spectrometry-based study that provides direct insight into the remodelling of the human lung adenocarcinoma cell (A549) glycome upon HPIV-3 infection. Our results reveal significant remodelling of host-cell glycome, including increased expression of oligomannose and reduced expression of sialylated complex-type N-glycans. In addition, we observed altered O-glycan expression, with upregulation of core 1 and downregulation of core 2 type structures in infected cells compared to mock-infected controls. HPIV-3 infection also led to distinct remodelling of glycosphingolipid glycans. Together, these findings present the first evidence that HPIV-3 infection alters host-cell glycome, offering new insights into the virus impact on host-cellular processes."
"Disinfection remains a critical strategy for controlling the transmission of infectious diseases. However, small non-enveloped viruses exhibit exceptional resistance to many disinfectants, often requiring harsh protein-disrupting chemicals for effective inactivation, thereby limiting their applicability in personal care products due to associated side effects. Sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) is a widely used anionic surfactant known for its virucidal efficacy; however, the molecular details of its action against robust non-enveloped viruses remain poorly understood, limiting efforts to design safer and more targeted antiviral formulations. In this study, a multiscale simulation approach combining a novel atomic-resolution icosahedral ""scaffold framework"" and coarse-grained modelling was developed to elucidate the mechanism of SDS-driven disruption of MS2 bacteriophage capsid, a surrogate for non-enveloped viruses. Experimental analyses including dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy revealed that SDS inactivates MS2 in a strongly pH-dependent manner, triggering capsid disassembly at acidic pH while leaving particles largely intact at neutral pH. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated that SDS micelles preferentially associate with hexameric pores and inter-dimer clefts under acidic conditions, where protonation of acidic residues weakens the electrostatic network of the capsid surface. Together, these findings provide a detailed molecular framework for SDS virucidal action and highlight the importance of environmental pH in modulating surfactant-virus interactions. These insights offer a foundation for designing next-generation antiviral surfactants with improved efficacy and biocompatibility."
"A novel methodology for evolving antibiotic-producing bacterial strains is presented, based on interspecies competition and environmental pressure. Using a previously undescribed strain of the genus Pantoea, we established a breeding protocol in which gradual exposure to different bacterial pathogens at increasing temperatures resulted in the selective emergence of antibiotic-producing variants. The target pathogens included Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The competitive passages were performed over a range of temperatures, gradually selecting for strains capable of inhibiting these species. Antibiotic activity was confirmed via disk diffusion assays. Although the chemical identity of the active compounds remains to be determined, their biological effects are reproducible and strain-specific. The approach provides a low-cost, scalable method for the generation of new antibiotic-producing bacterial strains."
"The rise in multidrug-resistant pathogenic bacteria presents a major current challenge, highlighting the urgent need for alternatives and sustainable biocontrol strategies. Here, we report the genome analysis of a bacteriophage called Salmonella phage Tennessee Salten and attributed to a new Tequintavirus species. Salten was isolated following infection of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serotype Tennessee (sequence type ST5018). Its genome is 109,999 bp in length and contains 220 predicted proteins on which 197 are CDS and 23 tRNAs. Compared to its closest known relative phage Escherichia phage HildyBeyeler - sharing 84.6% identity - Salten harbours 16 unique or highly divergent genes. Of these, 13 encode proteins with unknown function, one encodes for a putative adenine methyltransferase and two encode HNH homing endonucleases. Moreover, the Long Tail Fibre protein, whose structure was predicted based on that of phage T5, was highly divergent among the Tequintavirus genus."
"Full-spectrum flow cytometry has demonstrated clear advantages over conventional approach. Cyteks Aurora platform has played a pivotal role in popularizing this technology, even though SONY introduced a full-spectrum flow cytometer earlier. Full spectral cytometers can identify the autofluorescence and unmix the autofluorescence much better than conventional cytometers. The default gain setting for Aurora, known as the Cytek Assay Setting (CAS), is effective for its intended purpose. However, there is no clear evidence to confirm that CAS provides optimal data resolution. This technical note outlines a methodology for enhancing gain settings to achieve a two-to four-fold improvement in resolution on average."
"Differences in reproductive behaviour can contribute to speciation by establishing reproductive isolation and can thus be a significant driving force in ecology and evolution. However, studies investigating intraspecific variation in reproductive behaviour remain scarce. In this study, we focused on a simultaneously hermaphroditic freshwater snail, Lymnaea stagnalis, a model organism whose reproductive behaviour is well documented, to examine behavioural differences among populations. In addition to a laboratory population, ten wild populations were sampled and standardised under laboratory conditions. Mating behaviour and egg production were quantified through observation experiments. The observed traits were analysed using a hierarchical Bayesian model to estimate the effects of each population on reproductive traits. Moreover, genetic information of the populations was estimated using low-coverage whole genome sequencing data, and phylogenetic signals for each trait were assessed. Our results revealed that populations exhibited distinct behavioural traits, and most prominent were the differences in male behaviours and the motivation to mate in the male role (after short and long sexual isolation). Egg production also clearly differed between populations. However, no phylogenetic signals were detected for any of the traits, suggesting that the diversification of behavioural traits among populations may result from evolutionary processes such as divergent selection or founder effects. This study highlights that reproductive behaviour can be highly diversified within a single species, and that assuming homogeneity in behaviour should be done with care."
"PremiseComparative studies of seed longevity assess how environmental conditions, species identity, populations, or genotypes affect seed viability loss in stored seeds. These studies commonly use the time it takes for seed viability to drop to 50% - known as p50, - as a measure of seed longevity. However, p50 is influenced by the initial seed viability. To allow comparisons regardless of the initial seed viability, standard protocols for comparative studies of seed longevity recommend using seed lots with ""similar and high"" initial viability, typically between 85 and 100%. However, even such range of initial seed viabilities might result in substantial variation in p50.

MethodsHere, we use a modelling approach to illustrate how variation in initial viability affects p50 estimates, and to propose alternative, more robust measures of seed longevity in storage.

ResultsWe show that for hypothetical accessions with identical rates of seed viability loss, variation in initial viability between 85 and 100% leads to a threefold variation in p50 estimates. Most of the unintended variation is introduced by accessions with very high viability (>95%). Restricting the initial viability to a narrower range (e.g., 85-95%) reduces but does not eliminate this bias. Alternatively, p50 can be recalculated to a standardized value of initial viability (e.g., 90%), which makes it proportional to the rate of probit viability loss without any noise. However, the most straightforward measure of seed longevity for comparative studies is the rate of viability loss itself, represented by {sigma} (sigma) from the viability equation.

ConclusionThe common measure of seed longevity, p50, is affected by unintended, substantial variation caused by varying initial viability of the seed lot, and is thus suboptimal for comparative studies of seed longevity among seed accessions. More robust measures of seed longevity include the rate of viability loss, or p50 standardized to a certain initial seed viability."
"This study investigates the contrasting patterns of genetic diversity and local adaptation between old-growth and recently planted Norway spruce (Picea abies) stands in northern Sweden. We assess neutral genetic variation, adaptive genetic differentiation, and the potential for future adaptation using samples collected from old-growth forests and recently planted stands. Our results reveal no significant differences in overall genetic diversity between natural and planted populations, indicating that current forest management practices have not substantially reduced genetic variation. However, analyses of adaptive variation demonstrate stronger signatures of local adaptation in old-growth populations, with clear correlations between genetic and environmental distances. In contrast, planted stands show weaker adaptive signals and are at greater risk of non-adaptiveness under future climate scenarios. These findings highlight the importance of conserving and promoting adaptive genetic variation within forest management to ensure resilience against ongoing climate change, while also recognising that current practices preserve much of the neutral genetic diversity necessary for long-term forest health."
"Targeted protein degradation (TPD) destroys proteins of interest (POIs) by hijacking the cellular proteolytic machinery. Most proteins in cells exist and function as part of multi-protein or macromolecular complexes, thereby allowing a single protein to control multiple biological processes. Therefore, when a small molecule degrader induces proximity between an E3 ligase and the POI, the macromolecular context of the POI potentially influences the degradation outcomes of the POI and of the complex components. Here, we explore degradation of the eight CK1-SACK1(A-H) (formerly known as FAM83A-H) complexes initiated by molecular glue degraders primarily designed to target Ser/Thr kinase CK1. We demonstrate that lenalidomide-derived degraders DEG-77 and SJ3149, which selectively target the CK1 isoform, co-degrade multiple SACK1(A-H) proteins. We show that the degradation of SACK1(A-H) proteins by DEG-77 and SJ3149 requires CK1, the CUL4ACRBN E3 ligase complex and the proteasome. In cells derived from palmoplantar keratoderma patients harbouring the CK1-binding deficient SACK1GR265P mutation, DEG-77 targets CK1 and mitotic SACK1D but not SACK1GR265P, highlighting the requirement for CK1-SACK1(A-H) interaction to achieve co-degradation. Our study underscores the importance of POI context in TPD and reinforces the potential for selectively targeting specific protein complexes for degradation."
"Coral reefs are emblematic ecosystems of astonishing biological diversity and significant economic value for many countries, yet they are increasingly vulnerable to direct and indirect human-related threats, such as heavy tourism and global warming. To assess the biodiversity status, track assemblage changes and forecast future trends of these megadiverse ecosystems, there is pressing need for accurate, rapid and comprehensive assessments of fish communities. Here, we employed a versatile low-tech passive environmental DNA collector, the  metaprobe, in association with the recreational activity of scuba divers to collect eDNA data from reefs in the Seychelles archipelago and assess both the taxonomic and functional fish diversity of the area. Using a fish-specific 12S marker on eDNA metaprobe samples collected during 18 dives, we detected 174 fish taxa, eight elasmobranchs and 166 teleosts, corresponding to 112 unique functional entities and including iconic tropical reef taxa, endangered elasmobranchs and commercially valuable species. Despite the geographic proximity of dive sites, we identified ecological patterns of fish composition and community structure influenced by both the presence of marine protected areas (MPAs) and the type of predominant substrate (i.e., coral vs rocky). Ecological differences between MPA/non-MPA and coral/rocky habitats involved both taxonomic and functional community elements, which returned very similar patterns of significantly higher fish diversity in protected and coral areas. We argue that simple, inexpensive eDNA-based collection tools in association with recreational activities, such as scuba diving, provide a promising approach for upscaling ecological data collection and expanding biodiversity monitoring, while engaging and empowering the public."
"The prospects of fabricating human tissue grafts or models using cell-laden bioresins in space has garnered significant interest in recent years. While there has been tremendous progress in extrusion or light-based bioprinting in microgravity conditions, printing of aligned tissues, such as those featuring anisotropic organization of cells and extracellular matrices (e.g., muscle, tendon, cardiac, etc.), remains a challenge. Furthermore, current photoresin formulations do not allow long-term cell encapsulation and are difficult to perform in microgravity. In this study, we demonstrate a new gravity-independent filamented light (G-FLight) biofabrication system with in-built refrigeration and heating units, which can create viable muscle constructs within seconds. We developed new photoresin formulations based on gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) for encapsulation of primary cells (murine myoblasts) and storage in printing cuvettes for at least a week at 4{degrees}C or -80{degrees}C. The tissues printed in microgravity based on the new formulations exhibited higher cell viability, number of proliferating cells and after maturation higher numbers of myotubes and fusion index compared to control formulations (i.e., GelMA dissolved in phosphate buffered saline). The microgravity-printed tissues also featured similar myotube density and fusion index to those printed using the same resins on-ground. The G-Flight printing concept, together with the new resins enabling refrigeration or cryopreservation with encapsulated cells, offers a promising solution for biofabrication in space."
"Spatial transcriptomics (ST) unlocks new potential for studying gene functions in cellular processes, as these functions often depend on the or-chestration of transcription across space. However, despite their growing number, analysis tools for ST remain largely aimed at data exploration, with few resources for theory-driven hypothesis testing. Whats missing is a way to test whether a factor of interest affects functionally relevant parameters of a genes spatial distribution. We present a tool to fill this gap, which we call a warped sigmoidal Poisson-process mixed-effects (WSP, pronounced ""wisp"") model. WSP models are the first ST tool allowing researchers to test biologically critical questions without bespoke preprocessing pipelines for identifying key spatial parameters. By aligning coordinates to an axis of interest and letting a likelihood-based regression find between-group effects on expression rates and boundaries, WSP models replace error-prone manual preprocessing with minimally biased hypothesis testing. Integration with genome databases such as GO and KEGG is straightforward, as WSP model estimates of effects take the form of log fold change values. Using MERFISH data collected from wild-type mouse pups, we demonstrate utility by using a WSP model to test the hypothesis that there are interacting effects of age and laterality on gene expression during whisker barrel development."
"Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is a critical co/post-transcriptional process that enhances RNA isoform diversity, regulating mRNA stability, localization and translation in a spatiotemporal manner. Over the past decade, long-read (LR) RNA sequencing techniques have advanced rapidly, producing datasets that could offer insights into APA mechanisms. Here we introduce APALORD (Alternative Polyadenylation Analysis of LOng-ReaDs), an R-based analysis tool for APA analysis of LR RNA-seq data. Leveraging precise 3 end information from 3-primed LR RNA-seq data, APALORD identifies polyadenylation sites (PASs) and quantifies PAS usage (PAU) at individual sites for each sample. It conducts APA analysis at the gene level (using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) and at the level of individual PAS (using DEXSeq) across sample conditions. APALORD was applied to direct RNA-seq data from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and hESC-derived neurons. PASs were identified with high accuracy and a transcriptome-wide 3UTR lengthening trend was found, consistent with previous studies. APALORD analysis of PacBio cDNA data from human tissues confirmed a 3UTR lengthening trend in cortex compared to liver. R2C2 libraries generated on the Nanopore platform were analyzed with APALORD and it revealed APA change associated with polysome fractions in human neural progenitor cells. In summary, APALORD offers a comprehensive framework for differential APA analysis using LR RNA-Seq data, empowering researchers to investigate 3 end dynamics across diverse biological contexts."
"Beat-to-beat variability of the QT interval (QTV) is a well-established marker of cardiac health, with increased QTV (> 5 ms) often associated with a higher risk of arrhythmias. However, the underlying mechanisms contributing to this phenomenon remain poorly understood. Recently, we showed that cardiac instability is a major cause of QTV. Early afterdepolarizations (EADs) are abnormal electrical oscillations that occur during the plateau phase of the cardiac action potential (AP), often arising when the membrane potential becomes unstable. In this study, we use a physiologically detailed computational model of rabbit ventricular myocytes with stochastic ion channel gating to investigate the relationship between QTV and EAD propensity. We found that increased AP duration (APD) variability, which serves as a surrogate for QTV on the ECG at the single-cell level, can arise even in the absence of apparent EADs, driven by intrinsic dynamical instability. As the cellular state approaches the threshold for EAD generation, small perturbations in membrane voltage are amplified, leading to increased APD variability. The phase-plane analysis in the voltage-calcium channel inactivation space demonstrates that proximity to the EAD-generating basin of attraction strongly influences repolarization variability, establishing a mechanistic link between QTV and EAD propensity. Furthermore, we observed that QTV increases at longer pacing cycle lengths (PCLs), distinguishing it from alternans-associated APD variability, which increases at shorter PCLs. These findings suggest that increased QTV may serve as an early indicator of arrhythmic risk before the manifestation of EADs, potentially offering a critical window for preventive intervention. Our results provide novel insights into the fundamental mechanisms underlying QTV and its potential role in arrhythmia prediction.

Significance statementThis study investigates the relationship between beat-to-beat variability of the QT interval (QTV) and the propensity for early afterdepolarizations (EADs), abnormal electrical oscillations linked to life-threatening arrhythmias. Using a computational model, we show that increased QTV can precede apparent EADs, driven by inherent dynamical instability of cardiac cells. As cells approach an arrhythmia-prone state, small membrane voltage fluctuations are amplified, increasing repolarization variability and thus QTV. Furthermore, QTV increases with slower heart rates, distinguishing it from alternans, another type of instability arising at faster rates. Thus, increased QTV may serve as an early warning signal for arrhythmia risk, potentially enabling preventative interventions. Our results provide novel insights into the fundamental mechanisms underlying QTV and its potential role in arrhythmia prediction."
"Circulating Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts (cCAFs) have been discovered in circulating tumor cell clusters from all stages of disease progression in breast cancer patients. We have shown that CAFs promote lung metastases in the mouse tail vein model when they are clustered with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) MDA-MB231 cells. Following on this observation, we saw that MDA-MB231-luciferase labeled cells persist at higher levels when present in CAF23/MDA-MB231 co-clusters compared to MDA-MB231 mono-clusters within the first 3 days after tail vein injection. This prompted us to investigate whether CAFs aid cancer cell extravasation from capillary venules into the lung parenchyma, which would impart better survival and faster seeding of metastases. Ex vivo lung extravasation assays showed that within the first 8-24 hrs after tail vein injection, more cells from CAF23/MDA-MB231 co-clusters extravasated than cells from MDA-MB231 mono-clusters. Using in vitro endothelial binding assays, we determined that CAF/TNBC co-clusters bind to HUVEC endothelial cells better than TNBC mono-clusters. Single Cell RNA-seq identified several genes in the fibrinolysis pathway whose expression increases in TNBC cells when they are clustered with CAFs. One of these genes is PLAU, which encodes the urokinase-type plasminogen activator, uPA. siRNA knockdown of PLAU decreased in vitro TNBC-endothelial cell interactions and ex vivo extravasation of MDA-MB231 mono-clusters, revealing a role for uPA/PLAU in breast cancer cell extravasation. Our data helps to define the role of CAFs in breast cancer extravasation and highlights the importance of our previous work showing that CAFs promote tumor cell dissemination and metastasis."
"Muscle wasting and weakness are important clinical problems that impact quality of life and health span by restricting mobility and independence, and by increasing the risk for physical disability. The molecular basis for this has not been fully determined. Klotho expression is downregulated in conditions associated with muscle wasting, including aging, chronic kidney disease, and myopathy. The objective of this study was to investigate a mechanistic role for Klotho in regulating muscle wasting and weakness. Body weight, lean mass, muscle mass, and myofiber caliber were reduced in Klotho-deficient mice. In the tibialis anterior muscle of Klotho null mice, type IIa myofibers were resistant to changes in size, and muscle composition differed with a higher concentration of type IIb fibers to the detriment of type IIx fibers. Glycolytic enzymatic activity also increased. The composition of the soleus muscle was unaffected and myofiber caliber was reduced comparably in type I, IIa, and IIx fibers. Muscle contractile function declined in Klotho-deficient mice, as evidenced by reduced absolute twitch and torque, and decreased rates of contraction and relaxation. RNA-sequencing analysis identified increased transcriptional expression of synaptic and fetal sarcomeric genes, which prompted us to test effects on muscle innervation. Klotho-deficiency induced morphological remodeling of the neuromuscular junction, myofiber denervation, and a functional loss of motor units. Loss of motor units correlated with absolute torque. Collectively, our findings have uncovered a novel mechanism through which Klotho-deficiency leads to alterations to the muscle synapse affecting motor unit connectivity that likely influences muscle wasting and weakness.

Key points summaryO_LIMaintaining skeletal muscle mass and function is critical to preserve physical capacity and independence. Clinical observations implicate longevity factor Klotho as a key regulator of muscle mass and weakness. Low Klotho levels are reported to correlate with muscle weakness and frailty.
C_LIO_LIUsing Klotho null mice, our study shows that Klotho-deficiency promotes skeletal muscle weakness and impaired motor unit connectivity.
C_LIO_LIRNA-sequencing analysis identified altered expression of sarcomeric and synaptic genes suggesting changes to the muscle synapse in Klotho-deficient mice.
C_LIO_LIHistopathological analyses revealed Klotho-deficiency is associated with reduced myofiber caliber, altered muscle composition, and increased prevalence of NCAM+ denervated fibers. Imaging of the NMJ further showed morphological changes and reduced area of synaptic contact.
C_LIO_LIOverall, our findings show that Klotho regulates the structure and function of the NMJ affecting motor unit connectivity which may have an important role in the pathogenesis of muscle wasting and weakness.

"Second language (L2) comprehension is thought to proceed hierarchically, from basic word recognition to complex discourse-level understanding. However, the neural mechanisms underpinning this hierarchical progression remain poorly understood. Leveraging the hierarchical nature of linguistic representations in large language models (LLMs), we investigated whether L2 proficiency modulates brain-LLM alignment in a layer-dependent manner. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data collected during discourse listening from 54 participants with varying levels of L2 proficiency, we constructed individualized encoding models to quantify how proficiency shapes the brain-LLM representational correspondence. In high-proficiency individuals, LLM-based models reliably predicted neural responses in a distributed network comprising temporal, frontal, and medial-parietal cortices, while for low-proficiency participants, prediction performance decreased. Notably, alignment in the superior temporal sulcus (STS) showed a robust correlation with L2 proficiency at mid-to-deep LLM layers, suggesting that the STS encodes higher-level linguistic abstractions essential for advanced language comprehension. These findings indicate that L2 proficiency modulates the hierarchical alignment between LLMs and the brain, providing insights into how L2 learning shapes neural language representations."
"Human high-level visual cortex has been described in two seemingly opposed ways. A categorical view emphasizes discrete category-selective areas, while a dimensional view highlights continuous feature maps spanning across these areas. Can these divergent perspectives on cortical organization be reconciled within a unifying framework? Using data-driven decomposition of fMRI responses in face-, body-, and scene-selective areas, we identified overlapping activity patterns shared across individuals. Each area encoded multiple interpretable dimensions tuned to both finer subcategory features and coarser cross-category distinctions beyond its preferred category, even in the most category-selective voxels. These dimensions formed distinct clusters within category-selective areas but were also sparsely distributed across the broader visual cortex, supporting both locally selective, category-specific, and globally distributed, feature-based coding. Together, these findings suggest multidimensional tuning as a fundamental organizing principle that integrates feature-selective clusters, category-selective areas, and large-scale tuning maps, providing a more comprehensive understanding of category representations in human visual cortex."
"Aging is a complex process characterized by a progressive decline in physiological functions driven by both biological and environmental factors, with notable differences between sexes. Immune function is strongly influenced by biological sex, affecting both innate and adaptive immune responses, including macrophage behavior. In this study, we investigated the effects of age and sex on the immune cell composition within the peritoneal cavity niche and identified macrophages as the most affected cell type. Macrophages, as central components of the innate immune system, play critical roles in maintaining tissue homeostasis and responding to infections. Here, we find that aging induces sex-specific remodeling of peritoneal macrophage transcriptomic and epigenomic landscapes. Consistently, peritoneal macrophages undergo sex-specific functional remodeling with aging (i.e. female-specific phagocytic decline and metabolic rewiring). Modulation of gonadal hormone signaling showed that changes in circulating estrogen levels likely contribute to aspects of female-specific macrophage age-related changes. Importantly, multi-omic analysis identified candidate transcription factors whose sex-specific age-regulated expression may drive aspects of sex-specific  omic remodeling with aging. Specifically, Irf2 downregulation in female macrophages recapitulates distinct transcriptomic and metabolic aspects of macrophage female aging phenotypes. These findings suggest that female-specific age-related functional remodeling arises through hormone-dependent and - independent mechanisms in peritoneal macrophages."
"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWHeartwater is a tick-borne disease caused by Ehrlichia ruminantium and remains endemic in the Gua-deloupe archipelago. While previous data from 1989 suggested a seroprevalence of 22% in cattle, no updated figures were available for livestock, and certain islands such as Les Saintes were considered disease-free.

This study aimed to update the sero-epidemiological status of heartwater in cattle and goats across Guadeloupe in 2024. Blood samples were collected from 261 cattle and 135 goats from all islands. Serological testing using the MAP1B ELISA was performed, and true seroprevalence was estimated using a simplified stochastic model that accounts for test sensitivity, specificity, and sample uncer-tainty. The mean cattle seroprevalence was estimated at 28% (95% CI [22-34%]), with no significant differences between Basse-Terre, Grande-Terre, and Marie-Galante. Importantly, seropositive goats were identified on all major islands, including Les Saintes. Our findings suggest that heartwater remains endemically stable in Guadeloupe since the 1980s and reveal for the first time its serological presence in Les Saintes. These results emphasize the importance of strengthening regional surveillance systems, including veterinary reporting, serological monitoring, and coordinated efforts to prevent further spread across the Caribbean."
"MR1 is a non-polymorphic, ubiquitously expressed, MHC class I-like antigen-presenting molecule that presents small-molecule metabolites to T cells. Studies have shown that MR1 plays a role in microbial infection, inflammation, and tumor immunity. The antigens it presents include metabolites of microbial and self-origin as well as small-molecule drugs and form stable complexes with MR1 that are displayed on the cell surface to activate T cells. However, unlike classical MHC I and II molecules, the fundamental biology of MR1 remains poorly understood, particularly the mechanisms governing antigen loading and intracellular trafficking. This knowledge gap is largely due to the lack of molecular tools available to precisely manipulate MR1 function. In this study, we describe a high-affinity (1.6 nM KD) anti-MR1 nanobody, MR1Nb1. We characterize the binding of this nanobody including affinity by ELISA and kinetics by BLI. Crucially, we map the binding epitope of MR1Nb1 on MR1 by HDX-MS, providing key insights into the mechanism through which it blocks MR1T cell activation. In functional assays MR1Nb1 effectively and specifically blocks MAIT cell activation by cells infected with M. tuberculosis or treated with M. smegmatis supernatant. This nanobody represents a unique and versatile tool for the field, as it can be produced inexpensively and expressed intracellularly within antigen-presenting cells. Hence, our study provides a powerful new molecular probe for dissecting the mechanistic underpinnings of MR1 biology and uncover its broader roles in immunity."
"The kinetochore corona, a polymeric fibrous structure, facilitates chromosome biorientation and mitotic checkpoint signaling during mitosis. How its main building block, the RZZ complex, assembles on the outer kinetochore remains poorly understood. Harnessing corona biochemical reconstitutions and cell biology, we reveal the paralogous checkpoint proteins BUB1 and BUBR1 promote non-redundant branches of corona assembly. MPS1-kinase-dependent kinetochore docking of BUB1 and subsequent recruitment of BUBR1 initiates assembly. Disrupting the first branch by depleting CENP-E, a kinesin that links BUBR1 to RZZ, uncovered a second assembly pathway mediated by a direct interaction between BUB1 and ROD. Discovery of a direct interaction with the RZZ explains how the SAC protein MAD1 fits this corona assembly scheme. Our findings solve the long-standing puzzle of corona assembly and demonstrate the intimate interweaving of chromosome biorientation and checkpoint signaling."
"IntroductionThe advent of full spectral flow cytometry has enabled the development of complex panels with over 35 colors, with the latest panels reaching 50 colors (1). This capability is made possible by cytometers equipped with numerous detectors beyond those in traditional cytometers and an expanded range of fluorochromes with emission peaks across the visible spectrum. However, our observations reveal significant challenges in the current unmixing, spread prediction, and panel design methodologies. Existing tools and guidelines, largely optimized for panels with up to 20+ colors, are limited in their ability to navigate this new ultra-high-color landscape. Without improvements in unmixing algorithms, predictive tools for spread, and design strategies, researchers risk creating suboptimal panels and obtaining inaccurate results. This article aims to highlight a range of emerging challenges associated with ultra-high parameter flow cytometry, particularly for practitioners accustomed to conventional panel design and analysis. As the field advances toward increasingly complex multiparameter experiments, novel issues have surfaced--many of which were previously unrecognized. Although this work does not provide comprehensive solutions to all of these observations, it underscores the need for continued methodological development. We anticipate that ongoing research by experts in the field will yield robust frameworks to address these challenges and advance best practices in high-dimensional cytometric analysis.

"Fetal movements exert mechanical forces that shape the developing skeleton. Conditions that impair fetal movements can cause skeletal defects, but interventions are limited. Here, we show that maternal wheel running exercise regulates fetal skeletal development in mice. In wild-type fetuses, maternal exercise stimulated joint and bone morphogenesis. We reasoned that these effects occurred through either indirect maternofetal communication or direct mechanical stimulation of the fetus. Maternal exercise did not alter placental measures of nutrient transport. However, in the Splotch-delayed (Spd) mouse model of fetal akinesia, which features intact maternofetal communication but lacks fetal movements, maternal exercise substantially rescued fetal akinesia-impaired joint and bone development and prevented disuse-induced resorption of the deltoid tuberosity. Further, direct mechanical stimulation of Spd limbs explanted from systemic factors similarly stimulated joint morphogenesis. Together, these findings identify maternal exercise as a regulator of fetal skeletal development, providing a platform for studying skeletal developmental mechanobiology and suggesting potential therapeutic applications for fetuses with impaired movement."
"Nutrient availability drives community structure and ecosystem processes, especially in tropical lagoons that are typically oligotrophic but often receive allochthonous inputs from land. Terrestrially-derived nutrients are introduced to tropical lagoons by surface runoff and submarine groundwater discharge, which are influenced by seasonal precipitation. Lagoon habitats are distributed along an onshore-offshore gradient; terrigenous inputs presumably diminish along the same continuum. We characterized nutrient enrichment in the lagoons of a tropical high island, Moorea, French Polynesia, using spatially distributed measurements of nitrogen content in the tissues of a widespread macroalga during the rainy season over four years. We used synoptic water column sampling to identify associations among macroalgal nutrient content and the composition of inorganic macronutrients, dissolved organic matter, and microbial communities. We paired these data with quantifications of land use in nearby watersheds to uncover links between terrestrial factors, aquatic chemistry, and microbial communities. Algal N content was highest near shore and near large, human-impacted watersheds, and lower at offshore sites. Sites with high algal N had water columns with high nitrite + nitrate, silicate, and increased humic organic matter (based on a fluorescence humification index), especially following rain. Microbial communities were differentiated among nearshore habitats and covaried with algal N and water chemistry, supporting the hypothesis that terrigenous nutrient enrichment shapes microbial dynamics in otherwise oligotrophic tropical lagoons. This study reveals that land-sea connections create nutrient subsidies that are important for lagoon biogeochemistry and microbiology, indicating that changes in land use or precipitation will modify ecosystem processes in tropical lagoons."
"Garter snakes (Thamnophis spp.) are the most widespread reptiles in North America, although evidence suggests that thermal preference has not diverged much among populations or Thamnophis species. To shed light on how thermal decisions influence local habitat use by the eastern garter snake (Thamnophis sirtalis sirtalis), we measured the thermal profiles of three habitats differing in canopy cover: open peat, mixed shrub, and closed forest. We installed biophysical models to record operative temperatures at a fine scale and assess habitat thermal quality. We also used coverboards to survey habitat usage. While the open canopy offered the highest thermal quality, we recorded the greatest number of snakes in the mixed shrub which had a lower thermal quality. Since environmental temperatures regularly exceeded the upper thermal limit of T. s. sirtalis in the open canopy, snakes might favour the use of habitats that minimise the odds of overheating. Therefore, open habitats potentially restrict snakes activity window and may not be thermally attractive. Our data show that T. s. sirtalis use habitats that vary in thermal quality, but warmer habitats are not necessarily better. Rather, snakes preferentially seek areas that offer a mix of open and closed canopies to suit their thermoregulatory needs."
"Sex determination, the developmental process that directs embryos toward male or female fates, is controlled by master sex-determining genes whose origins and evolutionary dynamics remain poorly understood outside of a few model systems. In contrast to the highly differentiated sex chromosomes of mammals, birds, and Drosophila, most anurans (frogs and toads) maintain homomorphic sex chromosomes that exhibit a rapid turnover, even among closely related species. To uncover the mechanisms underlying the emergence of new master sex-determining genes and sex chromosome turnover, we analysed 53 published anurans and one caecilian genome (>200 Ma divergence) and available transcriptomes. We asked how often new master sex-determining genes arise by gene duplication, whether and how often gene translocation associates with sex chromosome turnover, and if new master sex-determining genes evolve under positive selection. We find that chromosome-level synteny is remarkably conserved, with only a few fusions or fissions and no evidence for translocation of four candidate master sex-determining genes (Dmrt1, Foxl2, Bod1l, Sox3). Only Dmrt1 duplicated in 3 out of 50 species (excluding tetraploid Xenopus), and it showed strong testis-biased expression in all 8 species with available gonadal expression data. While Dmrt1 has evolved under purifying selection, Dmrt1 duplicates exhibit elevated nonsynonymous substitution rates and a tendency towards positive selection. Lineage-specific amino acid changes were observed in the conserved DM domain of Dmrt1. These results demonstrate that, in anurans, master sex-determining genes arise rarely via gene duplication, and more likely evolve via allelic diversification. Sex chromosome turnover is not associated with gene translocation, and is more likely driven by mutations on genes involved in sexual developmental pathway. All candidate sex-determining genes were under strong purifying selection, with the exception of duplications which are linked to positive selection. Our results suggest future research on anuran sex determination and sex chromosome evolution should focus on identifying allelic diversification and novel mutations on genes involved in sexual developmental pathway."
"Centromere clustering orchestrates the three-dimensional genome organization and, in turn, impacts genome stability1-4. In this study, we report the principles governing the chromosome- scale architectural changes associated with centromere clustering and declustering in Cryptococcus neoformans, an opportunistic human fungal pathogen. We demonstrate that centromeres and telomeres in C. neoformans are scattered around the nuclear periphery during interphaseG1, resembling metazoans rather than model budding yeasts. Hi-C data of the synchronised cells reveal centromere and telomere-associated heterochromatic regions are organized as separate compartments at the nuclear periphery, distinct from the euchromatic regions, that eventually shape the global organization of interphaseG1 chromosomes. Polymer modeling of the Hi-C data at interphase and anaphase stages strongly supports a global reorganization of chromosomes from the non-Rabl to the Rabl-like chromosomal arrangement. Most strikingly, while centromeres are clustered and replicate early in most yeasts, our sort-seq studies provide evidence that C. neoformans centromeres replicate late during the S-phase. In summary, we uncover yet unknown principles governing the chromosome-scale architecture that link centromere DNA replication timing, spatial centromere positioning, functional compartmentalization of chromosomes, and dynamic changes in the global three-dimensional genome architecture in a species that shared a common ancestor with metazoans more than a billion years ago."
"Spatial analysis is becoming increasingly important for studies, from epidemiology to tissue biology, as technologies advance and experimental costs decrease. However, the widespread use of spatial metrics such as Nearest Neighbor G(r) is affected by the fact that biological systems rarely satisfy the assumption of stationarity, which is required to appropriately use theoretical complete spatial randomness (CSR) measures. As a result researchers often use computationally expensive permutations to empirically estimate CSR for subsets of points or cells. Here, we present closed form analytical solutions for both the mean and variance of the sample-specific CSR for Nearest Neighbor G(r) to allow for fast and reproducible calculation without permutations. Using a multiplex immunofluorescence sample of clear cell renal cell carcinoma, we show that the theoretical G(r) for cytotoxic T cells overestimates CSR at low radii (due to spatial constraints between cells) while drastically underestimating CSR at radii between 20 and 90 pixels. In a simulated sample of 30 points, our analytical solution for the mean is identical to the average of G(r) measured on all 142,506 unique combinations of 5 marked (or positive) points. On the real clear cell renal cell carcinoma sample, our exact CSR is similar in speed to estimating CSR with 1000 permutations while our optimized Rcpp implementation is [~]30x faster and consuming [~]20x less memory than 1000 permutations. This permutation-free approach dramatically enhances computational efficiency and reproducibility, enabling scalable and reproducible analysis for studies in epidemiology, multiplex immunofluorescence, spatial transcriptomics, and related fields where accurate, sample-specific null expectations are important for comparisons."
"Hi-C and single cell Hi-C (scHi-C) data are now routinely generated for studying an array of biological questions of interest, including whole genome chromatin organization to gain a better understanding of the chromosome three-dimensional hierarchical structure: compartments, Topologically Associated Domains (TADs), and long-range interactions. Due to concerns about data quality, especially for scHi-C because of its sparsity, data quality improvement is seen as a necessary step before performing analyses to answer biological questions. As such, methods have been developed accordingly, among them is a set of methods that are ""random walk""-based, including random walk with a limited number of steps (RWS) and random walk with restart (RWR). Nevertheless, there is little justification for the use of such methods, nor quantification of their performance success. Taking correct identification of TADs as the end point, in this paper, we describe the characteristics of random-walk-based approaches and carry out empirical investigation for identifying TADs before and after random walks. Due to the lack of practical guidelines for choosing tuning parameters necessary for performing random walks, it is difficult to know how many steps of random walk for RWS or how small a restart probability for RWR should one choose to achieve good performance. Even in the unrealistic scenario when one has the hindsight of using the optimal parameter values, little improvement in downstream studies by first performing random walk was observed. This conclusion was based on extensive analytical analyses, simulation study, and real data applications. Therefore, the current study provides a cautionary note to researchers who may consider using random-walk-based approaches prior to downstream analyses."
"Biomolecular condensates, or membraneless organelles, play pivotal roles in cellular organization by compartmentalizing biochemical reactions and regulating diverse processes such as RNA metabolism, signal transduction, and stress response. Super-resolved imaging and single-molecule tracking are essential for probing the internal dynamics of these condensates, yet intrinsic Brownian (thermal capillary wave) motion of the entire condensate in vitro could introduce artifacts into diffusion measurements, confounding the interpretation of molecular mobility. Here, we systematically assess and address this question using both experiments and simulations. We deploy three surface-tethering strategies--using biotinylated DNA, protein, or antibody tethers--to immobilize FUS protein condensates on passivated glass surfaces. We show that tethering effectively suppresses the global translational and rotational Brownian motion of the entire condensate, eliminating inherent measurement artifacts while preserving their spherical appearance and native liquid-like properties. Quantitative analysis reveals that untethered condensates systematically overestimate or underestimate molecular diffusion coefficients and step sizes, particularly for slowly diffusing structured mRNAs, while rapidly diffusing unstructured RNAs are unaffected due to temporal scale separation. Comparative evaluation of tethering strategies demonstrates tunable control over condensate stability and internal dynamics, with implications for optimizing experimental design. Finally, simulations spanning the full physiological parameter space enable us to provide practical guidelines for assessing whether, and to what extent, tethering is beneficial, based on condensate size and the diffusion properties of the biomolecule of interest. Our findings establish surface tethering as a necessary and robust approach for accurate quantification of intra-condensate molecular dynamics, providing a methodological framework for future studies of membraneless organelles.

"Proteins are ultimately responsible for cellular phenotypes and are targeted by most anticancer drugs. However, beyond immunohistochemistry, proteins are not typically measured in precision oncology, meaning transcriptomics is used as a proxy. To determine how informative mRNA is for guiding personalised treatments, mRNA-protein correlations were analysed in three large pan-cancer datasets and made available in a web portal (https://procan.shinyapps.io/OnCorr/). OnCorr can be integrated into precision medicine programs to augment transcriptomics."
"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by a dense extracellular matrix (ECM) that sustains an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). While this protective niche has been described, the molecular determinants orchestrating its formation and dictating its immune interactions are not well defined. Using Perturb-map, we determine how dozens of different gene perturbations shape the growth and cellular environments of PDAC clones through space and time. Our study reveals dynamic, gene-specific adaptations of immune neighborhoods during clonal selection. We identified Serpinb2 (PAI2) and Serpine1 (PAI1) as key cancer-derived mediators of TME remodeling and immune evasion. These factors promote the deposition of a fibrin-rich ECM that shapes immune cell composition, locally retains and polarizes immunosuppressive macrophages and excludes cytotoxic T cells. Deletion of either Serpinb2 or Serpine1 greatly enhanced tumor response to anti-PD1 immunotherapy in an aggressive PDAC model. Transcriptomic analysis further linked their expression to distinct PDAC subtypes and poor patient survival. Our findings demonstrate that Serpinb2 and Serpine1 establish a permissive niche for tumor progression and show how PDAC cells exploit components of the fibrinolysis pathway to remodel the ECM, alter macrophage composition, and protect themselves from immune editing, ultimately reinforcing the role of extracellular factors in shaping an immune-privileged tumor niche."
"Phytocytokines are peptide signaling molecules in plant immunity. Extracellular phytocytokines and their cognate membrane-receptors have been described in various species; however, processing and release of these signals remains largely unknown. The Zea mays immune peptide 1 (Zip1) is a maize-specific phytocytokine, which is associated to the salicylic acid (SA) signaling pathway. Zip1 resides central in its precursor PROZIP1, thus C- and N-terminal cleavage is required to release bioactive Zip1 peptide. Two apoplastic maize PLCPs, CP1 and CP2, were previously shown to cleave PROZIP1. We investigated the localization and processing steps of PROZIP1 leading to Zip1 release and found that PROZIP1 undergoes processing in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and cytoplasm, where the N-terminal PROZIP1 is cleaved. C-terminal PROZIP1 translocates to the apoplast via an unconventional secretion pathway, likely involving exocyst-positive organelles (EXPO). The combination of antibody detection, protease cleavage assays and mass spectrometry provided evidence for a proteolytic cascade, in which intracellular processing of PROZIP1 is executed by the calcium-dependent metacaspases ZmMC9 through arginine-dependent cleavage. After secretion, C-terminal PROZIP1 is processed by apoplastic PLCPs, which release, but also degrade the Zip1 peptide. Together, these findings reveal a two-step mechanism of phytocytokine processing, translocation, activation and clearance."
"Polyploidy is a widespread phenomenon in flowering plants, with up to 30% of extant species being recent polyploids. Whether and how polyploidy modulates the action of natural selection remains debated, and the particular case of balancing selection has been poorly explored. This study investigates the impact of autopolyploidy on sporophytic self-incompatibility in plants, a striking example of a genetic system evolving under a special form of balancing selection (strong negative frequency-dependent selection). Numerical simulations reveal that under strict codominance, the number of S-alleles maintained in tetraploid populations is expected to double as compared to diploid populations. However, under a model with strict hierarchical dominance among alleles, the number of S-alleles increases only slightly, but gene diversity and observed heterozygosity are substantially lower in tetraploids as compared to diploids, due to enhanced dominance masking effects. Empirical data on Arabidopsis arenosa and A. lyrata confirm the latter predictions, showing similar levels of allelic diversity but dramatically lower observed and expected heterozygosity at the self-incompatibility locus in tetraploids compared to diploids. The study highlights the significant impact of autopolyploidy on patterns of diversity at the self-incompatibility locus, emphasizing the increased dominance effect in tetraploids. The results also allow us to reject a scenario of strong founder effects associated with evolution of the polyploid lineages."
"Sleep is a fundamental biological process essential for cognitive function, memory consolidation, and overall health in both humans and animals. Dogs, in particular, share many physiological and neurological similarities with humans, making them a valuable model for sleep research. Similar to humans, dogs can experience sleep disorders that disrupt sleep cycles and impair cognitive function. While serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitors (SARIs), like trazodone, have been shown to alleviate these conditions in dogs, their underlying neural mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study investigates the effects of trazodone on brain dynamics in healthy dogs using electroencephalographic (EEG) analysis. We compared treated subjects with a control group by characterizing EEG activity across wakefulness, drowsiness, Non-REM (NREM), and REM sleep states. Hypnogram analysis was used to assess sleep architecture, including alterations in cycle patterns and time spent in each stage. Additionally, we examined linear and non-linear EEG dynamics using Power Spectral Density (PSD), Permutation Entropy (PE), and Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC), as well as connectivity changes through Phase Lag Index (PLI) and coherence analysis. Our findings indicate that trazodone significantly alters sleep structure by modifying sleep cycles, reducing power in lower frequency bands across most sleep stages, and increasing power in frequencies above 13 Hz during Drowsiness and NREM. Furthermore, treated dogs exhibited increased signal entropy and complexity in lower frequency bands across all sleep stages, along with a reduction in brain connectivity in most stages and frequency bands. These results provide new insights into the short-term effects of trazodone on brain activity during sleep, with potential implications for its clinical use as a sleep aid in dogs."
"The temporal structure of an animals vocal output can be cognitively controlled, presenting an interesting aspect for vocal learning species that benefit from diversification. Although birdsong is the most thoroughly studied aspect of animal communication, its rhythms remain largely unknown. Here, we revisit the question of vocal individuality in the songs of male yellowhammers (Emberiza citrinella) purely from a rhythmic perspective. Yellowhammers use simple songs composed of two phrases: the initial phrase, with one individual usually having a repertoire of on average two such phrase types, and the dialect phrase containing the dialect that is the same for all males at a given locality. Some of the initial phrases are commonly shared between various males, but their combinations and frequency contours are individually unique and temporally stable. Using focal recordings of 38 known individuals, collected over three years in the same geographic location, we calculated a set of nine temporal indices to describe each song and compared individuals in a permuted discriminant function analysis. Subsequently, we calculated the potential for individual coding for each of these parameters. To assess whether rhythmic similarity may depend on the singers proximity, we calculated vocal dissimilarity as the Euclidean distances between each two males, and used Kendalls correlation. We show that yellowhammer males use individual rhythms, maintained over different phrase types and carried mostly in the inter-onset-interval variability and syllable rate, as in syllables per second, within the song. There were particularly strong rhythmic differences between singers among the closest neighbours, which decreased over the first 600 m. There was no pattern for neighbours beyond this distance. This study is the first to demonstrate the existence of strong individuality based purely on rhythm, as well as rhythmic differentiation from neighbours, in a songbird.

"Proteins are dynamic molecules that depend on conformational flexibility to carry out functions in the cell, yet despite significant advances in the modeling of static protein structure, prediction of these dynamics remains challenging. We introduce RocketSHP, a machine learning model that predicts dynamic protein properties from sequence or static structure with unprecedented speed and accuracy. Trained on thousands of molecular dynamics trajectories spanning diverse protein families, RocketSHP simultaneously models multiple dynamics features: root-mean-square fluctuations (RMSF), generalized correlation coefficients (GCC-LMI), and a novel structural heterogeneity profile (SHP) based on recent structure quantization methods. RocketSHP significantly outperforms existing methods in predicting simulation-derived dynamics. We reduce RMSF prediction error by 57% compared to BioEmu and calibrated Dyna-1 predictions, including an up to 73% error reduction for long proteins. We validate these predictions with experimental hetNOE data, and we demonstrate the ability to adapt predictions to different physical temperatures. We highlight RocketSHPs utility in constructing allosteric networks in the oncogene KRAS and identify structural sub-modules with correlated motions, and we validate RocketSHP by showing that changes in node centrality within predicted KRAS allosteric networks correlate with changes of folding free energy in experimental DMS data. Our approach makes predictions in seconds rather than hours or days, enabling us to perform the first comprehensive dynamics analysis of the entire human proteome. RocketSHP bridges the gap between static structural biology and dynamic functional understanding, enabling dynamics-aware structural analysis and variant effect prediction at scales previously unavailable. RocketSHP is available as free and open-source software at https://github.com/flatironinstitute/RocketSHP."
"Understanding the spatial organization of proteins in tissues is essential for elucidating biological function, but current proteomic imaging methods face limitations in resolution, sensitivity, and multiplexing capability. Here, we present IMPACT (Imaging Mass Spectrometry for Proteome Analysis on Compressed Tissue), a hydrogel-based workflow that integrates controlled vertical tissue compression following expansion to enhance protein detection while improving spatial resolution in mass spectrometry imaging (MSI). Through a 6-fold lateral expansion and 100-fold thickness reduction, analytes were concentrated at the surface to improve detection and enable analysis of thick specimen. Coupled with optimized in-gel digestion using hybrid enzymes, IMPACT increased protein identifications 3-fold compared to conventional MSI while maintaining spatial fidelity. We demonstrate IMPACTs utility in mapping low-abundance proteins and resolving fine anatomical structures. Orthogonal validation with immunofluorescence and integration with spatial transcriptomics further reveal protein-RNA distribution discrepancies, highlighting the need for direct proteomic imaging. IMPACT bridges critical gaps in spatial proteomics by enabling high-resolution, high-sensitivity, and multiplexed untargeted protein imaging, opening new avenues for tissue biology and biomarker discovery."
"Coloured noises, such as white, pink, and brown noise, have gained attention in popular media as potential tools for enhancing memory consolidation, sleep quality, attentional focus, and more. These terms refer to distinct spectral slopes, which give rise to perceptually different noise stimuli. Although empirical research on their effects remains limited, a prevailing hypothesis suggests that their influence may be mediated by differential effects on arousal. In this study, we investigated this hypothesis using pupillometry, a physiological marker closely linked to arousal. Participants (N = 31) listened to three types of noise (white, pink, and brown), each presented for 10 sec, while their pupil diameter was recorded. The results showed no significant modulation of pupil size across noise conditions. These findings suggest that, despite widespread claims about the distinct arousing or calming properties of coloured noises, they do not differentially affect sustained pupil-linked arousal."
"This study explores the use of Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) to identify and differentiate Biomphalaria snails infected with the parasite S. mansoni, which causes schistosomiasis. The study was conducted on two snail species, Biomphalaria pfeifferi (collected in the field in Senegal) and Biomphalaria glabrata (a laboratory strain). The snails were infected in the laboratory with S. mansoni miracidia, and their infection was confirmed by cercariae emission tests and quantitative PCR. MALDI-TOF MS was then used to analyse proteins from infected and uninfected snails to identify spectral differences. Based on protein profiles, the results of MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry made it possible to accurately differentiate between S. mansoni-infected snails and uninfected snails. An increase in the number of peaks detected and their intensity was observed for the spectra of S. mansoni-infected snails compared to uninfected snails. The application of principal component analysis to these mass spectrometry profiles confirmed the discrimination between the two groups according to their infection status. In addition, specific discriminating peaks were identified for each snail species, allowing for the distinction of infected from uninfected snails. The present study revealed, for the first time, that MALDI-TOF MS appears to be a rapid, reliable, and specific tool for the diagnosis of schistosomiasis in snails, offering promising prospects for the surveillance and control of this disease in endemic areas. However, further work is needed to establish a MALDI-TOF MS reference spectra database specific to Schistosoma parasites and to standardise sample collection, storage, and preparation in order to apply this technique in the field."
"Male investment in offspring rearing through paternal care is rare among mammals and the neural mechanisms governing its emergence are poorly understood. We leveraged the natural paternal behavior of African striped mice (Rhabdomys pumilio) in combination with brain-wide cFos quantification, single-nucleus RNA-sequencing, viral-mediated gene manipulation, and environmental manipulation to dissect the neural basis of natural variation in male parenting. We find that socio-environmental conditions drive individual variation in male alloparenting such that post-weaning social isolation increases paternal care while social living in higher density groups increases infanticide. This natural variation in care corresponds to neural activity in the medial preoptic area and changes in correlated activity across brain regions. Within the medial preoptic area, expression of agouti signaling protein (Agouti) in neurons is increased by group housing and is negatively associated with care, and overexpression of Agouti reduces care and enhances infanticide in previously tolerant animals. Naturalistic manipulations further reveal that Agouti integrates long-term housing conditions rather than food availability/hunger. Together, our results demonstrate that Agouti acts as a molecular integrator of socio-environmental information to drive variation in paternal care."
"How precise 3D interactions among cortical neurons underlie layer-specific computations remains elusive. We developed a graph-framework to infer functional connectivity from fast volumetric two-photon Ca2+ imaging in the awake mouse primary motor cortex. By converting deconvolved traces into binary spike trains, removing population bursts, and applying an adaptive, layer-specific statistical threshold, we reconstructed a directed, weighted network of [~]1,000 neurons. Decomposition into strongly connected components revealed [~]10-cell subnetworks, predominantly in layer II/III but often bridging to layer Va. Across six 20-min recordings, we found that (1) layer II/III dominates connectivity, (2) feedback (Va[-&gt;]II/III) links are more numerous and stronger than the feed-forward (II/III[-&gt;]Va) ones, and (3) information flows in [&le;] 6 synapses. We uncovered seven geometrical and dynamical motifs--ranging from compact columns to elongated diagonals--each with characteristic event sizes and durations. These findings reveal diverse, column-like microcircuits in M1 with a net ascending flow, suggesting that such subnetworks form elemental processing modules for motor control."
"Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) is a leading cause of pharmacoresistant epilepsy in pediatric populations, although its contribution to epileptogenesis remains incompletely understood. Recent findings indicate that hyperexcitability might stem from peripheral areas that are not dysplastic, rather than from the malformation itself. However, considering the significant variability associated with these malformations, it remains challenging to clarify whether this degree of disorganization contributes to changes in activity. In this study, we used the carmustine-induced animal model to investigate how varying degrees of cortical malformation influence neural dynamics. Local field potentials (LFP) were recorded using a multielectrode array (MEA) during both spontaneous activity and external perturbation. We developed a novel metric to quantify spatial heterogeneity in signal organization and evaluated its association with excitation-inhibition (E/I) balance. Our results reveal that alterations such as the aperiodic exponent value and the sparcity of clustering in signal classification are related to the extent and distribution of cortical abnormalities, underscoring the functional relevance of cytoarchitectural variability. This work advances the understanding of FCD-related network dysfunction and introduces analytical approaches with potential translational value for neuroscience research and pre-surgical evaluation."
"The prefrontal cortex (PFC), which is thought to be disrupted early in the cycle of substance use and addiction [1], is comprised of a complex microcircuit of long-range glutamatergic pyramidal neurons controlled by GABAergic-expressing local inhibitory neurons [2, 3]. Somatostatin (SST)-expressing neurons are a subpopulation of these local GABAergic inhibitory cells and provide both peptidergic and GABAergic control over these PFC circuits [3, 4], and are disturbed following alcohol consumption in humans [5] and in rodent models [6, 7]. However, little is known about how endogenous SST peptide signaling is affected by alcohol. Using ex vivo electrophysiology, immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and behavior, we demonstrate robust down-regulation of SST control over pyramidal output activity in the prelimbic (PL), but not infralimbic (IL), PFC after alcohol exposure. We also show this is likely mediated by changes in SST receptor expression levels and not disrupted expression or capacity for release of SST peptide, suggesting postsynaptic homeostatic changes to SST signaling following binge alcohol consumption in mice that may underlie post-alcohol dysregulation in mood. This provides insight into how voluntary alcohol consumption disrupts PFC peptide signaling and suggests a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of alcohol use disorder (AUD)."
"Auditory memory is considered less detailed yet more durable than visual memory, implying a modality-specific memory retrieval process. We used fMRI and multivoxel pattern analyses to examine how 25 participants encoded and retrieved naturalistic sounds and videos. Both auditory and visual targets reinstated item-specific fine activation patterns in the association cortex during retrieval, and reinstatement strength correlates with subjective memory vividness. However, auditory episodes showed a markedly larger reliance on internally constructed representations than visual episodes, quantified by retrieval-retrieval similarity after removing encoding traces. Sensory reinstatement correlated more to the (detail-related) posterior hippocampus, while internal representations also correlated to the (gist-related) anterior hippocampus. Furthermore, temporal voice areas preserved gist-level (human versus non-human) information from encoding to retrieval, whereas fusiform face representations degraded. These findings reveal that auditory and visual memories share a common sensory reinstatement mechanism, but differ in the neural mechanism that supports retrieval, with participants favouring gist over perceptual details during auditory memory retrieval."
"Stabilizing the upright posture of the trunk relies on vestibular and proprioceptive afference. Previous studies found that the feedback responses to sensory afference vary between postures and tasks. We investigated whether and how vestibular and proprioceptive afference contribute to trunk stabilization during different postural tasks, and during walking at different speeds. Twelve healthy adults performed tasks in a random order: sitting, standing on the right foot or both feet, and treadmill walking at five speeds: 0.8, 2.0, 3.2, 4.3 and 5.5 km/h, while exposed to unilateral muscle vibration on the right paraspinal muscles at the level of the second lumbar vertebra, or to a step-like electrical vestibular stimulation (EVS) with the anode behind the left ear. The mediolateral displacements of markers at the sixth thoracic level and sacrum in the global coordinate system were used to evaluate the responses to sensory stimulation. No significant responses to EVS at T6 and sacrum level were found in sitting and standing. Responses to muscle vibration were significant and differed between unipedal standing compared to sitting and bipedal standing. The latter suggests a different interpretation of the sensation of muscle lengthening in these postures. The magnitude of the responses to both stimuli increased from very slow speeds to moderate speeds. This may indicate that a different control strategy is adopted in walking at slow speeds compared to walking at faster speeds. From moderate to high speeds, the responses decreased, suggesting a decreased demand for feedback control at higher speeds."
"Somatosensory feedback is essential for motor control, yet artificial limbs are thought to lack such feedback. We investigated how the body and brain gather informative sensory signals from a wearable augmentation interface (a robotic digit for motor augmentation), and whether naturally-mediated feedback can support technological embodiment.

Participants intuitively interpreted natural feedback across perceptual tasks, performing comparably to state-of-the-art artificial feedback systems. fMRI revealed an immediate and distinct, topographically-organised representation of the robotic digit. After longitudinal training, this representation was further refined, becoming more similar to the biological digits, which correlated with increased subjective somatosensory embodiment.

Our findings demonstrate that wearable devices naturally provide a powerful source of feedback which is immediately integrated with our body. Long-term use can then promote device-embodiment across the sensorimotor hierarchy."
"We alter our sampling of visual space not only by where we direct our gaze but also by where and how we direct our attention. Attention attracts receptive fields toward the attended position, but our understanding of this process is limited. Here we show that the degree of this attraction towards the attended locus is dictated not just by the attended position, but also by the precision of attention. We manipulated attentional precision while using 7T fMRI to measure population receptive field (pRF) properties. Participants performed the same color-proportion detection task either focused at fixation (0.1{degrees} radius) or distributed across the entire display (more than 5{degrees} radius). We observed BOLD response amplitude increases as a function of the task, with selective increases in foveal pRFs for the focused attention task and vice versa for the distributed attention task. Furthermore, cortical spatial tuning changed as a function of attentional precision. Specifically, focused attention more strongly attracted pRFs towards the attended locus compared to distributed attention. This attraction also depended on the degree of overlap between a pRF and the attention field. A Gaussian attention field model with an offset on the attention field explained our results. Together, our observations indicate the spatial distribution of attention dictates the degree of its resampling of visual space."
"Mutations in the RNA-binding protein FUS lead to nuclear depletion and cytoplasmic mislocalisation of the protein and cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Using a novel FUS-ALS mouse model, we found that adult mutant mice develop loss of function transcriptomic alterations, along with aberrant cytoplasmic partitioning associated with translatome deficits. Neuromuscular junction innervation was selectively impaired in FUS-ALS females; however, reinnervation following sciatic nerve crush was equally perturbed in both sexes. Additionally, we observed cargo-specific axonal transport alterations, a process critical for neuronal maintenance. In vivo mitochondrial transport was impaired across FUS-ALS mice, whereas the transport of signalling endosomes was selectively disrupted in mutant females. Altogether, our findings identify broader and sex-dependent motor neuron dysfunction in FUS-ALS, emphasise the link between endosomal transport impairments and denervation in disease, and establish FUS-ALS mice as a valuable model for investigating early cellular impairments driving ALS pathology."
"From shifting visual scenes to tactile deformations and fluid motion, animals must interpret patterns of sensory flow around their body to construct stable internal models and produce adaptive behavior. Understanding of how such transformations are encoded within the brain remains incomplete. To tackle this question, we leverage the lateral line of larval zebrafish as a tractable sensory system sensitive to fluid motion that is used to steer navigation, feed, and avoid predators. By presenting stimuli of either direction to neuromasts along the body, we used high-resolution calcium imaging to map hindbrain responses. Unexpectedly, our findings challenge the notion that central lateral line processing lacks topographic structure by revealing a simple yet powerful principle centered on a egocentric spatial framework: the direction and location of local flow motions are encoded in reference to the animals center-of-mass. This simple representation enables the brain to register complex flow patterns and provides a robust basis for subsequent behavioral action selection. MON neurons that encode flow toward the center-of-mass broadly project to form bilateral connections onto reticulospinal neurons that coordinate forward locomotion while MON neurons that encode flow away from the center-of-mass displayed a more selective and unilateral projection profile to command neurons for turns. Our discovery represents a shift from purely somatotopic encoding toward an integrative representation of axial position and directionality combined, revealing a novel principle of encoding spatio-directional cues in the hindbrain. This study advances our understanding of how complex mechanosensory inputs select appropriate motor outputs via simple egocentric neural maps in the hindbrain.

Significance StatementSpatial and directional cues are essential to select appropriate actions in response to changes in the environment. How information from broadly distributed mechanosensors across the entire body occurs in the brain enables motor selection remains elusive. By directionally stimulating each and virtually all neuromasts distributed along the lateral line of larval zebrafish, our study uncovers that spatial and directional inputs from each flow sensors is encoded in the medial octavolateralis nuclei relative to the animals center-of-mass in order to subsequently recruit reticulospinal neurons driving forward and turn bouts. These results establish a new framework for understanding how broadly distributed inputs get integrated to recruit motor command neurons responsible for producing diverse behaviors."
"Aging is modulated by nutrient-sensing pathways that integrate metabolic and hormonal cues to regulate growth, stress resilience, and lifespan. Caloric restriction (CR), a well-established intervention, extends longevity in diverse species primarily through inhibition of the TOR signaling pathway. Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), a classic serotonergic psychedelic with emerging therapeutic applications, remains largely unexplored in the context of aging. Here, we show that LSD treatment significantly extends lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans and reduces age-associated lipofuscin accumulation, indicative of delayed cellular aging. LSD reproduces several CR-like phenotypes, including decreased reproductive output and increased nuclear localization of the transcription factor PHA-4/FOXA, without affecting food intake. Moreover, LSD treatment reduces lipid stores and downregulates global protein synthesis, both hallmark signatures of TOR inhibition. These findings establish LSD as a modulator of evolutionarily conserved longevity pathways and suggest that psychedelic signaling can mimic a caloric restriction-like metabolic state, paving the way for the development of novel geroprotective strategies."
"In the brain, different stimuli are represented by responses of a neural population. How is this representation reshaped over time by the dynamics of local recurrent circuits? We investigate this question in Neuropixels recordings of awake behaving mice and recurrent neural network models. We derive a mean-field theory that reduces the dynamics of complex networks to only three relevant dynamical quantities: the mean population activity and two overlaps that reflect the variability of responses within and across stimulus classes, respectively. This theory enables us to quantitatively explain experimental observables and reveals how the three quantities shape the separability of stimulus representations through a dynamic interplay.

We measure the information transmitted from multiple stimuli to the responses with an optimally trained readout on the population signal. This reveals a trade-off between more information conveyed with an increasing number of stimuli, and stimuli becoming less separable due to their larger overlap in the finite-dimensional neuronal space. We find that the experimentally observed small population activity lies within a regime where information increases with the number of stimuli, sharply separated from a second regime in which information asymptotically converges to zero -- revealing a crucial advantage of sparse coding."
"The activation and repression of genes is a fundamental part of proper embryonic development and functional tissue formation, ensuring that unique molecular codes are set up to orchestrate cell differentiation. Changes in chromatin organisation dictate accessibility to gene regulatory elements and control gene expression. Several molecular factors regulating lymphatic endothelial cell (LEC) specification and differentiation have been identified. However, it remains to be defined how chromatin is organised in lymphatic endothelium and how it orchestrates lymphatic vessel network formation.

In this study, we combined Hi-C and ATAC-sequencing to characterise 3D chromatin architecture and accessibility in LECs and blood endothelial cells (BECs). We have identified cell type-specific topologically associated domains (TADs) in LECs and BECs. Specifically, our data revealed changes in the TAD boundaries and differentially segregating enhancers regions in lymphatic-associated loci, such as prox1a and tbx1. This multi-omic approach also defined the regulatory logic for nine genes whose expression is enriched in LECs. In vivo validation of their short- and long-range enhancers confirmed their LEC-confined activity. Leveraging these datasets, we reconstructed mafba tissue-specific regulatory networks and identified a genetic interaction with tfe3a in vivo necessary to limit ectopic vessel formation. Overall, our work provides a powerful resource of multi-omic datasets that can be used to systematically determine the regulatory networks governing LEC identity and genes linked to lymphatic disease."
"YAP1 signaling is essential for development but its specific roles in early embryogenesis remain poorly understood. To shed light on this, we analyzed YAP1s role in regulating the pluripotency of the mammalian epiblast, using scRNAseq approaches. Conditional deletion of Yap1 in the mouse epiblast (Sox2-Cre) altered the expression of signaling genes, including Nodal, Wnt3, and Fgf8. Accordingly, Yap1 loss led to enhanced differentiation of the epiblast toward primitive streak lineages, as evidenced by the upregulation of T/Brachyury and Eomes genes. Furthermore, a proximity labeling assay in human pluripotent stem cells, followed by biochemical assays and molecular modeling predictions, revealed that YAP1 cooperates with QSER1 protein to regulate lineage genes. Our analysis shows that YAP1:TEAD4 enhancers recruit QSER1 to prevent RNA Polymerase II recruitment. Accordingly, QSER1 depletion, similar to YAP1, increases NODAL gene expression and leads to hyperactive NODAL signaling in human 2D-gastruloids. Overall, our findings define a role of YAP1 in the epiblast in vivo and uncovered an interplay with QSER1 controlling the activity of developmental signaling pathways in pluripotent cells."
"Classical histology struggles to preserve three-dimensional spatial context, prompting the emergence of optical tissue clearing techniques that enable imaging of intact specimens at cellular or subcellular resolution. These techniques have revolutionised fields like cell biology, developmental biology, and neuroscience. However, their application in reproductive biology remains unexplored - particularly in studying the complexities of testicular development. We developed a novel, efficient and affordable toolbox for studying intact testicular tissues, PT-CLEAR3D, that stands for primate testis - whole mount staining, tissue clearing and three-dimensional imaging. Intact testicular tissues from humans (transgender model), common marmosets and macaques underwent antibody labelling, clearing with organic solvents, and three-dimensional imaging using light sheet fluorescence microscopy. Marker specificity was confirmed by immunofluorescence staining of 3 and 25 {micro}m testicular sections, followed by imaging with confocal. The testicular structure was evaluated using several markers: spermatogonia (melanoma-associated antigen 4), least differentiated spermatogonia (Piwi-like protein 4), Sertoli cells (vimentin and SRY-Box transcription Factor 9), peritubular myoid cells and vasculature (alpha-smooth muscle actin), and NucSpot as a nuclear dye. PT-CLEAR3D efficiently achieved optical transparency while a commercial kit that was ran in parallel was inefficient. This study presents a pioneering three-dimensional visualization of intact testicular samples of up to 50 mm3 in size and imaging depth of up to 4.5 mm across three primate species. Remarkably, PT-CLEAR3D revealed critical details at both tissue and cellular levels such as the spatial distribution of germ and somatic cells, cellular bridges, and vasculature. Furthermore, PT-CLEAR3D enabled three-dimensional reconstructions that effectively reduce confirmation bias enhancing our observation of spermatogonial clones organized as single cells, pairs, and quartets. Importantly, it adeptly identified testicular pathology and the persistence of germ cell clones in select tubules within the transgender testis following hormonal suppression of spermatogenesis. This technological development offers a versatile toolbox with benefits such as applicability across multiple species, fluorophore multiplexing, compatibility with different fixatives and deep tissue volumetric imaging with cellular resolution. Overall, PT-CLEAR3D establishes a foundation for spatial evaluation of testicular development, presenting substantial potential for advancing our understanding of the intricate kinetics of spermatogenesis in health and disease."
"NKX2.2 is a transcription factor that regulates pancreatic islet beta ({beta}) cell identity and function; however, cofactor proteins that modulate the functional activity of NKX2.2 in {beta} cells are relatively unexplored. An unbiased proteomics screen identified chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 4 (CHD4) as an NKX2.2 interacting partner. CHD4 is a nucleosome remodeler that directs the appropriate differentiation, maturation and function of many cell types by activating or repressing genes. To characterize the NKX2.2-dependent and independent roles of CHD4 in {beta} cells, we generated Chd4 {beta}KO mice. Deletion of Chd4 substantially impaired the maturation and function of {beta} cells. The Chd4 {beta}KO mice were diabetic as early as 3 weeks of age due to the disruption of islet integrity, impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and calcium signaling, and downregulation of essential {beta} cell regulatory genes. These studies demonstrate that CHD4 is an essential transcriptional cofactor of NKX2.2 that is required for the proper maturation and function of pancreatic {beta} cells."
"The oocyte-specific isoforms play crucial roles in oocyte maturation, while current understanding of the oocyte transcriptome is mainly focused on gene level. Here, we utilized single cell full-length isoform sequencing based on third generation sequencing to detect entire transcripts in human and mouse oocytes. Isoform diversity during oocyte maturation was systematically profiled, including 6,736 and 4,902 putative novel human and mouse transcripts, respectively. More than half of novel isoforms were categorized as the novel-not-in-catalog (NNC) and may serve specific functions in oocytes, including novel isoforms of ARHGAP18, colocalized with microtubules and targeted knockdown disrupting oocyte maturation. Moreover, over 25% of NNC isoforms were derived from transposable elements (TEs), and their incorporation within transcripts could enhance isoform stability during oocyte maturation. Altogether, our findings represent a valuable resource showcasing the complexity and diversity of RNA isoforms in oocytes, as well as TE co-option for novel isoform generation and isoform stability enhancement."
"The DNA Unwinding Element-Binding protein (DUE-B) is a Cyclin Dependent Kinase (CDK) and Dbf4-Dependent Kinase (DDK) substrate that has been implicated in the control of DNA replication initiation. Knockdown of DUE-B in HeLa cells perturbs the G1-to-S phase transition and immunodepletion of due-b in Xenopus egg extracts blocks replication initiation. Combined prior evidence has suggested that Due-b may be a vertebrate-specific DNA replication initiation factor. Here, we asked whether due-b was an essential vertebrate gene in vivo, and whether it was critical for proper embryonic development in the zebrafish Danio rerio. We have generated due-b mutant zebrafish through genome-editing TALENs that fail to express due-b mRNA or protein. Our mutant zebrafish are viable and survive to adulthood. They do not display outward developmental phenotypes, and when stressed with replication inhibitors, do not differ from their wild-type counterparts. Cell cycle analysis demonstrates that DNA replication occurs normally. Our data indicate that Due-b is not a core essential component of the DNA replication initiation machinery required for vertebrate development. Instead, it may be a mechanistically redundant protein or play a specialized role in DNA replication control.

SummaryThe DNA replication factor Due-b is not required for zebrafish development or genome duplication, suggesting it plays a redundant or specialized role in DNA replication."
"Proper migration and positioning of migrating pyramidal neurons occur in an ""inside-out"" pattern and are vital for proper cortico-genesis. The contribution of factors produced by migrating neurons in the morphogenesis of a developing cerebral cortex remains largely unknown. Our previous research revealed that a radial-migrating neuron must navigate to bypass its post-migratory predecessor, which resides at the dorsal border of the developing cortical plate, before reaching its final position. This final stage of radial migration ensures adherence to the ""inside-out"" pattern at the cellular level. However, whether neurons consistently preserve their sequential order during the prolonged radial migration period remains uncertain. In this study, we found that nascent neurons form queues perpendicular to the cortical plate during radial migration, extending across the upper cortical plate by approximately embryonic day 19. Within each queue, the leading neuron acts as a barrier, restricting the radial migration of the following neuron to preserve their order. We further discovered that the Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (DSCAM) functions cell-type autonomously in both the leading and following neurons to maintain their sequential order. We find that DSCAM in neurons is necessary to generate a gap between migrating neurons by suppressing N-cadherin-mediated adhesion. Without N-cadherin adhesion, the trailing neuron fails to assemble F-actin at the proximal end of the leading process, preventing its expansion and subsequently hindering nucleokinesis. In Dscam null mutant or Cre-induced knock-out, this gap is not observed, allowing N-cadherin adhesion to persist. Consequently, all migrating neurons keep moving directly to the dorsal border of the cortical plate, and the queue of migrating neurons does not form. This research reveals that DSCAM preserves the sequential order of neurons during radial migration, playing a crucial role in ""inside-out"" cortico-genesis."
"Endosymbiotic bacteria extensively impact phenotypes of their eukaryotic hosts, while experiencing dramatic changes to their own genome as they become more host-restricted in lifestyle. Understanding the trajectory of such a genome has largely been done through study of animal-associated bacteria, especially insect endosymbionts. Yet, endofungal bacteria provide another natural experimental model for investigating how microbial genomes change when living inside of a host cell. Mycetohabitans spp. are culturable bacterial endosymbionts of the Mucoromycota fungus Rhizopus microsporus. To investigate the genome dynamics resulting from the endohyphal nature of this emerging model genus, we long-read sequenced and assembled new complete genomes to combine with previous assemblies, creating a global dataset of 28 complete Mycetohabitans genomes. All genomes were between 3.3 and 3.9 Mbp in size and were multipartite, structured into two conserved replicons with some strains having an additional plasmid. Based on evolutionary rate and gene content analysis of the different replicons, we termed the two major ones a chromosome and chromid. The differential presence of a third, mobilome-rich plasmid in some strains and the proliferation of transposable elements provide putative mechanisms for recombination or gene loss. The conservation of intact prophage and putative toxin-antitoxin systems, and extensive enrichment of secondary metabolite clusters in the Mycetohabitans genomes highlight the dynamic nature of this reducing genome. With fungal-bacterial symbioses becoming increasingly apparent phenomena, lessons learned from this symbiosis will inform our understanding of bacterial adaptation to novel hosts, and the process of microbe-microbe coevolution."
"Animals undergo major behavioral adjustments during ontogeny, but the cognitive and neural computations controlling these processes remain elusive. Here, we describe that zebrafish transition from light-seeking to dark-seeking, as they grow from larval to juvenile stage, within the first few weeks of their life. We apply a combination of complementary phototaxis assays in virtual reality and modeling to dissect the algorithmic basis of this transition. We identify three parallel pathways, one analyzing whole-field luminance levels, one comparing spatial light levels across eyes, and one computing eye-specific temporal derivatives. Larvae mostly use the latter two spatio-temporal computations for navigation, while juveniles largely employ the first one. We build a library of agent-based models to predict animal behavior across stimulation conditions and in more complex environments. Model-based extraction of latent cognitive variables points towards potential neural correlates of the observed behavioral inversion and illustrates a novel way to explore the mechanisms of vertebrate ontogeny. We suggest that zebrafish phototaxis is regulated via parallel processing streams, which could be a universal implementation to change strategies depending on developmental stage, context, or internal state, making behavior flexible and goal-oriented."
"Significance statementWe show that visually naive chicks spontaneously prefer specific multipoint correlation patterns, mirroring preferences seen in humans and rats, and reflecting the most informative structures in natural scenes. This provides evidence that efficient coding mechanisms may be innately driven by evolutionary predispositions. Notably, early visual experience through imprinting can alter these preferences, highlighting a role for learning in shaping visual processing.

Recent studies have revealed that human and non-human animals (rats) can detect luminance distribution and correlations between pixels in an image (ranging from 2-point to 4-point). This sensitivity is believed to stem from optimization processes in the visual system that operate through efficient coding mechanisms to extract the most informative image statistics from the environment. However, it is yet to be determined whether this optimization is evolutionarily given by inborn mechanisms or shaped by visual experience. Here we report that newly-hatched visually naive domestic chicks spontaneously prefer to approach luminance, 2-point and 4-point correlation patterns (respectively, horizontal lines and rectangular patterns), while showing no preference for 3-point correlation over white noise controls. This parallels the ranking observed in adult humans and rats, thus suggesting that evolutionarily given biological predispositions largely drive efficient coding of natural images. We also found that learning by exposure to visual stimuli, as occurs naturally during visual imprinting, induced a preference for white noise over point correlation patterns in chicks exposed to 3- and 4-point patterns. We hypothesize that this behavior could reflect chicks preference for stimuli of lower statistical complexity."
"In this paper, we introduce a speckle contrast optical spectroscopy/tomography (SCOS/SCOT) configuration based on an integrated imaging approach exploiting 113 micro-objetives mounted on a commercial CMOS camera that operates without fiber coupling, suitable for direct skin contact measurements and simultaneous multiple source-detector separation acquisitions. This compact system was validated ex vivo on phantoms and in vivo by monitoring the blood flow on the forearm muscle of a healthy human subject. The measurements, performed at multiple source-detector separations and camera exposure times, demonstrate excellent agreement with the theory based on the correlation-diffusion model. In vivo data demonstrate the capability of tracking pulsatile blood flow with a high signal-to-noise ratio (> 4 harmonics of the cardiac pulse frequency detected) and sensitivity to small changes in muscle blood flow. This microlens array-based design overcomes a key challenge towards wearable SCOS/SCOT devices."

"Recent advancements in spatial transcriptomics technology have generated substantial volumes of spatial transcriptome data. However, the quality of this data is often compromised due to the limitations of current sequencing technologies. To address this issue, DiffusionST proposes a method for imputing spatial transcriptomics data and clustering the imputed data. The method employs a graph convolutional network (GCN) model combined with a newly designed loss function, denoising data using the zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) distribution, and data enhancement through a diffusion model to improve clustering accuracy. DiffusionST demonstrates superior clustering accuracy compared to six of the most popular spatial transcriptomics clustering algorithms. DiffusionST also excels in data imputation when compared to five single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) imputation algorithms. Additionally, DiffusionSTs robustness against noise is quantitatively validated by manually introducing random dropout noise into the dataset, where our model significantly enhances the quality of spatial transcriptomic data. Moreover, DiffusionST is well-suited for high-resolution spatial transcriptomics data and has been demonstrated, through survival analysis and cell-cell communication studies, to dissect spatial domains within breast cancer tissues. These findings provide strong evidence of DiffusionSTs efficacy in handling spatial transcriptomic data especially with strong noise, making it a valuable tool in this field."
"DNA-encoded libraries (DELs) facilitate high-throughput screening of trillions of molecules against protein targets through split-pool synthesis and DNA tagging. Despite their potential, few DEL-derived compounds have advanced to clinical trials or reached the market. A better understanding of the defining characteristics of target proteins, particularly those with binding pockets suitable for DEL screening, is critical to improving success rates. However, existing approaches remain limited in assessing pocket flexibility and functional similarity. Here, we present ErePOC, a pocket representation model based on contrastive learning with ESM-2 embeddings to address these challenges. ErePOC captures both structural and functional features of binding pockets, enabling identification of shared characteristics among DEL targets. By integrating analyses of low-dimensional physicochemical properties and high-dimensional ErePOC embeddings, we provide a comprehensive view of DEL target space. With 98% precision in downstream classification tasks, ErePOC demonstrates high performance in pocket representation, which is then applied to predict human proteins suitable for DEL screening, with enrichment uncovered across 18 functional categories. This work establishes a new framework for enhancing DEL-based drug discovery through more effective target selection and pocket similarity analysis."
"Nitrogen (N) fixation with non-thermal plasmas has been proposed as a sustainable alternative to meet growing N fertilizer demands for agriculture. This technology generates Plasma Activated Water (PAW) with a range of chemical compositions, including different concentrations of nitrate (NO-) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), among other compounds. Potential use of PAW as an effective crop fertilizer necessitates a robust understanding of the underlying biology of the plant, which is not yet available. The lack of a unified standard in PAW production and the varying chemical make-up that results from different devices and protocols hampers comparative studies and adoption of this technology. The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of two PAW solutions with differing concentrations of H2O2 produced from a Radio Frequency (RF) glow discharge plasma source. The effect of these solutions on plant growth, ROS accumulation, gene expression and heat stress response were compared to N-equivalent controls in the model plant Arabidopsis to assess their potential as an alternative N fertilizer. While PAW solutions lacking detectable H2O2 enhanced seedling growth, those containing approximately 0.3 {micro}M of H2O2 did not. ROS accumulation in root tissues was similar between PAW and chemically equivalent solutions, suggesting H2O2 is the primary ROS present in the PAW at the time of treatment. Gene expression studies showed induction of genes involved in N uptake and assimilation in PAW-treated seedlings. Pre- treatment of seedlings with PAW solutions containing H2O2 improved root growth under heat stress which indicates that this treatment may induce plant stress response pathways. Finally, mature plants showed similar growth when fertilized with PAW lacking H2O2 or NO3- control regimes for over 5 weeks indicating equivalency in chemical composition, plant nutrient uptake and utilization. Overall, these results demonstrate that PAW is an effective alternative to NO3- fertilizers for plant cultivation but the levels of H2O2 need to be carefully controlled."
"Data analysis of sperm morphology is critical for evaluating bull fertility, yet it is often performed using light microscopy and staining techniques in a highly subjective and manual manner. In this study, we introduce a scalable, high-resolution approach combining label-free Imaging Flow Cytometry (IFC) with deep learning for automated classification of bovine sperm morphology. We analyzed 436,374 single-cell images obtained from three prominent bull breeds in Kazakhstan - Kazakh Whitehead, Auliekol, and Simmental from fresh and cryopreserved sperm - providing a uniquely large and diverse dataset. The dataset was used for training and evaluation of deep learning models, among which the convolutional neural network (CNN) MobileNetV4 yielded superior results, achieving 92.3% accuracy and a 0.91 F1-score after training with a Layer-wise Pretraining and Fine-Tuning (LP-FT) strategy. The model classified spermatozoa into eight distinct morphological categories. The CNN-based pipeline ensured consistent, observer-independent classification across all samples. Testing across different conditions and breeds resulted in a 5-10% drop in generalization performance, highlighting the impact of domain-specific biases and underscoring the need for larger, standardized datasets. The proportion of morphologically abnormal spermatozoa varied between seasons and after cryopreservation. This study highlights the advantages of integrating IFC and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for robust, high-throughput, and objective label- free spermatozoa morphology assessment in fresh and cryopreserved sperm, offering a promising tool for improving fertility diagnostics and breeding strategies in veterinary practice."
"Body color plays key roles in fitness, communication with others, and hiding. In poikilothermal vertebrates, the body color is mainly determined by types and distributions of chromatophores. Among them, carotenoid color of xanthophores/erythrophores is important for interspecific diversity and colorful males as sexual dimorphism. Most vertebrates cannot synthesize carotenoids in their bodies and must ingest them from food. However, the genes involved in the uptake process are not fully understood. Therefore, we tried to identify the causal gene of the carotenoid color mutant of medaka. The HdrR-II1 strain used in the genome project has orange body color in males and white body color in females. The orange and white body color was known to be controlled by the sex-linked R locus, but the causal gene of this was unknown. In this study, we identified that the causal gene of the R locus is tetratricopeptide repeat domain 39b like (ttc39bl). In the HdrR-II1, the ttc39bl on the Y chromosome is normal, but the ttc39bl on the X chromosome has an 821 bases insertion in exon 3 and is broken. This insertion is also present on both the X and Y chromosomes of commercially available white medaka."
"Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are central to Parkinsons disease (PD) pathogenesis, particularly affecting substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) dopamine (DA) neurons. Here, we investigate how the R1441G mutation in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), a key genetic contributor to familial and sporadic PD, impacts mitochondrial function in midbrain DA neurons. Using a BAC transgenic mouse model overexpressing human LRRK2-R1441G, we crossed these mice with TH-mito-roGFP mice, enabling mitochondria-targeted redox imaging in DA neurons. The two-photon imaging of acute brain slices from 3-, 6-, and 10-month-old mice revealed a progressive elevated oxidative stress in SNc DA neurons and their striatal projections, accompanied with reduced respiratory complex activity and decline in mitochondrial health. Spatial transcriptomics via GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler identified molecular changes linked to dysregulated mitochondrial uncoupling protein function and calcium homeostasis. These findings demonstrate age-dependent mitochondrial dysfunction in LRRK2-mutant SNc DA neurons, highlighting calcium channels and uncoupling proteins as potential therapeutic targets to slow PD progression."
"Biological aging and sex interact to shape systemic metabolism, yet their role in chronic pain resolution remains unexplored. We hypothesized that metabolic resilience -- the ability to flexibly switch fuel sources and maintain energy homeostasis -- rules successful recovery from nerve injury in a sex-dependent manner during aging.

In 12-month-old male and female mice -- corresponding to the perimenopausal phase in females and the onset of hormonal decline in both sexes -- we induced sciatic nerve chronic constriction injury and performed multi-omics profiling during Wallerian degeneration, a phase known to trigger long-term neurobiological remodeling. Aging females exhibited early activation of fatty acid oxidation, increased resting energy expenditure, upregulation of mitochondrial redox enzymes and circulating progesterone and corticosterone. Proteomic and metabolomic analysis revealed pentose phosphate pathway enrichment and gluconeogenesis, supporting redox balance and metabolic flexibility. Conversely, males displayed persistent glycolytic reliance, long-chain acylcarnitine accumulation, suppression of adiponectin and PPAR{gamma}, indicating metabolic inflexibility.

Longitudinal behavioral analysis revealed that aging females recovered earlier and more fully than aging males, reversing the pattern previously shown in our adult mouse study, where females developed persistent pain and males recovered rapidly. These patterns highlight a non-linear, sex-specific interaction between biological aging and injury response, where hormonal decline reprograms the metabolic trajectory and reshapes pain outcomes.

Metabolic resilience governs sex-specific recovery following nerve injury by directing early systemic adaptations that precede and predict long-term pain trajectories. These results define mechanistically anchored, sex- and age-specific biomarkers, and propose preclinical targets for timely, personalized interventions in age-associated neuropathic pain."
"There is a drive to improve the acceptability of sweeteners like stevia by reducing their off-tastes. The main aim was to examine the synergistic neural effects of combining stevia with a flavor modifier and secondly to examine stevia vs. sucrose due to limited human neuroimaging data and concerns that sweeteners may be more addictive than sugar.

In a within-subjects fMRI study, 34 healthy adults (Mean age = 25) tasted four conditions: stevia, stevia plus a flavor modifier, the modifier alone, and sucrose. We analyzed whole-brain responses and focused on regions of interest (ROIs) including the insula, postcentral gyrus, and hypothalamus (identified via meta-analysis of sweet taste processing), as well as the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and amygdala due to their roles in reward and aversion.

Stevia combined with the modifier evoked super-additive responses in the postcentral gyrus, parietal cortex, and occipital gyrus (p < 0.05, FWE-corrected). Compared to stevia alone, the stevia-modifier combination elicited reduced hypothalamic activity (p = 0.008) and the hypothalamus tracked pleasantness and mouth fullness only in this condition. The NAcc tracked mouth fullness more for the modified stevia than for stevia alone, and the amygdala tracked bitterness only in the plain stevia condition. Sucrose elicited higher postcentral gyrus activation than stevia (p = 0.01).

We provide first evidence that combining stevia with a flavour modifier reveals synergistic neural activity associated with taste sensation, intensity and multisensory integration. Adding a modifier to stevia could increase unconscious desirability for stevia by masking its bitterness and increasing its mouth fullness."
"Prolonged sensory imbalance, induced by directing attention to one visual field, can paradoxically enhance performance in the opposite, non-attended visual field. This effect is likely driven by the brains homeostatic mechanisms that regulate excitation and inhibition between hemispheres in homotopic attention processing regions. Here, we employed transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) to modulate cortical excitability and probe its role in interhemispheric dynamics controlling visual attention. Specifically, we used a procedure called attentional isolation, where neurotypical participants covertly focused their visual attention in one hemifield (the attended visual field) for 30 minutes. Performance changes in both the unattended (opposite) visual field and the attended visual field were measured following this manipulation. We applied transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) over the right or left frontoparietal cortex to modulate the excitability of one hemisphere relative to the other during attention isolation, probing the neural mechanisms underlying the observed contralateral performance shift. Our results showed improved performance in the previously unattended visual field following the attentional isolation period after sham stimulation. However, tRNS revealed a functional dissociation between the hemispheres: right hemisphere active stimulation abolished the performance improvement, while left hemisphere stimulation preserved it. These findings suggest distinct roles for the left and right hemispheres in modulating paradoxical visual performance shifts and may inform the development of novel neurorehabilitation strategies for clinical populations."
"The increasing scale and complexity of neuroimaging datasets aggregated from multiple study sites present substantial analytic challenges, as existing statistical analysis tools struggle to handle missing voxel-data, suffer from limited computational speed and inefficient memory allocation, and are restricted in the types of statistical designs they are able to model. We introduce Image-Based Meta- & Mega-Analysis (IBMMA), a novel software package implemented in R and Python that provides a unified framework for analyzing diverse neuroimaging features, efficiently handles large-scale datasets through parallel processing, offers flexible statistical modeling options, and properly manages missing voxel-data commonly encountered in multi-site studies. IBMMA produced stronger effect sizes and revealed findings in brain regions that traditional software overlooked due to missing voxel-data resulting in gaps in brain coverage. IBMMA has the potential to accelerate discoveries in neuroscience and enhance the clinical utility of neuroimaging findings."
"Neuropathic pain, a persistent condition arising from injury to the nervous system, involves complex interactions between neurons and non-neuronal cells, including satellite glial cells (SGCs) in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG). In this study, we examined the glial-targeting effects of meteorin, a neurotrophic protein with gliogenic properties, using mouse models of neuropathic and inflammatory pain. Systemic meteorin administration reversed mechanical hypersensitivity across diverse neuropathic and inflammatory pain models, with therapeutic effects persisting beyond the treatment period. We identified SGCs as the principal site of meteorin expression and action in the DRG, where it selectively activated SGCs and altered their functional state. Proteomic profiling revealed meteorin-mediated downregulation of gap junction proteins in SGCs, particularly connexin 43, which was corroborated by immunohistochemical analyses. Functional assessments demonstrated that meteorin treatment normalized injury-induced increases in intercellular coupling between SGCs, establishing a mechanistic link between glial network modulation and pain resolution. These findings identify meteorin as a regulator of SGC communication through connexin-dependent mechanisms. The sustained therapeutic effects and multi-model efficacy highlight meteorin as a potential intervention for neuropathic pain while advancing our understanding of SGC plasticity in sensory processing."
"IntroductionSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disorder characterized by aberrant inflammation, type I IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression, and autoantibody production. Glucocorticoids (GCs) like dexamethasone (DEX) are standard long-term SLE treatments but cause significant side effects, highlighting the need for safer steroid-sparing options. Preclinical and clinical studies suggest that dietary supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids (O3FAs), particularly docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), suppress inflammation and autoimmunity associated with SLE disease progression. We explored the steroid-sparing potential of DHA to influence suppressive effects of DEX on pathogenic gene expression.

MethodsMacrophages from SLE-prone NZBWF1 mice were first subjected to DHA (5, 10, or 25 {micro}M), DEX (1, 10, 100, or 1000 nM), or DHA+DEX cotreatment. Following pretreatment, cells were exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 20 ng/mL) to model SLE hyperinflammation. Effects on gene expression were analyzed by qRT-PCR and RNA-seq.

ResultsqRT-PCR indicated that subinhibitory concentrations of DHA (5-10 {micro}M) potentiated the efficacy of low-dose DEX (1-100 nM) in suppressing LPS-induced ISG expression (e.g., Irf7, Oasl1, Rsad2), amplifying the effects of DEX monotherapy by 10- to 100-fold. SynergyFinder analysis confirmed that DHA and DEX interacted synergistically in suppressing ISG expression, with significant inhibition observed at concentrations as low as 1 nM DEX and 5 {micro}M DHA. RNA-seq revealed that combining suboptimal DHA (10 M) and DEX (100 nM) induced 247 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at 4 hr and 347 DEGs at 8 hr post-LPS, dramatically surpassing the effects of each treatment alone. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that DHA+DEX cotreatment robustly suppressed immune and inflammatory pathways while promoting proliferative and metabolic processes, reflecting a shift from inflammatory (M1) to pro-resolving (M2) macrophage phenotypes. DHA and DEX countered LPS effects by i) downregulating common transcription factors (TFs) canonically associated with inflammation (e.g., NF-{kappa}B, AP-1, STATs, and IRF1), ii) upregulating shared regulatory factors involved in inflammation resolution (e.g., YBX1, EGR1, and BCL6), and iii) selectively influencing other regulatory factors.

DiscussionAltogether, DHA and DEX synergistically suppress inflammation by targeting common and unique molecular pathways in SLE macrophages, favoring the pro-resolving M2 phenotype. O3FA-GC cotreatment might facilitate reducing requisite steroid dosages for SLE management."
"Toxoplasma gondii is a globally prevalent intracellular parasite that infects [~]40 million Americans. The murine immune response to Toxoplasma relies on both toll-like receptor (TLR) 11/12 and immunity related GTPase-mediated (IRGs) responses, which humans lack, making it unclear how the human immune response detects and responds to the parasite. We investigated whether human V{gamma}9V{delta}2 T cells, which detect phosphoantigens through the BTN3A1 receptor, shape the early immune response to the parasite. Using primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), we show that V{gamma}9V{delta}2 T cells are activated by Toxoplasma-infected cells in a BTN3A1- dependent manner leading to secretion of interferon gamma (IFN{gamma}) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF). Additionally, these T cells potentiate IFN{gamma} production by natural killer (NK) cells, likely via TNF and interleukin (IL)-12 produced during infection. Active parasite invasion is required to stimulate the IFN{gamma} response, and inhibition of the host mevalonate pathway, which limits the synthesis of the phosphoantigen isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP), attenuates the cytokine response, indicating Toxoplasma infection increases host phosphoantigens leading to V{gamma}9V{delta}2 T cell activation. Our findings identify V{gamma}9V{delta}2 T cells as key effectors that potentiate NK cells in the early human immune response to Toxoplasma, bridging innate and adaptive immunity in the absence of TLR11/12 signaling."
"Airspace macrophages (AM) are crucial to host defence and to maintenance of lung homeostasis, with smoking drastically compromising these functions. Airspace monocytes, precursors of the differentiated AM, are found in increased numbers in the lungs of smokers yet little is known about their metabolic regulation and function. Here, we develop a click chemistry-based single cell analysis platform to characterise human airspace monocytes and AM ex vivo, identifying distinct metabolic profiles and a key role for oxidative phosphorylation in supporting phagocytic function. While blood and newly recruited CD93+ airspace monocytes show low mitochondrial dependency, AM rely heavily on oxidative phosphorylation. Acute succinate supplementation enhanced mitochondrial metabolism and phagocytosis in monocytes and promoted their differentiation into highly oxidative macrophages with enhanced function. Succinate emerges as a promising candidate to restore lung immune function, particularly in the smokers lung where airspace monocytes are enriched. Overall, we identify mitochondrial metabolism as a key modulator of lung immune function and a target for therapeutic intervention, with potential applications in systemic monocyte-targeted therapies and metabolic preconditioning for adoptive cell therapies.

One Sentence Summary: Mitochondrial metabolism regulates phagocytic function in human lung monocytes and macrophages and can be targeted using succinate.

"Acute and chronic antibody mediated rejection (ABMR) continues to decrease clinical kidney graft function and survival. Dysregulated donor-specific antibody (DSA) responses are induced in B6.CCR5-/- recipients of complete MHC-mismatched A/J kidney allografts with NK cells playing a critical role in the acute ABMR. We tested the role of neutrophils in ABMR by transplanting A/J kidneys to CCR5-/- mice with a deletion in the neutrophil serine protease cathepsin G. Whereas B6.CCR5-/- recipients rejected all kidney allografts between days 18-25, 70% of allografts survived beyond day 60 in B6.CCR5-/-cG-/- recipients. At days 15-17 post-transplant DSA titers in B6.CCR5-/-cG-/- recipients were 24.3-fold higher than those in wild-type C57BL/6 allograft recipients. Allografts from B6.CCR5-/-cG-/- recipients on days 45 and 60 had typical characteristics of chronic graft injury including interstitial collagen deposition and peri-glomerular fibrosis that was accompanied by a fibrogenic transcript signature and late post-transplant production of autoantibodies to many targets, including structural proteins including collagen IV and fibronectin. Depletion of B cells at the time DSA peak titers were achieved on day 14 post-transplant decreased serum autoantibodies levels, the kidney allograft fibrogenic transcript signature, and the chronic kidney allograft injury, despite maintenance of the high DSA titers. These results indicate a critical role for neutrophil cathepsin G during acute ABMR of kidney allografts and in its absence, DSA induced late appearance of autoantibodies mediating development of chronic kidney allograft injury."
"Salinity--an essential factor shaping marine species distributions--is rapidly shifting due to global change, yet the mechanisms of salinity tolerance and adaptation remain poorly understood. We investigated local adaptation in the calanoid copepod Acartia tonsa, a broadly distributed marine species that thrives in the brackish Baltic Sea. Using a common-garden design, we compared physiological and transcriptomic responses to low salinity between populations from the North Sea (>25 PSU) and the Baltic Sea (<15 PSU). Baltic copepods exhibited significantly higher survival under low salinity, indicating local adaptation. While both populations shared a core osmoregulatory strategy involving active ion transport and regulation of amino acids, transcriptomic profiles revealed population-specific differences. Baltic individuals showed a reduced overall gene expression response, yet maintained higher relative expression of osmoregulatory genes--suggesting higher plasticity and a primed response. In contrast, North Sea copepods exhibited broader transcriptional shifts, including downregulation of metabolic and developmental pathways after prolonged stress exposure, possibly reflecting energy conservation mechanisms. These findings reveal that A. tonsa possesses both a plastic osmoregulatory strategy and population-level adaptation that enable survival in extreme salinity conditions. While both populations tolerate short-term exposure to low salinity, local adaptation has enhanced the Baltic populations resilience. This suggests that A. tonsa is broadly tolerant of moderate climate-driven salinity declines across most of its distribution. However, our data also indicate potential range contractions in the lowest salinity zones of the Baltic Sea, underscoring the importance of identifying physiological and genetic thresholds in climate resilience studies."
"Heavy metals are a widespread environmental contaminant, and even low levels of some metals can disrupt cellular processes and result in DNA damage. However, the consequences of metal exposure are variable among individuals, with susceptibility to metal toxicity representing a complex trait influenced by genetic and non-genetic factors. To uncover toxicity response genes, and better understand responses to metal toxicity, we sought to dissect resistance to zinc, a metal required for normal cellular function, which can be toxic at high doses. To facilitate efficient, powerful discovery of Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) we employed extreme, or X-QTL mapping, leveraging a multiparental, recombinant Drosophila melanogaster population. Our approach involved bulk selection of zinc-resistant individuals, sequencing several replicate pools of selected and control animals, and identified QTL as genomic positions showing consistent allele frequency shifts between treatments. We successfully identified seven regions segregating for resistance/susceptibility alleles, and implicated several strong candidate genes. Phenotypic characterization of populations derived from selected or control animals revealed that our selection procedure resulted in greater egg-to-adult emergence, and a reduced developmental delay on zinc media. We subsequently measured emergence and development time for a series of midgut-specific RNAi gene knockdowns and matched genetic controls raised in both zinc-supplemented and normal media. This identified ten genes with significant genotype-by-treatment effects, including pHCl-2, which encodes a zinc sensor protein. Our work highlights recognized and novel contributors to zinc toxicity resistance in flies, and provides a pathway to a broader understanding of the biological impact of metal toxicity.

ARTICLE SUMMARYStarting with an outbred Drosophila melanogaster population we repeatedly selected for groups of individuals showing high resistance to toxic levels of zinc during development. Pooled sequencing of these groups, along with matched groups of control individuals, enabled the identification of seven genomic regions - or QTL - contributing to zinc toxicity resistance. Midgut-specific RNAi of genes implicated by these QTL yielded ten genes impacting developmental traits in zinc-supplemented media, including MTF-1 (a metal response transcription factor) and pHCl-2 (a zinc sensor protein)."

"BAF (SWI/SNF) chromatin remodeling complexes belong to three subfamilies, cBAF, PBAF, and ncBAF, that regulate the nucleosomal organization and accessibility of transcription factors (TFs) DNA binding sites at cis-regulatory elements (CREs). However, the functional specificities of these complexes at promoters, enhancers, and other categories of CREs are poorly understood. Here, we examined how the BAF complexes regulate the nucleosomal and subnucleosomal landscape in which transcription initiation occurs in vivo. We first described how these complexes regulate the earliest step of transcription preinitiation complex (PIC) assembly, which is defined by the binding of the general transcription factors TBP and TFIIA. We show that in the presence of a TATA box, PIC formation occurs onto a core promoter or enhancer region still wrapped into a fragile nucleosome or a subnucleosomal particle. Conversely, without a TATA box, PIC assembles onto genomic templates mostly stripped of histones. We establish that cBAF, but not PBAF or ncBAF, regulates this chromatin organization and the first step of PIC formation at promoters and enhancers. We observed that individual subunits of cBAF have specific functions at promoters: the BRG1 ATPase and SMARCB1 regulate the production of fragile nucleosomes and subnucleosomal particles, while ARID1A stimulates the binding of TBP/TFIIA independently of the ATPase subunit. In contrast, all three subunits are systematically required for both chromatin organization and TBP/TFIIA binding at enhancers. Finally, we revealed that a subset of PBAF subunits controls the nucleosomal and subnucleosomal landscape at REST repressor binding sites. Our integrative study identified specific functions of cBAF and PBAF subunits in controlling the binding of TFs and the nucleosomal and subnucleosomal organization of CREs."
"Echolocating bats must continuously adapt their sonar output to meet the increasing demands of prey pursuit. While call rate and duration modulations have been extensively described, the underlying control thresholds governing these transitions remain poorly understood. Here, we present a predictive framework based on a novel metric responsivity, defined as the inverse change in interpulse interval (IPI), to quantify moment-to-moment temporal precision in sonar control. This metric reveals a critical transition point--buzz readiness-- where fine-scale IPI adjustments peak prior to the onset of the terminal buzz. By integrating biologically plausible reaction time constraints with echo-acoustic feedback loops, our model predicts how increasing relative velocity compresses the time available for sonar adaptation. Simulations incorporating prey motion and bat flight kinematics reproduce a consistent sublinear tradeooff between call rate and relative velocity. High-resolution field recordings from a portable, custom-built microphone array validate the model predictions, demonstrating that buzz readiness thresholds reliably align with behavioural transitions in natural prey interception. The framework further explains why shortened or absent buzzes occur at high velocities, when reaction constraints prevent full transition into the buzz phase. This work introduces a generalised, predictive model linking sensory-motor control, kinematics, and temporal adaptation in bat biosonar. The responsivity approach offers new tools to quantify control dynamics in natural behaviour and provides a foundation for biologically inspired sensing systems operating under real-time constraints."
"Plasmid DNA purification remains a fundamental yet resource-intensive step in molecular biology and biotechnology. Conventional protocols often yield plasmids with suboptimal purity, while commercial kits, though efficient, are costly and use proprietary formulations that limit transparency and customization. Here, we present Filterprep, a hybrid method combining classical ethanol precipitation with a single spin-column cleanup step, enabling rapid recovery of high-purity plasmid DNA with yields notably higher than those obtained using commercial kits, in approximately 40 minutes. Filterprep offers a transparent, cost-effective, and scalable alternative, simplifying workflows and reducing hands-on time without compromising DNA quality. The purified plasmids are compatible with a variety of downstream applications, including mammalian cell transfection, protein expression, and reporter assays. With its balance of efficiency and practicality, Filterprep is well suited for high-throughput laboratories and resource-limited settings."
"The extracellular matrix changes dramatically during the progression of diseases like cancer. These complex, tissue-specific changes are not adequately replicated by most current biomaterial disease models. Here we demonstrate, for the first time, a biomaterial system allowing combined, independent control over stiffness, composition and 3D collagen architecture. We demonstrate successful perfusion of defined hydrogel formulations into ice-templated collagen scaffolds, controlling the composition of these hybrid scaffolds at constant stiffness. The Youngs moduli of these hybrid scaffolds can also be tuned independently of composition via chemical crosslinking. Encapsulation of human dermal fibroblasts reveals that fibroblast morphology depends on hybrid scaffold composition and on viscoelasticity, highlighting the importance of a system that decouples biophysical from biochemical properties. Finally, we demonstrate application of this system to exert combined control over biochemical and biophysical drivers of cell growth and invasion, focussing on breast cancer as proof-of-concept. We show that collagen fibre patterning enhances breast cancer cell proliferation, also directing the invasion of patient-derived breast cancer cells. These hybrid scaffolds are therefore promising new tools for dissecting the diverse but complementary roles played by the extracellular matrix in regulating cell phenotype, in a range of healthcare applications."
"Numerical simulations and clinical measurements of nasal resistance are in quantitative disagreement. Bias introduced by the design of medical devices has not been considered until now as a possible explanation. The aim of present paper is to study the effect of the location of the probe on the rhinomanometer that is meant to measure the ambient pressure. Rhinomanometry is carried out on a 3D silicone model of a patient-specific anatomy; a clinical device and dedicated sensors are employed side-by-side for mutual validation. The same anatomy is also employed for numerical simulations, with approaches spanning a wide range of fidelity levels. We find that the intrinsic uncertainty of the numerical simulations is of minor importance. To the contrary, the position of the pressure tap intended to acquire the external pressure in the clinical device is crucial, and can cause a mismatch comparable to that generally observed between in-silico and in-vivo rhinomanometry data. A source of systematic bias may therefore exist in rhinomanometers, designed under the assumption that measurements of the nasal resistance are unaffected by the flow development within the instruments."
"The nanoscale spatial arrangement of T cell receptors (TCRs) ligands critically influences their activation potential in CD8+ T cells, yet a comprehensive understanding of the molecular landscape induced by engagement with native peptide-MHC class I (pMHC-I) remains incomplete. Using DNA origami as platform for multivalent engineering, we precisely organize pMHC-I molecules into defined spatial configurations to systematically investigate the roles of valency, inter-ligand spacing, geometric pattern, and molecular flexibility in regulating T cell function. We find that reducing inter-ligand spacing to [~]7.5 nm enhances T cell activation by up to eightfold compared to wider spacing ([~]22.5 nm), and that as few as six pMHC-I molecules are sufficient to elicit a robust response. Notably, the geometry of pMHC-I presentation emerges as a key determinant of signaling strength, with hexagonal arrangements proving most effective. In contrast, the introduction of flexible linkers into pMHC-I impairs TCR triggering. Together, these findings define spatial parameters that govern pMHC-I-TCR interactions at the T cell interface and provide design principles for engineering next-generation T cell-based immunotherapies."
"Complex in vitro models (CIVMs), including organoids, spheroids, and bioprinted constructs, have emerged as powerful platforms for recapitulating human tissue architecture and function. However, their inherent heterogeneity and dynamic nature pose significant challenges for standardization, reproducibility, and real-time manipulation. Here, we present VISIBLE (Versatile Imaging-Based Interactive Sampling and Bioprinting System), a modular, imaging-guided platform that integrates real-time monitoring with automated manipulation and 3D bioprinting that addresses these challenges. VISIBLE employs a dual-axis system comprising independently controlled tool-heads and microscope stages, enabling precise spatiotemporal interventions within live cultures. We demonstrate the system capabilities across a range of applications, including morphology- and function-based sampling of organoids and neurospheres, interactive 3D bioprinting, serial scratch assays, and real-time cell-cell interaction studies. Furthermore, we illustrate the system utility in translational contexts through the selective sampling and implantation of patient-derived xenograft organoids. VISIBLE supports long-term culture within an integrated incubation environment and accommodates interchangeable tool-heads for scalable, high-throughput workflows. By enabling closed-loop, feedback-controlled experimentation, VISIBLE addresses some of the critical limitations in existing complex in vitro model platforms and offers a new versatile solution for a wide range of biomedical research applications. This work represents a significant step toward the development of autonomous experimental systems for complex tissue modelling and preclinical investigation."
"The design of high-performance microbial cell factories is essential for advancing sustainable biomanufacturing. However, the intricate nature of metabolic networks complicates the prediction of genetic interventions, making strain optimization a challenging combinatorial problem. Here we present a novel computational strain design algorithm-MetaStrain that integrates enzyme-constrained models (ecModels) with efficient meta-heuristic algorithms to identify non-intuitive combinatorial gene targets for improving product yields. Our algorithm employs a modified enforced objective flux scanning algorithm to reduce the dimensionality of gene candidates and annotate editing strategies. Subsequently, binary and symbolic genetic algorithms and the adaptive differential evolution algorithm with external archives (JADE) are employed for gene target selection, with product yield as the fitness function. We adapted minimization of metabolic adjustment strategy for ecModels to evaluate the productive phenotypes of mutant strains. Computational validation using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a host demonstrates significant enhancements in 2-phenylethanol production. Further generalization to spermidine biosynthesis confirms the frameworks robustness. The proposed algorithm achieves high computational efficiency, stable convergence, and strong adaptability across diverse metabolic targets. This study provides a powerful computational tool for metabolic engineering, addressing the complexity of strain design and highlighting the potential of meta-heuristic optimization in synthetic biology."
"Genomic signatures are taxon-specific patterns in nucleotide sequence composition observed across different regions of a genome, used in the taxonomic classification of organisms and in inferring their evolutionary relationships. However, the nature and extent of the pervasiveness of a genomic signature across the expanse of a Telomere-to-Telomere (T2T) assembly, especially across the functionally diverse sequence elements and highly repetitive regions, remain counterintuitive and underexplored. This study aims to bridge this knowledge gap by systematically investigating the pervasiveness and variation of the genomic signature across the human genome and the genome of each of three other eukaryotic species from different kingdoms. Using the alignment-free k-mer-based Frequency Chaos Game Representation (FCGR) of DNA sequences, this study qualitatively and quantitatively analyzes the variations of the genomic signature along an entire genome. Qualitative analysis is first performed through visual inspection of FCGR patterns across different chromosomes of a species. In parallel, a quantitative analysis evaluates the variation of the genomic signature within a genome by comparing eight distance measures to identify the optimal one for the datasets in this study. By taking an intragenomic perspective with detailed analysis of chromosome landscapes these analyses reveal that, while the genomic signature is preserved in most genomic regions, exceptions exist in localized regions, such as tandem repetitions of short and long repeat units. Upon determining this pervasiveness, we assemble novel pipelines aimed at selecting a short contiguous representative genomic segment that encapsulates the sequence composition patterns characteristic of the entire genome. These representative segments are then used to assess intragenomic variation of the genomic signature, demonstrating that only a small proportion of segments (namely those characterized by regional density of short and long tandem repeats) show high distance values from the representative. No-tably, in the human genome, 80% of the segments have a distance of less than 0.24 (on a [0,1] DSSIM scale) from the representative. Moreover, we demonstrate that using these representative segments improves down-stream tasks, e.g., increasing one-nearest-neighbor (1-NN) taxonomic classification accuracy by 7% compared to selecting a random genomic segment to serve as a proxy of the genome. Lastly, this study presents a special-purpose graphical user interface (GUI) software tool, CGR-Diff, designed to provide both visual and quantitative comparisons of FCGRs of sample or user-provided DNA sequences, thereby facilitating intragenomic variation analysis of genomic signature within and across species."
"A major challenge in mass-spectrometry-based metaproteomics is accurately identifying and quantifying biological functions across the full taxonomic lineage of microorganisms. This issue stems from what we refer to as the ""shared confidently identified peptide problem"". To address this issue, most metaproteomics tools rely on the lowest common ancestor (LCA) algorithm to assign biological functions, which often leads to incomplete biological function assignments across the full taxonomic lineage of identified microorganisms. To overcome this limitation, we implemented an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, along with a biological function database, within MiCId workflow. Using synthetic datasets, our study demonstrates that the enhanced MiCId workflow achieves better control over false discoveries and improved accuracy in microorganism identification and biomass estimation compared to Unipept and MetaGOmics. Additionally, the updated MiCId offers improved accuracy and better control of false discoveries in biological function identification compared to Unipept, along with reliable computation of function abundances across the full taxonomic lineage of identified microorganisms. Reanalyzing human oral and gut microbiome datasets using the enhanced MiCId workflow, we show that the results are consistent with those reported in the original publications, which were analyzed using the Galaxy-P platform with MEGAN5 and the MetaPro-IQ approach with Unipept, respectively."
"The HIV-1-encoded membrane protein Vpu plays key roles in virus lifecycle. Our lab recently revealed a soluble form of Vpu, and we strived to determine its possible physiological function. Here, we provide solid experimental proof that soluble Vpu interacts with Ca2+-bound calmodulin (Ca2+-CaM). A putative CaM-binding motif in Vpu was predicted, but there was no experimental evidence of the Vpu-CaM association. We applied double electron electron-resonance (DEER) and protein spin labeling to detect the soluble Vpu-CaM complex. We found that soluble full-length and truncated C-terminal region of Vpu directly interact with Ca2+-CaM. DEER results from the spin-labeled double cysteine mutant S39C/A103C of CaM showed that upon association with Vpu Ca2+-CaM adopts a more closed conformation compared to those in the absence of Vpu. This restructuring is in agreement with previously observed Ca2+-CaM association with cellular and other HIV-1 proteins. Our results indicate that soluble Vpu and CaM form an equimolar complex. DEER results from doubly spin-labeled at residues Q36C/I61C in Vpu C-terminal region suggest that Vpus helices 2 and 3 move away from each other to facilitated CaM binding. These observations tell that under physiological conditions the soluble Vpu-CaM complex may provide Vpu with a trafficking pathway to membrane destination."
"The bendability of biopolymers, including DNA, actin filaments, and microtubules, is crucial to diverse biological processes, such as cell motility and cytoskeletal organization. While conventional polymer models like the worm-like chain model assume uniform bending stiffness along the contour, biopolymers in reality often attain spatially varying bending stiffness as a result of complex cellular interactions. For instance, the bending stiffness of actin filaments and microtubules varies in response to associated binding proteins or chemical modifications. Despite its biological implications, measuring the position-dependent persistence length along polymer contours remains challenging. Here, we present a deep-learning-based method that quantitatively predicts spatially varying bending stiffness of biopolymers. Our framework segments a polymer chain into short over-lapping fragments, predicts local persistence lengths using a deep-learning model, and reconstructs full profiles. Using simulated data, we demonstrate that our approach achieves high accuracy and robustness even under data-scarce conditions. Applied to various biological systems, our method reveals a spatially varying stiffness from tip to base in filopodia as well as spatially heterogeneous stiffness in microtubules. Additionally, we investigate the internal mechanism of our deep-learning model and show that the model utilizes multiple physics-related features for persistence length estimation while adaptively adjusting its attention based on polymer stiffness."
"Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is a widely used tool to probe nanometer scale dynamics, projecting rich 3D biomolecular motion onto noisy 1D traces. However, interpretation of FRET traces remains challenging due to degeneracy--distinct structural states map to similar FRET efficiencies-- and often suffers from under- and/or over-fitting due to the need to predefine the number of FRET states and noise characteristics. Here we provide a new software, Bayesian nonparametric FRET (BNP-FRET) for binned data obtained from integrative detectors, that eliminates user-dependent parameters and accurately incorporates all known noise sources, enabling the identification of distinct configurations from 1D traces in a plug-n-play manner. Using simulated and experimental data, we demonstrate that BNP-FRET eliminates logistical barrier of predetermining states for each FRET trace and permits high-throughput, simultaneous analysis of a large number of kinetically heterogeneous traces. Furthermore, working in the Bayesian paradigm, BNP-FRET naturally provides uncertainty estimates for all model parameters including the number of states, kinetic rates, and FRET efficiencies."
"The SPFH (Stomatin, Prohibitin, Flotillin, and HflK/C) family of proteins are key scaffolding components involved in the organization of functional membrane microdomains (FMMs) across various subcellular membranes, including those of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria, which are characterized by extremely low saturated lipid content. Among this protein family, the erlin1/2 complex is specifically located on the ER membrane. Previous studies have shown that the erlin1/2 complex plays essential roles in the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, mediating the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of various proteins such as inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs), important calcium ion transporters on the ER membrane.

In this study, we determined the single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the erlin1/2 complex under different detergent conditions. Our findings reveal that the erlin1/2 complex forms a 26-mer cage-like structure, composed of alternating erlin1 and erlin2 subunits. The erlin1/2 complex could recruit various types of proteins on both the interior and exterior surfaces of the cage. By caging cargo proteins, the erlin1/2 complex physically seclude them from their binding partners, leading to a potential halt of their function. Moreover, individual cages can further interact with one another, facilitating the organization of FMMs of different sizes on the ER membrane. These dynamic properties may play a general and critical role in various processes occurring on the ER, including viral replication, positioning the erlin1/2 complex as a promising new target for antiviral drug development."
"Intra-tumoral heterogeneity (ITH) is fueling tumor progression in breast cancer, as specific clones present within a tumor may have a selective advantage to colonize distant organs and escape therapy. Accurate sampling of ITH is therefore a pressing challenge in clinical oncology, to adequately predict recurrence and inform rational and personalized therapies. Here we used cellular barcoding to track the spatio-temporal composition of human breast cancer clones in six preclinical models - across two cell lines and four patient derived xenografts (PDXs). This allowed direct side-by-side quantitative comparison not only of intra-tumor clonal composition, but also of how that composition was reflected in needle biopsies and cell-free DNA (cfDNA). These analyses highlighted several clinically relevant findings. First, the use of orthogonal genetic and optical barcoding revealed that clonal diversity in the center of non-necrotic primary tumors was significantly higher compared to their periphery. Second, cfDNA barcode analysis suggested that DNA  shedding in the vasculature varied largely, not only depending on necrosis and tumor burden, but also between models. Third, combining information captured in both solid and liquid biopsies can provide a more robust assessment of tumor clonal composition. Taken together, these results showcases the utility of these barcoded models to optimize the use of solid and liquid biopsies as surrogate markers of ITH."
"B cell malignancies, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), rely on dysregulated B cell receptor (BCR) signaling for survival and proliferation. Prohibitin 1 and 2 (PHB1, PHB2) are multifunctional proteins involved in mitochondrial function, IgM-type BCR signaling and other key oncogenic pathways, making them potential therapeutic targets in lymphomas. Here, we assessed the effects of five PHB-targeting small molecules - FL3, Mel6, Mel56, IN44, and Fluorizoline - on lymphoma cell lines as proof-of-concept study. PHB transcript and protein quantities were differentially affected and distinct patterns of antiproliferative effects and viability were observed. Across cell models, FL3, Mel56, and Mel6 displayed strongest effects. FL3 and Mel56 exerted strong cytotoxic effects, while Mel6 primarily slowed proliferation. IN44 showed modest but selective cytotoxic effects in an ABC-DLBCL model, while Fluorizoline selectively stopped proliferation of a Burkitt lymphoma model. Non-malignant stromal cells remained largely unaffected by Mel56, highlighting a potential therapeutic window of this inhibitor. Replacing the native IgM constant region by IgG in the MEC-1 CLL line using CRISPR-Cas9 resulted in a somewhat reduced, but not abrogated effect of Mel56 suggesting effects on additional pathways beyond the BCR. Together these data provide proof-of-concept evidence for PHB inhibition as a potential strategy to target B cell lymphomas."
"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly lethal cancer, with liver metastases significantly worsening outcomes. However, distinct features of the tumor microenvironment (TME) between primary and metastatic sites remain poorly defined. Cellular neighborhoods within the TME are recognized as functional units that influence tumor behavior. Conventional spatial methods, which assign equal weights to all cells in a region, fail to capture the nuances of cellular interactions. To address this, we developed Functional Cellular Neighborhood (FunCN) quantification, which integrates both the proportion and proximity of surrounding cells. Applying FunCN to PDAC imaging mass cytometry data, we identified neutrophil-enriched interactions in liver metastases compared to primary tumors, correlating with elevated VISTA expression by tumor cells. Additionally, FunCN clusters around CD8+ T cells in pancreas and liver were associated with higher TIGIT and LAG3, respectively. These findings demonstrate the importance of spatial immune landscapes in PDAC and identify potential therapeutic opportunities."
"Male narwhals are unique in having one long, spiralled tusk, while females of the species do not have a tusk. However, a small number of individuals develop tusk anomalies, including two-tusked males or females with a tusk. In this study, we combine genetic sexing and bone collagen stable isotope ({delta}13C and {delta}15N) analysis to evaluate whether these tooth anomalies impact foraging ecology. Our analysis of individuals collected in the waters around Greenland showed no systematic impacts; nine of ten two-tusked male narwhals, and all three one-tusked female narwhals were within the normal range of known isotopic diversity from the sampled geographic regions. Two specimens with other forms of unusual dentition both showed stable isotope values outside the range of narwhals, suggesting their diet was different. Our findings underscore how DNA data retrieved from museum specimens can elucidate biological questions of interest, such as the sex of anomalous individuals. They also show how stable isotope analysis can be used to assign individuals with unknown provenance to their geographic region of origin."
"Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri, is a major global pest because it is the primary vector of Candidatus Liberibacter spp., the causal agents of huanglongbing (HLB), a lethal citrus disease. Following the detection of D. citri in Cyprus in 2023, the first record of this pest in the European Union, a classical biological control program targeting this pest was initiated in spring 2024 using the parasitoid Tamarixia radiata imported from California, USA. During field surveys in summer 2024, parasitized D. citri nymphs were found in orchards where no T. radiata releases had been made. These findings suggested the possible presence of native or unintentionally introduced parasitoids, or a rapid spread of T. radiata into new areas. To determine the identity of parasitoids associated with D. citri in Cyprus, an integrative approach was adopted combining field observations, molecular analyses of the COI gene, and morphological analyses. Tamarixia radiata recovered from Cyprus field sites matched reference sequences of parasitoids from California. However, other specimens were genetically and morphologically distinct and represented a new species. The new species is described here as Tamarixia citricola Hansson & Guerrieri sp. nov. Taxonomic diagnoses and characters for separating both Tamarixia species associated with D. citri are provided. Results presented here indicate the coexistence of both T. radiata (introduced) and T. citricola (likely autochthonous) in Cyprus citrus orchards. This finding has important implications for future biological control strategies and quarantine measures for D. citri in the Mediterranean basin."
"Alpha-synuclein (SNCA) overexpression is implicated in Parkinsons disease (PD) pathogenesis, making SNCA downregulation a promising therapeutic strategy. We developed a SNCA-targeted epigenome therapy using an all-in-one lentiviral vector (LV) carrying deactivated CRISPR/(d)Cas9, gRNA targeted at SNCA-intron1, and either the catalytic domain of DNA-methyltransferase3A (DNMT3A), or a synthetic repressor molecule of Kruppel-associated box (KRAB)/ methyl CpG binding protein 2 transcription repression domain (MeCp2-TRD). Therapeutic efficacy was evaluated in a new PD mouse model, generated with an adeno-associated viral vector carrying an engineered minigene comprised of the human (h)A53T-SNCA expressed via the human native regulatory region. Both therapeutic vectors reduced expression of -synuclein in the substantia nigra (SN), with LV/dSaCas9-KRAB-MeCP2(TRD) demonstrating greater repression. LV/dSaCas9-KRAB-MeCP2(TRD) also significantly reduced pathological -synuclein aggregation and phosphorylation (Ser129), and preserved tyrosine hydroxylase expression in the SN and the striatum. Behavioral analysis following LV/dSaCas9-KRAB-MeCP2(TRD) injection, showed significant improvement in motor deficits characteristic of our PD-mouse model. Safety assessments found normal blood counts, serum chemistry, and weights. Collectively, we provide in vivo proof-of-concept for our SNCA-targeted epigenome therapy in a PD-mouse model. Our results support the systems therapeutic potential for PD and related synucleinopathies and establish the foundation for further preclinical studies toward investigational new drug enablement."
"Functional ultrasound imaging (fUSI) is a promising tool for studying brain activity in awake and behaving animals, offering insights into neural dynamics that are more naturalistic than those obtained under anesthesia. However, motion artifacts pose a significant challenge, introducing biases that can compromise the integrity of the data. This study provides a comprehensive evaluation and benchmarking of strategies for detecting and removing motion artifacts in transcranial fUSI acquisitions of awake mice. We evaluated 792 denoising strategies across four datasets, focusing on clutter filtering, scrubbing, frequency filtering, and confound regression methods. Our findings highlight the superior performance of adaptive clutter filtering and aCompCor confound regression in mitigating motion artifacts while preserving functional connectivity patterns. We also demonstrate that high-pass filtering is generally more effective than band-pass filtering in the presence of motion artifacts. Additionally, we show that with effective clutter filtering, scrubbing may become optional, which is particularly beneficial for experimental designs where motion correlates with conditions of interest. Based on these insights, we propose four optimized denoising paradigms tailored to different experimental constraints, providing practical recommendations for enhancing the reliability and reproducibility of fUSI data. Our findings challenge current practices in the field and have immediate practical implications for existing fUSI analysis workflows, paving the way for more sophisticated applications of fUSI in studying complex brain functions and dysfunctions in awake experimental paradigms."
"Natural sound textures, such as rain or crackling fire, are defined by time-averaged summary statistics that shape their perceptual identity. Variations in these statistics provide a controlled means to examine how the human brain processes complex auditory structure. In this study, we investigated how such statistics are represented along the ascending auditory pathway, within auditory cortex, and in high-level regions involved in natural pattern analysis. Using fMRI, we measured brain responses to synthetic sound textures in which higher-order statistical structure was systematically degraded while preserving the overall texture category. Participants listened to sounds with varying levels of naturalness, defined by their statistical fidelity to real-world textures, and performed a perceptual comparison task, judging whether two sequentially presented sounds matched in naturalness. We observed that increasing naturalness elicited stronger BOLD responses across bilateral auditory cortex for both reference and test sounds. Activity in medial temporal lobe regions, including the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus, was modulated by naturalness in a position-dependent manner. The entorhinal cortex activity was modulated only during the test sound, suggesting a role in perceptual-mnemonic comparison. The hippocampal connectivity with auditory cortex increased when reference textures were more degraded or less natural, indicating top-down inference under uncertainty. Together, these findings highlight the interplay between bottom-up encoding and memory-based mechanisms in supporting judgments of auditory realism based on summary statistics."
"Hippocampal theta (6-12 Hz) oscillations coordinate neural activity during spatial navigation and are strongly related to locomotion speed. However, recent research has yielded conflicting evidence on whether theta rhythms are primarily modulated by acceleration or instantaneous speed. Moreover, the role of movement transitions--at locomotion onset and offset--has often been overlooked, despite potentially involving distinct dynamics not explained by speed or acceleration alone. Previous studies have rarely controlled for locomotion timing and speed, limiting our ability to dissociate the contributions of speed, acceleration, and movement transitions. To address this, we used a computer-controlled treadmill to induce rat locomotion under three distinct conditions: (a) movement transitions, (b) steady running at constant speed, and (c) locomotion with continuous acceleration. This setup allowed precise spectral analysis of hippocampal theta oscillations across conditions. We found that treadmill-triggered movement transitions produced sustained increases in theta power and transient increases in theta frequency. Upon treadmill stop, theta power decreased slowly, whereas theta frequency dropped rapidly. Steady running elevated both theta power and frequency relative to rest. During constant-speed trials, both metrics increased with speed and remained stable over time. Notably, the acceleration rate itself had no effect on theta power or frequency. Instead, during accelerating trials, theta frequency increased progressively with instantaneous speed, underscoring speed as the primary modulator. In summary, our results show that movement transitions induce distinct, sustained changes in theta power and transient changes in theta frequency, while instantaneous speed--not acceleration--governs hippocampal theta frequency.

Significance statementThe precise contributions of movement transitions, speed, and acceleration to hippocampal theta oscillations remain unclear due to confounding factors in freely moving paradigms. To resolve this, we employed a computer-controlled treadmill to systematically isolate each locomotor variable under tightly controlled conditions. Our results demonstrate that movement transitions induce distinct changes in theta power and frequency, and that instantaneous speed--not acceleration--robustly modulates theta frequency across hippocampal subregions. These findings clarify an ongoing debate and refine our understanding of how specific locomotor dynamics shape hippocampal activity during navigation."
"Aberrant activation of the classical complement pathway in the brain is implicated in contributing to synapse loss and neurodegeneration in various neurodegenerative conditions. Given that C3aR is a druggable target in the complement pathway, we evaluated the potential of C3aR KO to rescue neurodegeneration in a tauopathy model and neuroinflammatory responses in an acute endotoxemia model. We found that C3aR KO did not rescue tau pathology, microglia activation markers, neurodegeneration, or behavioral abnormalities in tauopathy model mice. While we found that endotoxemia resulted in numerous transcriptional changes including distinct alterations in subpopulations of microglia, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, C3aR KO did not impact these alterations. Together, our results suggest that the beneficial effects of blocking the complement classical pathway in neurodegeneration models is likely independent of C3aR activation and raise questions about the rationale for therapeutically targeting C3aR for neurodegenerative disease."
"BackgroundChlordecone (CLD) is a persistent organochloride pesticide formerly used against banana weevil. It is detectable in blood samples from a large proportion of the population in the French Caribbean Islands. Several experimental studies have demonstrated acute neurotoxicity of CLD, but the effect of a subchronic exposure to CLD remains to be studied.

MethodsYoung adult male mice were injected intraperitoneally with 3 mg/kg CLD (n=34) or vehicle (n=22), twice a week, for eight weeks. Behavior, regional brain accumulation, and effects on the dopaminergic system were studied. In addition, functional ultrasound imaging (fUSi) was used to probe the visual, somatosensory and dopaminergic pathways.

ResultsCLD was detected in all brain regions (5-15 mg/kg) after two-month exposure, without any marked impact on behavior (anxiety, motor coordination, memory). The dopaminergic system was mostly unaffected, despite slight decreases in the number of TH-positive neurons and the expression of VMAT2, quantified in a subset of animals. fUSi highlighted a decreased response to the visual stimulation in CLD-exposed animals, in contrast to the sensorimotor response, which was found unaltered.

ConclusionThe two-month-long, systemic, exposure to an intermediate dose of CLD resulted in a mostly unaffected phenotype, with a normal behavior and a largely intact dopaminergic system. Interestingly, functional ultrasound imaging was able to detect an altered visual response, which has also been noted in Parkinsons disease. This study position functional ultrasound imaging as a promising technique to capture early signs of neurotoxicity, opening up opportunities for ""toxico-fUS"" in the field of neurotoxicology.

"Prolonged nervous system inflammation and glia activation are among hallmarks of Parkinsons disease. There are no therapies slowing pathology. Microglia and astrocytes are considered targets for disease modifying strategies. Nigrostriatal neurodegeneration causes locomotor dysfunction but at early stages can be compensated. Interaction between neurons, microglia and astrocytes could be essential for this functional adaptation and neuronal survival in long-term.

The aim was to check how microglia activation inhibition affects neuron and astrocyte cell death caused by selective toxins and how it affects locomotion and potential for spontaneous functional compensation of motor deficits at the early stages of Parkinsons disease.

In a rat model of fluorocitrate (FC)-induced astrocyte death and microglia activation combined with 6-OHDA selective dopaminergic system neurodegeneration we analyzed anti-inflammatory effect of minocycline on each of the cell type and on functional behavioral output.

In result, reduced microglia activation by minocycline probably prevented part of astrocytes from FC-induced cell death. Microglia inhibition caused non-dopaminergic neurodegeneration in a group treated by both neurotoxins but still enhanced compensatory potential to functionally improve walking deficits caused by dopaminergic lesion.

It seems that activation of microglia by dying astrocytes vs dying neurons induced varied mechanisms. Inhibition of strong microglia activation could be protective for astrocytes but microglia is also important for neuronal adaptation, therefore suppression of its activation perturbs structural rebuilding during progressive neurodegeneration affecting functional outcome.

Understanding the relationship between neuronal death, astrocyte loss of function and microglial response could help to identify new, non-neuronal pharmacological target for healing various neurodegenerative diseases.

"Those who study visual perception and visuo-spatial attention are increasingly paying interest to the ways in which these processes are influenced by the size of the pupil. However, this realm of research is complicated by the pupils notorious susceptibility to confounders and difficulties in disentangling cause and effect. Recent studies have sought a solution in the exploitation of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), which trigger pupil constrictions upon detecting blue light. Experiments typically present stimuli against blue versus red backgrounds of equal perceived luminance, to effectuate systematically smaller pupils in the former than in the latter condition. Here we provide a further validation of this method, by testing a scenario of potential concern. Via retino-hypothalamic pathways, ipRGC activation modulates alertness and arousal. Blue and red backgrounds may therefore differentially impact behavior in addition to the pupil, potentially confounding inferences about the pupils impact on cognition. This was investigated with an auditory task in which participants responded as quickly as possible to sequences of randomly timed beeps while looking at blue versus red displays. Each participant was tested with an easy and a difficult version of the auditory task. Results suggest that the ipRGC method is good to go: in the presence of effects of task difficulty on both pupil size and task performance, the display color exclusively influenced pupil size without affecting task performance."
"Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is defined by granulomas-- immune aggregates that either contain or support bacterial replication. Macrophages, fundamental components of these lesions, are crucial to TB pathogenesis, yet their phenotypic and functional diversity is incompletely understood. Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing and immunofluorescence to profile macrophages in lung tissue and granulomas from a nonhuman primate model of early TB. We identified distinct subsets, including embryonic-origin tissue-resident alveolar macrophages and monocyte-derived alveolar and interstitial macrophages, with distinct spatial localization in granulomas. Tissue-resident alveolar macrophages and a subset undergoing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition accounted for the highest frequency of Mtb-infected cells. Infected cells exhibited differential expression of immune- and migration-associated genes compared to uninfected counterparts, suggesting Mtb either induces or exploits these pathways as a survival strategy. These findings highlight macrophage heterogeneity as a major driver of differential susceptibility to Mtb and provide insights relevant to future immunomodulatory strategies."
"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a leading cause of cutaneous infections, underscoring the need for alternative therapeutic strategies. Catestatin, a neuroendocrine antimicrobial peptide produced by neurons and epithelial cells, has been implicated in skin defense against pathogens such as MRSA, though its mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that catestatin expression is upregulated in MRSA-infected skin wounds and that topical catestatin application significantly reduces MRSA burden in infected murine cutaneous wounds. This effect is dependent on the mast cell-specific G protein-coupled receptor Mrgprb2, the murine ortholog of human MRGPRX2. Notably, catestatin treatment leads to Mrgprb2-dependent suppression of inflammatory cytokine production and leukocyte infiltration, alongside upregulation of the antimicrobial peptide Defb14. In human mast cells, catestatin induces MRGPRX2-dependent degranulation, histamine release, prostaglandin D2 production, and cytokine expression. Pharmacological inhibition and western blot analysis reveal that catestatin activates multiple downstream G protein-dependent signaling pathways in an MRGPRX2-dependent manner. These findings demonstrate that catestatin promotes bacterial clearance by activating mast cells through Mrgprb2, thereby enhancing antimicrobial peptide production. Our study positions catestatin as a promising mast cell-targeting immunotherapeutic candidate for treating antibiotic-resistant skin infections."
"Current vaccine strategies to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) against HIV-1 generally propose complex, multi-boost immunization regimens. In rhesus macaques, SHIV infection has been observed to rapidly drive the development of some classes of bnAbs that share structural similarities with those in humans. Here, we generated a knockin mouse model with B cells bearing the unmutated common ancestor (UCA) of the V2 apex-targeted bnAb lineage, V033-a. A single immunization of mice with a germline-targeting native-like trimer was sufficient to recapitulate the ontogeny of the mature rhesus bnAb in knockin mice--including rare, disfavored somatic mutations--leading to the induction of antibodies that exhibited potent neutralization against both autologous and heterologous tier 2 viruses. A boost with Env escape mutant trimers further improved breadth and potency, and cryo-EM structure revealed the structural basis for heterologous neutralization breadth. Non-human primate and mouse models can thus combine with structure to serve as a platform for identifying and confirming immunogens that streamline HIV-vaccination regimens."
"Macrophages, as key sentinel cells of the innate immune system, can retain memory of prior stimulus exposure. Interferon gamma (IFN{gamma}) plays a central role in maintaining trained immunity in vivo and can induce potent memory in macrophages. Such memory is associated with the formation of de novo enhancers that alter gene expression responses to subsequent stimuli. However, how such enhancers are maintained after cytokine exposure remains unclear. We report that durable IFN{gamma}-induced enhancers can last for days after cytokine washout, yet the underlying persistence mechanism is not cell-intrinsic. IFN{gamma}-treated macrophages continue to exhibit JAK/STAT signaling days after cytokine removal. Blocking IFN{gamma} signaling with a JAK inhibitor or anti-IFN{gamma} neutralizing antibodies after cytokine removal is sufficient to reverse IFN{gamma}-induced enhancers and erase the potentiated state of the treated macrophages. Our findings suggest that epigenetic changes in macrophages do not inherently encode innate immune memory or a ""potentiated"" macrophage state, but in fact are themselves dependent on ongoing cytokine signaling. These findings suggest new possibilities for pharmacologic interventions to reverse aberrantly trained immune states associated with pathology."
"While protein synthesis typically initiates at an optimal AUG start codon, the 5 untranslated region (5UTR) of mRNAs harbors non-canonical start codons that result in the translation of upstream Open Reading Frames (uORFs). However, the mechanisms underlying the selection of non- canonical start codons remain poorly understood. Structural analysis of translation pre-initiation complexes showed that the 2OH group of the first nucleotide within start codons is monitored by 18S rRNA, allowing optimal translation initiation. We identified a chemical modification of mRNA, 2O-methylation (Nm), that represses translation initiation by interfering with the interaction of mRNA and 18S rRNA, thereby preventing the pre-initiation complex from recognizing start codons. Significantly, we uncovered the presence of 2O-methylation in the first nucleotide of non- canonical initiation sites within 5UTRs, where it repressed upstream translation initiation. These findings revealed a potent regulatory function of 2O-methylation in translation initiation and uORF expression, providing new insights into the mechanisms of non-canonical start codon selection in human cells."
"We adapted a multiparametric fitness assay panel--including ATP quantification, larval growth, pigmentation, and cuticle permeability--to assess Nippostrongylus brasiliensis viability in vitro. To validate this system, we benchmarked two known anthelmintics with distinct modes of action: quinidine, a heme detoxification disruptor, and pyrantel pamoate, a neuromuscular antagonist. We then applied this framework to NCR247, a plant-derived heme-sequestering peptide with proposed antiparasitic activity. While the assay panel sensitively detected physiological disruption by known anthelmintics, NCR247 did not significantly impair parasite fitness across any tested parameter. These findings highlight the utility of integrated viability assays and suggest further in vivo or delivery-optimized studies may be necessary to evaluate NCR247 efficacy."
"It has been suggested that temperature and pH are strong explanatory causes of protein evolutionary constraint. However, a general understanding of how changes in temperature and pH may universally impact protein evolution is lacking. Moreover, while pH is locally regulated in the different microbial compartments (e.g. periplasm, cytoplasm), temperature is not. A priori, these variables should act at different rates over evolutionary timescales with respect to genome evolution, since there are genes encoding for proteins allocated in different compartments. To test whether this is true, we can use a proxy for the number of evolutionary events (e.g. mutations, duplications, etc.). One simple yet unregarded way is to calculate the diversity of unique sequences assigned to a biochemical function (KEGG) across species. Given similar diversity of species in particular environments, the expectation for any KEGG is to be represented by a similar number of sequences. We can give answer to the question comparing this metric between metastable communities with differential values of temperature and pH. In this work, we examine the sequence diversity among 17 metagenomes from El Tatio geothermal field (Chile), spanning temperatures of 45-62{degrees}C, and pH values of 7.2-9.3. We found that, when controlling for abundance, higher temperature (>56{degrees}C) increases, while basic pH (>8.1) decreases the expected by-function diversity. The inclusion of these variables improved the prediction of sequence diversity from metagenomic abundance. Between-compartment diversity was more affected by pH than by temperature. Protein length distributions and individual, well-known taxa from hydrothermal springs showed compatible trends. Overall, our results suggest that sequence diversity is universally governed by the signature buffering of the stable compartments to some of the outside-cell factors, besides the taxonomic trends or the particularities of any function. Altogether, we provide evidence against the temperature-induced gene loss hypotheses, and in favor of the confined evolution hypothesis."

"Human influenza viruses are grown in chicken eggs for vaccine production. Sequences of these egg-passaged viruses give us the opportunity to examine the evolution that occurs when these human viruses are subjected to the selective pressure of growing in chicken eggs, which (among other things) express different sialic acid receptors. The repetition of this evolutionary experiment in hundreds of strains over the past several decades allows us to identify mutations that adapt the virus to eggs and epistatic constraints that influence them. We analyze influenza A/H3N2, A/H1N1pdm, B/Vic and B/Yam sequences that were passaged in eggs and find that almost all of the adaptive mutations are located around the receptor-binding pocket of hemagglutinin (HA). We observe epistatic interactions both between adaptive mutations and between these mutations and the continually-evolving human influenza HA background sequence. Our results show that this background dependence is greatest for influenza A/H3N2, then A/H1N1pdm, with B/Vic and B/Yam showing little-to-no background dependence. We find that the total number of adaptive mutations and the length of adaptive walk also follow the same pattern between the influenza subtypes, suggesting that background dependence, number of adaptive mutations, and extent of additive versus epistatic interactions may all be related features of the fitness landscape."
"Chromosomal inversions are large-scale structural variants that disrupt recombination and contribute to population differentiation and local adaptation. In this study, we characterized the genomic features, frequency, and evolutionary significance of chromosomal inversions in the European flat oyster (Ostrea edulis), a species of ecological and commercial relevance. Using a low-density SNP array ([~]5K), we obtained confident genotyping data across the native European distribution of the species. The breakpoints of the inversions at chromosome (C) 2, C5 and C8, spanning 27, 7 and 35 Mb, respectively, were precisely mapped by combining linkage disequilibrium in a large sample and long-read sequencing. This enabled us to identify the SNPs and genes within the inversions for comparative population genomics and functional evaluation. A north to south cline was observed for the three inversions, although with low-moderate correlation between them. Strong signals for divergent selection were detected for the three inversions, although with specific profiles suggestive of adaptive peaks around highly divergent SNPs across the inversion length. The three inversions seem to be old considering genetic diversity and differentiation between arrangements. Phylogeographic events and adaptation to the current environment seem underlying the structural pattern observed. Gene content and enrichment analyses within inversions suggest that these polymorphisms may play a role in the immune system and response to different stressors including parasite resistance. Our results provide new insights into the genomic architecture of adaptation in O. edulis and highlight the potential of structural variants as targets for conservation and selective breeding."
"DNA binding assays, expression analyses, and binding site mutagenesis revealed that the Drosophila CrebA transcription factor (TF) boosts secretory capacity in the embryonic salivary gland (SG) through direct regulation of secretory pathway component genes (SPCGs). The mammalian orthologues of CrebA, the Creb3L-family of leucine zipper TFs, not only activate SPCG expression in a variety of mammalian tissues but can also activate SPCG expression in Drosophila embryos, suggesting a highly conserved role for this family of proteins in boosting secretory capacity. However, in vivo assays reveal that CrebA binds far more genes than it regulates, and it remains unclear what distinguishes functional binding. It is also unclear if CrebA is the major factor driving SPCG gene expression in all Drosophila embryonic tissues and/or if CrebA also regulates other tissue-specific functions. Thus, we did single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of wild-type (WT) and CrebA null embryos to explore the relationship between CrebA binding and gene regulation. We find that CrebA binds the proximal promoters of its targets, that SPCGs are the major class of genes regulated by CrebA across tissues, and that CrebA is sufficient to activate SPCG expression even in cells that do not normally express the protein. A comparison of scRNA-Seq to other methods for capturing regulated transcripts reveals that the different methodologies identify overlapping but distinct sets of CrebA targets."
"The electroencephalogram (EEG) reflecting brain activity can be characterized through brief periods of stable neural activity patterns that recur over time and are referred to as microstates. Microstates are related to a range of cognitive processes, and their analysis has become an increasingly popular tool for studying human brain function. While microstates have been extensively studied in humans, their presence and characteristics in animal models have yet to be as thoroughly investigated. This study aims to address this gap by detecting and characterizing microstates in EEGs of rats collected using a superficial electrode system corresponding to homological areas of the human 10-20 system. Specifically, we demonstrate the presence of microstates in rats EEG; those can be captured by the same metrics as in humans. We define these microstates, describe them through topology and parameters, and identify the EEG frequency bands and intracranial sources that predominantly determine microstate topography. These findings have important implications for the use of microstates as a preclinical tool for investigating brain functions, detecting new biomarkers of brain diseases, and translating this knowledge to humans."
"AbstractsThree-dimensional (3D) enhancer communities are key regulators of gene expression, shaping cell fate decisions and contributing to disease pathogenesis. Assays such as H3K27ac HiChIP have been used to map enhancer-enhancer interactions and define enhancer communities; however, their reliance on antibody-based enrichment restricts scalability and cross-cell-type applicability. In contrast, Hi-C provides an unbiased, genome-wide view of chromatin architecture but lacks direct annotation of regulatory elements, limiting its utility for enhancer-focused analyses. To bridge this gap, we introduce Hi-Cociety--a graph-based computational framework and accompanying R package that infers 3D enhancer communities directly from Hi-C data, without relying on histone modification or chromatin accessibility measurements. Hi-Cociety constructs a network of significant interactions and applies clustering algorithms to define chromatin interaction modules. Applying Hi-Cociety to Hi-C measurements in T lymphocytes, we identified highly connected modules enriched for active transcription, chromatin accessibility, and histone acetylation. Notably, modules identified in T cells pinpoint critical genes central to T cell biology. Hi-Cociety also detects cell-type-specific differences in chromatin organization, highlighting dynamic regulatory rewiring across T cell states. Our findings underscore the importance of network properties-- connectivity, transitivity, and centrality--in shaping gene regulation through 3D genome organization. Hi-Cociety provides a scalable and versatile tool for mapping enhancer communities at scale, advancing our understanding of immune cell identity and the regulatory logic encoded in 3D chromatin structure."
"While excess adiposity is a major risk factor for hypertension and cardiovascular disease, brown fat is associated with protection from these pathologies. Whether brown fat has a causal role in this process and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown. Here we investigate the role of murine beige fat, as a model of inducible brown fat in humans, in adipocyte-vascular crosstalk. Using mice with an adipocyte-specific deletion of PRDM16, resulting in a loss of beige adipocyte identity, we discover a dramatic remodeling of perivascular adipose tissue, increased vascular reactivity and elevated blood pressure. We further show that the circulating enzyme Qsox1 is de-repressed in Prdm16-deficient adipocytes, and deletion of Qsox1 in PRDM16cKO mice rescues vascular fibrosis and reactivity. These results demonstrate a key new role for beige adipocytes in blood pressure regulation and identify Qsox1 as an important mediator of adipocyte-vascular crosstalk."
"Iridoids are specialized monoterpenes ancestral to asterid flowering plants (Albach et al, 2001; Stull et al, 2018). Iridoids play key roles in plant defense and are also essential precursors for pharmacologically important alkaloids (Dobler et al, 2011; Eisner, 1964). The biosynthesis of all iridoids involves the cyclization of a reactive enol intermediate. While this cyclization occurs spontaneously at low yields, it has long been hypothesized that a dedicated enzyme is involved in this process (Geu-Flores et al, 2012; Lichman et al, 2019b). Here, we report the discovery of asterid iridoid cyclases (ICYC). We show that these enzymes catalyze cyclization of the reactive intermediate to form the two major iridoid stereoisomers found in plants. Our work uncovers the last missing key step in the otherwise well-characterized iridoid biosynthesis pathway in asterids. This discovery unlocks the possibility to generate previously inaccessible iridoid stereoisomers, which will enable metabolic engineering for the sustainable production of valuable iridoid and iridoid-derived compounds."
"Marsupials (Marsupialia, Mammalia) represent a clade with highly varied ecologies. This is particularly true for opossums (South American marsupials), which are difficult to observe and collect. Consequently, few studies have focused on their bite force and the muscles of their masticatory apparatus, and there exists only scant information about the diet of certain species. Here we describe the masticatory muscles of several previously unstudied opossum species including Caenolestes fuliginosus, Dromiciops gliroides, and Monodelphis touan. We calculate the bite force of these species using data from both manual and virtual dissections and compare their theoretical bite forces with literature data. Additionally, we explore the differences between manual and virtual dissection to determine muscle PCSA (Physiological Cross-Sectional Area). We tried two virtual methods (VPDE: ""virtual physiological data estimating method"" and SM: ""slicing muscle method"") to calculate the PCSA, determine the differences induced by the inter-fiber void in the virtual volume, and calculate a correction post-treatment with the contrast agent. The results highlighted variation in the position of the muscular attachments of the M. zygomaticomandibularis, whose insertion area is the largest in Monodelphis touan and the smallest in Caenolestes fuliginosus. The bite forces are coherent with estimates from the literature suggesting that the biomechanical model is reliable. The comparison between manual and virtual dissection showed that while virtual dissection allows an overall description of the masticatory muscles, it is more complex to accurately describe the different subdivisions of the muscle bundles. Virtual dissection data could potentially complete manual dissection data with the association of the VPDE method, the exclusion of inter-fiber voids, and a correction for the treatment with contrast-agents."
"Stress granules are RNA-protein condensates that form in response to an increase in untranslating mRNPs. Stress granules form by the condensation of mRNPs through a combination of protein-protein, protein-RNA, and RNA-RNA interactions. Several reports have suggested that G-rich RNA sequences capable of forming G-quadruplexes promote stress granule formation. Here, we provide three observations arguing that G-tracts capable of forming rG4s do not promote mRNAs partitioning into stress granules in human osteosarcoma cells. First, we observed no difference in the accumulation in stress granules of reporter mRNAs with and without G-tracts in their 3 UTRs. Second, in U-2 OS cell lines with reduced DHX36 expression, which is thought to unwind G-quadruplexes, the partitioning of endogenous mRNAs was independent of their predicted rG4-forming potential. Third, while mRNAs in stress granules initially appeared to have a higher probability of forming rG4s than bulk mRNAs, this effect disappeared when rG4 motif abundance was standardized by mRNA length. However, we observe that in a G3BP1/2 double knockout cell line, reducing DHX36 expression rescued stress granule-like foci formation. This indicates that DHX36 can limit stress granule formation, potentially by unwinding trans rG4s, or limiting other intermolecular RNA-RNA interactions that promote stress granule formation.

Key Points- G-tract RNAs with quadruplex forming potential in an mRNA do not affect its partitioning into stress granules

- mRNA partitioning to stress granules is dependent on mRNA length rather than rG4-forming potential

- DHX36, a DEAH-box helicase that unwinds RNA G-quadruplexes, limits stress granule formation

"This study introduces a formal framework for modeling inheritance patterns based on an algebraic representation of genotype distributions. The approach defines genotypes as probability measures rather than discrete states, enabling the computation of genetic expectations, a probabilistic analogue that captures the expected distribution of offspring genotypes under Mendelian inheritance rules. This formulation permits constant-time simulation of multi-locus inheritance processes and provides a means of incorporating uncertainty and partial information in genotype data. A series of eleven illustrative examples is presented, encompassing both Mendelian and selected non-Mendelian mechanisms, including polygenic inheritance, uniparental disomy, and haplodiploidy. While the current framework does not model recombination, linkage, or phenotypic traits, it is designed to accommodate extensions to some complex chromosomal structures, such as those encountered in polysomic inheritance. The model reproduces classical inheritance outcomes and is intended as a computational and theoretical tool for genetic analysis in both research and pedagogical settings. Future development will focus on increasing biological scope and integrating empirical data sources.

"MotivationAccurate quantification of live cell migration, including velocity, is essential for understanding biological processes such as development, immune function, and cancer metastasis. High-throughput migration assays generate complex, hierarchically structured datasets with technical noise, batch effects, and biological variability, introducing significant uncertainty into velocity estimates. Current statistical approaches often fail to rigorously quantify this uncertainty, undermining reproducibility and comparability across independent experimental datasets. To address this challenge, we present cellmig, a computational tool that employs Bayesian hierarchical modeling to separate biological signals from technical variation while explicitly quantifying uncertainty in migration velocity.

Resultscellmig provides a robust framework for analyzing cell migration assays, including dose-response studies and large-scale screens with multiple biological and technical replicates. By modeling biological variability (e.g., compound-dependent effects) and technical confounders (e.g., batch variability) within a unified Bayesian framework, cellmig estimates condition-specific effects on cell velocity with probabilistic uncertainty intervals, avoiding common pitfalls associated with null-hypothesis testing. Additionally, its generative models enable simulation of migration velocities under various assumptions, aiding experimental planning. In summary, cellmig enhances reproducibility, reliability, and biological insight in high-throughput migration studies, facilitating inter-dataset comparisons.

"Recently, cellular heterogeneity has gained attention in several scientific studies. Its a phenomenon of the occurrence of differences in cellular parameters, for example, morphology or migration parameters of cells from a single cell line. It has been studied primarily in cancer cells; however, normal cells exhibit analogous behavior. This study investigated morphological and migratory parameters heterogeneity in mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF 3T3) cells cultured on polyacrylamide (PA) substrates with elasticity of 20 and 40 kPa, which were functionalized with fibronectin solutions in 1, 5, 10 and 20 g/ml concentrations. Two-hour time lapse microscopy made it possible to quantify the cells spread area and velocity. Based on these parameters and observations of cellular migration strategies, it was possible to classify normal cells into four subpopulations - mesenchymal, amoeboid, slow amoeboid and polygonal/bigonal. Cells grown on softer substrates (20 kPa) showed a greater sensitivity to fibronectin than those grown on stiffer substrates. Cells area was maximal, with the lowest velocity for cells grown on PA substrates functionalized with a 10 g/ml solution, making their parameters closest to those grown on glass. Cells underwent spontaneous transitions between subpopulations, but no direct transition between mesenchymal and amoeboid or slow amoeboid has been observed. Overall, substrate elasticity and concentration of fibronectin in the functionalizing solution impact the morphology and migration parameters of cells. These findings demonstrate the occurrence of heterogeneity phenomenon in normal mouse fibroblasts. This study also shows the impact of the concentration of fibronectin in the functionalization solution on cells behavior."
"Recombinant proteins, in particular monoclonal antibodies and related molecules, have become dominant therapeutics. As they are produced in mammalian cells, they require the concerted function of hundreds of host cell proteins in the protein secretion pathway. However, the comprehensive set of host cell machinery involved remains unclear. Thus, it is often unknown why some recombinant proteins fail to express well. Here we present and deploy an approach called Fc-targeting Biotinylation by Antibody Recognition (FcBAR), which allows for the in situ detection of protein-protein interactions for any recombinant protein with Fc domain. Briefly, cells are permeabilized and incubated with an anti-Fc antibody, conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. All proteins interacting with Fc-bearing proteins are then biotinylated, pulled down and identified via mass spectrometry. We applied this method on a panel of rituximab-producing CHO-S clones with a range of productivity levels. Through analysis of FcBAR protein-protein interactions and RNA-Seq, we identified protein interactions positively correlated with rituximab secretion, and tested 7 of these targets. We found overexpression of AGPAT4, EPHX1, and NSDHL significantly increased rituximab production. Thus, FcBAR provides an unbiased approach to measure PPIs supporting recombinant antibody production in situ, and can guide efforts to boost production of biotherapeutics and biosimilars by addressing production bottlenecks."
"Tissue homeostasis requires a precise balance between cellular self-renewal and differentiation. While fate decisions are known to be closely linked to cell cycle progression, the functional significance of this relationship is unclear. Here, we develop a mechanistic framework to analyse cellular dynamics when cell fate is coupled to cell cycle length. We focus on a distinct feature of cell cycle regulation where mitogens act as control parameters for a bifurcation governing the G1-S transition. Under competitive feedback from cell-cell interactions, the cell cycle regulatory network fine-tunes to the critical point of this bifurcation, becoming highly sensitive to mitogenic signalling. This critical positioning lengthens G1 while amplifying cell-to-cell variability in signalling and biochemical states. Such regulation confers significant advantages for controlling cell population dynamics, including maintaining a robust population set-point and rejecting mis-sensing mutants. The mutant rejection capability trades off against tissue growth and repair. Counter-intuitively, we propose that adult stem cells couple prolonged G1 with increased self-renewal propensity to efficiently eliminate mis-sensing mutants. Our theory explains and predicts regulatory patterns across development, homeostasis, and ageing."
"Neural mass models (NMMs) aim to capture the principles underlying mesoscopic neural activity representing the average behavior of large neural populations in the brain. Recently, a biophysically grounded laminar NMM (LaNMM) has been proposed, capable of generating coupled slow and fast oscillations resulting from interactions between different cortical layers. This concurrent oscillatory activity provides a mechanistic framework for studying information processing mechanisms and various disease-related oscillatory dysfunctions. We show that this model can exhibit periodic, quasiperiodic, and chaotic oscillations. Additionally we demonstrate, through bifurcation analysis and numerical simulations, the emergence of rhythmic activity and various frequency couplings in the model, including delta-gamma, theta-gamma, and alpha-gamma couplings. We also examine how alterations linked with Alzheimers disease impair the models ability to display multifrequency activity. Furthermore, we show that the model remains robust when coupled to another neural mass. Together, our results offer a dynamical systems perspective of the laminar NMM model, thereby providing a foundation for future modeling studies and investigations into cognitive processes that depend on cross-frequency coupling.

Author SummaryUnderstanding how the brain generates and coordinates rhythms across different layers is essential for uncovering the mechanisms underlying perception, memory, and cognition. In this work, we analyze a previously developed model of mesoscopic brain activity that simulates the layered structure of the cortex and its ability to produce coupled slow and fast neural oscillations. Using tools from dynamical systems theory, we reveal how the model gives rise to a rich repertoire of dynamical patterns--including periodic, quasiperiodic, and chaotic activity--through the coexistence of multiple oscillatory modes. We also investigate how pathological changes, such as those linked to Alzheimers disease, alter the models dynamics and impair its capacity to sustain complex cross-frequency interactions. Finally, we show that the model remains stable when connected to another brain region, highlighting its robustness. Our findings provide a deeper understanding of how multifrequency neural rhythms may emerge, how they might break down in disease, and how this modeling framework can inform both future theoretical studies and the development of new brain models."
"Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive technique to modulate brain activity, often used in treating Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) by targeting fronto-limbic circuitry. Despite its clinical utility, optimizing rTMS protocols remains challenging due to the complex and variable effects of stimulation parameter changes on synaptic plasticity. Oscillatory brain activity, measurable via Electroencephalography (EEG), serves as a biomarker for functional circuits and treatment response. To better understand the impact of rTMS on brain oscillations and connectivity, we used computational modeling of corticothalamic circuits to explore the mechanisms of stimulus-induced plasticity. We integrated calcium-dependent plasticity (CaDP) with Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro (BCM) metaplasticity formulations in a neural population model of resting-state EEG. By varying protocol parameters, we simulated iTBS effects on spectral power, synaptic efficacy, and calcium concentrations. Our findings highlight a resonance between theta stimulation and individual resting-state alpha rhythms, enhancing incoming excitatory long-term depression (LTD) and inhibitory long-term potentiation (LTP), leading to corticothalamic feed-forward inhibition (FFI). Induced effects were encapsulated by a weakening of corticothalamic loops and enhancement of intrathalamic loops. This work offers a novel paradigm for individualizing iTBS treatments, provides insights into the neurophysiological basis of clinical responsiveness, and offers a framework with which to derive tailored protocols."
"Balancing plasticity and rigidity is essential for brain function. While the neocortex typically shifts toward rigidity during development to preserve circuit integrity, certain forms of socially acquired emotional learning involve rapid remodeling in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), raising the question of how such flexibility is achieved without compromising pre-existing representations. We found that activity-dependent dendritic spine enlargement is actively suppressed by microglia via a humoral factor in the adolescent mPFC. Noradrenaline lifted this suppression through cAMP signaling in microglia, permitting spine enlargement. Disruption of this noradrenaline-dependent pathway in the mPFC impaired the rapid acquisition of socially learned fear. Conversely, localized microglial ablation enhanced learning efficiency but disrupted emotional boundaries, inducing social fear learning to alter pain sensitivity. These findings demonstrate that noradrenaline and microglia regulate the plasticity-rigidity balance within an optimal range in the mPFC, enabling rapid social learning while safeguarding the functional segregation of emotional circuits."
"Using machine learning, we developed models that rigorously detect and classify larval zebrafish spontaneous and stimulus-evoked behaviors in various well plate formats. Zebrafish are an ideal model system for investigating the neural substrates underlying behavior due to their simple nervous system and well-documented responses to environmental stimuli. To track movement, we utilized an 8 key point pose estimation model, allowing precise capture of zebrafish kinematics. Using this kinematic data, we trained two random forest classifiers in a semi-supervised learning framework to classify various discreet behavioral outputs including stationary, scoot, turn, acoustic-startle like behavior, and visual-startle like behavior. The classifiers were trained on a manually labeled dataset, and their accuracy was validated showing high precision. To validate our machine learning models, we analyzed behavioral outputs during various stimulus evoked responses and during spontaneous behavior. For additional validation, and to show the utility of our recording and analysis pipeline, we investigated the locomotor effects of several established drugs with well-defined impacts on neurophysiology. Here we show that machine learning model development, enabled by semi-supervised learning developed classification models, provide detailed insights into the behavioral phenotypes of zebrafish, offering a powerful, high throughput method for studying neural control of behavior."
"Huntingtons disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expanded trinucleotide repeat in the huntingtin gene (HTT) that subsequently leads to aggregation of the mutant huntingtin (mHTT) protein. Thus, lowering mHTT is a key therapeutic approach used by several candidate therapeutics currently under investigation. Visualization of the efficiency of these therapeutics through in vivo mHTT quantification rises in importance. For positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of mHTT aggregates, it is critical to characterize the in vivo kinetic profile of newly identified mHTT binders to assess their translational application. Here, we report the evaluation of [11C]CHDI-009R, a PET imaging radioligand with higher affinity and selectivity for mHTT aggregates than previously reported radioligands, in the heterozygous (HET) zQ175DN mouse model of HD wild-type (WT) littermates at 9 and 3 months of age.

[11C]CHDI-009R displayed high stability in plasma and brain, which was reflected in brain kinetics as demonstrated by rapid uptake followed by relatively slow elimination. Kinetic modeling and volume of distribution VT (IDIF) indicated the radioligands ability to quantify mHTT aggregation at 9 months of age with clear genotype differentiation (p<0.0001). [11C]CHDI-009R showed an excellent test-retest reliability in 9-month-old mice (intraclass correlation coefficient: 0.62 - 0.79). A phenotypic difference in mHTT aggregates was also observed in 3-month-old mice in several brain structures (p<0.05) and was confirmed with [3H]CHDI-009R autoradiography.

Overall, this study suggests [11C]CHDI-009R is a promising radioligand for the detection of cerebral mHTT aggregates in a mouse model of HD and supports its advance to clinical evaluation."
"Balancing selection is a powerful evolutionary force that maintains adaptive genetic and phenotypic diversity. Although methods to detect the footprints of balancing selection in genomic data have advanced, we still lack a clear understanding of how repeatable these signatures appear in wild populations, and how this repeatability is shaped by demographic history and existing genetic variation. The Trinidadian guppy (Poecilia reticulata) provides an ideal model to test the repeatability of balancing selection in the wild as there is strong evidence that negative frequency-dependent selection (NFDS) maintains colour polymorphism. Analysing whole-genome sequencing data from 11 guppy populations (n = 195) with contrasting demographic contexts, we apply scans of balancing selection to explore which genomic regions show evidence of repeatability. We find that populations with small Ne show less genetic repeatability but still exhibit population-specific regions of elevated diversity, implicating independent balancing selection or other evolutionary mechanisms. Despite this, we identify 23 regions with repeated signatures of balancing selection, including a region on LG22 containing genes involved in colour, vision, mate choice, and social behaviour. Investigating the repeatability of balancing selection in small and large populations improves our knowledge of how demographic factors interact with selective processes to shape natural variation."
"The 2020 SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus pandemic highlighted the urgent need for novel small molecule antiviral drugs. (S)-x38 DNDI-6510 is a non-covalent SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitor developed by the open science collaboration COVID Moonshot.

Here, we report on the metabolic and toxicologic optimization of the lead series previously disclosed by the COVID Moonshot Initiative, leading up to the selection of (S)-x38 DNDI-6510 as the preclinical candidate. We describe the thorough profiling of the series, identifying key risks such as formation of genotoxic metabolites and high clearance, which were successfully addressed during lead optimization. In addition, we disclose the in vitro and in vivo evaluation of (S)-x38 DNDI-6510 in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic models, exploring multiple approaches to ameliorate rodent-specific metabolic clearance, and show that both co-dosing of (S)-x38 DNDI-6510 with an ABT inhibitor and utilizing a metabolically humanized mouse model (8HUM) achieve significant improvements in exposure. Through comparisons of ABT co-dosing and humanized mouse models in efficacy experiments, we demonstrate that continuous exposure over cellular EC90 is required for SARS-CoV-2 antiviral efficacy in vivo in an antiviral model using a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 strain. Finally, (S)-x38 DNDI-6510 was assessed in maximum tolerated dose experiments in two species, demonstrating significant in vivo PXR-linked auto-induction of metabolism, leading to the discontinuation of this compound.

In summary, we report the successful effort to overcome series-specific AMES liabilities in a lead development program. Downstream optimization of existing series will require in-depth optimization of rodent-specific liabilities and metabolic induction profile."
"Black spot disease, caused by the hemibiotrophic fungus Diplocarpon rosae, is a major foliar disease of garden roses. Resistant cultivars offer an alternative to fungicides, but the genetic basis of resistance is not well known. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for the effective and durable deployment of resistant cultivars. A hybrid of Rosa wichurana (RW) exhibits quantitative resistance to black spot. Analysis of an F1 progeny from a cross between RW and the susceptible cultivar Rosa chinensis  Old Blush showed that RWs resistance mainly involves two Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs), on linkage groups 3 (B3) and 5 (B5). This study aimed to better characterize the molecular mechanisms underlying these QTLs. RNA sequencing was performed on inoculated and non-inoculated samples of RW and four F1 genotypes with different QTL combinations, at 0, 3, and 5 days post-inoculation (dpi). The comparison of inoculated and non-inoculated samples revealed that most genes were differentially expressed at 3 dpi. For all the genotypes, we observed shifts in expression of genes involved in plant defense, as well as genes participating in hormonal pathways and calcium-mediated signaling. Genotypes harboring QTL B3 showed ""classic"" defense responses involving pathogen recognition, signaling, ROS production, callose deposition, and localized cell death. In contrast, QTL B5 was associated with few shared DEGs, making it harder to define its role. The quantitative nature of RWs resistance may result in this complex regulation of gene expression."
"End-to-end, machine-learning based design of mRNA molecules offers a powerful means to tailor their properties for specific tasks. mRNA expression level, immunogenicity, tissue specificity, stability, and localization, among others strongly depend on sequence, thus providing a rich set of properties amenable to optimization. Despite this potential, the various components of mRNA are governed by distinct grammatical and functional rules that hinder the development of a unified algorithmic approach for complete mRNA design. While machine learning and generative AI techniques demonstrate substantial benefits for individual sequence design tasks, adapting these tools to new domains or out-of-distribution tasks remains challenging. In this work, we describe a simple and powerful alteration to integrated gradients (Design by Integrated Gradients-DIGs) that serves as the foundation for several mRNA design tasks. Using this technique, we demonstrate complete model-informed mRNA design and reveal the underexplored rules governing the assembly of mRNA components into complete, high-performance transcripts. This framework closes the loop on mRNA design by unifying the strengths of predictive neural networks with the vast quantities of diverse RNA data that has been accumulating for decades across transcriptomic profiling, CLIP-seq, and individual experimental findings. By linking the benefits of neural network-based design with diverse alternative datasets, we demonstrate the design of complete mRNA sequences in out-of-distribution settings that exhibit dramatically improved translational capacity, enhanced cell-type-specific expression, and improved stability."
"Pneumocystis species are obligate fungal pathogens that cause severe pneumonia, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. The absence of robust genetic manipulation tools has impeded our mechanistic understanding of Pneumocystis biology and the development of novel therapeutic strategies. Herein, we describe a novel method for the stable transformation and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genetic editing of Pneumocystis murina utilizing extracellular vesicles (EVs) as a delivery vehicle. Building upon our prior investigations demonstrating EV-mediated delivery of exogenous material to Pneumocystis, we engineered mouse lung EVs to deliver plasmid DNA encoding reporter genes and CRISPR/Cas9 components. Our initial findings demonstrated successful in vitro transformation and subsequent expression of mNeonGreen and DhpsARS in P. murina organisms. Subsequently, we established stable in vivo expression of mNeonGreen in mice infected with transformed P. murina for a duration of up to 5 weeks. Furthermore, we designed and validated a CRISPR/Cas9 system targeting the P. murina Dhps gene, confirming its in vitro cleavage efficiency. Ultimately, we achieved successful in vivo CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homologous recombination, precisely introducing a DhpsARS mutation into the P. murina genome, which was confirmed by Sanger sequencing across all tested animals. Here, we establish a foundational methodology for genetic manipulation in Pneumocystis, thereby opening avenues for functional genomics, drug target validation, and the generation of genetically modified strains for advanced research and potential therapeutic applications.

IMPORTANCEPneumocystis species are obligate fungal pathogens and major causes of pneumonia in immunocompromised individuals. However, their strict dependence on the mammalian lung environment has precluded the development of genetic manipulation systems, limiting our ability to interrogate gene function, study antifungal resistance mechanisms, or validate therapeutic targets. Here, we report the first successful approach for stable transformation and CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing of Pneumocystis murina, achieved through in vivo delivery of engineered extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing plasmid DNA and encoding CRISPR/Cas9 components. We demonstrate sustained transgene expression and precise modification of the dhps locus via homology-directed repair. This modular, scalable platform overcomes a long-standing barrier in the field and establishes a foundation for functional genomics in Pneumocystis and other obligate, host-adapted microbes."
"Anaerobic digesters are operated at high solids retention times (SRTs) of 20 d or longer to mitigate accidental substrate overloading. However, the long-term effects of such disturbances on digester performance and microbiome remain unclear. This study investigates whether short-term pulse disturbances (temporary SRT reductions) can enhance microbial resilience and accelerate recovery from sustained overloading conditions. We explored the feasibility of anaerobic digestion at shorter SRTs by introducing one or two pulse SRT disturbances (SRT reduction from 15 to 5 d) in four mesophilic anaerobic digesters treating wastewater sludge, followed by sustained operation (press disturbance) 5 d SRT. Dual pulse disturbances showed faster process recovery compared to digesters receiving a single pulse disturbance (60 d vs 104 d) with reduced volatile fatty acids levels during the subsequent press disturbance periods. Microbial community redundancy and resilience, with shifts between the slow-growing, resource-efficient taxa (K-strategists) and fast-growing, opportunistic taxa (r-strategists), were crucial in ensuring minimal disruptions during disturbance and recovery periods. Overall, pulse disturbances may serve as a practical tool for enhancing microbiome resilience in anaerobic digestion, enabling stable performance under fluctuating substrate loading conditions.

SYNOPSISControlled pulse disturbances enhance anaerobic digestion resilience by priming microbial communities, enabling stable performance at short solids retention times and high organic loading conditions."
"Cationic peptides rich in arginine are potent antimicrobials but face challenges due to enzymatic degradation and potential host toxicity. We screened eight linear arginine-rich peptides for antimicrobial and haemolytic activity, identifying R4F4 as the most active. However, its efficacy decreased in the presence of human serum and trypsin. To enhance stability, we developed three R4F4 derivatives--D-R4F4, cyclic R4F4, and R4F4-C16--plus one R4-based peptide (R4-C16). Cyclisation and D-amino acid substitution significantly improved protease resistance and antimicrobial activity. Using fluorescence imaging, microscopy, and RNA sequencing, we revealed a complex mechanism involving membrane disruption, oxidative stress modulation, and transcriptomic changes in bacterial metabolic pathways. The R4F4-based peptides also displayed strong antibiofilm activity and good cytocompatibility. Our findings highlight the benefits of peptide optimisation--particularly D-amino acid incorporation and cyclisation--in improving stability and function. This work informs future design of antimicrobial peptides and deepens understanding of their multifaceted biological effects."
"Human noroviruses (HuNoVs) are the leading global cause of non-bacterial gastroenteritis, yet no vaccines or antiviral therapies are currently approved1. The viral non-structural protein NS3 is a membrane-bound AAA+ ATPase of superfamily 3 (SF3) with multiple proposed roles in the norovirus replication cycle. However, the structure of NS3, and the mechanisms by which it contributes to genome replication and membrane remodeling, have remained unknown. We engineered a soluble, hexameric, and catalytically active form of NS3 and determined its cryo-EM structure in the presence of a nucleotide analogue at 2.9 [A] resolution. The structure adopts a split lock-washer architecture characteristic of AAA+ motors that operate via a hand-over-hand translocation mechanism2. Modeling of the nucleotide-binding site reveals conserved features governing ATP binding and hydrolysis. Using integrative modeling with AlphaFold3, we generated a full-length, membrane-associated model of NS3, in which an N-terminal transmembrane domain, central helical bundle, and AAA+ motor form a continuous conduit. This model supports a role for NS3 as a candidate membrane-spanning RNA translocase that couples ATP hydrolysis to genome movement. This structural framework helps address long-standing gaps in our understanding of norovirus replication and establishes a basis for mechanistic studies and structure-guided antiviral design."
"Antimicrobial resistance is a global health threat emerging through microbe adaptation, driven by genetic variation, genome plasticity or epigenetic regulation. This study investigates how the Mucor circinelloides species complex adapts to the antifungal natural product FK506. In Mucor bainieri, most resistant strains exhibit unstable phenotypes without genetic changes. Approximately [~]50% of FK506-resistant isolates acquire resistance via RNAi-dependent epimutation, where small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) silence fkbA transcription. The remaining isolates undergo heterochromatin-mediated silencing via H3K9 methylation and siRNAs spreading, repressing fkbA and neighboring genes. One isolate retained only heterochromatin marks without detectable siRNAs. A similar mechanism operates in Mucor atramentarius, where FK506 resistance is mediated by ectopic heterochromatin associated with siRNA. Strikingly, heterochromatin-based epimutation inheritance remains stable following in vivo infection. These findings reveal that antifungal resistance can arise through distinct, heritable epigenetic pathways involving RNAi, heterochromatin, or both highlighting adaptive strategies employed by ubiquitous eukaryotic microbial pathogens infecting humans."
"Chromate (Cr(VI)) is a widely distributed heavy metal known for its toxicity and adverse effects on human health. Due to its extensive industrial use, Cr(VI) is commonly detected in municipal and industrial wastewater, often co-occurring with other contaminants such as nitrate (NO3-). Nitrate-dependent anaerobic methane oxidation (N-DAMO) is a promising microbially driven process that enables the simultaneous removal of methane (CH4) and NO3-, potentially lowering the carbon footprint of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Given that Cr(VI) can act as an alternative electron acceptor, its presence may influence the N-DAMO process either by supporting CH4 oxidation or, conversely, by exerting toxic effects that inhibit microbial activity. In this study, we investigated the impact of Cr(VI) on an N-DAMO enrichment culture composed of Candidatus Methanoperedens and Candidatus Methylomirabilis, using NO3- as the electron acceptor and 13C-CH4 as the sole electron donor. Cultures were exposed to varying concentrations of Cr(VI), and microbial activity was assessed through GC-MS, 16S rRNA gene sequencing and qPCR. Here we found that while Cr(VI) was reduced within the culture, this process was not coupled to CH4 oxidation. In fact, CH4 oxidation was significantly inhibited, and the relative abundances of Ca. Methanoperedens and Ca. Methylomirabilis declined under increasing Cr(VI) concentrations. Cr(VI) reduction was likely mediated by the flanking microbial community via two possible pathways: (i) enzymatically, through nitrate reductase activity in denitrifying bacteria, and (ii) abiotically, through chemical reaction with nitrite (NO2-), an intermediate of denitrification. These findings highlight the potential of N-DAMO microbes to confer functional resilience in contaminated environments. However, the sensitivity of methanotrophic organisms to Cr(VI) underscores a limitation in applying this process to wastewater treatment systems containing heavy metals."
"Chrysophytes are widespread nanoflagellate protists in aquatic ecosystems with diverse trophic strategies ranging from phototrophy to heterotrophy. Here, we report the first isolation of a chrysophyte-infecting virus, Chrysophyceae clade-H virus SA1, referred to hereafter as ChrysoHV, on a sympatric mixotrophic chrysophyte. Both host and virus were isolated from surface waters in the subtropical North Pacific. The ChrysoHV capsid (291 {+/-} 42 nm diameter) is associated with a loose, sac-like membrane that extends its effective diameter (716 {+/-} 115 nm), and presents a long, thin tail extending 1,202 ({+/-} 243) nm. This unique morphology has not been previously observed in other isolates or environmental surveys. The sequenced, assembled genome is 1.19 Mbp, and phylogenetic analysis places ChrysoHV as the third cultivated member of the Aliimimivirinae subfamily in the Mimiviridae family of giant viruses. ChrysoHV is the first cultivated member of Aliimimivirinae to encode a rhodopsin, which has high phylogenetic relatedness and structural similarity to proteorhodopsin sequences retrieved from the same subtropical research site. The most closely related sequences from cultivated organisms derive from bacteria in the genus Pelagibacter. This suggests that ChrysoHV acquired the proteorhodopsin-like protein through lateral gene transfer from the chrysophytes bacterial prey."
"Positive-sense RNA viruses that constitute a large class of human pathogens employ various strategies to evade host immune defences, complicating the development of effective antiviral therapies. Understanding the dynamic interaction between the viral life cycle and immune signaling is critical to designing effective antiviral strategies, yet the quantitative principles governing virus-host interactions remain poorly understood. In this study, we develop a mechanistic mathematical model that integrates the intracellular viral life cycle with key cellular innate immune pathways, including RIG-I-mediated sensing and JAK-STAT signaling. Our model reveals that virus-host interactions exhibit sharp bifurcation behaviour, where minor perturbations in immune strength or viral evasion capacity determine whether infections resolve or persist. Sensitivity analysis further revealed ISG mRNA translation and viral replication kinetics as dominant factors controlling infection outcomes, providing quantitative targets for therapeutic intervention. The model successfully recapitulates IFN desensitization phenomena and predicts optimal timing and dosing strategies for interferon-based prophylactic therapies. Together, our approach reveals fundamental principles that govern the delicate balance between viral persistence and immune control in RNA virus infections and potential avenues for future antiviral strategies."
"The bacterial order Magnimaribacterales, previously known as the SAR86 lineage, is among the most abundant groups of planktonic bacteria inhabiting the global surface ocean. Despite their prevalence, our understanding of how this genetically diverse lineage partitions into units with coherent ecology and evolution remains limited. Here we surveyed multiple stations in the tropical Pacific Ocean using shotgun metagenomes and 16S rRNA gene amplicons to resolve distinct habitat preferences for Magnimaribacterales lineages across nearshore, offshore, and open-ocean environments. The comprehensive collection of genomes that captured a large fraction of the known evolutionary breadth of Magnimaribacterales, revealed patterns of ecotypic differentiation manifested primarily among genus-level clusters with specific clear preferences for distinct marine habitats. Enrichment analyses identified several functional genes associated with genomes from genera abundant in the nearshore environment, including those associated with sugar metabolism, peptide transport, and glycerophospholipid biosynthesis. Such metabolic adaptations likely facilitate the predominance of specific Magnimaribacterales genera in nearshore environments, promoting ecological partitioning across marine habitats.

ImportanceUnderstanding the nature by which abundant, genetically-diverse planktonic marine bacteria organize into evolutionarily related and functionally coherent units remains an important question for scientists interested in the ecology of the global ocean. The bacterial order Magnimaribacterales (formerly SAR86) is one of the most prevalent clades in the global surface ocean, yet its ecological differentiation remains poorly resolved. By integrating metagenomic and amplicon analyses across a nearshore-to-open-ocean gradient in the tropical Pacific, this study reveals distinct habitat preferences within this lineage. The study also highlights how differences in distribution appear are primarily found between genus-level groupings. Our findings also highlight key functional traits, including sugar metabolism and glycerophospholipid biosynthesis, that were associated with the partitioning of nearshore and open-ocean Magnimaribacterales. This work enhances our understanding of the evolutionary processes shaping the diversity of one of the oceans most abundant bacterial clades."
"DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are highly cytotoxic lesions whose misrepair can lead to genomic instability, cancer and developmental disorders. Through systematic screening of understudied ubiquitin-like modifiers (UBLs), we identify UFM1 as a previously unrecognised regulator of non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ). Using a structure-guided chemical biology strategy, we develop a photo-crosslinkable UFM1 probe and, together with high-resolution NMR, uncover non-canonical UFM1-binding regions in core NHEJ components, including XRCC4. Mechanistically, proximity-dependent proteomics reveals Ku70 as a key UFMylation substrate, establishing a functional axis in which XRCC4 engages UFMylated Ku70 to promote the chromatin assembly of NHEJ factors. Perturbation of UFM1 signalling, via UFSP2 depletion or a hypomorphic UBA5 allele in patient-derived fibroblasts, impairs these processes, linking UFMylation defects to altered regulation of DSB repair. Our findings define a complete UFM1 signalling module in genome maintenance and uncover a molecular connection between hereditary UFMylation disorders and dysregulated DSB repair pathways."
"Prokaryotic microorganisms coexist with mobile genetic elements (MGEs), which can be both genetic threats and evolutionary catalysts. In Haloferax lucentense, a halophilic archaeon, we have recently identified an unusual genomic arrangement: a complete type I-B CRISPR-Cas system encoded on a mega-plasmid coexists with a partial counterpart within an integrated provirus in the main chromosome. The provirus-encoded system lacks the adaptation genes (cas1, cas2, and cas4), suggesting its potential reliance on the plasmid-encoded CRISPR-Cas module for the acquisition of new spacers. This arrangement suggests a potential instance of ""adaptive outsourcing,"" where a provirus might leverage a co-resident MGE for a key function. Through comparative genomics, we show that similar proviral CRISPR-Cas systems are found in distantly related haloarchaea (e.g., Natrinema and Halobacterium), indicating probable virus-mediated horizontal transfer and suggesting they may function as mobile defense modules. Phylogenetic analysis highlights distinct evolutionary origins of the two systems: the plasmid system clusters with other Haloferax CRISPR-Cas systems, while the proviral system clusters with those from other genera, consistent with horizontal acquisition. Interestingly, spacer analysis reveals that the proviral systems predominantly target viral sequences, while the plasmid system appears to target both plasmids and viral sequences, a distribution mirroring broader trends observed in other plasmid- and chromosome-encoded CRISPR systems. This observed targeting preference suggests a potential for complementarity that could support a model of cooperative immunity, where each system may protect its genetic ""owner"" from competition and, indirectly, the host."
"Recombination rates vary markedly across species, populations, and sexes. In house mice (Mus musculus), this variation is particularly pronounced. Prior studies have established large differences in global recombination rates between M. musculus subspecies and inbred strains, with males exhibiting more extensive variation than females. The observation of sex-limited variation has prompted the hypothesis that male and female recombination rates may evolve by distinct evolutionary mechanisms in M. musculus. Here, we set out to formally evaluate this hypothesis in a phylogenetic framework using a dataset of cytogenetic sex-specific genome-scale crossover rate estimates from >6000 single meiotic cells from 31 genetically diverse inbred mouse strains spanning five Mus species and four M. musculus subspecies. Using phylogenetic comparative methods, we document a significant phylogenetic signal in male recombination rates, but female recombination rates show no clear phylogenetic trend. Males from M. m. musculus exhibit a large increase in recombination rate compared to other M. musculus subspecies, prompting us to explicitly test models of lineage-specific trait evolution. We show that the phylogenetic distribution of male recombination rates is best explained by an evolutionary model that allows a unique adaptive optimum along the M. m. musculus lineage, whereas female recombination rates are well-explained by a simplified model with a single global trait optimum. Taken together, our findings confirm the hypothesis that recombination rate evolution in house mice is governed by distinct sex-specific evolutionary regimes and motivate future efforts to ascertain the sex-specific selective pressures and sex-specific genetic architectures that underlie these observations.

ARTICLE SUMMARYMeiotic recombination rates are highly variable between species, populations, and sexes. This variation is genetically controlled, but the underlying evolutionary processes that shape the extreme diversity of recombination rates are poorly understood. Here, we analyze sex-specific recombination rate estimates across a large panel of genetically diverse male and female house mice in an explicit phylogenetic framework. We show that recombination rates in males and females have evolved under distinct evolutionary programs, implying sex differences in the phenotypic value that optimizes evolutionary fitness. Our data point to intersexual genetic conflict driving rapid sex-specific recombination rate evolution in this system."
"Transcription factors (TFs) regulate gene expression by interacting with specific DNA sequences in various manners, yet the mechanisms by which they dissociate from high-affinity DNA sites under physiological conditions remain not completely understood. Here, we employ continuous wave electron paramagnetic resonance (CW-EPR) spectroscopy in native solution state to resolve, with domain-level precision, the dissociation dynamics of the MYC-associated factor X (MAX) from its cognate EBOX DNA motif. Site-directed spin labeling reveals that in the absence of DNA, MAX undergoes a stepwise dissociation process--beginning with melting of the N-terminal disordered region (NTD), followed by the helix-loop-helix (HLH) domain, and culminating in leucine zipper (LZ) dimer dissociation. DNA binding reorganizes this process into a cooperative all-or-none transition, wherein destabilization of the LZ triggers concerted collapse of the entire trimeric MAX:MAX-DNA complex. Strikingly, the addition of a disordered BRCA1 fragment (residues 219-504) disrupts this cooperativity by selectively destabilizing DNA contacts in the NTD and HLH regions, without perturbing the LZ. This results in facilitated dissociation via competitive DNA binding, observed here directly at domain-level resolution. Our findings establish EPR spectroscopy as a uniquely sensitive tool for dissecting TF-DNA dynamics under physiological conditions, offering mechanistic insight into regulated unbinding processes inaccessible to ensemble methods."
"Targeted insertion of large DNA fragments has promising applications for genome engineering and gene therapy1,2. Twin prime editing (PE) guide RNAs (pegRNAs) have enabled relatively large insertions, but the efficiency remains low for insertions greater than 400 base pairs3-6. Here we describe a Prime Assembly (PA) approach for the insertion of large DNA donor fragments, whose ends are designed to overlap with the flaps generated by twinPE. We used PA to insert one, two, or three overlapping DNA fragments, with total insertion sizes ranging from 0.1 to 11 kilobase pairs. An inhibitor of non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) enhanced both the efficiency and precision of insertions. PA relies on DNA templates that are easily produced and does not require co-delivery of exogenous DNA-dependent DNA polymerases. Our study demonstrates that PA can initiate ""Gibson-like"" assembly in cells to generate gene insertions without double-stranded DNA breaks or recombinases."
"The paradigm postulating that tissue stable isotopic ratios ({delta}tissue) equal those of the diet ({delta}diet) plus a small, quasi-constant isotope discrimination factor {Delta} emerged in the late 1970s, establishing stable isotope analysis as a dietary proxy. Today, this framework is still widely used across multiple branches of science, despite growing contradicting evidence. Here, we reanalysed several well-controlled laboratory experiments and universally found that {Delta} not only varies strongly with{delta} diet, but also changes sign at a certain{delta} eq ={delta} diet ={delta} tissue value, which we term the {Delta}-equilibrium. The {Delta}-equilibrium phenomenon results from the sub-unity slope of the linear regression between{delta} diet and{delta} tissue and leads to converging of{delta} tissue values. The most frequently observed position of the {Delta}-equilibrium on the ({delta}13C,{delta} 15N) plane is (-21{+/-}1{per thousand}, 12{+/-}1{per thousand}). These findings firmly establish that stable isotopes are not neutral spectators but active participants in biochemical processes. If presented evidence holds in a much broader study, the paradigm{delta} tissue ={delta} food + {Delta} can finally be retired after half a century of service, being replaced by{delta} tissue = ax{delta}food + Const, where a is the newly defined isotope assimilation factor. The {Delta}-equilibrium position is then found as{delta} eq = Const/(1 - a). The reason for isotope convergence remains a subject for future research, but likely hypotheses include evolutionary adaptation and isotopic resonance."
"Advanced genome editing technologies have enabled rapid and flexible rewriting of the Escherichia coli genome, benefiting fundamental biology and biomanufacturing. Unfortunately, some of the most useful technologies to advance genome editing in E. coli have not yet been ported into other bacterial species. For instance, the addition of bacterial retrons to the genome editing toolbox has increased the efficiency of recombineering in E. coli by enabling sustained, abundant production of ssDNA recombineering donors by reverse transcription that install flexible, precise edits in the prokaryotic chromosome. To extend the utility of this technology beyond E. coli, we surveyed the portability and versatility of retron-mediated recombineering across three different bacterial phyla (Proteobacteria, Bacillota and Actinomycetota) and a total of 15 different species. We found that retron recombineering is functional in all species tested, reaching editing efficiencies above 20% in six of them, above 40% in three of them, and above 90% in two of them. We also tested the extension of the recombitron architecture optimizations and strain backgrounds in a subset of hosts to additionally increase editing rates. The broad recombitron survey carried out in this study forms the basis for widespread use of retron-derived technologies through the whole Bacteria domain."
"Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV) remains a major global public health challenge, having led to over 42.3 million deaths since its discovery in the early 1980s. Despite progress in prevention and treatment, around 60% of people with HIV (PWH) remain undiagnosed in resource-limited regions, disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations and underserved communities across the world. This illustrates the critical need for accessible, accurate, and equipment-free diagnostic tools to enhance detection and thus provide opportunities to curb its spread. Here, we developed a low-cost, robust, and label-free rolling circle amplification (RCA)-rCRISPR diagnostic platform for detecting HIV viral load with minimal instrumentation. Our strategy, combining the integration of RNA-detecting RCA reaction with plasmid reporter-based ratiometric CRISPR (rCRISPR), enables sensitive detection of unprocessed RNA targets without the need for intensive sample pre-treatment. This label-free RCA-rCRISPR diagnostic platform detected HIV RNA down to single-digit aM sensitivity (~3000 copies/mL) from PWH-derived HIV samples ex vivo. Unlike typical RCA, which requires sample fragmentations to break long RNA target sequences, our design harnesses the triple functions of the phi29 DNA polymerase (namely exonuclease activity, polymerization, and strand displacement), enabling the detection of the entire HIV genome without pre-fragmentation. For point-of-care (POC) applications, we constructed an all-in-one smartphone-based minigel electrophoresis device to facilitate equipment-free HIV viral load testing, making it accessible to resource-limited communities. Additionally, the assay has demonstrated the ability for point mutation detection (BRAF mutation in canine urothelial carcinoma), showcasing the robustness of our strategy for broad disease diagnostic applications."
"Given how quickly the SARS-CoV-2 virus mutates, the COVID-19 pandemic has been a major source of concern. The ORF8 accessory protein is one such protein, which is reported to have undergone many mutations. This makes ORF8 an intriguing protein to investigate how these mutations might play a role in overall ORF8 activity. In this study, we have performed conservation and mutational analysis on SARS-CoV- 2 ORF8 protein sequences to identify the conserved and mutated residues. We have also split the ORF8 sequence data into SARS-CoV-2 variant datasets to further identify top mutations across each of them. The mutated and conserved residues were visualised on the available structure of ORF8 to highlight the conserved and mutated sites, which might hold some biological significance. Finally, our study also investigated the significance of sequence dataset size in capturing top mutations following multiple sequence alignments.

Author SummaryThe COVID-19 pandemic was caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is known to change over time, i.e., it gets mutated, resulting in the generation of different variants. The ORF8 accessory protein of the SARS-CoV- 2 genome is known to undergo these changes more frequently. In our study, we used SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 protein sequences from various variants to identify mutations among them. Furthermore, we have discovered sites that remain unchanged over time, a phenomenon known as conservation. We think that these unchanged and changed sites could be important for biology and studying them will help in understanding the underlying mechanism of how ORF8 interacts with partner proteins based on existing experimental data. Lastly, we have looked at how much sequence data is sufficient for identifying the top mutated sites.

"CRISPR-associated transposons (CAST) enable programmable, RNA-guided DNA integration, marking a transformative advancement in genome engineering. A central player in the type V-K CAST system is the AAA+ ATPase TnsC, which assembles into helical filaments on double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) to orchestrate target site recognition and transposition. Despite its essential role, the molecular mechanisms underlying TnsC filament nucleation and elongation remain poorly understood. Here, multiple-microsecond and free energy simulations are combined with deep learning-based Graph Attention Network (GAT) models to elucidate the mechanistic principles of TnsC filament formation and growth. Our findings reveal that ATP binding promotes TnsC nucleation by inducing DNA remodelling and stabilizing key protein-DNA interactions, particularly through conserved residues in the initiator-specific motif (ISM). Furthermore, GNN-based attention analyses identify a directional bias in filament elongation in the 5'[-&gt;]3' direction and uncover a dynamic compensation mechanism between incoming and bound monomers that facilitate directional growth along dsDNA. By leveraging deep learning-based graph representations, our GAT model provides interpretable mechanistic insights from complex molecular simulations and is readily adaptable to a wide range of biological systems. Altogether, these findings establish a mechanistic framework for TnsC filament dynamics and directional elongation, advancing the rational design of CAST systems with enhanced precision and efficiency."
"Activin A and B share the same downstream signalling pathway (activation of SMAD2/3) as TGF-{beta} and consequently elicit many of the same functional responses as TGF-{beta}, including immune suppression, activation of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and extracellular matrix production and remodelling. However, activins role in tumourigenesis has been relatively overlooked compared to TGF-{beta}s. We generated and characterized a dual specificity human antibody that recognizes both activin A and B and compared its activity in syngeneic mouse models of breast cancer and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) with an activin A-specific antibody. We demonstrate that activin A and B are central to the function of CAFs and therapeutic inhibition of activin results in a reduction of collagen rich desmoplastic barriers, enabling the infiltration of cytotoxic T cells. This is correlated with an upregulation of the T cell chemoattractant CXCL10, which is normally repressed by activin signalling. Interestingly, despite greater T cell infiltration, activin A inhibition resulted in poorer survival in the KPC mouse model of PDAC and slightly larger tumours in the breast cancer model, indicating a tumour suppressive role of activin A-rich CAFs. Strikingly, however, treatment with the same anti-activin A antibody of PDAC tumours where SMAD4 is deleted in the tumour cells, resulted in increased survival, which was potentiated with additional treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors. These results suggest that anti-activin therapy has potential for the cohort of PDAC patients exhibiting inactivation of SMAD4."
"Understanding RNA structure and predicting the functional consequences of mutations are fundamental challenges in computational biology with broad implications for therapeutic development and synthetic biology. Current evaluation of machine learning-based RNA models suffers from disparate experimental datasets and inconsistent performance assessments across different RNA families. To address these challenges, we introduce RNAGym, a large-scale benchmarking framework specifically designed for three core tasks-RNA fitness, secondary structure, and tertiary structure prediction. The framework integrates extensive datasets, including 70 standardized deep mutational scanning assays covering over a million mutations across diverse RNA types; 901k chemical-mapping reactivity profiles for secondary structure; and 215 diverse tertiary structures curated from the PDB. RNAGym is designed to facilitate a systematic comparison of RNA models, offering an essential resource to enhance the understanding and development of these models."
"Mutations in GBA1, the gene encoding glucocerebrosidase (GCase), are the most common risk factor for Parkinsons Disease (PD). GBA-PD patients are a genetic subpopulation of PD carrying heterozygous mutations in GBA1. Additionally, bi-allelic mutations in GBA1 cause Gaucher Disease (GD), a lysosomal storage disorder. Loss of GCase activity, a lysosomal enzyme leads to the accumulation of lipid substrates, disrupting lipid homeostasis and promoting cellular toxicity. Here, we report an AAV-mediated GBA1 replacement strategy to treat GD and GBA-PD by a one-time infusion via intravenous (GD Type 1) or intra-CSF (GBA-PD) route of administration. We engineered human GCase to be readily secretable to facilitate broad cross-correction. We developed CBE (conduritol {beta}-epoxide) induced lipid accumulation models to assess efficacy in mice and non-human primates (NHPs) to assess efficacy of our engineered constructs. Based on data across species, across different routes of administration, we nominated AAV.GMU01 SS3-GBA1 as our lead candidate. SS3-GBA1 is robustly secreted, cross-corrected across tissues and promotes lipid clearance. By comparing human GCase levels in AAV-treated NHP brains to healthy human donor brains, we demonstrate that AAV.GMU01 SS3-GBA1 replenishes the GCase deficit seen in GBA-PD patients, thus, restoring GCase to near-physiological levels Importantly, AAV.GMU01 SS3-GBA1 is well-tolerated with no adverse findings. Collectively, we establish a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of Gaucher Disease and GBA-PD with a single gene therapy product.

"Peptides are desirable therapeutics due to their inherent potency, safety, cost-effectiveness and ability to engage large or more complex protein surfaces. Slower kinetics of protein-peptide (un)binding can directly influence their drug efficacy and duration of action, in part by improving plasma stability of the peptide. The CLR:RAMP1 complex and its endogenous agonist peptide CGRP are of particularly high interest because of their central role in migraine pathophysiology. A better understanding of peptide binding mechanisms is needed for the development of next-generation peptide-based drugs with optimized kinetic properties. In this study, we comparatively analyze constructs of native CGRP and ""ssCGRP"", an engineered variant with 430-fold longer residence time on the CLR:RAMP1 complex. Using large-scale computational resources and our high-dimensional weighted-ensemble algorithm, we then thoroughly sample and compare unbinding path ensembles for the two peptides. This elucidates the basis of the engineered residence time enhancement for ssCGRP and provides a detailed view of the intra- and intermolecular stabilizing interactions for both peptides in the bound ensemble and along the unbinding transition path. The bias-free nature of the sampling approach in combination with Markov state modeling allows for the calculation of committor values and the first analysis of protein-peptide binding transition state ensembles. Through analysis of the unbinding committor, we find that ssCGRP(27-37) also demonstrates enhanced ligand recapture of intermediate unbinding conformations and samples a more heterogeneous bound-state ensemble that entropically stabilizes the bound basin. This study shows the molecular determinants of peptide residence time at CLR:RAMP1 and provides valuable insight for the design of long-acting peptide therapeutics."
"Recent advancements in single-cell sequencing and spatial omics technologies have enhanced our understanding of diverse cellular identities, compositions, architectures, and functions. However, the single-cell three-dimensional (3D) organization of the epigenome is still not well understood, due to an absence of spatial single-cell methods that allow high-resolution, locus-specific detection of combinations of epigenetic marks while maintaining the 3D organization of the genome. Here, we develop Epigenetic Proximity Hybridization Reaction (Epi-PHR), a non-disruptive image-based single-cell spatial epigenetic profiling technology. Epi-PHR enables locus-specific and high-resolution in situ detection of combinations of epigenetic marks at hundreds of single gene targets within the same individual cells, while retaining the 3D organization of the genome. Dual-mark Epi-PHR in hippocampus tissue sections revealed region-specific epigenetic profiles. Phased Epi-PHR combined with chromatin tracing simultaneously detects allele-specific epigenetic states and chromatin conformations of a paternally imprinted Meg3 gene cluster in single cells, revealing associations between specific epigenetic mark enrichment and chromatin folding features for the distinct alleles from different parental origins. Surprisingly, we found that H3K9me3 abundance is positively associated with a chromatin domain boundary at the Meg3 locus among maternal copies. We expect Epi-PHR will be broadly applicable in research requiring single-cell spatial epigenetic information, and will help extend our understanding of the combinatorial epigenetic code and its relationship with chromatin organization."
"Background: T cell activation induces substantial changes in gene expression by rapidly increasing transcription and translation. Additionally, microRNAs play a crucial role in regulating protein expression in T cell physiology, adding a layer of complexity by fine-tuning protein levels. While various miRNAs have been implicated in T cell function, a systematic analysis of differentially expressed miRNAs during early T cell activation and identification of their mRNA targets remains mostly unknown. Results: We investigated dynamic changes in global gene expression during early T cell activation using a multi-omics approach combining small RNA-seq, mRNA-seq and ribosome profiling. Our results show that most differential expression changes occur by 5 hours post-activation, with translational upregulation predominating over downregulation. From 5 to 12 hours, we observed modest transcriptional and translational reprogramming. We identified 9 miRNAs that are differentially expressed (DE) during early activation, with most changes occurring as early as 5 hours. We calculated translation efficiency (TE) and classified genes based on changes in both mRNA abundance and ribosome-protected fragments (RPFs). By integrating TE and miRNA expression data, we examined the relationship between TE group- specific regulation patterns and the number of miRNA binding sites. Interestingly, rather than observing a uniform downregulation of targets with 4 or more predicted DE miRNA binding sites, we found distinct regulatory patterns that varied with both activation time point and TE category. Conclusions: Our data provide new insights into how genes associated with key events in T cell activation such as translation, cell proliferation, and immune signaling are regulated at both the transcriptional and translational levels. The observation that most regulatory changes occur within the first 5 hours post-activation highlights the rapid and coordinated nature of T cell responses. The differential patterns of target regulation, based on translation efficiency groups and miRNA binding site density, suggest a context-dependent role for miRNAs in shaping protein output. Future experiments will be required to functionally validate specific miRNA--target interactions and to explore their relevance in primary T cells in vivo. This study also lays the groundwork for identifying miRNA-based regulatory circuits for therapeutic modulation of T cell activity."
"Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is the most common childhood muscular disorder. Mitochondrial dysfunctions are key disease features of the disease, and strategies that improve mitochondrial health have emerged as promising to slow disease progression. Emerging evidence indicates that impaired/insufficient mitophagy may contribute to the accumulation of mitochondrial dysfunction seen in patients and animal models of DMD. We therefore hypothesized that overexpressing Parkin, a key mitophagy regulator, may improve mitochondrial and muscle health in a mouse model of DMD. To this end, Parkin was overexpressed using intramuscular injections of adeno-associated viruses performed in 5-week-old and 18-week-old D2.B10-Dmdmdx/J mice (D2.mdx), a widely used mouse model of DMD. Four and 16 weeks of Parkin overexpression initiated in 5-week-old and 18-week-old D2.mdx, respectively, resulted in muscle hypertrophy, as indicated by an increase in muscle mass and fiber cross-sectional area. While Parkin overexpression did not impact maximal mitochondrial respiration or mitochondrial content, it increased the Acceptor Control Ratio, an index of mitochondrial bioenergetic efficiency. Parkin overexpression also decreased mitochondrial H2O2 emission, a surrogate for mitochondrial ROS production. However, Parkin overexpression failed to reduce the proportion of fibers with central nuclei and markers of muscle damage and/or necrosis. Taken all together, our results indicate that Parkin overexpression can attenuate muscle atrophy, improve mitochondrial bioenergetics and lower mitochondrial ROS production in a mouse model of DMD. These findings showcase the partial beneficial effects of overexpressing Parkin in ameliorating some, but not all, pathological features observed in a mouse model of DMD."
"The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) is a standardized international medical terminology widely used in databases that collect adverse event data for drugs. MedDRA employs a hierarchical structure, allowing for analysis at different levels of granularity. However, as the volume of adverse event data continues to grow, and given MedDRAs complexity, it becomes increasingly challenging to analyze, and visualize the information effectively. To address this, PharmAverse was developed, an interactive dashboard designed to facilitate the analysis and visualization of adverse event data using MedDRA terms. It offers three main views: Adverse Events, Drug, and Target."

"Physics-based simulators for neuromechanical control of virtual animals have the potential to significantly enhance our understanding of intricate structure-function relationships in neuromuscular systems, their neural activity and motor control. However, a key challenge is the accurate prediction of the forces that muscle fibers produce based on their complex patterns of electrical activity (""spike trains"") while preserving model simplicity for broader applicability. In this study, we present a chemomechanical, three-dimensional finite-element muscle model - JiSuJi (pronounced ji su j[i], meaning ""ultrafast muscle"" in Chinese) - that efficiently and accurately predicts muscle forces from naturalistic spike trains. The models performance is validated against songbird vocal muscles, a particularly fast and therefore challenging muscle type. Our results demonstrate that JiSuJi accurately predicts both isometric and non-isometric muscle forces across a variety of naturalistic neural activity patterns. JiSuJi furthermore outperforms state-of-the-art muscle simulators for accuracy, while maintaining computational efficiency. Simulating muscle behavior offers a promising approach for investigating the underlying mechanisms of neuro-muscular interactions and precise motor control, especially in the fast-contracting muscles of animal model systems."
"Antibodies play a crucial role in adaptive immunity. They develop as B cell receptors (BCRs): membrane-bound forms of antibodies that are expressed on the surfaces of B cells. BCRs are refined through affinity maturation, a process of somatic hypermutation (SHM) and natural selection, to improve binding to an antigen. Computational models of affinity maturation have developed from two main perspectives: molecular evolution and language modeling. The molecular evolution perspective focuses on nucleotide sequence context to describe mutation and selection; the language modeling perspective involves learning patterns from large data sets of protein sequences. In this paper, we compared models from both perspectives on their ability to predict the course of antibody affinity maturation along phylogenetic trees of BCR sequences. This included models of SHM, models of SHM combined with an estimate of selection, and protein language models. We evaluated these models for large human BCR repertoire data sets, as well as an antigen-specific mouse experiment with a pre-rearranged cognate naive antibody. We demonstrated that precise modeling of SHM, which requires the nucleotide context, provides a substantial amount of predictive power for predicting the course of affinity maturation. Notably, a simple nucleotide-based convolutional neural network modeling SHM outperformed state-of-the-art protein language models, including one trained exclusively on antibody sequences. Furthermore, incorporating estimates of selection based on a custom deep mutational scanning experiment brought only modest improvement in predictive power. To support further research, we introduce EPAM (Evaluating Predictions of Affinity Maturation), a benchmarking framework to integrate evolutionary principles with advances in language modeling, offering a road map for understanding antibody evolution and improving predictive models."
"New World hantaviruses cause severe infections in humans, with case fatality rates approaching 40%. Previous structural studies have advanced our understanding of hantavirus glycoprotein architecture and function, however, the lack of high-resolution in situ structures of the glycoprotein tetramer and its lattice organization has limited mechanistic insights into viral assembly, entry, and antigenicity. Here, we leveraged a virus-like particle (VLP) system to establish a cryo-electron microscopy workflow for lattice-forming viral glycoproteins. This enabled the determination of a 2.35 A resolution structure of the membrane-embedded Andes virus (ANDV) glycoprotein tetramer, as well as structures of dimers of tetramers and a complex with antibody ADI-65534. These structures reveal previously uncharacterized features of glycoprotein organization, stability, and pH-sensing. Immunization of mice with self-amplifying replicon RNA (repRNA) encoding ANDV-VLPs elicited high levels of glycoprotein-binding antibodies but equivalent titers of neutralizing antibodies compared to repRNA-encoded native ANDV glycoprotein complex. Collectively, these findings advance our understanding of hantavirus glycoprotein assemblies and their function, laying a foundation for structure-based vaccine design efforts."
The ability to specifically degrade one protein in a cell provides an immediate insight into any resulting phenotype and thus function that may be occluded by secondary effects using other techniques. The auxin inducible degron is a method developed to achieve this end and is effective in mammalian and yeast cells. The approach is dependent on the recognition of a tagged target protein by an endogenous E3 ubiquitin ligase modified by the expression of a plant F-box protein. This approach was initially unsuccessful in trypanosomes probably due to a lack of interaction between the endogenous E3 ubiquitin ligase and the plant F-box protein. This was overcome by expressing the entire rice E3 ubiquitin ligase in trypanosomes and here we describe the production of the auxin inducible degron competent cell lines and tagging of target genes.
"High occupancy target (HOT) regions, genomic sites bound by many transcription factors, are found across eukaryotes, but their regulatory roles remain unclear. In Caenorhabditis elegans, transcription primarily relies on promoter-proximal elements, and HOT regions frequently coincide with constitutively active promoters. Examining the dlg-1 locus, we identify a putative HOT region essential for embryonic expression. A small sequence within this region, far upstream of the transcription start site, is essential for dlg-1 transcriptional levels. In addition, the first intron modestly enhances transcription. These findings reveal that HOT regions in non-canonical positions can play critical roles in gene regulation in C. elegans."
"DNA methylation (DNAm), capturing biological gestational age (GA) and epigenetic gestational age acceleration (EGAA), can be modified by environmental exposures. The Asthma&Allergy array is a new DNAm array developed with content focused on asthma and allergy loci. The association between content on the Asthma&Allergy array and chronological GA and EGAA has not been evaluated alone or in the context of perinatal exposures. We performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) based on chronological GA at single CpG sites and regions. We further constructed a multi-CpG site methylation model to predict chronological GA in cord blood from 391 newborn children from a Detroit-based birth cohort. Associations between perinatal environmental factors with GA, epigenetic gestational age (EGA), and EGAA were assessed. We identified 2,435 CpG sites associated with chronological GA. HLA class II (HLA-DRB1,HLA-DQB1,HLA-DRB6) were the most significantly associated with chronological GA. Our multi-CpG site model attained predictive accuracy (cross-validated Pearson correlation=0.75) comparable to other EGA methods. Using genes implicated in region-based analyses (n=395 regions), the pathways most significantly enriched with chronological GA-associated CpGs included T helper 1(Th1) and 2(Th2) activation, macrophage classical activation, and IL10 signaling, which were also enriched in at least one of the other published epigenetic clocks. In multi-exposure models, prenatal indoor pet exposure and unplanned C-section were associated with EGA deceleration, while infant first-born status was associated with EGAA. Our findings highlight enrichment for T cell modulated pathways and antigen presentation as biological processes enriched in chronological GA, as well as novel perinatal factors that may impact EGAA."
"The Information System on Wildlife Health (SISS-Geo) is a free platform designed for the real-time collection of georeferenced data on wildlife health and environmental conditions via mobile devices. It serves as a collaborative tool, enabling health professionals, researchers, environmental managers, and the general public to report information about wildlife health occurrences directly within the system. Since its launch in 2014, SISS-Geo has been successfully applied in supporting decision-making during significant wildlife health events in Brazil. In this paper, we introduce a dynamic alert system based on a Multi-Attribute Zoonotic Alert Index (Z-Alert) to enhance disease outbreak detection and response in wildlife. The proposed approach improves the current alert system of the SISS-Geo platform by integrating clustering techniques with multi-objective optimization. The clustering stage allows to group SISS-Geo records in a way that reflects both spatial and temporal variations, capturing relevant patterns for epidemiological surveillance. Each identified cluster is assigned a numerical alert index, the Z-Alert index, reflecting its criticality level, based on optimally weighted attributes such as the percentage of dead animals, temporal interval, and geographical spread. The system offers customization alert thresholds, allowing health managers to adapt the alert system to their specific needs. To validate the model, we used historical yellow fever case data from Brazils Ministry of Health, achieving over 94% accuracy in identifying critical clusters. By enabling the prioritization of prevention and investigation actions, the system strengthens the responsiveness of health managers, optimizing resource allocation and promoting smart economic strategies for outbreak containment."

"Formalizing protocols used in wetlab biological research as programs improves reproducibility by making protocols replicable and standardized. However, existing protocol languages have limited capacity for codifying error sources and standardizing error handling. When protocols inevitably go wrong, debugging must still be done by technicians, a process which is challenging for unfamiliar protocols and a scalability constraint in automated facilities. We introduce OO_SCPLOWOPSC_SCPLOW, a programming language for describing biological protocols along with how they can fail. OO_SCPLOWOPSC_SCPLOW makes expression of how errors affect outcomes concise through probabilistic semantics, an extensible abstraction of the lab, and metaprogramming. Given an outcome, OO_SCPLOWOPSC_SCPLOW enables analyses of what errors occurred by mapping lab observations to enforced program conditions and applying existing probabilistic inference algorithms. We formalize a collection of molecular cloning protocols and present case studies demonstrating how OO_SCPLOWOPSC_SCPLOW can explain errors and assess diagnostic capabilities."
"Human brain charts provide unprecedented opportunities for decoding neurodevelopmental milestones and establishing clinical benchmarks for precision brain medicine. However, current lifespan brain charts are primarily derived from European and North American cohorts, with Asian populations severely underrepresented. Here, we present the first population-specific brain charts for China, developed through the Chinese Lifespan Brain Mapping Consortium (Phase I) using neuroimaging data from 43,037 participants (aged 0-100 years) across 384 sites nationwide. We establish the lifespan normative trajectories for 296 structural brain phenotypes, encompassing global, subcortical, and cortical measures. Cross-population comparisons with Western brain charts (based on data from 56,339 participants aged 0-100 years) reveal distinct neurodevelopmental patterns in the Chinese population, including prolonged cortical and subcortical maturation, accelerated cerebellar growth, and earlier development of sensorimotor regions relative to paralimbic regions. Crucially, these Chinese-specific charts outperform Western-derived models in predicting healthy brain phenotypes and detecting pathological deviations in Chinese clinical cohorts. These findings highlight the urgent need for diverse, population-representative brain charts to advance equitable precision neuroscience and improve clinical validity across populations."
"Movement disorders, like Parkinson's disease, happen because of unusual patterns in the connections between the cortex and basal ganglia, often caused by timing issues in feedback pathways. This study uses a two-delay nonlinear dynamic model, based on the delayed the van der Pol oscillator, to examine how delays in the feedback loops of the direct and indirect basal ganglia pathways lead to unusual movement patterns and resonance. A thorough analysis of resonance looks at how the ratios of delays and the time it takes to respond affect the system's frequency, showing when internal resonance occurs and how frequency stabilizes under different conditions. We examine how stable the system is by looking at changes in its behavior and measuring the Lyapunov exponent across distinct types of nonlinear feedback setups. Simulations demonstrate transitions from stable oscillations to chaos with varying delays and saturation strength. Our results reproduce symptoms of Parkinson's disease, such as resting tremor, dyskinesia, and freezing, demonstrating how delayed inhibition or hyperactivity destabilizes motor function. The discussion supports these findings, indicating that early problems start in the striatum, with complex effects in the globus pallidus that worsen motor symptoms. This model explains the temporal evolution of Parkinson's disease symptoms and highlights the timing of feedback and saturation as key therapeutic targets. Overall, this research offers a biological explanation for motor problems caused by delays and supports novel approaches for brain stimulation using flexible methods."
"The urban landscape acts as a novel habitat providing opportunities for certain species. However, populations of these so-called urban winners are constantly exposed to environmental contaminants, among which mercury (Hg) is perceived as a significant health concern for both wildlife and humans. While absorption of Hg is primarily related to its environmental level, it could be theoretically mitigated by near-natural habitats that have persisted within the urban landscape. Here, we investigated this hypothesis using three sympatric corvids as a model - Magpie Pica pica, Jackdaw Corvus monedula and Rook Corvus frugilegus. Total Hg concentrations were identified in the feathers (in the shafts and barbs separately) of each species collected in their breeding territories located along the urbanization gradient of Krakow (Poland). These concentrations were then correlated with particulate matter emissions (PM10) and habitat features (green and grey infrastructure) measured in the territories where the feathers had been collected. We expected that Hg concentrations in feathers would increase with increasing local pollutant emissions but decrease with increasing areas of green infrastructure, i.e. natural or semi-natural vegetation. Mean Hg concentrations in both feather shafts and barbs differed between the species. Magpie showed the highest concentrations (0.621 +-0.442 SD mcg/g in barbs), followed by Jackdaw (0.441 +-0.272 mcg/g) and Rook (0.296 +-0.134 mcg/g). A generalized linear model yielded a correlation between habitat composition and Hg concentration only for Jackdaw feather shafts. A generalized additive model, however, revealed a non-linear relationship between PM10 emissions and Hg concentrations in feather barbs and/or shafts of Jackdaw and Magpie (but not Rook). Hg concentrations initially increased, but then fell with increasing PM10 emissions; these relationships were not influenced by habitat features. In conclusion, we found no evidence that Hg contamination was mitigated by urban green infrastructure."
"Combinatorial pathway optimization is an important tool for industrial metabolic engineering to improve titer, yield, or productivity of strains. Machine learning has been increasingly applied on many aspects of the Design-Build-Test-Learn (DBTL) cycle, an engineering framework that aims to navigate through the large landscape of theoretically possible designs using an iterative approach. While machine learning-assisted recommendation strategies have been successfully used to optimize strains, they have so far been limited to relatively small design spaces with few targeted elements. This small design space may limit key strengths of these approaches, such as strong predictive capabilities of supervised machine learning and exploration-exploitation schemes widely used in reinforcement learning and Bayesian optimization. In this work, two DBTL cycles are performed on Saccharomyces cerevisiae for p-coumaric acid production. We first perform a large library transformation on eighteen genes with twenty promoters, which expands the size of the combinatorial design space significantly (approximately 170 million configurations), followed by a smaller model-guided recommendation round. We use a machine learning-assisted recommendation strategy, based on the gradient bandit algorithm, parametrized to balance exploration and exploitation. We show that our recommendation strategy has a better performance than strain recommendation strategy using greedy strategies, such as feature importance-based methods. While balancing between exploration and exploitation has been shown to be important in many applications, we provide the first direct experimental illustration of this effect by recommending strains for scenarios with increasing exploitative-ness. A clear effect of the exploration-exploitation scenario on the p-coumaric acid production distribution of strains is observed, where a balanced scenario shows a higher variation in production over an exploratory or exploitative scenario. Interestingly, using an alternative top-producing parent strain with this balanced exploration-exploitation scheme gives the highest p-coumaric acid production, suggesting that model predictions outside of the training data distribution can still be used to perform successful strain recommendation. Overall, these results suggest that using machine learning-assisted strategies with balanced exploration-exploitation can be used to efficiently explore large combinatorial design spaces. The best engineered strain shows an increase in p-coumaric acid production of 137% over the parent strains and a 0.07g/g yield on glucose."
"Cluster analysis is a widely used unsupervised learning technique in genomic data analysis, with critical applications such as inferring genetic population structures and annotating cell types from single-cell RNA-seq data. However, most existing clustering methods focus on identifying a single optimal partition while overlooking intrinsic relationships among the inferred clusters. Moreover, clustering results produced by different algorithms often appear inconsistent, and there is a lack of principled approaches to extract shared, biologically meaningful patterns across diverse clustering outputs. In this work, we introduce a computational framework that enables systematic exploration of multi-resolution clustering structures in genomic data, starting from an initial configuration generated by any available clustering algorithm. The proposed algorithm provides a unified and principled approach for uncovering complex, nested biological relationships and reconciling discrepancies among clustering results. We demonstrate the utility of our framework through comprehensive simulations and applications to both genetic and single-cell transcriptomic datasets, highlighting its ability to recover interpretable and reproducible clustering structures. Furthermore, we show that our multi-resolution cluster analysis of complex genomic data yields valuable insights into patterns of human population migration and cell differentiation trajectories."
"Soil probiotics are indispensable in agro-ecosystem, which enhances crop yield through nutrient solubilization, pathogen suppression, and soil structure improvement. However, reliable prediction methods for soil probiotics remain absent. In this study, we utilize genomic foundation models to generate representations from samples sequences, and then, enhance them by deeply integrating domain-specific engineered features. The enhanced representations enable training a powerful classifier for a target task, instead of common parameter fine-tuning. Inspired by the stacking ensemble learning framework, we also design a stacked aggregation classifier. It predicts the label of a sample with only leveraging partial sequence segments from this sample, effectively addressing the challenges in processing long sequences. The proposed method is applied on prediction of soil probiotics and obtains 97.50% accuracy and 0.9807 AUC value on balanced and imbalanced test sets, respectively. Potential functional genes are revealed from the predicted probiotics, providing biologically insights for more related studies."
"Tissue-resident monocyte-lineage cell (TRMC) are an extravascular population distinct from circulating monocytes and synovial macrophages and are critical for the development of inflammatory arthritis. However, the precise identities and origins of TRMC subpopulations remain unclear. Here, we characterize the ontogeny of TRMC, which are comprised of bone-marrow (BM)-derived and an embryonic, long-lived population. Furthermore, we identified three TRMC subpopulations, distinguished by expression of TIM4, CX3CR1, and MHCII. Clodronate-laden liposome reduces the number of TRMC but does not impact the proportions or transcriptional profile of TRMC subpopulations at 7 days post administration. TIM4+CX3CR1+ and TIM4+ TRMC represent long-lived population, whereas MHCII+ TRMC are BM-derived and dependent on Ccr2 during steady state. BM-derived TRMC expand and replenish the TIM4+CX3CR1+ and TIM4+ TRMC compartments throughout the peak and plateau of inflammatory arthritis. These findings underscore the importance heterogeneity within TRMC and highlight their distinct responses to synovial disruption and potential roles in rheumatoid arthritis (RA)."
"Myeloid cells, including dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages, are essential for establishing central tolerance in the thymus by promoting T cell clonal deletion and regulatory T cell (Treg) generation. Previous studies suggest that the thymic DC pool consists of plasmacytoid DC (pDC), XCR1+ DC1 and SIRPalpha+ DC2. Yet the precise origin, development, and homeostasis, particularly of DC2, remain unresolved. Using single-cell transcriptomics and lineage-defining mouse models we identify nine major populations of thymic myeloid cells and describe their lineage identities. What was previously considered to be DC2 is actually composed of 4 distinct cell lineages. Amongst these are monocyte-derived DCs (moDC) and monocyte derived macrophages (moMac), which are dependent on thymic interferon to upregulate MHCII and CD11c. We further demonstrate that conventional DC2 undergo intrathymic maturation through CD40 signaling. Finally, amongst DC2 we identify a novel thymic population of CX3CR1+ transitional DC (tDC), which represent transendothelial DCs positioned near thymic microvessels. Together, these finding reveal the thymus as a niche for diverse, developmentally distinct myeloid cells and elucidate their specific requirements for development and maturation."
"During early stages of development of cerebral organoids, budding neuroepithelia display striking changes in size and morphology, occurring very rapidly. Whilst mechanical forces mediated by cadherin-cadherin junctions are known to control the assembly, maturation and stability of epithelia, little is known of the mechanical context associated with neuroepithelial organoid development. In this report, we demonstrate a rapid translocation of YAP to budding neuroepithelial apical junctions, suggesting the build-up of strong compressive forces early on in their development. To study the mechanics of budding rosettes, we designed oil microdroplets stabilised by protein nanosheets displaying cadherin receptors, able to engage with receptors presented by neighbouring neuroepithelial cells, to integrate into embryoid bodies and developing organoids. The resulting artificial cells are able to sustain the formation of mature junctions with neighbouring cells and lead to the recruitment of tight junction maturation proteins such as ZO1. During early budding of neuroepithelial rosettes, artificial cells are found to be rapidly expelled from the developing organoids, further evidencing apical compressive forces. These forces are not opposed by sufficiently strong shear forces from neighbouring cells, or adhesive forces maintaining anchorage to the apical junction, to induce deformation of artificial cells."
"Understanding the divergence of cultural traits, such as bird song, provides critical insights into evolutionary processes. In geographically isolated populations, the divergence of traits associated with mate choice can lead to further genetic separation. This study investigates divergence in song syllable types, acoustic characteristics, singing behavior, and morphology in two allopatric populations of Darwin's cactus finch (Geospiza scandens) on Floreana and Santa Cruz Islands in the Galapagos Archipelago. Using song recordings of 50 males, we identified 25 syllable types with no overlap between islands, indicating a complete divergence in syllable repertoires. Syllables of Floreana and Santa Cruz males diverged in the acoustic space largely due to broader frequency bandwidths on Floreana. Moreover, Floreana males had smaller beaks than Santa Cruz males. Despite acoustic and morphological divergence, singing behaviors - like syllable repetition rate and number of syllables per song - did not differ significantly. Both cultural processes, including drift and transmission biases, as well as selection on morphology could have contributed to the observed acoustic divergence. This study adds to a growing literature on the role of geographic separation in the accumulation of both cultural and morphological divergence between populations. Future research could interrogate speciation scenarios in cactus finches if populations cease to interbreed after secondary contact."
"Single-cell RNA sequencing has revolutionized cellular biology, with atlases now encompassing over 100 million cells. However, researchers employ vastly different naming conventions when annotating cell types, creating a fragmented landscape that severely impedes data integration and comparative analysis. Here, we present CellOntologyMapper, an automated framework that standardizes cell type annotations by intelligently mapping user-defined names to established Cell Ontology and Cell Taxonomy identifiers. Our approach leverages advanced natural language processing, including sentence transformers and large language models, to interpret diverse naming conventions and resolve them to standardized ontological terms. The system handles complex challenges including abbreviated cell names, synonym resolution, and context-dependent interpretation. We built a comprehensive query system based on 19,381 cell type entries from established Cell Ontology and Cell Taxonomy databases, which organize into 24 biologically coherent clusters. Systematic validation across datasets spanning different scales from 17-cell-type lung studies to 91-cell-type immune atlases and complex developmental systems consistently demonstrated robust performance and high accuracy. CellOntologyMapper successfully resolved annotation challenges across conventional tissue studies, rare cell populations, and developmentally intricate datasets rich in abbreviated nomenclature. By providing automated, scalable annotation harmonization, our framework enables researchers to leverage existing single-cell datasets while ensuring compatibility with future atlas efforts. When incorporated into publications, CellOntologyMapper enhances the credibility and reference value of cell type annotations, representing a crucial step toward an integrated single-cell genomics ecosystem."
"Computational protein design can create binders against targets of interest, but identifying binders with sufficient affinity still requires biochemical screening of many designs. In this work, we test flow-induced dispersion analysis (FIDA) as a method for screening binders in a time and cost-effective manner. FIDA uses Taylor dispersion analysis to determine the hydrodynamic radius of fluorescently labelled biomolecules and their complexes. Here, we use FIDA to assess the binding of RFdiffusion-designed protein binders against the small helical peptide ALFA-tag and the GK domain of PSD-95. Successful binders can be identified in a single measurement using heat-treated bacterial lysates allowing rapid identification of binders with high affinity, and thermostability. Subsequent titration experiments show micromolar affinities for ALFA-tag binders and nanomolar affinities for GK domain binders. The lack of immobilization, the minimal sample volume, and the compatibility with complex biological samples, positions FIDA as a valuable tool for the screening and characterization of computationally generated protein binders."
"Lubricin is a glycoprotein that is crucial for maintaining joint health by preventing joint wear by reducing joint friction in the boundary mode. Lubricin was recently observed to hinder the formation of uric acid crystals in the joint and prevent a form of gouty arthritis. However, despite lubricin's great physiological importance, our current understanding of the molecular origins of lubricin's beneficial properties is limited by a lack of detailed structural information regarding its central mucin domain: lubricin's large size (227.5 kDa) and numerous glycosylations pose a substantial obstacle to conventional experimental methods for solving protein structures. In this work, we employ a combination of physics-based replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulations and circular dichroism (CD) experiments to shed light on the structure of lubricin's central mucin domain. Using REMD, we model [KEPAPTTP]2, an amino acid repeat found throughout the mucin domain, and find that the mucin domain is likely to exhibit polyproline type II (PPII) helices, which are further stabilized by O-linked oligosaccharide chains. Motivated by these simulation results, we performed circular dichroism spectroscopy on fragments of the mucin domain that also show clear polyproline-II helical character, corroborating our computational findings. Altogether, this work provides strong evidence of a lubricin mucin domain with significant polyproline type II content. As polyproline helices are often also found in other glycoproteins with antifreeze properties, this work may also explain the atomistic underpinnings of their interfacial functions, including lubrication and competition with crystal formation."
"While specificity of biomolecular interactions is typically understood to require interactions involving ordered structures, several biomolecular condensates exhibit specificity in the absence of apparent structural order. We have previously shown that condensates composed of the disordered region of MED1 partition specific proteins, mediated by sequence patterns of charged amino acids on the disordered regions of both MED1 and the interacting partner. Whether this specificity is due to an unknown ordered-structure-mediated interaction or from the dynamic multivalent interactions between the patterned charged amino acids in the disordered regions was unresolved. Here we show that a polymer physics-based model that only accounts for multivalent interactions among polymers in a statistical manner can largely explain published data on selective partitioning and make predictions that are subsequently experimentally validated. These results suggest that the specificity of condensate composition is underpinned to a substantial extent by multivalent interactions in the context of conformational disorder."
"Amyloids, classically linked to neurodegenerative diseases, also play critical roles in infection and immunity. Phenol-soluble modulins (PSMs) from Staphylococcus aureus are virulent amyloids that contribute to cytotoxicity, immune modulation, and biofilm stability. PSM3 forms cross- amyloid fibrils and shares sequence and structural features with LL-37, a human host-defense peptide that assembles into -helical structures. Here, we uncover RNA as a potent, context-dependent modulator of their aggregation and activity. RNA consistently reduces LL-37's cytotoxicity toward human cells without compromising its antibacterial function, suggesting a selective host-protective mechanism. In contrast, RNA preserves PSM3's cytotoxic and antimicrobial activity over time, likely by promoting liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and stabilizing bioactive fibrillar polymorphs, enabling S. aureus to fine-tune its virulence strategies. At higher concentrations, RNA drives both peptides toward distinct aggregated states, amorphous for LL-37 and fibrillar for PSM3, underlying their divergent functional outcomes. The amyloid inhibitor EGCG abolishes the bioactivity of both PSM3 and LL-37, overriding RNA's modulatory effects. Together, our findings establish RNA as a key modulator of both virulent amyloids and host-defense peptides, with broad implications for microbial immune evasion, innate immunity, and amyloid-associated diseases. Moreover, they highlight phase transitions as a tunable mechanism for regulating peptide bioactivity and a promising therapeutic target across infectious and neurodegenerative conditions."
"Super-resolution imaging has gained significant traction in recent years due to its unprecedented ability to visualize target biomolecules at nanometer resolution. Here, we demonstrate the capability to detect target pairs that are in close proximity by exploiting base-stacking interactions between two DNA strands, each labelling one target. Our DNA probes hybridize transiently with the each other only when both target molecules are proximal, thus creating a hybridization site for fluorophore-conjugated DNA strand, called imager. In this design, hybridization and co-axial base-stacking act synergistically to enable imager binding, with stacking interactions providing essential stabilization that allows for transient hybridization. This synergy generates the stochastic binding events required for DNA-PAINT imaging, which we call Stack-Proximity-PAINT (Stack-pPAINT). To gain mechanistic insights into hybridization of our probe, we performed atomistic equilibrium and steered molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The simulations reveal that DNA base-stacking and fluorophore stacking together stabilize the imager. We utilized programmable DNA nanostructures to benchmark the applicability of Stack-pPAINT. As a cellular proof of concept, we visualized microtubular structures using Stack-pPAINT with antibodies targeting both alpha- and beta-tubulin molecules. This probe technology offers promising applications in cell biology research aimed at elucidating spatial interactomes at high resolution within cells."
"We present improved k-means clustering initialization strategies for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, implemented as part of the N-ary Natural Initiation (NANI) method. Two new deterministic seeding strategies: strat_all and strat_reduced, extend the original NANI approaches and dramatically reduce the clustering runtime while preserving the quality of clustering results. These methods also preserve NANI's reproducible partitioning of well-separated and compact clusters while avoiding the costly iterative seed selection procedures of previous implementations. Testing on the beta-heptapeptide and the HP35 systems shows that these new flavors achieved Calinski-Harabasz (CH) and Davies-Bouldin (DB) scores comparable to the previous NANI variant, indicating that the efficiency gains come with no quality decrease. We also show how this new variant can be used to greatly speed up our previously proposed Hierarchical Extended Linkage Method (HELM). These enhancements extend the reach of NANI to accelerate large-scale MD analysis both in stand-alone k-means clustering and as a component of hybrid workflows, and remove a key barrier to routine, scalable, and reproducible exploration of complex conformational ensembles. The improved NANI implementation is accessible through our MDANCE package: https://github.com/mqcomplab/MDANCE."
"Proteins engage in interactions with lipid membranes to facilitate important cellular processes that form the basis of healthy or sick biological conditions. Transmembrane proteins such as ion channels are often made up of bound monomers that engage in specific contacts within the bilayer. However, molecular mechanistic information related to how these channel structures form is scarce. Understanding the role of lipids in driving this process have the potential to close knowledge gaps regarding the assembly behavior of oligomeric proteins which are often clinical targets for disease treatment. Using the hepatitis C virus p7 hexamer as a case study, this work focuses on characterizing the interactions that dictate the beginnings of dimerization using molecular dynamics simulations. Results comparing dimers formed in aqueous solution to those at the surface of a lipid membrane model reveal that protein-lipid interactions are critical in aiding the proper alignment and binding of inter-protein residues. Hydrophobic protein-lipid interactions and hydrogen bonding of key residues to phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylinositol membrane lipids drive the characteristic inter-protein helix interactions that underlie p7 oligomerization. This increases favorable binding between hydrophobic protein residues, particularly for the first helix of the p7 monomers. This study provides evidence that membrane lipids are a necessary and dynamic factor that contributes to appropriate binding and association of proteins for channel formation within cellular membranes."
"Pathogen effectors play critical roles in pathogenesis by directly manipulating host cellular processes. The Ser/Thr protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is commonly targeted by pathogens. Effectors from devastating plant pathogen Phytophthora hijack the PP2A core enzyme in plant hosts, altering the host phosphoproteome. In this study, we present a series of cryo-electron microscopy structures of the Phytophthora effector PSR2 in complex with the host PP2A core enzyme to form a functional holoenzyme. The PSR2-PP2A complex adopts a unique hexameric architecture, driven by PSR2-mediated dimerization of two heterotrimers. This hexamer exhibits greater stability and features a more exposed catalytic pocket compared to the canonical trimeric form of PP2A, likely enhancing its virulence activity. Mutational analyses underscore the importance of this hexameric structure for PSR2's virulence function. These findings provide mechanistic insights into pathogen-mediated manipulation of a key host phosphatase and offer targets for developing disease resistance strategies."
"Extrachromosomal-circular DNA (eccDNA) are circular-DNA elements that are implicated in cellular processes such as genomic diversification and instability, along with other genomic mechanisms. However, their structure and chromatinization state is poorly understood. Here we identified a 358-bp circular micro-eccDNA molecule derived from the human Titin gene, which was selected for this study based on its size and sequence characteristics, and used atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to study its interaction with nucleosomes and corresponding topological state. We show the presence or absence of bound nucleosomes provides a topological switch between intact and denatured DNA."
"Future genetic devices expressed in microbes need to be tested in complex environments containing multiple organisms to expand their usability. We sought to determine if genetic parts designed for monoculture are predictable when used in co-culture by testing constitutive Anderson promoters driving expression of chromoproteins from a plasmid. In Escherichia coli monoculture a high copy number origin of replication causes stochastic expression regardless of promoter strength, and high Anderson promoter strength leads to selection for inactivating mutations, resulting in inconsistent chromoprotein expression. Medium and low strength Anderson promoters function more predictably in E. coli monoculture but experience an increase in inactivating mutations when grown in co-culture over many generations with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Expression from native promoters instead of Anderson promoters can lead to stable expression in a complex wastewater culture. Overall, we show intraspecies selection for inactivating mutations due to a competitive growth advantage for E. coli that do not express the genetic device compared to their peers that retain the functional device. We show additional interspecies selection against the functional device when E. coli is co-cultured with another organism. Together, these two selection pressures create a significant barrier to genetic device function in microbial communities that we overcome by utilize a native E. coli promoter. Future strategies for genetic device design in microorganisms that need to function in a complex microbial environment should focus on native promoters and/or strategies that give the microorganism carrying the device a selective or growth advantage.

ImportanceFirst generation biotechnology focused on genetic devices designed for use in monoculture conditions. Next generation biotechnology devices will need to function in complex ecosystems with other organisms, so we sought to create conditions where the genetic device retained function when the organism carrying it is in co-culture with other organisms. We discovered that when the genetic device is a significant resource burden on the organism carrying the device mutations will be selected for due to intraspecies and interspecies selection pressures and the device will be rendered non-functional. Therefore, genetic device design for complex ecosystems in next generation biotechnology needs to balance functionality of the genetic device with the need to reduce resource burden on the organism carrying it."
"The glycolipid transfer protein (GLTP) is linked to a multitude of cellular processes aside from its best-known function as a lipid transport protein. Based on previous research and hypotheses, it is for example proposed that it may also act as a sensor and regulator of glycolipid homeostasis in the cell, as expression levels of GLTP directly influence the cellular levels of many glycosphingolipid species. Furthermore, through its previously determined interaction with the ER membrane protein VAP-A (vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein A), GLTP may also be involved in facilitating or regulating vesicular transport in the cell. In this study, we propose a role of GLTP in regulating the COPII vesicle trafficking pathway and thereby indirectly regulating the glycosphingolipid homeostasis of the cell, by regulating the vesicular ceramide transport from the ER to the Golgi apparatus. We propose that the effect of GLTP expression levels on the glycolipid homeostasis is related to the observed effect of GLTP on vesicle trafficking; ceramide for GSL synthesis is likely primarily transferred from the ER to the Golgi through vesicular transport, and the observed effects of GLTP fit this hypothesis. The restriction of GLTP/VAP-A-interaction by GLTP-GSL binding may provide a regulatory mechanism. We also show that GLTP localizes to the nucleus of the cell at the onset of the S-phase of the cell cycle, an unexpected discovery which further complicates our understanding of the function of GLTP."
"Tear fluid comprises a diverse group of extracellular glycoproteins which are critical for ocular homeostasis. Within the tear fluid glycoproteome, lacritin is highly expressed and plays a key role in immune response, tear secretion, and antimicrobial activity. Importantly, glycosylation constitutes over 50% of lactritins molecular weight. However, despite this fact, nothing is known about the specific glycan structures on lacritin and how they influence its protein folding, function, or downstream biological processes. Similarly, it remains completely unknown whether alterations to lacritin glycans are correlated with ocular pathologies. To address this gap in knowledge, we harnessed mass spectrometry (MS) to conduct the first O-glycoproteomic study of tear fluid. Here, we report unprecedented coverage of lacritin glycosylation, detailing 19 O-glycosites bearing a myriad of glycan structures. Further, we leveraged Alphafold 3.0 and GlycoShape to visualize the impact of these glycans on its structure, demonstrating that O-glycosylation renders the protein backbone rigid and extended. Surprisingly, we also detected protein-level evidence of two lacritin spliceoforms, representing the first observation of these isoforms by MS. Simultaneously, we describe the most comprehensive characterization of the tear fluid glycoproteome to date, elucidating the glycosylation profile of Immunoglobulin A (IgA), lactoferrin, and other glycoproteins with demonstrated clinical relevance as diagnostic biomarkers. Overall, this study lays critical groundwork for future biochemical investigation of tear fluid glycoproteins and their application as diagnostic or therapeutic tools for ocular diseases."
"Despite advancements in oncology, multidrug resistance (MDR) mediated by P-glycoprotein (P-gp/ABCB1) remains a major barrier to chemotherapy. P-gp is an ATP-binding cassette transporter that undergoes nucleotide-driven structural rearrangements to efflux chemotherapeutics, but the mechanistic details of the substrate transport remain poorly resolved. Here, we performed high-throughput molecular dynamics to simulate P-gp in a lipid bilayer (totaling ~110 microseconds) to dissect nucleotide-dependent conformational changes across the transport cycle. Our adaptive sampling strategy reveals asymmetric nucleotide coordination at nucleotide-binding sites (NBS), which correlates with transmembrane domain (TMD) restructuring for substrate efflux. The experimentally unresolved flexible linker transiently forms up to five turn -helix that affects nucleotide binding domain (NBD) dimerization process. We identified conformation-dependent substrate/allocrite pathways including nucleotide-specific access routes, while TMD-linker interaction facilitates substrate access tunnel formation. Together, these pathways reveal that the concerted interplay of nucleotide occupancy, linker dynamics, and overall protein conformation governs the structural plasticity and broad substrate promiscuity of the substrate binding cavity in P-gp. By integrating these findings, this work bridges static structural data with dynamic functional insights to further our understanding of the P-gp substrate translocation cycle."
"Since its emergence in 1996, the H5 avian influenza virus (AIV) A/Goose/Guangdong/1/1996 (Gs/GD) haemagglutinin (HA) has evolved into over 30 genetically and antigenically distinct clades, including the widespread clade 2.3.4.4b. Vaccination is widely used in endemic regions to reduce poultry losses and zoonotic risk. However, the evolving antigenic diversity and global co-circulation of multiple clades challenges protective efficacy of poultry vaccines with poor antigenic matching to field strains, resulting in immune escape and vaccine failure. This study aimed to improve vaccine seed selection by identifying HA epitopes contributing to inter-clade antigenic differences. Recombinant clade-representative viruses were generated using HA genes from circulating H5 AIVs via reverse genetics with A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (PR8) internal and neuraminidase genes. Antigenic relationships were assessed using haemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays with homologous and heterologous chicken antisera. Antigenic cartography revealed a clear distinction of clade 2.3.4.4 from others and notable intra-clade diversity. Pairwise antigenic and genetic comparisons identified 48 putative antigenic residues. These were individually introduced into a candidate HA by site-directed mutagenesis, and antigenic influence assessed by HI using sera raised against the non-mutated HA. Four residues R82K, A83T, T204I, and F229Y had significant antigenic effects, with three (R82K, T204I, F229Y) being novel. These findings demonstrate that combining serology and in silico residue analysis can identify key antigenic determinants. This work highlights the need for precise antigenic matching in vaccine design and highlights the value of combining molecular and immunological tools to optimise vaccine seed selection against diverse and evolving H5 AIV strains."
"Echolocating bats routinely navigate complex wild environments with remarkable agility, yet it remains unclear whether their flight trajectories reflect reproducible internal control strategies or are merely the result of improvised reactive behavior. To address this question, we recorded flight paths and pulse emissions of Rhinolophus nippon and Miniopterus fuliginosus as they navigated seven obstacle-rich arenas in complete darkness. Using a machine learning model--a variational recurrent neural network (VRNN)--we show that bat flight is governed by a consistent internal policy. Trained on only part of each trajectory, our model accurately predicted future flight paths across arenas and individuals, preserving key features such as turning direction, obstacle-avoidance arcs, and velocity profiles. The models ability to faithfully reproduce species-specific strategies despite differences in sonar and flight morphology supports the existence of structured internal control in bat navigation. Our approach reveals that bat flight, while appearing improvisational, is in fact guided by internal policies that can be directly inferred from trajectory data, without relying on hand-crafted assumptions. Furthermore, the data-driven model developed here enables a priori testing of flight-path reorganization by virtually imposing environmental changes and analysing the resulting predicted trajectories, providing a powerful tool for biomimetic robotic design and for forecasting ecological responses to landscape transformation."
"The expansion of pathogen genome sequencing into routine disease surveillance programmes is set to bring rapidly-growing volumes of increasingly structured data on a global scale. This has the potential to deliver exciting opportunities for accelerating vaccine development and monitoring. Here we present an interactive platform, vaccines.watch (https://vaccines.watch), which aims to support decision-making around vaccine formulations and roll-out by enabling interrogation of vaccine target diversity from global genome data. We have initially focused on targets included in existing or prospective multivalent polysaccharide-based vaccines for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae (and related species) and Acinetobacter baumannii. The platform currently displays data for >100k high-quality genomes with geotemporal sampling information (post-2010), with new genomes assembled, analysed and incorporated on an ongoing basis (every 4 hours) as public data are newly deposited. Crucially, users can view vaccine target information in the broader context of genotypic variants (e.g. sequence types) and antimicrobial resistance markers. The platform also enables users to review the composite serotypes of pneumococcal vaccine formulations among the available genomes. For example, using data in vaccines.watch from 3 June 2025, we observed that serotypes included in the PCV13 and PCV21 formulations accounted for 36.2% (11,907/32,918) and 87.4% (28,764/32,918) of global public genomes, respectively. The platform also enables continuous review of the global genomic landscape of the included pathogens, enabling identification of gaps (e.g. in geographic coverage) that should be targeted with increased genomic surveillance. Indeed we demonstrate that substantial geographic gaps remain in the coverage of available genomes, with over half of countries contributing no genomes for each of the three pathogens. However, while caution in interpretation is important, as global representativeness of genome data grows, vaccines.watch is positioned to support different stages of the vaccine pipeline, from selection of target antigens to post-rollout monitoring of population changes."
"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with reduced cardiac output, which is correlated with increased symptomatic burden and declined quality of life. Predicting hemodynamic effects of AF remains challenging due to the complex interplay of multiple contributing mechanisms. Computational modeling offers a valuable tool for simulating hemodynamics. However, existing models are lacking the capabilities to both replicate beat-to-beat hemodynamic variations during AF while being well suited for fitting to clinical data. In this study, we present a computational model comprising: 1) an electrical subsystem that generates uncoordinated atrial and irregular ventricular activation times characteristic of AF, and 2) a mechanical subsystem that simulates hemodynamics using a reduced order model. The model was fitted to replicate individual hemodynamic measurements from 17 patients in the SMURF study during both normal sinus rhythm (NSR) and AF. The fitted model matched a large majority (75%) of blood pressure and intracardiac pressure measurements in both NSR and AF with absolute simulation errors well below 10mmHg. Furthermore, a large majority of left atrial and left ventricular ejection fraction measurements during NSR were matched with absolute simulation errors well below 10%. The model consistently underestimated right ventricular diastolic pressure during NSR while overestimating right ventricular systolic and mean left atrial pressures during AF. The presented approach of modeling atrial activity in AF as uncoordinated atrial contractions, rather than no atrial contraction, achieved lower overall absolute simulation errors when fitting to individual patients. This computationally efficient model provides a platform for future investigations of patient-specific hemodynamics during AF."
"Resolving the underlying mechanisms of complex brain functions and associated disorders remains a major challenge in neuroscience, largely due to the difficulty in mapping large-scale neural network dynamics with high temporal and spatial resolution. Multimodal neural platforms that integrate optical and electrical modalities offer a promising approach that surpasses resolution limits. Over the last decade, transparent graphene microelectrodes have been proposed as highly suitable multimodal neural interfaces. However, their fabrication commonly relies on the manual transfer process of pre-grown graphene sheets which introduces reliability and scalability issues. In this study, multilayer graphene microelectrode arrays (MEAs) with electrode sizes as small as 10-50 um in diameter, are fabricated using a transfer-free process on a transparent substrate for in vitro multimodal platforms. Through acute experiments using cerebellar brain slices, their ability to detect spontaneous extracellular spiking activity from neural cells, with a high signal-to-noise ratio up to 30-40 dB, is demonstrated. The recorded signal quality is found to be more limited by the electrode-tissue coupling than the MEA technology itself. Overall, this study shows the potential of transfer-free multilayer graphene MEAs to interface with neural tissue, which paves the way to advance neuroscientific research through the next-generation of multimodal neural interfaces."
"Immunity is a delicate balance between combating infection and preserving the metabolic functions vital for host survival. However, the mechanisms by which immune responses are coordinated with cellular metabolism remain largely unknown. Here, we show that NONEXPRESSER OF PR GENES 1 (NPR1), the central plant immune regulator of salicylic acid (SA)-mediated defense responses, is controlled by a cascade of posttranslational modifications (PTMs) involving two master nutrient-sensing kinases. Under normal growth conditions, TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN (TOR) inhibits NPR1 through phosphorylation at Ser 55/59. During defense responses, elevated SA enhances SNF1-RELATED KINASE 1 (SnRK1) activity, which in turn inhibits TOR signaling and phosphorylates NPR1 at Ser-557. This phosphorylation event activates NPR1 and facilitates its subsequent PTMs. Together, our results reveal an integral role of SA (the active metabolite of aspirin) in controlling central metabolic regulators SnRK1 and TOR to coordinate immune responses and growth through antagonistic modifications of NPR1."
"Human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSCs)-derived hepatocytes are widely used in regenerative medicine and disease modeling. However, existing protocols mainly produce fetal-like cells, limiting accurate modeling of liver functionality. Topoisomerase II (TOP2) and its transcription factor, forkhead box M1 (FOXM1), are silenced during late liver embryonic development; however, their roles in hepatocyte differentiation remain unclear. Here, we examined the effects of TOP2 and FOXM1 inhibition on the terminal differentiation of hepatocytes. We found that subtoxic TOP2 inhibition reduced nuclear chromatin condensation without causing DNA damage. RNA-seq analysis showed that TOP2 inhibition induced cell cycle arrest in a TOP2A-selective manner, with FOXM1 downregulation. ATAC-seq validation demonstrated that TOP2A inhibition decreases chromatin accessibility and modulates the Wnt/{beta}-catenin pathway. Proteomic analysis revealed that FOXM1 inhibition modulated TOP2A expression, replicated TOP2A-mediated cell cycle arrest, and reduced the levels of fetal hepatocyte proteins (HBG1/2, UGT2B7, and AFP). Prolonged FOXM1 inhibition is correlated with increased hepatocyte polyploidization, enhanced CYP450 activity, and improved lipid metabolism, suggesting a potential role in these processes. Overall, our findings suggest that FOXM1 inhibition significantly promotes the terminal differentiation of human iPSC-derived hepatocytes, indicating a potential role for FOXM1 and TOP2A in liver development, regeneration, and disease."
"Epigenetic regulatory mechanisms, which include histone modifications and DNA methylation, play a central role in development and aging. Dimethylation of H3K36, deposited mainly by the histone methyltransferase NSD1, occurs predominantly in intergenic regions and recruits the DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A to facilitate DNA methylation. Haploinsufficiency of NSD1 results in the overgrowth disorder Sotos syndrome in vivo, which is associated with aberrant DNA methylation signatures and an enhanced epigenetic age. To understand the mechanisms by which NSD1 may regulate development, differentiation and diseases, we generated human iPSC lines deficient in functional NSD1 (NSD1-KO). NSD1-KO cells exhibit a substrate-specific decrease in proliferation, reduced H3K36me2 levels and extensive DNA hypomethylation. Notably, the loss of functional NSD1 altered the differentiation potential of iPSCs, with aberrant endodermal and mesodermal lineage commitment. Further analysis revealed that NSD1 might drive endodermal differentiation by regulating the expression of an endodermal lncRNA HIDEN by mechanisms independent of the regulation of DNA methylation. Our NSD1-KO iPSC lines partially recapitulate the DNA methylation defects associated with NSD1-related disorders. Additionally, we uncovered a novel mechanism by which NSD1 may regulate endodermal differentiation of human iPSCs."
"Phenanthrene (PHE), as one of the most frequently found polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons can induce immunotoxicity, oxidative stress, and endocrine disruption in marine organisms. However, whether autophagy can be induced by PHE and the regulatory mechanism and cytoprotective roles of autophagy under PHE stress condition have not been unveiled. Our data first unveil a ""E3 ubiquitin ligases-NF-{kappa}B-autophagy"" axis, which play cytoprotective roles in Pacific oysters Crassostrea gigas exposed to PHE. The results of confocal laser scanning microscope, flow cytometry and transmission electron microscope confirmed that PHE could induce autophagy in the haemocytes of Pacific oysters, and the presence of autophagosomes was also confirmed. The proteomics results showed that the expression of the E3 ubiquitin ligase HUWE1, TRIM36, and autophagy-related protein 7 (ATG7) were significantly upregulated. The expression of genes of the ""axis"" were significantly upregulated, and the expression of genes of autophagy was downregulated after the inhibition of the NF-{kappa}B, indicating that the expression of the ""axis""-related genes can be stimulated by PHE, and thus autophagy is activated. The upregulation of the expression of ""axis""-related genes in mouse macrophages, further demonstrating the existence of the ""axis"" proposed by this study and the ""axis"" can be activated by PHE. Incorporating with changes of cell number, apoptosis rate, phagocytic capacity, and ROS levels of lymphocytes, we demonstrated that autophagy plays a cytoprotective role in cellular defence against PHE. This study proposed a novel pathway and supplied a comprehensive understanding of the protective role of autophagy in Pacific oysters to cope with pollutants."
"The actin cytoskeleton is dynamically remodelled by conserved regulators to control cellular and tissue mechanics. While the functions of these proteins are well studied, how they drive tissue-specific contractility remains unclear. Twinfilin, an actin uncapper and depolymerase, has not previously been linked to tissue contractility. Here, we show that the sole twinfilin ortholog in C. elegans, TWF-2, regulates actomyosin contractility in the spermatheca. TWF-2 localizes to the spermathecal cortex via interactions with -spectrin (SPC-1) and {beta}-spectrin (UNC-70). In vitro, TWF-2 promotes barbed-end depolymerization and rapidly removes CAP-1 from actin filaments. In vivo, embryonic lethality caused by CAP-1 depletion is partially rescued by simultaneous loss of TWF-2. Similarly, loss of the contractility regulator SPV-1 leads to elevated F-actin and phosphorylated myosin, causing hypercontractility. Notably, removing TWF-2 suppresses this hypercontractility by reducing F-actin levels-without affecting myosin or its phosphorylation-highlighting a specific role in F-actin regulation. Together, these findings show that TWF-2 modulates actin dynamics in a tissue-specific manner. This work provides the first in vivo evidence that twinfilin regulates contractility, and reveals how its interactions with capping protein and spectrins help maintain balanced actomyosin levels in the spermatheca."
"Centrioles are polarized microtubule-based structures with appendages at their distal end that are essential for cilia formation and function. The protein C2CD3 is critical for distal appendage assembly, with mutations linked to orofaciodigital syndrome and other ciliopathies. However, its precise molecular role in appendage recruitment remains unclear. Using Ultrastructure Expansion Microscopy (U-ExM), iterative U-ExM, and in situ cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET), we reveal that C2CD3 adopts a radially symmetric 9-fold organization within the centrioles distal lumen. We show that the C-terminal region of C2CD3 localizes close to a [~]100 nm luminal ring structure consisting of [~]27 nodes, while its N-terminal region localizes close to a hook-like structure that attaches to the A-microtubule as it extends from the centriole interior to exterior. This hook structure is adjacent to the DISCO complex (MNR/CEP90/OFD1), which marks future appendage sites. C2CD3 depletion disrupts not only the recruitment of the DISCO complex via direct interaction with MNR but also destabilizes the luminal ring network composed of C2CD3/SFI1/centrin-2/CEP135/NA14, as well as the distal microtubule tip protein CEP162. This reveals an intricate ""in-to-out"" molecular hub connecting the centriolar lumen, distal microtubule cap, and appendages. Although C2CD3 loss results in shorter centrioles and appendage defects, key structural elements remain intact, permitting continued centriole duplication. We propose that C2CD3 forms the luminal ring structure and extends radially to the space between triplet microtubules, functioning as an architectural hub that scaffolds the distal end of the centriole, orchestrating its assembly and directing appendage formation."
"Hypomorphic variants in the SEL1L-HRD1 ER-associated degradation (ERAD) complex have been linked to severe neurological syndromes in children, including neurodevelopmental delay, intellectual disability, motor dysfunction, and early death. Despite this association, its physiological importance and underlying mechanisms in neurons remain poorly understood. Here, we show that neuronal SEL1L-HRD1 ERAD is essential for maintaining one-carbon metabolism, motor function, and overall viability. Neuron-specific deletion of Sel1L in mice (Sel1LSynCre) resulted in growth retardation, severe motor impairments, and early mortality by 9 weeks of age, mirroring core clinical features observed in affected patients, despite preserved neuronal numbers and only modest ER stress. Multi-omics analyses, including single-nucleus RNA sequencing and metabolomics, revealed significant dysregulation of one-carbon metabolism in ERAD-deficient brains. This included activation of the serine, folate, and methionine pathways, accompanied by elevated levels of S-adenosylmethionine and related metabolites, likely resulted from induction of the integrated stress response (ISR). Together, these findings uncover a previously unappreciated role for neuronal SEL1L-HRD1 ERAD in coordinating ER protein quality control with metabolic adaptation, providing new insight into the molecular basis of ERAD-related neurodevelopmental disease."
"PurposeThis study investigates the prediction of endometrial cancer (EC) recurrence using MRI-based texture analysis and deep learning. EC recurrence remains a major clinical challenge, and accurate prognostic tools are needed. The study aims to identify significant imaging biomarkers for recurrence risk and evaluate the performance of a Faster R-CNN deep learning model in classifying recurrence-free survival (RFS) and recurrence (REC) groups.

Materials and MethodsA total of 112 patients with histopathologically confirmed EC who underwent pre-treatment MRI between 2009 and 2018 were included. MRI texture analysis was performed using histogram and gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) methods, analyzing perimeter, integrated density, entropy, and homogeneity. A Faster R-CNN deep learning model was trained and tested on five image subclasses, using 20,000 iterations to optimize performance. REC and RFS were classified based on clinical outcomes, and probability scores were calculated to define the REC score. Feature importance was assessed using a Random Forest model.

ResultsSignificant clinical predictors of recurrence included high-grade tumors, FIGO stage III-IV, and cervical invasion. Texture analysis revealed notable differences in perimeter, integrated density, contrast, entropy, and homogeneity between REC and RFS groups. Faster R-CNN achieved an average precision of 0.86 and an AUC of 0.61. Feature importance analysis identified area as the most significant factor, while REC_score was independent of texture-based parameters.

ConclusionMRI texture analysis combined with deep learning provides valuable predictive insights for EC recurrence. The study highlights the potential of integrating machine learning with imaging biomarkers for personalized risk assessment, offering a promising approach for improving EC patient management.."
"The lungs are the primary target of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV- 2), with the infection resulting in lung inflammation, pulmonary vascular leakage and diffuse alveolar damage. Polymerase delta-interacting protein-2 (Poldip2) mediates lung inflammation and vascular permeability after lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome; however, its role in regulating lung permeability, vascular inflammation and tissue damage following SARS-CoV-2 infection is completely unknown. Here, we assessed the role of Poldip2 in inflammation, immune cell infiltration and lung tissue damage in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our data shows that while deletion of Poldip2 does not affect the susceptibility to SARS- CoV-2 infection, mice heterozygous for Poldip2 exhibit reduced lung tissue damage, reduced cytokine and chemokine induction and decreased infiltration of myeloperoxidase (MPO)-positive neutrophils into inflamed lung tissue. These data reveal that Poldip2 depletion mitigates inflammation and immune cell infiltration following SARS-CoV-2 infection, highlighting the therapeutic potential of Poldip2 inhibition to attenuate severe lung injury."
"Xylazine, a veterinary sedative increasingly found in the unregulated drug supply, is associated with severe skin wounds in humans, particularly when co-used with fentanyl. Despite growing concern, the mechanisms underlying these wounds remain unclear. To investigate how xylazine and fentanyl affect wound healing, we administered subcutaneous injections of saline, xylazine (3.2 mg/kg), fentanyl (1.0 mg/kg), or their combination to female C57BL/6J mice for 28 days. After a standardized punch biopsy, wound closure was tracked for 14 days, with continued drug exposure. Mice receiving the xylazine-fentanyl combination exhibited significantly delayed wound healing compared to all other groups, as shown by slower closure rates and increased area under the healing curve. A follow-up study without chronic pretreatment showed that acute xylazine-fentanyl exposure still altered healing dynamics, although it did not significantly delay time to closure. Neither drug alone impaired healing at the tested doses. These findings suggest that prior exposure to xylazine and fentanyl contributes to impaired wound healing and support the hypothesis that xylazine-associated wounds may arise from delayed healing of pre-existing skin injuries rather than spontaneous formation. This is the first preclinical model of xylazine-related wound impairment and provides a foundation for future research into biological mechanisms and potential interventions for these emerging soft tissue injuries."

"Ligation of staple strands in DNA origami nanostructures (DONs) can yield enhanced structural stability in critical environments. This process can be viewed as performing hundreds of parallel reactions programmed on a self-assembled nanoscale platform. While previous studies have focused on investigating the collective results of the chemical or enzymatic ligation reactions, herein, the global assessment of individual ligation reactions is achieved using quantitative PCR (qPCR). By mapping enzymatic ligation efficiency on a trapezoidal substructure representing one third of a triangular DON, ligation is shown to preferentially occur at the trapezoid edges rather than at inner sites. Excellent agreement between the experimental ligation yields and docking simulations suggests that this is a result of variations in the ligase docking probability. Interestingly, removing neighboring staple strands increases the local dynamics on inner nick sites and thereby enhances the docking probability of the ligase, resulting in remarkably improved ligation yields. Finally, ligation products involving more than two consecutive sequences can be generated with each enzyme-catalyzed reaction as an independent event. This method provides unprecedented insight into the multiple ligation reactions occurring in parallel within complex DONs and will be an invaluable tool in the translation of DONs from the lab to real-world applications."
"Pathogenic mosquito-borne flaviviruses infect mosquito and human hosts, relying on host protein interactions to replicate, evade immunity, and mediate pathogenesis. Prior proteomic studies mapped such interactions for some flaviviruses, but yellow fever virus (YFV)--a pathogen of resurgent concern--remains understudied. Here, we map YFV interactomes in human and mosquito cells to identify interactions common among divergent flaviviruses or unique to YFV. Functional assays reveal a previously unrecognized YFV restriction factor: RBBP6 inhibits YFV genome replication by interacting with the viral polymerase NS5. We enhance the identification of dual-host interactions using structural modeling and holistic network integration. Extending our holistic approach to other flavivirus interactomes, we distinguish conserved mechanisms of host targeting from those unique to YFV. Contrary to expectations that conserved viral proteins lead to conserved protein interactions, we find that Capsid, a divergent structural protein, shares more host interactions than NS5, a conserved enzyme. Integrating proteomics with complementary analyses defines new principles of host-targeting strategies across flavivirus and host evolution, offering a versatile resource for navigating the complex landscape of flavivirus biology."
"Animals integrate environmental and internal cues to maintain homeostasis and health. The mitochondrial stress response is an essential cytoprotective mechanism, and priming its activation provides a survival advantage. Here, we show that the Caenorhabditis elegans receptor guanylyl cyclase GCY-9 regulates neuropeptide signalling from carbon dioxide sensing neurons to govern a non-canonical mitochondrial stress response in the intestine. This stress response induces atypical mitochondrial chaperone transcription, confers mitochondrial stress resistance, and increases mitochondrial membrane potential and respiration. GCY-9 loss disrupts pathogen avoidance, leading to indiscriminate feeding. We show that starvation decreases GCY-9 expression and propose that the resultant cytoprotective program is launched to offset risks associated with this behaviour. Thus, environmental sensing by peripheral neurons can pre-emptively enhance systemic mitochondrial function in response to metabolic uncertainty."
"Atomic layer deposition (ALD), a new vaccine technology, permits multiple dosing with a single administration by pulsatile release of one or more immunogens. We evaluated ALD delivery of mosaic-8b [60-mer nanoparticles presenting 8 different SARS-like betacoronavirus (sarbecovirus) receptor-binding domains (RBDs)] that elicits broadly cross-reactive antibodies and protects against mismatched sarbecoviruses not represented by RBDs on mosaic-8b. Compared with conventional prime-boost immunizations, ALD-delivered mosaic-8b RBD-nanoparticles elicited antibodies in both naive and pre-vaccinated mice with improved mismatched binding and neutralization. Results of RBD epitope mapping of serum antibodies from ALD-delivered mosaic-8b were consistent with broader coverage of RBD epitopes compared to conventional immunizations, and systems serology revealed distinct IgG subclass and Fc{gamma}R-binding IgG distributions. These results suggest that ALD is a promising technology for use with mosaic-8b RBD-nanoparticle vaccines to protect against future sarbecovirus spillovers and support applications for ALD vaccine delivery to elicit cross-reactive antibodies against rapidly mutating or diverse pathogens."
"Denitrification is a microbial process that leads to nitrogen loss from marine oxygen minimum zones (OMZs). The complete metabolic pathway for denitrification reduces nitrate to dinitrogen gas in four sequential steps. Many anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic bacteria are capable of the initial step of nitrate reduction to nitrite. Far fewer reduce nitrite to nitric oxide, nitrous oxide, or dinitrogen gas. In this study, we cultured and sequenced the complete genomes of 24 bacteria isolated from low dissolved oxygen waters (DO = 24 micromoles/L) in the northern Benguela Upwelling System (nBUS) OMZ to identify facultatively anaerobic bacteria with the genetic potential to contribute to denitrification. Most of the isolates obtained from the nBUS have denitrification genes (83%). They include several new species in the order Pelagibacterales (SAR11), as well as representatives from a previously uncultured family of Arenicellales (UBA868), a previously uncultured genus of Paracoccaceae, and a previously undescribed genus of Porticoccaceae. All ten nBUS SAR11 genomes encode a copper-containing nitrite reductase (nirK) and key components of a cbb3-type cytochrome c oxidase (cco), suggesting that they respire oxygen under low DO concentrations and have the potential to contribute to nitrogen loss by respiring nitrite to nitric oxide."
"Timing in the natural world is a matter of life or death, consequently, nearly all life on Earth has evolved internal circadian clocks. Many behavior-manipulating parasites exhibit striking daily timing, but whether this is clock-driven has remained unclear. Here, we leveraged the laboratory-tractable zombie fruit fly model, Drosophila melanogaster infected by the behavior manipulating fungus Entomophthora muscae, to tackle this long standing mystery. Using an automated behavioral paradigm, we found that the timing of death of wild-type flies continues to occur with ~21 hour periodicity in the absence of environmental cues. Surprisingly, we also discovered that light is required within the first 24 hours of exposure for E. muscae to infect and kill flies. Experiments with circadian and photoreception mutants revealed that death is independent of host genotype, suggesting the fungus - not the host - drives this rhythm. Transcriptomic analysis of in vitro grown fungus revealed that E. muscae maintains rhythmic gene expression independent of the fly host that peaks at sunset and has a free-running period of ~22 hours. Among cycling genes, we identified a transcript encoding a protein with high homology to white collar-1, the blue light sensor and core component of the molecular oscillator in the model ascomycete fungus Neurospora crassa. Altogether, our findings suggest that E. muscae has an endogenous circadian clock that it uses to control the timing of host death. This study provides evidence that a fungal clock can influence fly outcomes, pointing to a new mechanism by which parasites temporally coordinate host manipulation."
"Accurately modeling biomolecular interactions is a central challenge in modern biology. While recent advances, such as AlphaFold3 and Boltz-1, have substantially improved our ability to predict biomolecular complex structures, these models still fall short in predicting binding affinity, a critical property underlying molecular function and therapeutic efficacy. Here, we present Boltz-2, a new structural biology foundation model that exhibits strong performance for both structure and affinity prediction. Boltz-2 introduces controllability features including experimental method conditioning, distance constraints, and multi-chain template integration for structure prediction, and is, to our knowledge, the first AI model to approach the performance of free-energy perturbation (FEP) methods in estimating small molecule-protein binding affinity. Crucially, it achieves strong correlation with experimental readouts on many benchmarks, while being at least 1000 times more computationally efficient than FEP. By coupling Boltz-2 with a generative model for small molecules, we demonstrate an effective workflow to find diverse, synthesizable, high-affinity binders, as estimated by absolute FEP simulations on the TYK2 target. To foster broad adoption and further innovation at the intersection of machine learning and biology, we are releasing Boltz-2 weights, inference, and training code under a permissive open license, providing a robust and extensible foundation for both academic and industrial research."
"Genetic fusion of protein tags is widely used to study protein functions in vivo. It is well known that tag fusion can cause unwanted changes in protein stability, but whether this is an inherent property of the tagged protein, or can be influenced by the cell and tissue environment, is unclear. Using a series of genome edited mouse models, we show that tag-dependent changes in protein expression can vary across different primary cell and tissue contexts. In one case (Ncaph2), a C-terminal auxin-inducible degron fusion strongly increased protein stability in some tissues but decreased it in others. Destabilisation resulted from tissue-specific leakage of the auxin-inducible degron, which depended on TIR1 expression, and occurred selectively in the small intestine where basal concentrations of auxin / indole-3-acetic acid can reach levels that are sufficient to trigger protein degradation in cultured cells. Stabilisation occurred in post-mitotic cells via an endogenous degradation signal situated at the Ncaph2 C-terminus, which normally undergoes activation upon cell cycle exit, but is inactivated by C-terminal tag fusion. Our results highlight the underappreciated importance of cell and tissue environment in determining the consequences of tag fusions on protein expression, which may be particularly important in animal models that contain diverse cell types."
"Background: Despite recent advancements in the management of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), the disease remains devastating, with limited survival. Although the Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling pathway is known to play an important role in PAH, our current understanding of this pathway remains limited. Methods: We assessed BMP3 levels in the lungs of mice, rats, and pigs with pulmonary hypertension, and in pulmonary vascular cells from human patients with PAH. We performed in vitro studies on human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (hPASMCs) and human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (hPAECs) derived from healthy donors and from patients with PAH. We generated mice with global or SMC-specific deletion of BMP3. Recombinant BMP3 protein and adeno-associated viruses (AAV) were used to overexpress BMP3 in two different models of PAH in rodents. Magnetic resonance imaging, cardiac hemodynamics, morphometric, and histological measurements were performed to evaluate the effects of BMP3 on cardiac function and pulmonary vascular remodeling. Results: BMP3 is predominantly expressed in PASMCs and is downregulated in PAH. In vitro, conditioned medium from siRNA-BMP3-transfected hPASMCs increased hPAECs migration and proliferation, while PASMC-derived BMP3 inhibited PAH-diseased PAEC dysfunction. In both global and SMC-specific BMP3-deficient mice, exposure to a model of PAH exacerbated cardiac and pulmonary vascular remodeling in middle-aged mice. An intraperitoneally injected recombinant BMP3 prevented and reversed PAH in mice. A lung-targeted overexpression of BMP3, via AAV1-BMP3, reversed pulmonary vascular remodeling and inhibited cardiac dysfunction in mice and rats. Mechanistically, BMP3 activated the BMP/Smad1,5,8 pathway, inhibited the TGF-b/Smad2,3 pathway, and decreased the expression of cell cycle genes in hPAECs and in the lungs of BMP3-treated animals with PAH. Conclusions: Our findings provide evidence that BMP3 overexpression attenuates pulmonary vascular remodeling and inhibits cardiac dysfunction by restoring the balance between the TGF-b and BMP pathways through a cell-cell communication mechanism, offering a novel therapeutic pathway for PAH."
"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is an enteric coronavirus causing gastrointestinal disease in swine. To mitigate PEDV risks to swine health, agricultural economic losses, and global food security, a better understanding of host-pathogen interactions is required. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we studied transcriptional cellular responses to PEDV infection in two anatomical compartments of intestinal jejunum: first-line barrier defenses of epithelia and underlying immune induction in Peyer's patches. PEDV infection altered gene expression across all cell types and was associated with antiviral response pathways, indicating coordinated transcriptional reprogramming of diverse cell types. Signaling network inferences showed macrophages, dendritic cells, and non-resting B cells had increased signaling to T follicular helper cells associated with processes of T cell-dependent B cell activation during PEDV infection, indicating transcriptional promotion of immune induction in Peyer's patches. Mature enterocytes were the primary targets for PEDV infection, and a 190-gene signature indicative of antiviral immune defense represented a conserved enterocyte response to PEDV infection, regardless of enterocyte stress state or infection status. The 190-gene signature was specific to the epithelial lineage and escalated with enterocyte maturation, indicating antiviral transcriptional reprogramming is mobilized across matured enterocytes of PEDV-infected intestinal segments. Results exemplify key roles of Peyer's patches and epithelia as integral components for coordinated antiviral responsiveness in the intestine. Improved understandings of host-pathogen interactions during PEDV infection can identify indicators of PEDV protection versus susceptibility to target for future intervention strategies."
"Transfer RNA derived small RNAs (tDRs) are increasingly recognized as versatile regulators, yet their physiological landscape remains poorly charted. We re-analyzed a small-RNA-seq dataset generated with tDR-optimized library preparation from seven adult mouse tissues to explore tissue specific tDRs enrichment. We catalogued 26901 unique nuclear tDRs (ntDRs) and 5114 mitochondrial tDRs (mtDRs). Library sizes and subclass composition varied markedly: heart was mtDRs-rich, whereas spleen produced the fewest reads but the greatest diversity. Clustering analysis segregated tissues, with spleen and lung forming a distinct immune cluster. Tissue-versus-all differential analysis showed the spleen harboring unique ntDRs and mtDRs. The brain preferentially accumulated 5'tiRNAs, while other organs were enriched for i-tRFs or tRF3s. Enriched fragments in different tissues originated from specific isoacceptors and isodecoder tRNAs independent of mature tRNA abundance, implying selective biogenesis rather than bulk turnover. G-quadruplex prediction revealed pronounced enrichment of potentially quadruplex-forming ntDRs in the spleen, predominantly Gly-, Asp- and Val-derived i-tRFs/tRF3s, suggesting structure-dependent functions in immune regulation. Collectively, our atlas reveals extensive tissue-specific heterogeneity in tDR biogenesis, sequence and structure, providing a framework for deciphering context-dependent regulatory roles of tDRs."
"Giant viruses are large DNA viruses that infect unicellular and multicellular eukaryotes and form exceptionally large extracellular particles. (Meta)genomics and (meta)transcriptomics have provided insight into their diverse coding repertoire, but many of the proteins remain to be characterized as they lack homology with known proteins. Here, we integrated cross-linking mass spectrometry, quantitative proteomics, computational tools and cryo-EM data to characterize the protein architecture of intact melbournevirus particles. Based on this, we allocated 88 viral proteins to different virion sub-compartments and proposed topologies of 25 inner membrane proteins. We assigned eight components of the capsid in cryo-EM data, including proteins that tether the capsid shell to the membrane, reflecting key points in virion maturation. The data provide a valuable resource and demonstrate the power of an integrative approach to gain system-level structural insights into a poorly characterized biological system."
"Mutations in mitochondrial complex I can cause severe metabolic disease. Although no treatments are available for complex I deficiencies, chronic hypoxia improves lifespan and function in a mouse model of the severe mitochondrial disease Leigh syndrome caused by mutation of complex I subunit NDUFS4. To understand the molecular mechanism of NDUFS4 mutant pathophysiology and hypoxia rescue, we investigated the structure of complex I in respiratory supercomplexes isolated from NDUFS4 mutant mice. We identified complex I assembly intermediates bound to complex III2, proving the cooperative assembly model. Further, an accumulated complex I intermediate is structurally consistent with pathological oxygen-dependent reverse electron transfer, revealing unanticipated pathophysiology and hypoxia rescue mechanisms. Thus, the build-up of toxic intermediates and not simply decreases in complex I levels underlie mitochondrial disease."
"The heterogeneity of atherosclerotic plaques is critical for their vulnerability to rupture and the associate risk of cardiovascular events. Most proteomic studies have only examined bulk changes, potentially obscuring key spatial differences in protein content and abundance. Here we report a high-resolution spatial proteomics workflow that allows exploration of the molecular landscape of human plaques and murine myocardial tissue. This combines laser capture microdissection of tissue areas (50,000 {micro}m2 from 10 {micro}m-thick sections, corresponding to < 30 cells), with high-sensitivity ion-mobility mass spectrometry, allowing spatial profiling of cellular and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteomes. Over 2700 proteins were detected, revealing substantial intra-plaque proteome heterogeneity across distinct regions (lipid-rich, media layers, shoulder regions, necrotic core, intima) and distance from the lumen into the artery wall. Strong inverse correlations were detected between proteases (e.g. cathepsin-B) and core structural ECM components (e.g. perlecan, HSPG2) consistent with active ECM remodeling. Analysis of media layers indicated distinct protein signatures associated with smooth muscle contraction and cell-cell communication. Blood coagulation signatures, including platelet degranulation and fibrin clot formation were enriched at the intimal surface. Inflammatory markers (clusters of differentiation 4 and 68, CD4/CD68; vascular cell adhesion molecular 1, VCAM1) and vascular damage markers (tenascin-C, TNC) were enriched in shoulder regions. The necrotic core was dominated by blood proteins, consistent with intra-plaque hemorrhage. The capacity of this workflow to resolve changes over modest distances (225 {micro}m) provides unprecedented insights into the spatial organisation of the atherosclerotic microenvironment, offering a powerful tool for elucidating plaque biology and identifying potential therapeutic targets."
"The small chloroplastic protein CP12 has multiple functions, including the regulation of enzymes in the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle. Here, we investigated its role in the acclimation of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to varying CO2 availability. This alga has a CO2 concentrating mechanism that increases the supply of CO2 to ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) and involves hallmarks such as HCO3- transporters and carbonic anhydrases as well as the condensation of RuBisCO within the pyrenoid via its interaction with a scaffold protein named Essential Pyrenoid Component 1 (EPYC1). We showed that compared to the wild type, at high CO2, C. reinhardtii CP12 deletion mutants, or partially complemented mutants, have less phosphoribulokinase and ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) indicating that the regeneration of RuBP is regulated by CP12. In the absence of CP12, the expected relocation of RuBisCO towards the pyrenoid was not observed upon transition from high to very low CO2, contrary to WT cells. The CP12 deletion mutants are a unique example where the induction of CO2 concentrating mechanism hallmarks at very low CO2 was not accompanied by RuBisCO relocation. Altogether, these results suggest that CP12 contributes to the coordination between RuBP regeneration, RuBisCO location and CO2 acquisition."
"In clinical uses, RNA must maintain its integrity in serum that contains ribonucleases (RNases), especially RNase 1, which is a human homolog of RNase A. These omnipresent enzymes catalyze the cleavage of the P-O5'' bond on the 3' side of pyrimidine residues. Pseudouridine ({Psi}) is the most abundant modified nucleoside in natural RNA. The substitution of uridine (U) with {Psi} or N1-methylpseudouridine (m1{Psi}) reduces the immunogenicity of mRNA and increases ribosomal translation, and these modified nucleosides are key components of RNA-based vaccines. Here, we assessed the ability of RNase A and RNase 1 to catalyze the cleavage of the P-O5'' bond on the 3' side of {Psi} and m1{Psi}. We find that these enzymes catalyze the cleavage of UpA up to 10-fold more efficiently than the cleavage of {Psi}pA or m1{Psi}pA. X-ray crystallography of enzyme-bound nucleoside 2',3'-cyclic vanadate complexes and molecular dynamics simulations of enzyme{middle dot}dinucleotide complexes show that U, {Psi}, and m1{Psi} bind to RNase A and RNase 1 in a similar manner. Quantum chemistry calculations suggested that the higher reactivity of UpA is intrinsic, arising from an inductive effect that decreases the pKa of the 2' hydroxy group of U and enhances its nucleophilicity toward the P-O5'' bond. Experimentally, we found that UpA does indeed undergo spontaneous hydrolysis faster than does m1{Psi}pA. Our findings inform the continuing development of RNA-based vaccines and therapeutic agents."
"Senescence has been shown to contribute to the progression of aging related diseases including degenerative disc disease (DDD). However, the mechanisms regulating senescence in the intervertebral disc (IVD) and other tissues/diseases remain poorly understood. Recently, in a CRISPRa genome-wide screen, our lab identified a previously uncharacterized zinc finger protein, ZNF865 (BLST), that regulates a wide array of genes related to protein processing, cell senescence and DNA damage repair. Here, we demonstrate that ZNF865 expression is correlated with age and disease state in human patient IVD samples and mouse IVD. Utilizing CRISPR-guided gene modulation, we show that ZNF865 is necessary for healthy cell function and is a critical protein in regulating senescence and DNA damage in intervertebral disc cells, with implications for a wide range of tissues and organs. We also demonstrate that downregulation of ZNF865 induces senescence and upregulation mitigates senescence and DNA damage in human nucleus pulposus (NP) cells. Importantly, upregulation of ZNF865 shifts the chromatin landscape and gene expression profile of human degenerative NP cells towards a healthy cell phenotype. Collectively, our findings establish ZNF865 as a novel modulator of genome stability and senescence and as a potential therapeutic target for mediating senescence/DNA damage in senescence related diseases and disorders."
"Living animals reach their end-of-life through a stereotypic set of fascinating but poorly understood processes. The discovery, first in flies and later in nematodes and zebrafish, of the ""Smurf phenotype"" is a central tool for picking this complex ""lock of biology"", that one of ageing. Using the Smurfs, we have shown an evolutionarily conserved end-of-life transition across Drosophilids, nematodes and zebrafish. This tool has been key to identify the discontinuous nature of ageing and predict impending death from natural causes as well as from environmental stresses. This phenotype allowed us to discover that ageing is made up of two successive phases : a first phase where individuals are healthy and have no risk of mortality, but show an age-dependent and increasing risk of entering a second phase, characterized by the so-called hallmarks of ageing and a high risk of death. Here, we test whether these two consecutive phases of ageing separated by the Smurf transition are a conserved feature of ageing in the mammals using Mus musculus as a model. We performed a longitudinal longevity study using both males and females from two different mouse genetic backgrounds and by integrating physiological, metabolic and molecular measurements with the life history of approximately 150 mice. We show the existence of a phenotypic signature typical of the last phase of life, observable at any chronological age. Validating the two-phase ageing model in a mammalian organism allows better characterized the high risk of imminent death and would extend its implications to a broader range of species for ageing research."
"Red devil spiders of the genus Dysdera colonised the Canary Islands and underwent an extraordinary diversification. Notably, their genomes are nearly half the size of their mainland counterparts (~1.7 vs. ~3.3 Gb). This offers a unique model to solve long-standing debates regarding the roles of adaptive and non-adaptive forces on shaping genome size genome size evolution. To address these, we conducted comprehensive genomic analyses based on three high-quality chromosome-level assemblies, including two newly generated ones. We find that insular species experienced a reduction in genome size, affecting all genomic elements, including intronic and intergenic regions, with transposable element (TE) loss accounting for most of this contraction. Additionally, autosomes experienced a disproportionate reduction compared to the X chromosome. Paradoxically, island species exhibit higher levels of nucleotide diversity and recombination, lower TE activity in recent times, and evidence of intensified natural selection, collectively pointing to larger long-term effective population sizes in species from the Canary Islands. Overall, our findings align with the non-adaptive mutational hazard hypothesis, supporting purifying selection against slightly deleterious DNA and TE insertions as the primary mechanism driving genome size reduction."
"The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a pre-pandemic coronavirus that is transmitted from camels, the natural reservoir, to humans and can cause severe disease. MERS cases have been documented in Arabia but not Africa, although the virus is circulating in both Arabian and African camels. Further, evidence has been provided that viruses in African camels might have a reduced capacity to cause disease. However, the underlying determinants are incompletely understood. Here, employing pseudotyped particles as model systems for MERS-CoV entry into cells, we compared cell entry of viruses from African and Arabian camels and its inhibition. We show that viruses found in Arabian camels and recent human cases are less susceptible to inhibition by human soluble DPP4 (sDPP4) than viruses from African camels, although both enter human cells efficiently and are comparably sensitive to inhibition by IFITM proteins and neutralizing antibodies. Furthermore, relative resistance to soluble DPP4 was linked to mutation Q1020R, present in the spike proteins of recent Arabian but not African viruses. These results support the concept that soluble DPP4 might constitute a natural barrier against human infection that is more efficiently overcome by viruses currently circulating in Arabian camels than those in African camels."
"SetDB1 is best known as a chromatin modifier catalyzing H3K9me3. However, recent studies show that SetDB1 can promote H3K27me3-deposition and CTCF-binding, and potentially recruit de novo DNA methyltransferases. Given the tight connection with these processes, we hypothesized that DNA methylation (DNAme) may integrate these combined features of SetDB1. Thereto, we conducted time-course whole-genome bisulfite sequencing following Setdb1 knockout (KO) in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). In serum-cultured ESCs, nearly half of SetDB1 binding sites are DNA methylated, coinciding with H3K9me3, mainly silencing retrotransposons and imprinting control regions. Both H3K9me3 and DNAme are lost upon SetDB1 KO, but while TET2 rapidly removes DNAme at many of these sites, some retrotransposons are shielded from TET2 and lose DNAme slowly via passive dilution. SetDB1-mediated regulation via H3K27me3, CTCF, SMAD3, and histone acetylation are uncoupled from the DNAme-H3K9me3 axis. Hypomethylated naive ESCs show massive reactivation of retrotransposons upon Setdb1 KO, providing functional evidence that DNAme adds a protective layer against such activity. Altogether, our findings reveal how DNAme coordinates the multifaceted regulatory roles of SetDB1."
"The principle goal of clinical tumor treatment is to improve the therapeutic outcomes in the clinic while suppressing undesired purgatorial side-effects of anticancer drugs. However, its clinical usage of fluorescence prodrug was significantly hampered with some critical issues such as water-solubility, blood circulation, therapeutic efficacy, inevitable leakage, and side effects simultaneously. Herein, based on the strategy of the unique grafting structure, we report H2O2 activatable phototheranostic probes targeting the Golgi in drug-induced kidney injury tissues of mice with hypertension. The drug release study in vitro demonstrated that LGM-XL can diagnose cancer effectively by monitoring fluctuations of H2O2 in vivo through fluorescence imaging. More importantly, the prodrug LGM-XL could detect and image endogenous H2O2 in inflamed mice in situ, while effectively avoiding drug leakage in blood. The novel multifunctional drug delivery system enhanced not only Golgi oxidative stress in the pathophysiology of hypertension by stimulation of H2O2 but also the molecular mechanism for the diagnosis of inflamed-related diseases (e.g., drug-induced liver injury and the liver repair)."
"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), particularly anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies, block extracellular interactions between programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) and programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) to enhance antitumour immunity. Here, we present a streamlined workflow integrating public databases, bioinformatics tools, and in silico molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and in vitro experimental assays to identify consequential pathogenic nonsynonymous PD-L1 variants (PD-L1SNVs). Four variants predicted as pathogenic across six bioinformatic tools (SIFT, PolyPhen-2, PANTHER, SNP-PhD, SNP&GO, and Pmut) destabilized the anti-PD-L1 ICI atezolizumab-drug binding epitope in MD studies, correlating with reduced drug affinity. Live-cell assays directly linked PD-L1SNVs to intracellular trafficking defects and aberrant glycosylation, even distal from Nglycosylation sites. Allostery modeling (AlloSigMA) linked these disruptions to long-range structural perturbations. Our work establishes bioinformatics-driven predictions of functionally impactful pathogenic PD-L1SNVs and highlight how glycosylation/trafficking defects may serve as key mechanisms compromising therapeutic efficacy. These insights in predicting and validating pathogenic PD-L1SNVs has significant implications for guiding the personalized selection of effective PD-L1-targeted therapies in clinical settings."
"Ageing is associated with significant immune changes, with unhealthy ageing characterised by chronic inflammation and immune dysregulation. Here we identify a population of CD8 TEMRA cells during unhealthy ageing, which exhibit features of premature senescence and are regulated in part by TGF{beta}. These cells show impaired cytotoxic function and altered migratory behaviour, including an increased presence in tissues. TGF{beta} plays a pivotal role in modulating their phenotype by inducing CD103 expression and downregulating KLRG1, causing these cells to resemble tissue-resident memory cells. This disruption to receptor recycling leads to defective degranulation potentially altering the capacity of these cells to mount an effective immune response. Overall, these findings suggest that TEMRA cells in the context of unhealthy ageing are a pathogenic T cell subset that accumulate in tissues where they are unable to exert an effector function."
"Murine ocular autoimmunity develops through 3 stages; prodrome, primary peak and secondary regulation. During the prodromal phase, leukocytes accumulate within the retina and vitreous. Using the adoptive transfer model of experimental autoimmune uveitis, we can analyse the disease course by tracking the transferred cells during disease initiation being recruited to the ocular environment throughout peak of disease to secondary regulation. During initiation (the prodrome) of disease pathogenic transferred CD4 T cells can be detected within the retina as well as an endogenous CD4 infiltrate and as disease reaches peak, both transferred and endogenous CD4 T cells can be found in large numbers in the retina. Active clinical disease resolves by day 21 but transferred CD4 T cells persist within the retina when disease is in a clinically quiescent state. Concurrent transfer of RBP3 specific and OVA specific activated cells induces a similar clinical disease phenotype and time course. Both RBP3 and OVA specific cells are recruited during active clinical disease in equal measure showing that autoantigen specific CD4 T cells induce susceptibility for recruitment of other activated CD4 T cells. When analysing the endogenous and transferred CD4 T cells by RNA sequencing, differences between the two sets of gene signatures highlight genes found in pathogenic T cells in other models, including upregulation of markers associated with cytokine interactions and NK cell mediated cytotoxicity. Due to the persistence of the original transferred population throughout clinical disease, in depth analysis of this population could suggest pathways contributing to ocular autoimmunity."
"While genetically encoded Ca2+ indicators are valuable for visualizing neural activity, their speed and sensitivity have had limited performance when compared to chemical dyes and electrophysiology, particularly at synaptic compartments. We addressed these limitations by engineering a suite of next-generation GCaMP8-based indicators, targeted to presynaptic boutons, active zones, and postsynaptic compartments at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction. We first validated these sensors to be superior to previous versions. Next, we developed a new Python-based analysis program, CaFire, which enables the automated quantification of evoked and spontaneous Ca2+ signals. Using CaFire, we show a ratiometric presynaptic GCaMP8m sensor accurately captures physiologically-relevant presynaptic Ca2+ changes with superior sensitivity and similar kinetics compared to chemical dyes. Moreover, we test the ability of an active zone-targeted, ratiometric GCaMP8f sensor to report differences in Ca2+ between release sites. Finally, a newly engineered postsynaptic GCaMP8m, positioned near glutamate receptors, detects quantal events with temporal and signal resolution comparable to electrophysiological recordings. These next generation indicators and analytical methods demonstrate that GCaMP8 sensors, targeted to synaptic compartments, can now achieve the speed and sensitivity necessary to resolve Ca2+ dynamics at levels previously only attainable with chemical dyes or electrophysiology."
"Short-term synaptic plasticity (STP) is a fundamental mechanism of neural computation supporting a variety of nervous system functions from sensory adaptation and gain control to working memory and decision making. At the presynaptic release site, an interplay between distinct (M)Unc13 protein isoforms is suggested to orchestrate depressing and facilitating components of STP. In this study, we introduce a modification of the well-established Tsodyks-Markram Model (TMM) for STP. We constrain our model by in vivo intracellular recordings in the olfactory system of the fruit fly, where previous work suggested Unc13A to provide a phasic, depressing and Unc13B a tonic, facilitating release component. A combination of a facilitating and a depressing model component indeed allowed for accurate model fits. Differential knock-down experiments of the Unc13A and Unc13B gene variants provide biological model interpretation, linking the protein-specific molecular mechanisms to synaptic function and STP. Our mathematical formulation of protein-dependent STP can be readily and efficiently used to design biologically realistic spiking neural network models that feature different genetically defined synapse types."
"Recent advances in brain-wide recordings of small animals such as worms, fish, and flies have revealed complex activity involving large populations of neurons. In the Drosophila brain, with about 140,000 neurons, brain-wide recordings have been critical to uncovering widespread sensory and motor activity. However, current limitations in volumetric imaging rates hinder the accurate capture of fast neural dynamics. To improve the speed of volumetric imaging in Drosophila, we leverage the recently introduced light beads microscopy (LBM) method. We built a microscope and a LBM module tailored to fly brain experiments and used it to record brain-wide calcium signals in adult behaving flies at 28 volumes per second and at 60 volumes per second when selecting the central brain alone. We uncover fast-timescale auditory responses that are missed with standard volumetric imaging. We also demonstrate how temporal super-resolution can be combined with LBM data to uncover responses to single Drosophila courtship song pulses. This establishes LBM as a viable tool for capturing whole-brain activity at high spatial and temporal resolution in the fly."
"Machine learning frequently encounters challenges when applied to population-stratified datasets, where data representation bias and data distribution shifts can substantially impact model performance and generalizability across different subpopulations. These challenges are well illustrated in the context of polygenic prediction for diverse ancestry groups, though the underlying mechanisms are broadly applicable to machine learning with population-stratified data. Using synthetic genotype-phenotype datasets representing five continental populations, we evaluate three approaches for utilizing population-stratified data, mixture learning, independent learning, and transfer learning, to systematically investigate how data representation bias and distribution shifts influence polygenic across ancestry groups. Our results show that conditional distribution shifts, in combination with data representation bias, significantly influence machine learning model performance disparities across diverse populations and the effectiveness of transfer learning as a disparity mitigation strategy, while marginal distribution shifts have a limited effect. The joint effects of data representation bias and distribution shifts demonstrate distinct patterns under different multi-population machine learning approaches, providing important insights to inform the development of effective and equitable machine learning models for population-stratified data."
"Skeletal muscle architectural design strongly affects force-generating capacity and excursion range, and its functional importance to animal and human movement is well-founded. Traditionally, this 'structure-function' relation has been inferred when assessing a muscle's architecture at rest, often using muscle images or geometrical measurements obtained from anatomical dissections or medical imaging techniques such as ultrasonography or magnetic resonance imaging. However, a more contemporary view recognises that muscles display a remarkable capacity to dynamically change shape-and therefore architecture-during contraction, quite literally allowing them to change gears as contractile conditions change. Muscle gearing refers to the velocity and force advantages obtained through the effects of fibre rotation and shape changes on muscle and fibre velocities, which significantly influence the length and velocity operations of both the fibres and whole muscle during contraction. This phenomenon can be characterised by the ratio of the velocities or displacement of the muscle to the fascicle. Given its function importance, muscle gearing should be considered an integral part of a comprehensive framework for understanding dynamic muscle function, as both fibre length and architecture, along with muscle shape changes, respond to varying mechanical demands and influence functionality in both normal and pathological conditions. The present review aims to (i) present a historical overview of our understanding of the muscle structure-function relation from measurements obtained in resting muscle as well as during dynamic, active contractions and (ii) define 'muscle gear', explain how muscle gear impacts muscle function under various movement conditions, describe intrinsic and extrinsic factors that determine or influence gearing, and overview the literature reporting gearing in animal and human studies while raising hypotheses in an attempt to explain the gearing differences identified across the literature. Given the current challenges in experimentally quantifying the unique influence of each identified factor, we employ a computational modelling approach using a previously validated three-dimensional finite element muscle model to gain a better understanding of the mechanical phenomena underlying muscle gearing. Finally, we briefly discuss the potential role of gearing in the observed changes in muscle function with ageing, injury, and exercise training. Overall, muscle gearing is a distinctive feature of skeletal muscles, with the modelling demonstrating that it is an emergent property of the physics of muscle contraction. A greater understanding of this phenomenon may provide significant insight into human muscle function and movement performance that cannot be predicted from examination of the architectural features of resting (non-contracting) muscles."
"Gene centric pathway mapping tools, widely used to interpret untargeted LCMS metabolomics data, may underperform because a single metabolite can generate multiple spectral features, inflating false positive rates. Classic enzymology, which established metabolite flow long before gene sequencing, offers experimentally validated precursor product relationships that could overcome these ambiguities. We evaluated whether enzymology defined precursor product correlations are consistently detectable in human plasma LCMS data and explored their potential to enhance pathway analysis and metabolite identification. Using a high resolution LCMS platform, we detected amino acids and carnitine related metabolites in one individual sampled eight times over five years and in 50 adults sampled 6 to 8 times each. Spearman correlations were calculated for longitudinal and cross sectional data. In the single participant repeated measures, strong positive correlations were observed for every direct precursor product pair except the branch point metabolite palmitoylcarnitine. The longitudinal analysis reproduced these patterns, and the same relationships were retained when analysis was cross sectional. Despite contributions from multiple organ systems, plasma thus preserved core enzymatic relationships. Precursor product proportionality, a fundamental principle of enzymology, is readily detectable in large scale LCMS datasets and remains robust across longitudinal and cross sectional designs. Applying these correlations to metabolomics workflows can improve pathway analysis, help metabolite identification, and reveal how genetic variations, diets, therapeutic drugs, and environmental exposures jointly impact metabolic pathways."
"Task-based functional MRI (tb-fMRI) has gained prominence for investigating brain connectivity by engaging specific functional networks during cognitive or behavioral tasks. Compared to resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI), tb-fMRI provides greater specificity and interpretability, making it a valuable tool for examining task-relevant networks and individual differences in brain function. In this study, we evaluated the utility of the BOLD-filter-a method originally developed to extract reliable BOLD (blood oxygenation level-dependent) components from rs-fMRI-by applying it to tb-fMRI data as a preprocessing step for functional connectivity (FC) analysis. The goal was to enhance the sensitivity and specificity of detecting task-induced functional activity. Compared to the conventional preprocessing method, the BOLD-filter substantially improved the isolation of task-evoked BOLD signals. It identified over eleven times more activation voxels at a high statistical threshold and more than twice as many at a lower threshold. Moreover, FC networks derived from BOLD-filtered signals revealed clearer task-related patterns, including gender-specific differences in brain regions linked to everyday behaviors. These patterns were not detectable using standard preprocessing approaches. Our findings demonstrate that the BOLD-filter enhances the robustness and interpretability of FC analysis in tb-fMRI. By effectively isolating meaningful functional networks, this approach offers significant advantages over conventional preprocessing methods. The BOLD-filter holds promise for advancing both basic neuroscience research and clinical applications by enabling more precise characterization of task-induced brain activity."
"Deep ocean dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is one of the largest pools of reduced carbon on Earth. Many DOC compounds escape microbial degradation and persist for thousands of years in the ocean. Although many hypotheses have been proposed, the mechanisms responsible for this long-term stability remain unresolved. Heterotrophic microorganisms in the deep ocean are energetically starved and exhibit low metabolic activity. Here, we investigated whether the severe energy limitation in deep sea environments acts as a barrier to microbial degradation of DOC. We hypothesized that alleviating this energetic barrier through the addition of labile compounds (i.e., the priming effect) could stimulate microbial consumption of DOC. We conducted 62-day bottle incubations with deep seawater from the Southern Ocean that were amended with simple organic carbon, nitrogen- and/or phosphorus-containing compounds. We tracked DOC concentration, cell abundance and microbial community structure over the course of the experiment. Our results show no evidence of a priming effect regardless of the priming compound. However, priming compounds selected for distinct microbial populations with little overlap among amended bottles even when compounds were chemically similar. Pseudoalteromonas and Pseudomonas were enriched across all amended bottles, and their competition for labile substrates likely contributed to observed variations in DOC consumption. Our results reveal that the persistence of DOC is not driven by the energetic state of deep-sea microbes. In contrast, our results suggest that inputs of fresh carbon to the deep ocean are more likely to increase DOC sequestration, via the microbial carbon pump, rather than stimulate DOC consumption."
"This study aimed to reveal a comprehensive genetic diversity and genetic structure of Island Southeast Asian (ISEA) goats, and infer the details of gene introgressions and propagation routes in ISEA goats using genome-wide SNPs. Correlation analysis of the distance from the domestication center and the genetic diversity of each Asian population showed a significant negative correlation (r = -0.796, p = 2.66E-05), while the Philippines showed a relatively high genetic diversity (He = 0.363) against the distance, suggesting the multiple propagation routes and admixture history in Philippine goats. Reduced Representation Admixture Analysis at K=6 showed that six clusters (Europe, Northwest Africa, Southern Africa, Eastern Africa, Asia and Southeast Asia) were formed based primarily on geographical location, and ISEA goats included African and Europe components. However, this introgression is much lower in Indochinese goats. In addition, the Southern African and European populations included Southeast Asia component. Treemix and f4 statistics analyses showed the genetic influence and gene flow between ISEA and the Southern Africa. The results of this study have revealed obvious mutual gene flow between ISEA and the Southern African regions through the European maritime activities across the Indian Ocean since the Middle Ages."
"Culling is frequently used to control animal diseases. Intensive culling can alter the movement behavior of surviving animals, especially in socially-structured wildlife species. These behavioral responses could have unexpected consequences on the spread of a disease. Thus, planning effective culling responses to diseases in wildlife hosts requires a thorough understanding of the potential impacts of culling on the target wildlife host species. We conducted a BACI design study of behavioral response to culling in wild pigs. We examined movement and contact responses in the populations using GPS-collared wild pigs and three different culling methods (aerial operations, trapping, and an experimental toxic bait). Movement metrics included home range area, net-squared displacement (i.e., home range shift), movement speed, and distance. We estimated contact as the total weekly pairwise number of contacts per day, and median number of unique individuals per day. We evaluated change in movement during and after culling treatments relative to control individuals, and how these changes varied by sex, using generalized linear mixed models. We observed increased movement distances during and after trapping treatments, and home range shifts and reduced area size after the toxicant treatment. We also observed increases in total contacts and number of unique contacts during trapping removals. Movement and contact responses varied by sex. Our results suggest that continued, intensive culling as with extensive trapping can substantially alter wild pig space use. These behavioral responses could have important consequences for disease spread when managing an introduction of transboundary animal diseases or endemic diseases."
"Balancing population growth against finite resources remains a foundational challenge in sustainability science. Although qualitative sustainability principles have matured over decades, translating these principles into universal quantitative rules has been challenging due to the diverse environmental and cultural contexts under which human societies develop. Here, we demonstrate that a general sustainability rule emerges naturally when population-resource feedbacks follow empirically observed allometric scaling laws, condensing ecological, technological, and social complexities into four fundamental parameters. This rule predicts ``sustainability corridors'' within which societies must remain to ensure long-term persistence. Testing our theoretically derived rule against ethnographic data from 299 hunter-gatherer societies across varied ecological and social environments, we find consistent alignment: these societies tend to occupy the predicted corridors despite substantial contextual differences. By grounding sustainability in biophysical scaling rather than context-specific variables, our approach bridges ecology and sustainability science, suggesting that despite cultural and technological differences, all societies face fundamental constraints for sustainable growth."
"Multiple selective pressures can shape the evolution of color vision in animals, by acting on the co-evolution of the opsin genes. How do adaptive processes shape the duplications of opsins, the evolution of their amino acids and the modification of their patterns of expression? At large phylogenetic scales, natural selection due to the contrasted light environments has been found to have a profound impact on the evolution of the opsin gene family. However, in closely-related species, species interactions due to sexual selection or competition may also influence opsin evolution. Here, we investigate the diversification of opsin sequences and their expression in closely-related blue Morpho butterfly species, living in different microhabitats, to shed light on the effect of biotic and abiotic selective pressures shaping the evolution of their opsin gene family. First, we combined genomics, transcriptomics and immunochemistry to precisely characterize the expression and the spatial distribution of the opsin proteins found in the eyes of Morpho helenor. We found unique ommatidial types compared to other butterfly species. We then investigated the evolution of opsin genes among 18 Morpho species, found signature of positive selection on two opsin genes, and identified key co-evolving amino-acids shaping the diversification of the Morpho visual system. We showed that such opsin evolution was correlated to both light environment and wing coloration, highlighting the joint effect of several selective pressures in the evolution of those proteins. Overall, our study underlines the peculiar evolution of visual systems in closely-related species specialized in divergent microhabitats."
"In this study, we systematically evaluate the performance of several DNA foundation models (NT, DNABERT, and HyenaDNA) in predicting the functional impact of genetic variants using Zero-shot scoring, a method that does not require task-specific fine-tuning. We assess the models' sensitivity to sequence alterations introduced by Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs), comparing their ability to capture both local and extended contextual effects. Using pathogenic, benign, and uncertain SNVs from ClinVar, we show that large multi-species NT models outperform other architectures in detecting functional consequences, not only at the mutation site but also in adjacent regions. These models exhibit superior discriminative power across variant categories, especially when aggregating Zero-shot scores over multiple surrounding tokens. Conversely, models trained solely on human sequences, such as DNABERT and HyenaDNA, show limited contextual awareness and reduced ability to differentiate variant effects. Our findings highlight the critical importance of model size, training objective, and training data diversity in shaping model performance. Furthermore, we discuss current limitations in modeling long-range dependencies in genomic sequences and suggest that innovations in transformer architectures, such as sparse attention or memory-augmented models, may provide viable paths toward scalable, genome-wide variant effect prediction."
"Influenza viruses are characterized by high mutation rates and genetic diversity, which have the potential to compromise the efficacy of vaccines and to facilitate the emergence of pandemic strains. These mutations are primarily introduced by the error-prone RNA-dependent RNA polymerase during viral replication. It has been demonstrated that conventional RNA sequencing methodologies frequently result in the masking of low-frequency mutations, a phenomenon that can be attributed to technical inaccuracies. This limitation impedes the acquisition of comprehensive knowledge regarding the early-stage evolution of viruses. A major challenge in mutation analysis is distinguishing true biological variants from sequencing artifacts, especially when assessing rare mutations within viral populations. To address this, we applied a single-UMI (sUMI) sequencing method to influenza virus populations derived from single particles, achieving an error rate of ~10- per base. The findings of this study demonstrate that the efficacy of the sUMI method in facilitating precise detection of low-frequency mutations. These results indicate that the observed mutations are not merely a result of technical noise but rather are indicative of biological variation. Information-theoretic analyses, including Shannon entropy and Jensen-Shannon divergence, showed non-random mutation distributions and enhanced sequence diversity in viral samples relative to in vitro controls. These findings imply that selective pressures act during replication, influencing mutation retention and propagation. This study proposes a high-precision framework for the quantification of viral genome diversity and the identification of early adaptive mutations. This finding also substantiates the approach's viability in the context of mutation prediction through the utilization of logistic models. Collectively, these results contribute to a deeper understanding of viral evolution and provide a foundation for real-time surveillance of emerging variants, resistance mutations, and vaccine escape potential. The approach has broad implications for forecasting influenza evolution and improving preparedness for future outbreaks."
"Fish protein hydrolysates hold great promise as nutraceuticals, yet their application as food ingredients or nutraceuticals is currently limited by their fish-like odor. This odor is mainly due to the presence of trimethylamine (TMA), a volatile biogenic amine resulting from the breakdown of naturally occurring trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) in marine fish. The bacterial trimethylamine monooxygenase mFMO can oxidize TMA into TMAO using molecular oxygen and the cofactor nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). We have established an enzyme cascade which takes advantage of glucose dehydrogenase to recycle NADPH from NADP+, significantly decreasing the cost of the reaction and paving the way for using the enzyme system in fish protein hydrolysates targeted for human consumption. We demonstrate that the dual enzyme system works in an industrially relevant substrate. Salmon protein hydrolysate treated with an mFMO/glucose dehydrogenase cocktail showed a 75% reduction in TMA. A trained sensory panel perceived an improved odor across several parameters, including a reduction in the characteristic TMA smell."
"Deep mutational scans have measured the effects of many mutations on many different proteins. Here we use a collection of such scans to perform a statistical meta-analysis of the effects of single amino acid substitutions. Specifically, we model the relative deleteriousness of each substitution in each deep mutational scan with respect to the identities of the wildtype and mutant residues, and the wildtype residue's surface accessibility. This model explains much of the variance in mutational effects and quantifies physicochemical trends underlying them, including by yielding an empirical amino acid exchangeability matrix."
"Predicting drug efficacy across diverse patient contexts remains a major challenge in oncology, as models trained on cancer cell lines often fail to capture patient-specific biology. Emerging biological foundation models and patient-derived technologies offer a promising solution. Here, we present UniCure, a pre-trained foundation model that predicts transcriptomic responses to drugs across diverse cellular/tissue contexts, enabling personalized cancer therapy or drug prioritization at the individual level. Rather than encoder/decoder used in traditional models, UniCure utilizes parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques for optimizing the foundation model, a novel FlexPert module for modeling flexible drug-cell interactions, and a Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) loss for learning unpaired data. Trained on over 1.8 million perturbation RNA-seq profiles (across over 22,000 compounds, 166 cell types, and 24 tissues), UniCure achieves high accuracy in predicting both dose-dependent responses and drug combination effects, demonstrating strong generalization across bulk and single-cell transcriptomic data. In particular, fine-tuning on our patient-derived tumor-like clusters and real-world data (800 profiles) enables UniCure to generate individualized therapeutic predictions on patient's tissue samples. In addition, UniCure enables patient stratification based on the predicted drug response, providing a new way for patient subtyping. UniCure's drug prioritization was validated across over 1000 patients from public pan-cancer cohorts and supported by experimental confirmation of candidate therapeutics. By screening millions of compounds per patient at scale, UniCure provides a biologically grounded tool for advancing precision oncology and accelerating drug discovery."
"Stable isotope analysis is a widely used tool in primate ecology for investigating diet and environment, with numerous studies focusing on chimpanzees. However, few studies have explored the dietary niche of chimpanzees in comparison to other primates or examined intra-individual dietary variability. This limitation hinders the understanding of the comparability of isotopic data with the wealth of behavioral observational data in primate ecology. In this study, we report the carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios of hairs from wild chimpanzees and four other primate species in the Kalinzu Forest Reserve, Uganda. Bulk analysis revealed that both plant foods and chimpanzees in Kalinzu exhibited lower carbon isotope ratios than expected for the region's rainfall. Additionally, preliminary compound-specific nitrogen isotope analysis of amino acids was conducted, revealing that chimpanzees in Kalinzu have a lower degree of faunivory than the sympatric Cercopithecus primates. Furthermore, ultra-fine sectioning of a hair sample was conducted to investigate dietary variation over daily to weekly timescales. In one adult male chimpanzee, carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios fluctuated by more than 1{per thousand} within approximately 10 days. These findings highlight the importance of recognizing uncontrolled ecological variability and hidden intra-individual dietary changes when interpreting stable isotope data in relation to behavior and environmental traits."
"Comparative analyses of trait evolution aim to uncover the different evolutionary forces shaping phenotypic diversity among species. This is typically done by fitting various evolutionary models to observed trait changes along a species tree. For instance, under neutral evolution, trait values are modelled as changing randomly along the branches of the tree. In contrast, for a trait under selection, species are typically assumed to track an optimal trait value, which itself may shift along the tree. Here, rather than relying on alternative models to discriminate among evolutionary scenarios, we focus on the underlying species tree, and specifically the units in which its branch lengths are measured. Species trees are usually represented as chronograms, with branch lengths proportional to time. The rationale is that time correlates with trait changes through its connection to the number of generations. However, since the generation time of species can also vary along the phylogenetic tree, we argue that chronograms introduces biases. In contrast, phylograms with branch lengths in units of sequence divergence will account for the effect of changing generation time. In this study, we develop a method to test whether a phylogram provides a better fit than a chronogram for modelling trait evolution. We show using simulations that, for a trait evolving neutrally, the fit of a random evolution model has more support on a phylogram than on a chronogram. However, comparing models and testing different scenarios of selection using a phylogram leads to incorrect predictions. Given these results, we argue that we should use phylograms instead of chronograms when assessing the neutral evolution of a trait. Nevertheless, we support the fact that we should generally continue to use chronograms to model selection acting on a quantitative trait."
"Adaptive variation is typically presented to selection in a biased manner, owing to vast differences in effective mutation rates across genomes, organisms and environments. Yet, how strongly and how generally such bias shapes adaptation remains poorly understood. Here we used a well-known experimental system in which two Escherichia coli mutator variants evolve antibiotic resistance via two mutationally favored, but genetically distinct routes. Through simulations and experiments, we show that the scaling of mutation-biased adaptation with population size is complex, highly dependent on biological details, and - most critically - on how closely mutation bias aligns with selection. Contrary to the common view, we find that mutation-biased adaptation may not wane in large populations but instead intensify depending on the nature of the bias. Crucially, we demonstrate that distinct mutation biases can produce markedly different collateral sensitivity profiles to multiple antibiotics, even at large population sizes. These findings suggest that mutation-biased adaptation may not only be widespread but also have far-reaching and unpredictable consequences both within and beyond the original selective context."
"Appropriate identification of evolutionary significant units (ESUs) is essential for effective conservation planning. Genomic data has emerged as a key tool to inform ESU decisions due to the increased resolution of information, yet little is known about how genomic data is being used in practice to inform these decisions. To address this, we conducted a systematic literature review and found that genomic data is increasingly being used to inform ESUs globally and across plant and animal taxa. We identified a lack of consistency in the methods used to analyze the genomic data, although with reduced representation sequencing and whole genome sequencing improving the ability to infer evolutionary significance. Adaptive loci, a key advantage of genomic data, need to be interpreted with caution and simply identifying these loci may lead to the inflation of ESUs. Our review further revealed inconsistencies in how ESUs are defined and that conclusions do not always meet the criteria outlined in the definition provided. For instance, the amount of gene flow determined rarely influenced the number of ESUs recommended. Overall, 67% of the studies included in this review suggested an increase in the number of ESUs regardless of vast differences across studies. A unifying definition of what constitutes an ESU and a detailed workflow that can provide reliable support to assess the evolutionary significance of these units is still needed. The unparalleled depth of information obtained from genomic data, and the application of a proven workflow has the potential to improve the identification of ESUs globally."
"Background: Full tissue segmentation is laborious, especially for non-model organisms, whereas accurate and reliable delineation still requires much firsthand visual inspection. A virtual environment can be equipped with suitable data representations, interaction techniques, and method interfaces as to enable the interactive delineation and quantification of anatomical structure. Situated in such an environment, analysts can benefit from reduced pre-processing, but also from in-situ learning and collaboration. Results: Therefore, we apply virtual reality as a method to visualise and derive higher-level anatomical features from low-level descriptors. Following voxel-size calibration, scalable delineations and measurements are performed in virtual reality. The data representation for delineation is volume visualisation: a volume rendering or an isosurface mesh. Two delineation techniques are proposed for the placement and editing of points and segments in virtual reality. For quantification, different measures and metrics can be computed for each delineated region. To mitigate some of the fundamental challenges of virtual reality, e. g., mid-air interaction affecting precision at a distance, different virtual-reality affordances were considered as part of the design. As a result, we present Brainacle, a virtual reality application, and make its usage freely available. We incorporate Brainacle in a synchrotron tomography reconstruction pipeline to delineate and quantify the gross brain regions of 20 individuals from six species of African cichlid fish. Conclusion: Brainacle, an editor for the interactive delineation and quantification of anatomical structures in virtual reality, is applicable to different biological pipelines and workflows. In particular, Brainacle can be used to quickly gain an overview of structure, ease repetitive delineation and measurement, and visually inspect and communicate findings."
"We have previously reported a cyclic peptide CRAGVGRGC (termed BLMP6) that homes to disseminating tumor cells in mouse cancer models and could be used for metastasis detection and intervention. Here, based on BLMP6 similarity to latent transforming growth factor beta binding protein 4 (LTBP4), we discovered fibulin-4 as a BLMP6 target. We show that BLMP6 mimics the LTBP4 domain binding to fibulin-4 and selectively binds to fibulin-4 in vitro. Fibulin-4 knockout in mouse 4T1 cancer cells abrogated BLMP6 homing to lung metastases. Fibulin-4 expression was found to be increased in invasive and metastatic human breast cancer. AZDye555 fluorophore-labeled BLMP6 was developed as a reagent selectively binding to invasive and metastatic human breast cancer cells in tissue sections and homing to MDA-MB-231 metastases in mice. We show that radiolabeling BLMP6 with 68Ga can be used for detection of MDA-MB-231 metastases. We designed a peptide-drug conjugate consisting of monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) and BLMP6 that preferentially kills aggressive cancer cells. Cytotoxicity of MMAE-BLMP6 against MDA-MB-231 tumors was confirmed in vivo. In an immunocompetent mouse model of B16F10 experimental lung metastases, treatment with MMAE-BLMP6 suppressed metastasis growth and improved survival. There was also a trend for metastasis suppression and survival improvement in the MDA-MB-231 experimental metastasis model. Our results suggest that fibulin-4 and BLMP6 may be further developed for the detection and targeting of metastatic human cancers."
"Subinhibitory antibiotic exposures are common in clinical and environmental contexts, yet their effects on bacterial growth dynamics remain incompletely understood. We studied the temporal response of Escherichia coli to a panel of bactericidal (""cidal"") and bacteriostatic (""static"") antibiotics at sub-minimum inhibitory concentrations (sub-MIC). We uncover a sharp dynamical distinction between the two classes. Bacteriostatic antibiotics reduce the initial growth rate in a dose-dependent manner, similar to nutrient limitation physiological responses. In contrast, bactericidal antibiotics do not alter initial growth rates - cells continue to grow as fast as untreated cells - until an abrupt slowdown in growth rate. The onset of slowdown occurs earlier with increasing dose, suggesting a damage accumulation mechanism leading to a lethal threshold. Cidals also show a steeper dose-response curve. We propose that bacteria respond to cidal antibiotics with a ""grow-fast-then-crash"" strategy that is adaptive for transient lethal threats, whereas static antibiotics trigger stress adaptation and slower growth. While clinical outcomes of statics and cidals may be similar at full inhibitory doses, these sub-MIC dynamical signatures could influence resistance evolution and treatment outcomes in biofilms or partially resistant strains. Our findings offer a dynamic framework for antibiotic classification and raise new questions about how bacteria respond to sublethal antibiotic stress."
"Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a prevalent condition characterized by mucus stasis, persistent inflammation, and infection of the paranasal sinuses. It often involves the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa, especially in individuals with cystic fibrosis or a history of antibiotic use. While P. aeruginosa is a known opportunistic pathogen that employs a diverse array of virulence factors to cause airway infections, its ability to thrive in the sinonasal environment is also likely influenced by its local microbial ecology. For instance, anaerobic bacterial genera, such as Streptococcus, Veillonella, and Prevotella, are also commonly found in CRS and may contribute to P. aeruginosa persistence. Here we sought to test the hypothesis that anaerobes promote P. aeruginosa colonization of the upper airways, specifically through degradation of mucin glycoproteins that decorate the epithelial surface. Using a novel dual oxic-anoxic culture platform termed DOAC, we co-cultured Calu-3 epithelial cells with a CRS-derived anaerobic microbial community. We observed increased expression of inflammatory marker genes and degradation of mucin glycoproteins, along with enhanced P. aeruginosa colonization of the epithelial surface after anaerobe pre-treatment. Furthermore, mucins isolated from anaerobe-treated Calu-3 cells promoted greater P. aeruginosa attachment to microtiter plates in vitro compared to intact mucins. These results suggest that anaerobic microbiota may shape the sinonasal environment in a way that favors P. aeruginosa persistence, offering new insights into CRS pathogenesis and potential therapeutic targets to disrupt detrimental bacterial interactions in chronic airway disease."
"We have developed a simple and highly efficient in vivo method to iteratively relocate functional chromosomal loci onto an episome in Escherichia coli by utilizing synthetic DNA fragments. In this in vivo cut'n'paste procedure, ""cutting"" is executed by the RNA-guided DNA endonuclease Cas9 and a set of guides, while ""pasting"" is facilitated by the phage {lambda} Red recombinase, which are all synthesized on easily curable plasmids. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we commercially obtained synthetic DNA fragments containing locus-specific homology regions, antibiotic marker cassettes, and standardized Cas9 target sequences. By using these locus-specific synthetic DNA fragments, we relocated 7 functional chromosomal loci. Scarless relocation mutants of the trg, aer, tsr, malHM, malQT, macB-nadA, and folA chromosomal loci were obtained as antibiotic-resistant isolates by combining Cas9 counterselection with the restoration of an antibiotic marker cassette. The additional antibiotic marker cassettes and standardized Cas9 target sequences present in the synthetic DNA fragments are inherently eliminated upon completion of the procedure, enabling iterative processing of loci. This procedure should be widely useful, especially in genome (re-)engineering of E. coli and other bacteria because the procedure can be done on wild-type cells."
"Microbial communities encompass diverse bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes that play vital roles in ecosystems and host health. Comprehensive analysis of these communities requires accurate, quantitative, and cross-domain profiling, yet current sequencing methods--metagenome shotgun sequencing (MGS) and ribosomal RNA (rRNA) amplicon sequencing--struggle to achieve these goals in a single assay. MGS provides broad functional insights but suffers from high cost, computational burden, and reliance on incomplete reference databases. rRNA amplicon sequencing, while more taxonomically targeted, typically profiles either prokaryotes or eukaryotes separately, depending on the chosen primer sets, and thus lacks simultaneous cross-domain resolution. To address these limitations, we developed PAMA-seq, a droplet-digital multiplex PCR technique. PAMA-seq partitions DNA sample from microbial communities into nanoliter droplets, each containing a single template molecule, and independently amplifies both the 16S and 18S rRNA genes, resulting in uniform amplification efficiency and accurate quantification. We validated PAMA-seq on a synthetic microbial community, a stool sample from a patient with colorectal cancer, and a coastal seawater sample. The method provided stable, cross-domain taxonomic profiles at sequencing depths as low as 10E3; reads--one to two orders of magnitude fewer than comparable shotgun metagenomics approaches--while significantly reducing variability between replicates. By combining comprehensive domain coverage with low sequencing depth requirements, PAMA-seq offers an efficient, cost-effective, and scalable method for monitoring microbial communities across diverse ecosystems, from clinical samples to global marine environments."
"Fusobacterium nucleatum is a common member of the oral microbiota frequently associated with extra-oral infections and diverse polymicrobial environments, including chronic airway diseases and colorectal tumors. Yet, its interactions with co-colonizing microbiota remain poorly defined. Here, we investigate cross-feeding interspecies dynamics between F. nucleatum and Segatella oris, a glycan-foraging anaerobe enriched in airways and gastrointestinal tumors. Using broth cultures, cell-free supernatants, and co-culture on primary human airway epithelial cells, we identify bidirectional interactions that shape nutrient acquisition, biofilm formation, gene expression, and host responses. While mucin or S. oris supernatants modestly enhanced F. nucleatum growth, both conditions triggered transcriptional remodeling, including induction of the nan opeon for sialic acid catabolism, suggesting reliance on glycan degradation by S. oris. Conversely, S. oris exhibited differential expression of multiple polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs) when exposed to F. nucleatum or its metabolites. Biofilm formation by F. nucleatum was strongly inhibited by S. oris, indicative of antagonistic interactions. Dual and triple RNA-seq revealed that epithelial responses were predominately shaped by F. nucleatum, with enrichment of inflammatory and cancer-associated pathways; however, co-colonization with S. oris modulated the magnitude and specificity of host gene expression. These findings demonstrate that glycan-mediated cross-feeding and microbial interactions shape the physiology and pathogenic potential of F. nucleatum in mucosal environments. This work underscores the importance of modeling polymicrobial communities under host-relevant conditions to better understand pathobiont behavior at the epithelial interface."
"Colonization of titanium dental implants by the oral pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis can lead to peri-implant diseases and, ultimately, implant failure. P. gingivalis growth can be stimulated by 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoic acid (DHNA), a menaquinone precursor from various oral bacteria, yet its impact on biofilm formation remains unclear. The aim of the study was to evaluate P. gingivalis growth and metabolic activity over six days in response to DHNA on two titanium grade IV surfaces with different roughness using a hybrid in vitro - in silico approach. P. gingivalis growth was modestly stimulated by DHNA and exhibited an inverse correlation with ammonia concentration in culture medium. Notably, this growth pattern transitioned from an initial linear phase to a later exponential phase, with DHNA-treated biofilms reaching this exponential shift at an earlier stage than untreated controls. Confocal microscopy revealed that DHNA-treated biofilms exhibited surface-dependent growth patterns, with larger biofilm volumes observed on rougher surfaces in later biofilm stages, compared to smoother surfaces. Regardless of surface characteristics, the area occupied by biofilms and the size of the aggregates exhibited a consistent and progressive increase over time and was larger in late DHNA-treated biofilms. The experimental data were used to calibrate a coupled finite element method (FEM)-based model that simulated P. gingivalis biofilm dynamics and nutrient utilization. Summarizing, DHNA moderately stimulated P. gingivalis growth, accelerated its transition to ammonia-independent growth, and promoted an increase in biofilm area and aggregate size. Our coupled approach offers significant potential for advancing in vitro biofilm research. Importance: Results of our hybrid in vitro - in silico experiments advance the research on P. gingivalis physiology and its DHNA-dependent colonization of implant surfaces. Our findings reveal that DHNA accelerates P. gingivalis growth, induces aggregation and promotes colonization of titanium surfaces. For the first time, DHNA-induced P. gingivalis growth acceleration and an earlier shift away from ammonia dependency were observed fluorometrically, highlighting ammonia assimilation as a promising marker of P. gingivalis physiology during early biofilm expansion. Understanding how growth factors together with surface properties influence P. gingivalis colonization offers a basis for future preventive strategies. Our study's stringent characterization of 3D surface texture parameters is expected to improve reproducibility of biofilm-surface interactions experiments. The findings were validated using a continuum-based in silico model, initiating a hybrid approach where computational models complement in vitro research. Our interdisciplinary approach offers a versatile framework for investigating additional aspects of oral biofilms on titanium."
"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes a spectrum of disease outcomes in infected humans, ranging from asymptomatic or tolerant to lethal. While the virus itself contributes to pathogenesis, disease severity is primarily influenced by the host response to infection. One factor observed to impact the host response is sex, as epidemiological data indicates that male persons have a higher case fatality rate than females infected with MERS-CoV. However, the mechanism underlying this sex bias is unknown and disease course remains difficult to predict. This study investigates how male and female transgenic mice expressing humanized dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (hDPP4) respond to MERS-CoV infection following exposure to either a tolerance-inducing low dose or lethal high dose. We observed that female hDPP4 mice display dose-dependent tolerance to infection and males experienced uniformly lethal disease in both dosing groups. Longitudinal transcriptomic analysis revealed that males suppress innate and inflammatory responses early after infection, causing delayed induction of the host antiviral response. In contrast, high dose females mount an immediate and sustained interferon and inflammatory response, activating antiviral effectors and interferon-stimulated genes. Tolerant females displayed the greatest transcriptional control, showing no pathway enrichment and minimal changes in weight throughout infection. Our results suggest that the magnitude of the response is driven by dose while the nature of the response in shaped by sex. Females mount a more robust response to MERS-CoV infection, allowing females to tolerate low-dose infection but causing uncontrolled inflammation after high dose infection. In contrast, males experienced lethal outcomes regardless of dose. By examining the dynamics of sex-biased host transcriptional responses in determining disease severity, this study highlights the importance of sex as a biological variable in coronavirus pathogenesis research."
"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a hallmark pathogen of cystic fibrosis (CF) airway infections, capable of reaching high cell densities despite its limited ability to directly utilize mucin glycoproteins as a nutrient source. In the CF lung, however, P. aeruginosa may access preferred carbon sources (e.g., amino acids and short-chain fatty acids) through metabolic cross-feeding with co-colonizing mucin-degrading microbes. Although host-derived enzymes such as neutrophil elastase can also degrade mucins, the extent to which host-mediated mucin breakdown supports P. aeruginosa growth remains unclear. Thus, here we compared the nutritional impact of microbial versus host mucolytic activity on P. aeruginosa physiology. Analyses of CF sputum revealed patient-specific variability in mucin integrity that is shaped by both host and microbial factors. We demonstrate that mucin degradation by anaerobic bacteria through proteolysis, glycolysis, and fermentation, promotes robust P. aeruginosa growth, unlike mucin processed by neutrophil elastase alone. Targeted metabolomics identified acetate and propionate as key metabolites driving this cross-feeding, while transcriptomic and phenotypic analyses revealed that P. aeruginosa engages in diauxic growth on a broader set of mucin-derived substrates. Unexpectedly, cross-feeding with anaerobes triggered the induction of P. aeruginosa denitrification and fermentation pathways, suggesting redox remodeling despite being cultured under oxygen-replete conditions. Finally, the transcriptional profile of P. aeruginosa grown on anaerobe-conditioned mucins more closely resembled its in vivo gene expression, more so than when grown on intact or neutrophil-degraded mucins. Together, these findings provide new insight into the potential role of interspecies metabolic interactions in shaping pathogen physiology in the inflammatory, polymicrobial, and mucus-rich environment of the CF airways."
"Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease with limited treatment options and significant unmet medical need. Here, we report the development of a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET)-based target engagement assay in live intact cells to identify and validate cell-permeable, ATP-competitive inhibitors of Leishmania mexicana (Lmx)CLK1. LmxCLK2, a closely related paralogue with an identical protein kinase domain, is also considered in our analysis. Genetic and pharmacological evidence indicates that simultaneous deletion or inhibition of both LmxCLK1/2 is lethal to the parasite. Using our newly developed assay, we screened a library of human kinase inhibitors and identified WZ8040, a third-generation EGFR inhibitor, as a potent LmxCLK1 ligand. WZ8040 demonstrated robust target engagement in both promastigotes and macrophage-internalized amastigotes, with low micromolar EC50 values for parasite killing and minimal toxicity to host macrophages. Biochemical assays confirmed that WZ8040 covalently binds and inhibits LmxCLK1, with mass spectrometry identifying Cys172 as the primary site of modification. Genetic validation using overexpression and knockout lines supports LmxCLK1 as the primary target of WZ8040. However, the retained activity of WZ8040 in mutant lines with the Cys172Ala substitution suggests that covalent binding is not essential for compound efficacy. Our findings highlight the utility of BRET-based assays for target validation in kinetoplastid parasites and underscore the potential of CLK1 as a druggable kinase in Leishmania. This integrated approach provides a framework for accelerating the discovery of novel anti-leishmanial agents through target engagement-guided strategies."
"Mitochondrial transplantation is a promising but still experimental strategy for treating ischemic and metabolic disorders. A key barrier to its advancement is the lack of scalable, non-invasive methods for tracking transplanted extracellular mitochondria in vivo. Technetium-99m (Tc-99m) radiopharmaceuticals, widely used in SPECT imaging, may offer a clinically compatible solution. Cryopreserved mitochondria derived from HEK-293 cells were incubated with Tc-99m sestamibi, tetrofosmin, pertechnetate, or control solutions. After brief incubation and washing, mitochondrial pellets were analyzed for retained radioactivity. ATP content was measured to assess metabolic function, and electron microscopy was used to evaluate ultrastructural integrity. Tc-99m sestamibi and tetrofosmin showed labeling efficiencies of 2.74% and 2.68%, respectively. Pertechnetate demonstrated minimal uptake (0.34%). Radiolabeled mitochondria retained ATP production comparable to controls. Electron microscopy showed preserved double membranes and cristae. Controls confirmed assay specificity and viability. To our knowledge, this is the first report of radiolabeling isolated mitochondria with clinically approved Tc-99m agents. This platform supports the development of SPECT-compatible protocols for visualizing viable transplanted mitochondria in recipient tissues."
"Methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) is an epigenetic reader essential for neuronal function, but how it binds DNA methylation within chromatin is unclear. Using designer nucleosomes we observe that MeCP2 preferentially engages DNA methylation positioned at multiple sites around the nucleosome. Surprisingly, MeCP2 can bind methylated DNA in bent, histone-contacting core nucleosomal DNA. However, this activity requires additional DNA linker interactions, using MeCP2 regions beyond its canonical methyl binding domain. We mapped a novel DNA-binding region in MeCP2 required for this function. Furthermore, histone H1 antagonises the MeCP2-nucleosome interaction by competing for linker DNA. Overall, this reveals that MeCP2 combines nonspecific but essential interactions with linker DNA to aid specific binding to nucleosomal methylated DNA, independent of nucleosome structure. Our findings reveal a novel contribution to full MeCP2 function, and mechanistic insight into how this clinically important protein interacts with chromatin."
"Background: Non-translated transcripts (nt-RNAs) with frame-shifts or premature termination codons resulting from alternative splicing events (ASE), have been recently found at unexpectedly abundant in transcriptomes of cancer tissue. However, their full genomic spectrum has not yet been fully elucidated. This study comprehensively characterised the expression of signature junctions of these nt-RNA (termed 'toxic junctions' here) of both known and novel nt-RNA across multiple cancer types and investigated their potential as biomarkers. Methods: RNA-seq data of ~6,000 samples, including the tumor and normal samples for 13 cancer types were retrieved from The Cancer Genome Atlas database (TCGA) together with data from Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) project. Due to the difficulty in quantifying the entire transcript isoform of nt-RNA, we pioneered an algorithm to focus exclusively on the expression of junctional reads, which also circumvented the limitation of non-directional RNA-seq of TCGA data. We showed that the majority of nt-RNA is associated with at least one toxic junction. We built a comprehensive catalogue of known nt-RNA toxic junctions from genome databases. And novel toxic junctions were also identified by a new junction-focused algorithm from the higher quality discovery subsets of TCGA data. Splicing in Ratio (SiR) was used to quantify ASE leading to nt-RNA, enabling: 1. Differential expression analysis between cancer and normal tissue and across cancer types.2. Identification of different profiles of nt-RNA abundance and various factor which may be the causes of differential nt-RNA abundance and SiR results 3. Identification of specific nt-RNA and toxic junctions that were expressed in various cancer (and/or normal tissue) types. 4. Assessment of nt-RNA and their toxic junction expression as biomarkers or prognosis indicators. Results: We profiled the expressed known nt-RNA (toxic) junctions of known transcripts and discovered ~22,000 novel toxic junctions out of ~250,000 novel junctions found in the transcriptome data. The expression of nt-RNA was as high as 10% of all transcripts of the corresponding gene in cancer transcriptomes. Interestingly, some signature toxic junctions of nt-RNA are expressed in even higher quantities, e.g. up to 50% or more, which is reminiscent of a heterozygous mutation. We identified distinct patterns between cancer and normal samples, including example of nt-RNA expressing toxic junctions exclusively in normal or tumor samples. Clinically relevant examples included ANXA6 in breast cancer, where the nt-RNA isoform showed significantly higher expression in tumors (p=1.8e-15). In kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), a significant isoform switch of ESYT2 based on the RNA-seq data was confirmed. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that samples with the higher expression ratio of ESYT2-L are associated with better survival (p=2.0e-06). Unsupervised clustering showed that SiR results of 150 toxic signatures defined 4 subgroups of patients with different prognosis. Through principal component analysis (PCA), PC1 and PC2 can be used as an independent prognosis biomarkers. nt-RNA accounting for these PCs included splicing factors SRSF3 and CLK1, where CLK1 phosphorylates SRSF3 to promote exon 4 inclusion in both genes. Conclusions: In summary, the expression profiles of all known and novel toxic junctions were explored using pan-cancer RNA-seq data. A dual 10% rule emerged from this study: ~10% of novel junctions were toxic junctions associated with nt-RNA, and up to 10% of RNA transcripts inside a cell were also nt-RNA. The SiR metric enables accurate quantification of unproductive splicing and identification of cancer biomarkers. Our findings reveal that unproductive splicing represents functionally important post-transcriptional regulation in cancer. These expression profiles allow researchers to study the expression of nt-RNA signature junctions or novel signature junctions in or near the genes they are interested in, which could provide a new direction for their research. The SRSF3-CLK1 regulatory mechanism provides insights into splicing dysregulation. Our comprehensive toxic junction catalogue serves as a valuable resource, suggesting that targeting unproductive splicing pathways may offer novel therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment. Data availability: The catalogue is available on GitHub and UCSC browser. https://github.com/danhuang0909/nt_database for GitHub overview https://genome.ucsc.edu/s/dandan_0909/hg38_all_new_nr for genome browsing of all novel (unannotated) toxic junctions https://genome.ucsc.edu/s/dandan_0909/hg38_5_26 for toxic junctions in known (annotated) nt-RNA."
"Microbial communities often exhibit apparently complex dynamics driven by myriad interactions among community members and with their environments. Yet, practical modeling and control are often based on limited number of observables, raising a fundamental question: to what extent are these observed dynamics predictable given unobserved background complexity? Here, we report an emergent simplicity that the temporal dynamics of observable microbial populations can be captured by low-dimensional representations. Using variational autoencoders (VAEs), we define a critical latent dimension (Ec) that quantifies the minimal number of variables required to represent observable microbial dynamics. We find that Ec scales linearly with the number of observables, despite the complexity of unobserved background dynamics. This principle holds across simulations of ecological, spatial, and gene-transfer models, experiments with engineered and environment-derived communities, and human microbiomes. Our findings establish a scaling law for microbial community dynamics and demonstrate observable dynamics alone contain sufficient information for prediction and control, even without full knowledge of the community."
"Accounting for more deaths than any other bacterial species, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) represents a critical threat to public health worldwide. A key factor contributing to Mtb's virulence is its unique cell envelope, which acts as a protective barrier. Among the components of this envelope, lipoproteins represent a critical but understudied group of proteins. In this study, we focused on 79 conserved putative lipoproteins, shared between Mtb and the closely related M. marinum. Leveraging the CRISPR1-Cas9 (Sth1Cas9) gene editing system for Mycobacteria, we generated frameshift mutations, targeting one conserved lipoprotein-coding gene at a time. We identified two mutants, lpqZ and fecB, that exhibited increased susceptibility to all tested antibiotics, suggesting essential roles in cell envelope biogenesis. Interestingly, despite having homology to periplasmic substrate binding proteins (SBPs), neither protein is associated with any inner membrane transporter complex. Instead, co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that LpqZ interacts with AftA and FecB interacts with AftB. Both these interaction partners are essential enzymes involved in arabinogalactan and lipoarabinomannan synthesis. Accordingly, we observed alterations for both glycoconjugates in lpqZ and fecB mutants. Together, these findings show that orphaned SBP-like proteins have been neofunctionalized in mycobacteria to aid key enzymes involved in cell envelope biosynthesis."
"Cyclic oligonucleotide-based anti-phage signalling systems (CBASS) are widespread prokaryotic antiviral defense mechanisms that function through coordinated cyclase-effector interactions. Upon sensing viral infection, the cyclase produces a signal molecule that activates effector function and causes cell dormancy or death. However, the evolutionary origins and functional independence of CBASS components remain unclear. Type II CBASS systems commonly employ TIR-SAVED domain effector proteins that deplete cellular NAD during viral infection. Here, we demonstrate that a TIR-SAVED effector protein can operate as a standalone antiviral defense, causing significant growth inhibition and approximately 50% viral clearance during infection in the complete absence of its cognate cyclase. Remarkably, we show that the TIR-SAVED effector can sense cyclic di-AMP, a conserved second messenger produced by the host diadenylate cyclase DacZ, when the canonical CBASS signal is absent. This antiviral activity was associated with depletion of cellular NAD and required intact conserved functional residues within both the TIR and SAVED domains. These findings reveal a novel mechanism of antiviral signalling that expands the functional repertoire of CBASS. They also provide insights into the modular evolution of complex prokaryotic immune systems, suggesting that what are now CBASS effectors might have evolved as independent defense components before being integrated into multi-protein systems."
"Peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) are versatile tools for diagnostic and therapeutic applications, including gene regulation and miRNA targeting. However, their therapeutic potential is often limited by challenges such as biological efficacy. To address this, PNAs offer a key advantage over other nucleic acids--their ease of modification, which allows for enhanced properties. In this study, we introduced a novel {gamma}-amino carboxylic acid ({gamma}-ACA) modification to PNAs targeting miR-221-3p, a key miRNA implicated in various pathological processes. The modified PNAs showed significantly improved binding affinity to their targets and more efficient inhibition of miR-221-3p expression compared to unmodified PNAs in A549 cells, leading to effective regulation of downstream gene and protein expression. These results highlight the potential of {gamma}-modified PNAs as a platform for developing miRNA-targeted therapeutics."
"Tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily 1A gene (TNFRSF1A) encodes the TNFR1 protein, a critical regulator of inflammation implicated in various diseases. Using ScanFold with the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) GUI, we identified novel RNA structural elements within the TNFRSF1A gene. Focusing on the 3'UTR, these structures were characterized using reporter assays and targeted DMS-MaPseq. We identified a structured region that may play a role in regulating TNFR1 translation and that was also found to associate with HuR, a key regulatory RNA-binding protein. These findings provide a framework for identifying and characterizing potential functional RNA structures in therapeutically relevant genes, suggesting a new layer of post-transcriptional regulation for TNFR1 expression."
"The origin of life likely involved a complex interplay between organic molecules and mineral surfaces, yet the molecular details of these interactions remain poorly understood. Over recent decades, considerable research has focused on the individual roles of key biomolecules - such as RNA, lipids, and proteins - in early biogenesis. However, this reductionist view offers only a partial picture; the emergence of life likely involved networks of molecular interactions that collectively shaped early functional assemblies. In this study, we examine the potential of peptides - arguably the most abundant early polymers - to interact with mineral surfaces and lipid vesicles, representing prebiotically plausible interfaces and compartments. Focusing on peptide compositions derived from prebiotically plausible amino acids, we demonstrate that such early peptides could bind mineral surfaces (e.g., fluorapatite) via negatively charged residues. Nevertheless, the recruitment of amino acids from the modern alphabet was likely adaptive for favorable interactions with lipid vesicles and could lead to enhanced functional behavior, such as promoting phosphate release. Our findings suggest that the evolving complexity of the peptide/protein alphabet was a key factor in the evolution of protocells and could enhance early catalytic functions at the interface of geochemistry and biochemistry."
"How the approximately 300 human protein kinases identify their dedicated substrates despite the significant overlap of their phosphorylation consensus sequences is relevant for nearly all cellular processes. We show here that the Cdk8/19-CycC kinase uses mutually exclusive targeting and activation factors to facilitate distinct cellular roles. The Med12 protein is known to target Cdk8/19-CycC to the mediator of transcription complex to control the transcription of specific gene sets upon respective stimuli. We describe that a second Cdk8/19-CycC targeting factor exists, the replication origin firing regulator MTBP that targets the kinase to Med12-independent cellular roles. Both Med12 and MTBP constitute allosteric activators of the enzymatic Cdk8/19-CycC kinase activity in vitro. We describe the structural basis of this activation that involves distinct mechanisms how Med12 and MTBP reposition the T-loop of the kinase independently of T-loop phosphorylation - the canonical mechanism of CDK kinase activation. Our results support the following model: the Cdk8/19-CycC dimer alone has low enzymatic activity, which may help avoid off-target phosphorylation. Med12, MTBP and potentially other as yet unidentified accessory factors, target the kinase to distinct molecular environments, at the same time activating kinase activity for efficient substrate phosphorylation. Our work establishes an unusual mechanism of CDK kinase control and change the current paradigm how Cdk8/19-CycC selects its substrates. Substrate selection of the kinase may be relevant for cancer biology and therapy because Cdk8 is a well-established colorectal cancer promoting factor."
"Targeted protein degradation (TPD) via PROTACs and molecular glues holds significant therapeutic promise but demands detailed mechanistic evaluation in live cells to fully understand compound behavior and optimize efficacy. Here, we present an integrated, cell-first platform that combines a modular degradation assay with E3 ligase target engagement readouts for comprehensive assessment of TPD molecules in cells and use it to evaluate PROTACs towards NUDT5. To mimic endogenous degradation conditions and TPD amenability, we established a fusion protein expression system consisting of a lysine-free FKBP12 F36V PROTAC handle (FKBPVK0) and used a HiBiT/akaLuc dual luciferase reporter to accurately measure degradation dynamics. This set-up identified a VHL-dependent NUDT5 PROTAC, DDD2, that induced robust NUDT5 degradation, despite impaired NUDT5 binding in vitro and in cellulo, but no CRBN-dependent degraders. NUDT5 lysine availability mapping with DDD2 and FKBP12 F36V-directed PROTACs suggested that the CRL4CRBN complex is more sensitive to target lysine accessibility than CRL2VHL, which may have implications for E3 ligase choice and therapeutic resistance. CeTEAM drug biosensors were also established towards CRBN and VHL to quantitatively monitor degrader engagement in living cells and confirmed that the tested CRBN-directed NUDT5 PROTACs poorly engaged the E3. All together, this platform provides a versatile and scalable framework for TPD molecule discovery in a cellular context."
"Transcription factor 4 (TCF4), a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein, plays a critical role in neurodevelopment and is genetically linked to disorders such as Pitt-Hopkins syndrome (PTHS) and schizophrenia. While TCF4 is known to function through sequence-specific DNA binding, the influence of its intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) on its molecular behavior remains scattered. The TCF4 deletion mutant, lacking a fragment of the bHLH domain, forms puncta in the nucleus, which are reminiscent of patterns observed in disease-associated TCF4 mutants. Our in vitro analyses have demonstrated that the shortest human isoform of TCF4 (TCF4-I-), which is predominant in the brain and contains extensive IDRs, undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in vitro. LLPS is promoted by increased ionic strength and molecular crowding, resulting in dynamic, liquid-like condensates that coalesce and display rapid fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). Over time, these condensates mature, exhibiting increased viscosity while retaining molecular mobility. Importantly, we show that both specific and non-specific DNA sequences dissolve TCF4 condensates. This suggests that DNA binding competitively inhibits the multivalent interactions necessary for phase separation. These findings indicate that LLPS driven by TCF4 is a reversible process, likely involved in transcriptional activation bursts. We propose that mutations that disrupt DNA binding or localization may trap TCF4 in aberrant condensates, contributing to PTHS pathogenesis through dysregulated phase behavior. Our findings offer a mechanistic link between TCF4 structural features, phase separation, and its transcriptional function, providing novel insight into how mutations in this TF may drive neurological disease through aberrant biomolecular condensation."
"Enzymes play a pivotal role in ""green chemistry"" as tools for biocatalysis. Oxidoreductase enzymes are especially useful for carrying out key electron transfer (redox) steps towards a wide range of chemical transformations (e.g., asymmetric hydrogenation, oxygenation, hydroxylation, epoxidation, or Baeyer-Villiger oxidation) that might not otherwise be available to chemists through conventional (nonbiological) synthetic approaches. The ability to screen oxidoreductase activity is important in identifying useful biocatalysts from nature, and also towards engineering novel ones through directed evolution. Many valuable redox enzymes are dependent upon NAD(P)H as an electron donating co-substrate (or conversely, upon NAD(P)+ as an electron acceptor), and the common method to detect their activity is to monitor the change in absorbance at 340 nm as NAD(P)H is converted to NAD(P)+ (or vice versa). The limited sensitivity of this method presents a challenge in detecting very low levels of oxidoreductase activity, and this can prove very difficult to begin engineering enzymes as improved biocatalysts when the rates of natural enzymes may be slow for a desired redox reaction. Herein, we report a fluorescence-based, enzyme cascade-coupled system that we have developed to detect oxidoreductase activity with orders of magnitude more sensitivity than conventional absorbance-based assays. While recycling NAD(P)H from NAD(P)+, the coupled enzyme cascade triggers cleavage of a fluorogenically labeled probe, releasing a strong fluorescent signal. This allows detection of very low levels of a specific oxidoreductase activity that we may wish to magnify by directed evolution using our assay in high-throughput screening."
"Protein-based microparticles are promising materials for applications such as biocatalysis and biomolecular capture, yet their fabrication by existing techniques remains challenging due to protein denaturation or lack of spatial control. Here, we present a method for synthesizing microscale protein-based materials by chemically crosslinking biomolecular condensates. Leveraging the liquid-liquid phase separation behavior of intrinsically disordered RGG domains, we sequestered RGG-tagged fusion proteins into droplets, then we solidified them into porous microparticles using the homobifunctional, amine-reactive crosslinker BS3. By modulating protein concentration and condensate coalescence, we controlled microparticle size from <1 to >40 m. We then demonstrated three encodable functionalities: We used the SpyCatcher/SpyTag system to capture cargo proteins, we crosslinked core-shell condensates to generate microparticles with controlled spatial organization, and we immobilized a thermostable alcohol dehydrogenase with 31% retained enzymatic activity. These POMPOMS (protein-based, self-organized microparticles of multifunctional significance) represent a sustainable, tunable platform for versatile protein-based materials."
"Many proteins require molecular chaperones to fold into their functional native forms. Previously we used limited proteolysis mass-spectrometry (LiP-MS) to find that ca. 40% of the E. coli proteome do not efficiently refold spontaneously following dilution from denaturation, a frequency that drops to ca. 15% once molecular chaperones like DnaK or GroEL are provided. However, the roles of chaperones during primary biogenesis in vivo can differ from the functions they play during in vitro refolding experiments. Here, we used LiP-MS to probe structural changes incurred by the E. coli proteome when two key chaperones, trigger factor and DnaKJ, are deleted. While knocking out DnaKJ induces pervasive structural perturbations across the soluble E. coli proteome, trigger factor deletion only impacts a small number of proteins' structures. Overall, proteins which cannot spontaneously refold (or require chaperones to refold in vitro) are not more likely to be dependent on chaperones to fold in vivo. For instance, the glycolytic enzyme, phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), cannot refold to its native form in vitro following denaturation (even with chaperones), but by LiP-MS we find that its structure is unperturbed upon DnaKJ or Tig deletion, which is further supported with biochemical and biophysical assays. Thus, PGK folds to its native structure most efficiently during co-translational folding and does so without chaperone assistance. This behaviour is generally found among chaperone-nonrefolders (proteins that cannot refold even with chaperone assistance), strengthening the view that chaperone-nonrefolders are obligate co-translational folders. Hence, for some E. coli proteins, the vectorial nature of co-translational folding is the most important ""chaperone."""
"Despite their limited size, ponds are ecologically important habitats that harbor rich microbial communities and play key roles in global biodiversity and biogeochemical cycling. In this study, we conducted a metagenomic survey of microbial diversity in three ponds - Vermelha, Grande, and Furnas - situated within the Atlantic Rainforest biome in Brazil. Vermelha and Grande are natural, remote, and minimally impacted by human activity, whereas Furnas is an artificial pond with greater human accessibility and long-term anthropogenic influence. Using a long-read nanopore shotgun metagenomics approach, we sequenced DNA extracted from pond water, assembled metagenomes, and performed taxonomic classification and functional annotation. From these datasets, 21 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) were recovered. Our results reveal pond-specific microbial community compositions and functional profiles. Although a direct temporal comparison would require synchronized sampling, the current data offer compelling snapshots of microbial diversity. Vermelha was characterized by high cyanobacterial diversity and exclusive Planctomycetes, while Furnas displayed broader taxonomic diversity, and more notable Actinobacteria and Patescibacteria. Viral communities, including dsDNA bacteriophages and eukaryotic viruses, also varied across sites, with Prasinovirus consistently detected in all ponds. Functional annotation identified putative antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), most of them in Furnas, potentially reflecting human impact. Besides ARGs, cyanotoxin biosynthesis genes-especially those linked to microcystin production- were predominantly found in Vermelha. Our findings underscore the ecological distinctiveness of each pond and demonstrate the utility of nanopore-based metagenomics for investigating microbial biodiversity in understudied freshwater ecosystems. This work provides knowledge on microbial community structure and anthropogenic influence in tropical pond environments, with implications for conservation and biotechnological exploration."
"Loss of NF2 tumor suppressor activity causes NF2-related schwannomatosis. Proximity biotinylation identified proteins proximal to Merlin isoform 1 and isoform 2 at confluence, when Merlin is active, but not in sub-confluent, growing cells. These data confirmed Merlin involvement in cell-cell and cell-substrate junctions, identified new signal transduction pathways, and highlighted a role for Merlin in intracellular transport. Direct binding assays identified the small GTPases RalA and RalB as high affinity PIP2-dependent Merlin binding proteins that co-localized with RalA/B on the plasma membrane. Merlin loss resulted in aberrant activation of RalA and RalB at high cell density. Merlin competitively inhibited RalB binding to its exocyst effectors Sec5 and Exo84 and regulated the kinetics of exocytosis in a RalB dependent manner. Thus, RalB is a novel binding partner for active Merlin, and the RalA/B pathway is a possible therapeutic target to treat NF2-related schwannoma."
"Biofilm formation allows pathogenic nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) to adhere to household plumbing systems and has been observed in vivo during human infection. Glucose drives NTM aggregation in vitro, and ammonium inhibits it, but the regulatory systems controlling this early step in biofilm formation are not understood. Here, we show that a variety of carbon and nitrogen sources have similar impacts on aggregation in the model NTM Mycobacterium smegmatis as glucose and ammonium, suggesting that the response to these nutrients is general and likely sensed through downstream, integrated signals. Next, we performed a transposon screen in M. smegmatis to uncover these putative regulatory nodes. Our screen revealed that mutating specific genes in the purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis pathways caused an aggregation defect, but supplementing with adenosine and guanosine had no impact on aggregation either in a purF mutant or WT. Realizing that the only genes we hit in purine or pyrimidine biosynthesis were those that utilized glutamine as a nitrogen donor, we pivoted to the hypothesis that intracellular glutamine could be a nitrogen-responsive node affecting aggregation. We tested this hypothesis in defined M63 medium using targeted mass spectrometry. Indeed, intracellular glutamine increased with nitrogen availability and correlated with planktonic growth. Furthermore, a garA mutant, which has an artificially expanded glutamine pool in growth phase, grew solely as planktonic cells even without nitrogen supplementation. Altogether these results establish that intracellular glutamine controls M. smegmatis aggregation, and they introduce flux-dependent sensors as key components of the NTM biofilm regulatory system."
"Ecological studies of pollinators often require long-term and extensive monitoring, posing a significant cost and limitation to research. Traditional sampling methods of observation such as sweep netting and pan trapping provide valuable information on pollinator diversity, but scale poorly when conducting large sampling efforts across space and time. We introduce ""buzzdetect"", our tool to apply deep learning models to audio data for conducting passive acoustic monitoring on pollinators, and test our accompanying audio classification model. The model is capable of distinguishing the buzzing of insect flight from environmental noise with a sensitivity of 27% at a precision (true positive rate) of 95%. Application of buzzdetect to recordings made in pumpkin, watermelon, mustard, and soybean reveals differences in timing and intensity of foraging: foraging occurred the earliest in pumpkins and the latest for soybean while foraging activity was most intensive in mustard."
"Whales play a crucial role in marine ecosystems, yet many populations face growing environmental pressures. Among them, the fin whale, Balaenoptera physalus, from the Mediterranean Sea remains poorly characterized at the genomic level despite its classification as Endangered and decreasing in population size due to habitat degradation, climate change, and human-induced disturbances. Previous studies based on bioacoustics and telemetry data suggest the presence of resident and migratory subgroups, but the genetic isolation of this population remains uncertain. Here, we sequenced and analysed for the first time whole genomes of the Mediterranean fin whale to provide a comprehensive genomic characterization of this population, assessing its genomic variability, genetic load, population structure and potential for adaptation to environmental stressors. By comparing genomic data from Mediterranean fin whales with populations from the North Atlantic, North Pacific, and the Sea of Cortez (also sequenced in the present study), we aim to determine the degree of genetic isolation and contextualize the Mediterranean population within a broader evolutionary and conservation framework. Our results showed that while Mediterranean fin whales form a distinct genetic cluster, they are not entirely isolated from North Atlantic populations, with gene flow persisting at low levels. Furthermore, we identified a complex substructure within the Mediterranean, supporting the existence of a resident subpopulation. Although this population preserves moderate levels of genomic diversity and adaptive potential, it remains vulnerable to genomic erosion due to continued demographic decline, limited connectivity, and increasing environmental stressors. These findings underscore the urgency of targeted conservation actions and long-term genetic monitoring, especially as climate change accelerates and introduces increasingly unpredictable selective pressures that may exacerbate the risk of genomic erosion and threaten population viability."
"Human-swarm interaction (HSI) explores how humans engage with distributed collective systems, aiming to incorporate human cognition into scalable and robust robotic swarms. While most HSI research focuses on remote teleoperation via engineered interfaces, real-world integration of swarms into everyday tasks requires natural, embodied interactions in shared physical spaces. To address the limitations of traditional teleoperation studies, and the high resource demands of using physical robot swarms for HSI research, we introduce CoBe XR, a spatial augmented reality system that projects virtual swarms into the physical environment of the human operator. CoBe XR enables real-time, fine-grained, natural interaction between humans and swarm-like agents through full-body movement without dedicated control interfaces or prior training. As a proof-of-concept, we present a behavioral study involving 40 participants who influenced swarm behavior solely through walking. Our results show that human participants were able to adapt to the collective dynamics of the swarm and control it through natural perception-motion control in a shared physical space. We argue that similar extended reality systems can not only reveal how humans perceive and adapt to collective dynamics, but they offer a general platform to understand human behavior or an intermediate solution to design embodied robot swarms."
"Sawflies (Insecta: Symphyta) use their ovipositors to incise plant tissue and deposit eggs, a task that demands precise substrate discrimination while preserving both ovipositor and host. How a passive selective mechanical system such as the ovipositor can discriminate between substrates based on material properties without active sensing or control remained until now an open question. This article presents an analytical model of the selective cutting mechanism inspired by sawfly ovipositors. Substrate cutting is shown to depend on an ultimate stress threshold determined by the interaction between blade geometry and substrate properties. The model captures the transition between cutting and ejection as a competition between a failure and an ejection criterion. Morphological modifiers, including serrulae and banding patterns, are shown to influence the ultimate stress threshold and are strongly dependent on both substrate hardness and elastic modulus. The model explains key previously reported observations obtained from prior experimental work that used scaled up biomimetic blades. These findings suggest novel directions in the design of surgical tools required to cut heterogeneous tissues with minimal extraneous damage."
"The blood-brain barrier (BBB) significantly hinders the treatment of central nervous system (CNS) disorders and brain tumors with intact BBB by restricting the entry of most therapeutic agents, including small-molecule drugs and particularly larger macromolecules. Liposomal formulations, such as PEGylated liposomes with long blood half-lives, high drug-carrying capacity, and reduced off-site toxicity, can be useful for brain drug delivery, but their large size often limits BBB penetration. A novel liposomal doxorubicin formulation, Talidox (Innomedica), with a smaller size (~36 nm), increased blood circulation half-life, and better stability than previous clinical formulations, can be a suitable choice for brain delivery. This study investigated Talidox delivery to the brain through focused ultrasound (FUS)-mediated BBB transient opening. Radiolabelling of Talidox via intraliposomal 89Zr enabled Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging for whole-body non-invasive, real-time monitoring of biodistribution and pharmacokinetics. Following FUS-mediated BBB opening in mice, PET imaging revealed a significant increase in brain uptake compared to non-FUS controls, achieving a 14-fold higher accumulation. Additional validation using passive acoustic detection, microscopy, autoradiography, and cryo-fluorescence tomography demonstrated successful brain distribution that correlated with PET imaging results. These findings underscore the potential of combining Talidox with FUS for effective, non-invasive drug delivery to the brain and highlight the advantages of PET imaging as a modality for non-invasive, longitudinal quantification of drug delivery to the brain."
"Ladybird beetles (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) represent a highly diverse insect group comprising over 6000 species. Recently, an increasing amount of omics data on ladybirds has accumulated. To better understand their roles and adaptations in biological control, we developed LadybirdBase (http://www.ladybirdbase.com/), a comprehensive database that compiles both published and self-collected data on ladybird beetles. It contains five main modules that encompass: (1) the Biology Module summarizing information on over 6000 species, including their classification, morphology, diet, distribution, and omics data; (2) the Ecology Module offering diet and distribution records; (3) the Genomics Module integrating published and unpublished resources such as genomes, transcriptomes, mitogenomes, orthogroups, and variance; (4) the Microbiomics Module presenting 16S rRNA, ITS, and metagenome data; and (5) the Lab Test Module covering diet ranges, life histories under different treatments, and stress tolerance. Additionally, LadybirdBase offers analysis tools for species detection using morphology or barcodes, BLAST searches against the genome resources, differential gene expression analysis, and PCR primer search. LadybirdBase can greatly simplify species identification, enhance the efficiency of omics studies, and provide a theoretical foundation for the use of ladybirds in biological control."
"The intricate molecular landscape within tissues holds crucial information about cellular behavior and disease progression, yet capturing this complexity at a spatial level remains challenging. While Spatial transcriptomics (ST) offers valuable insights into gene expression patterns within their native tissue context, its widespread adoption is hindered by high costs and limited gene detection capabilities. Here we introduce CarHE (Contrastive Alignment of gene expRession for hematoxylin and eosin image), a method that overcomes these limitations by accurately predicting high-dimensional ST data (over 10,000 genes) solely from readily available H&E (Hematoxylin and Eosin) stained images. This novel pre-trained architecture employs contrastive learning through two mechanisms: cell-type-based transcriptomics information transfer and image-based histology information transfer. These mechanisms precisely align image features with spatial single-cell gene expressions, achieving prediction accuracies exceeding 0.7 (up to 1.7 folds compared to second best) across diverse tissue types and species. CarHE's superior performance extends to identifying subtle pathological features such as tertiary lymphoid structures in various cancers, including breast cancer, lung cancer, melanoma and ccRCC (clear cell renal cell carcinoma), and reconstructing 3D spatial transcriptomics from images alone, offering a cost-effective and robust alternative for large-scale spatial transcriptomics. We further validated CarHE's effectiveness by predicting DFS (Disease-Free Survival) from >1,600 lung cancer patients HE images, achieving a significantly higher AUC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve) of 0.73 compared to state-of-the-art alternatives (0.58-0.64)."
"FastGA finds alignments between two genome sequences more than an order of magnitude faster than previous methods that have comparable sensitivity. Its speed is due to (a) a carefully engineered architecture involving only cache-coherent MSD radix sorts and merges, (b) a novel algorithm for finding adaptive seed hits in a linear merge of sorted k-mer tables, and (c) a variant of the Myers adaptive wave algorithm to find alignments around a chain of seed hits that detects alignments with up to 25-30% variation. It further does not require pre-masking of repetitive sequence, and stores millions of alignments in a fraction of the space of a conventional CIGAR-string using a trace-point encoding that is further compressed by the ONEcode data system introduced here. As an example, two bat genomes of size 2.2Gbp and 2.5Gbp can be compared in a little over 2 minutes using 8 threads on an Apple M4 Max laptop using 5.7GB of memory and producing 1.05 million alignments totaling 1.63Gbp of aligned sequence that cover about 60% of each genome. The output ALN-formated file occupies 66MB. This file can be converted to a PAF file with CIGAR strings in 6 seconds, where the PAF representation is a significantly larger 1.03GB file. FastGA is freely available at github: http://www.github.com/thegenemyers/FASTGA, along with utilities for viewing inputs, intermediate files, and outputs and transforming outputs into other common formats. Specifically, FastGA can, in addition to its highly efficient ONEcode representation, output PSL-formatted alignments, or PAF-formatted alignments with or without CIGAR strings explicitly encoding the alignments. There is also a utility to chain FastGA's alignments and display them in a dot-plot like view in Postscript files, and an interactive viewer is in development."
"Chickpea, is the second most consumed food legume, and significantly contributes to the human diet. Chickpea seeds are rich in a wide range of metabolites including bioactive specialized metabolites influencing nutritional qualities and human health. However, the genetic basis underlying the metabolite-based nutrient quality in chickpea remains poorly understood. Here we dissected the genetic architecture of seed metabolic diversity and explored how domestication shaped the chickpea metabolome. Through UPLC-MS we quantify over 3400 metabolic features in 509 chickpea seeds accessions from three independent multi-location field trials. The metabolite genome-wide association study (mGWAS) detected around 130,000 leading SNPs corresponding to 1890 metabolites across different environments. We further found and functionally validated a gene cluster of three CabHLH transcription factors that regulate soyasaponin biosynthesis in chickpea seeds. Our results reveal new insights on the effects of domestication process on chickpea metabolome. and provide valuable resources for the genetic improvement of the bioactive compounds in chickpea seeds."
"Cell growth rates exhibit cell-intrinsic cell-to-cell variability, which influences cell fitness and size homeostasis from bacteria to cancer. Whether this variability arises from noise in cell growth or cell division processes, or originates from cell-size-dependent growth rates, remains unclear. To separate these potential sources of growth variability, single-cell growth rates need to be examined across different timescales. Here, we study cell-intrinsic size and growth regulation by tracking lymphocytic leukemia cell mass accumulation with high precision and minute-scale temporal resolution along long ancestral lineages. We first show that cell-size-dependent growth regulation and asymmetric division of cell size do not explain cell-to-cell growth variability. We then isolate growth fluctuations from overlapping cell-cycle-dependent growth using a Gaussian process regression analysis. We find that these growth fluctuations drive cell-to-cell growth variability within ancestral lineages despite being independent of cell divisions, cell cycle, and cell size. Overall, our results indicate that cell-intrinsic long-term patterns in cell growth are a byproduct of short-term growth fluctuations."
"Resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) and resting state effective connectivity (rsEC) are two of the most common measures that can be extracted from resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data. RSFC is often used to indicate the statistical dependencies among different brain regions of interest, whereas rsEC describes the causal influences among them. Many studies have explored utilities of rsFC and rsEC measures for classifying psychiatric conditions. Several studies showed that rsEC were better than rsFC features for classifying major depression (Frassle et al., 2020; Geng et al., 2018) and schizophrenia ((Brodersen et al., 2014)). However, no study to-date has investigated whether rsEC is inherently better than rsFC for classifying psychiatric conditions or the impact of autocorrelation on classifying rsFC, even though autocorrelation is known to be present in rs-fMRI data. To fill these gaps, we performed a series of computational experiments, by varying the size of the network and the number of participants, to gain some insight into these two aspects of supervised classification with resting state connectivity. Contrary to what has been reported in the literature, the results from our study suggest that rsEC cannot be, in principle, better than rsFC features for classification. In fact, rsEC measures led to systematically worse classification results, compared to rsFC features. In terms of the impact of autocorrelation, we found that lag-one autocorrelation could lead to both false negative and false positive classification results for studies with a small sample size."
"Understanding how zoonotic viruses spill over from wildlife to humans requires direct ecological observation at reservoir host interfaces, yet such events remain rare in the literature, and no such interface has been documented at scale. As part of a broader long-term study on African leopard (Panthera pardus) population ecology in Queen Elizabeth National Park, Uganda, we deployed camera traps on animal trails and at Python Cave, a known roost site of Egyptian fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus) and a confirmed Marburg and virus reservoir. This serendipitous deployment yielded the first visual documentation of a multi-trophic predator and scavenger guild interacting at a filovirus reservoir site. Over a five month period (February 16th to June 5th 2025) across 304 trap nights, we recorded at least 14 different vertebrate species, including leopards, primates, raptors, and small carnivores, engaging in bat predation, scavenging on bat remains, guano foraging, or cave exploration across 261 temporally and spatially independent events (>1 hour apart). These instances were structured, repeated and the species continuously made contact with the bats or entered their roosting space. Camera traps also recorded an estimated 400 human individuals visiting the cave, including school groups, tourists, and local trainees-the majority with no personal protective equipment. The shallow, accessible structure of Python Cave appears to collapse the typical spatial buffers between reservoir species and both predators and humans. These observations constitute the first ecological confirmation of a dynamic, multispecies exposure network at a known Marburg virus site, and may represent a Rosetta Stone for interpreting the real-time mechanics of zoonotic spillover."
"The seed microbiome plays a key role in the assembly of the plant microbiome, which has major impacts on plant functioning. Nonetheless, little is known about the origin of the seed microbiome. We investigated the relative contributions of two hypothesized transmission routes: sexual inheritance (via reproductive organs) and asexual inheritance (via the plant vascular system). To do that, we sampled shoot endophytes both before bloom and at seed maturity stages, apple flower ovaries and pollen sacs, and mature seeds from field-grown apple trees (Malus domestica BORKH. cv 'Gala Galaxy Selecta'). We showed that bacterial richness, diversity and composition differ among tissue types, with shoots before bloom harboring a higher diversity than ovary and pollen. Source tracking revealed that both sexual (30.3%) and asexual (23.8%) pathways contributed to seed microbiome assembly, with shoots at seed maturity being the dominant source. Notably, a large proportion (49.5%) of the seed microbiome originated from unknown sources. Lastly, the transmission pathways significantly differed among bacterial genera, with Pseudomonas primarily linked to shoots, Rhizobacter to pollen and Burkholderia to the ovary. Insights into seed microbiome origin offers new opportunities to enhance seed health and crop productivity through microbiome-assisted breeding."
"The global carbon cycle depends heavily on the carbon sequestration rates of aquatic ecosystems. Sinking of phytoplankton is a rapid mediator of carbon sequestration, because phytoplankton are globally abundant photoautotrophs that grow rapidly. Pico- and nano phytoplankton sinking velocities vary depending on their growth state, viability, clumping, and distribution in the water column. We introduced high throughput fluorescence microscopy of well-plates, to measure sinking velocities of three diatom strains, and three cyanobacteria strains, with cell radii spanning an order of magnitude, all grown under three different light levels. Cultures were measured for sinking velocities repeatedly across their growth trajectories. Tracking multiple fluorescence wavebands allowed us to simultaneously determine sinking velocities for living vs. dead cells. Sinking velocities varied strongly across growth light levels, and across growth stages. These monoclonal cultures furthermore show distinct sub-populations of slow- and fast-sinking cells. Our results departed widely from simple Stokes Law estimates of sinking based upon radii and mass density of cells. Complex, heterogeneous phytoplankton communities likely show more complicated sinking patterns than are currently expressed in biogeochemical ocean models. Our well-plate microscopy approach using parallel imaging of many samples generates high-throughput measures of cell sinking at population- or community-scales, to in turn improve modelling of carbon export to deeper layers."
"Genetic analyses of natural selection within and between populations have increasingly developed along separate paths. The two important genres of evolutionary biology (i.e. phylogenetics and population genetics) borne from the split can only benefit from research that seeks to bridge the gap. Simulation algorithms that combine fundamental concepts from both genres are important to achieve such unifying objective. We introduce scoup, a codon sequence simulator that is implemented in R and hosted on the Bioconductor platform. There is hardly any other simulator dedicated to genetic sequence generation for natural selection analyses on the platform. Concepts from the Halpern-Bruno mutation-selection model and the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) evolutionary algorithm were creatively fused such that the end-product is a novelty with respect to computational genetic simulation. Users are able to seamlessly adjust the model parameters to mimic complex evolutionary procedures that may have been otherwise infeasible. For example, it is possible to explicitly interrogate the concepts of static and changing fitness landscapes with regards to Darwinian natural selection in the context of codon sequences from multiple populations. scoup is published for free public use under the GPL-2 license. It is available for download from the Bioconductor platform (doi.org/10.18129/B9.bioc.scoup), along with detailed help and example files."
"Global warming and rising sea temperatures are pushing many reef-building coral species towards extinction. As thermal tolerance in corals is partially heritable, identifying genes under thermal selection is critical for targeted biodiversity management. However, it remains unclear how large breaks in connectivity (>100 km of open sea) affect the spread of adaptive alleles for different coral species in discontinuous reef networks such as the West Indian Ocean (WIO). To address this, we applied a seascape genomics approach to model (i) population connectivity and (ii) thermal adaptive potentials for two keystone coral species, Acropora muricata and Pocillopora damicornis, across the WIO. For both species, corals from the Seychelles were predominantly genetically isolated from corals in Rodrigues and Mauritius, putatively an effect of regional oceanographic barriers. Furthermore, sea currents during reproductive periods better predicted genetic connectivity than did Euclidean distances for both species, highlighting that connectivity models can serve as proxies to understand dispersal potential depending on reproductive strategies. Spatial patterns of neutral genetic variation were best explained by sea surface temperature variability and mean degree heating weeks. When used in genotype-environment association (GEA) analyses, we identified hundreds of loci under putative thermal selection from linked to known heat stress responses. In A. muricata, five Sacsin genes-co-chaperones of the Hsp70 heat-shock protein involved in thermal stress response-were identified, alongside genes related to immune defence, antioxidant response, signalling, and protein folding. In contrast, only the centromere protein V, involved in mitosis, was enriched in P. damicornis. By integrating patterns of gene flow with molecular adaptations to estimate species-specific adaptive potentials, we found that large sea distances and strong oceanographic barriers inhibit the genetic exchange of adapted genotypes across the WIO, providing valuable insights to guide local and regional biodiversity management in this region."
"In response to the emerging threat of insecticide resistance in malaria vectors, insecticides are being repurposed for vector control or developed de novo. Good stewardship of these finite new resources is essential if disease control programmes are to remain effective. This is dependent on timely data to help guide evidence-based decision-making for National Malaria Control programmes (NMCPs). By embedding genomics into cluster randomized control trials (cRCTs), we can perform surveillance and early detection of insecticide resistance variants to new and repurposed chemicals in natural field conditions, supporting effective stewardship. The LLIN Evaluation Uganda Project (LLINEUP) trial evaluated the efficacy of pyrethroid-piperonyl butoxide (PBO) and pyrethroids-only long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs). It was conducted in Uganda between 2017-2020 and was the largest cRCT to date, covering 40% of the country in 104 health sub-districts. We embedded genomic surveillance within LLINEUP to detect and track insecticide resistance variants. At baseline and throughout the trial, we sampled Anopheles mosquitoes with Prokopack aspirators and performed Illumina whole-genome sequencing. We show that An. funestus populations were relatively unaffected by the interventions, compared to An. gambiae s.l., which were markedly reduced six months following LLIN deployment. Standard approaches for describing genetic diversity and population structure e.g. fixation index (FST), Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Neighbour-Joining (NJ) trees, were consistent with the density observations and suggestive of a single large An. funestus population in Uganda with little genetic differentiation. Genome-wide selection scans revealed strong signals of selection at the Resistance to pyrethroid-1 (RP1) locus and Cyp9k1, both loci previously implicated in pyrethroid resistance. We report two additional loci, eye diacylglycerol kinase (Dgk) ({cong} 13.5Mb on the X chromosome) and O-mannosyl-transferase (TMC-like) ({cong} 67.9Mb on 3RL) that showed signals of selection. Known DDT and permethrin resistance-associated variants at the Gste2 locus, L119F and L119V, were also identified. Over the trial period, changes in haplotype frequencies were observed in regions under selection, with more pronounced shifts in the PBO arm. Notably, there were significant reductions in the frequencies of swept haplotypes (measured by delta ({Delta}) H12) in the Dgk and Cyp6p9a regions, while significant increases in haplotype frequency were observed at Gste2 and Cyp9k1 loci. Our findings reveal the differential impact of the trial on An. gambiae s.l. and An. funestus densities and the differing responses of An. funestus populations to pyrethroid and pyrethroid-PBO selection pressure. These insights underscore the potential value of tailored, species- and region-specific vector control strategies, supported by regional genetic surveillance, to better control insecticide resistance evolution and spread. By embedding genomic surveillance in cRCTs we can facilitate the discovery of putative resistance variants and can provide evidence of their impact on vector control tool efficacy; both of crucial importance to evidence-based deployment of vector control tools by NMCPs."
"Efficient access to soluble recombinant proteins remains a major bottleneck in biochemical and structural studies. We describe a buffer centric, fully miniaturized, 96-well plate workflow to map protein solubility across a large number of conditions in a single working day. Liquid-nitrogen-frozen E. coli pellets are cryogenically bead-milled with stainless-steel beads at sub-zero temperature, retaining the native intracellular milieu while ensuring uniform disruption. The resulting dry powder can therefore be extracted with any buffer of choice, enabling systematic exploration of pH, ionic strength, detergents, and chaotropes. Protein solubility is quantified by a one-microliter chemiluminescent anti-His dot-blot. Using a His-Ruby2 reporter panel, we show that dot-blot intensity can be used as a quantitative proxy of protein solubility. We also provide experimentally supported guidelines on the influence of those buffer reagents on subsequent steps of protein production, SDS-PAGE and Ni-NTA purification. This workflow is compatible with upstream genetic solubility-enhancement strategies, and enables direct transition to scale-up, the same day that soluble hits are identified. Because the entire workflow uses standard molecular-biology equipment and inexpensive consumables, it can be readily adopted or automated in any laboratory."
"We present a novel framework for chemical learning based on Competitive Dimerization Networks (CDNs) - systems in which multiple molecular species, e.g. proteins or DNA/RNA oligomers, reversibly bind to form dimers. We show that these networks can be trained in vitro through directed evolution, enabling the implementation of complex learning tasks such as multiclass classification without digital hardware or explicit parameter tuning. Each molecular species functions analogously to a neuron, with binding affinities acting as tunable synaptic weights. A training protocol involving mutation, selection, and amplification of DNA-based components allows CDNs to robustly discriminate among noisy input patterns. The resulting classifiers exhibit strong output contrast and high mutual information between input and output, especially when guided by a contrast-enhancing loss function. Comparative analysis with in silico gradient descent training reveals closely correlated performance. These results establish CDNs as a promising platform for analog physical computation, bridging synthetic biology and machine learning, and advancing the development of adaptive, energy-efficient molecular computing systems."
"The HK97-fold is a conserved three-dimensional protein structure specialized in forming protein shells. It is the primary building block of capsids that protect the genome of viruses in the Duplodnaviria realm, infecting organisms across all domains of life. It is also the primary building block of encapsulins, compartments that confine biochemical reactions in prokaryotes. Recent genomic studies have hypothesized that encapsulins evolved from HK97-fold viruses. However, this evolutionary pathway is challenging to justify biophysically because HK97-fold viruses form larger and more complex protein shells than encapsulins. We addressed this paradox by searching for smaller and simpler HK97-fold viral entities in metagenomes across ecosystems. The investigation yielded a well-defined group of viral entities, which encode HK97-fold proteins displaying significant molecular similarities with encapsulins and lacking tail genes. The structural phylogenetic analysis of HK97-fold entities revealed likely bidirectional evolutionary transitions between encapsulins and HK97-fold viruses. A potential evolutionary mechanism responsible for such transitions was identified based on the presence of lysogeny-associated genes in the viral entities and the structural and molecular parallels between encapsulins and procapsids, the immature state of viral capsids before genome packaging. Structural comparisons indicated that procapsids are akin to the common HK97-fold protein shell ancestor and might still facilitate transitions between modern viruses and encapsulins. This also implies that viral procapsids may retain the ability to carry out biochemical reactions during infections or when released in the environment, which, if confirmed, would require a fundamental revision of the role of viral capsids in the biosphere."
"Submarines pose significant physiological and behavioral challenges due to their dimly lit, isolated, confined, and extreme (DICE) environment, which deprives individuals from exposure to a natural light-dark cycle and limits opportunities for physical activity. In this study, we developed a minimal yet robust exploratory feature-screening approach to identify candidate actigraphy markers of split shift work during a three-week military submarine mission. Actigraphy data was collected across the pre-mission, mission and post-mission periods. During the mission, crew members followed a 6-hours-on/6-hours-off split shift schedule, except for submariners with on-call duty or extended hours. Forty-one actigraphy features were screened for their ability to differentiate between study periods and shifts. A Monte Carlo permutation test was used for this initial screening, followed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis for pairwise comparisons. Light-related features, the slopes of regression lines fitted to the daily predicted dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) trajectories, and Pearson correlation coefficients between each recording day and its corresponding predicted DLMO demonstrated the greatest potential to distinguish between study periods. Among shifts, most high-performing features discriminated between split shift work schedules and on-call or extended-hours schedules. Only the relative amplitude (RA) and the average light intensity during the five least-illuminated hours of the day (L5) reliably distinguished between the shift performing the bulk of nighttime work and its counterpart. Given its robustness under conditions of low activity and light exposure, our methodology may be applicable to other operational or clinical populations with reduced activity levels, such as individuals with depression or dementia."
"Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is essential for lipid homeostasis and has been extensively studied in the central nervous system, particularly in the context of Alzheimers disease (AD). Individuals carrying an APOE4 allele have an increased risk of AD and exhibit deficits in energy metabolism, including glucose utilization and mitochondrial dysfunction. While the role of APOE in the liver is well characterized, the impact of APOE genetic variation on hepatic health and metabolism remains poorly understood. We sought to investigate this using young female and male APOE3 and APOE4 targeted replacement mice. We also used APOE isogenic induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived hepatocyte-like cells (iHLCs) to examine specific effects in a human-relevant cell model. Proteomic and functional assays show that APOE4 causes extensive changes to liver mitochondrial function in a sex-specific manner in mice and alters glucose and lipid metabolism. APOE4 also impairs mitochondrial function in iHLCs and shifts metabolism towards glycolysis while modifying expression of extracellular matrix proteins. Additionally, APOE4 iHLCs display a greater reliance on fatty acids as an energy source and show increased lipid accumulation. Taken together, our findings show that APOE genetic variation causes mitochondrial dysfunction and rewires hepatic metabolism."
"In the face of accelerating biodiversity loss, phylogenetically informed approaches offer critical insights for conservation planning from an evolutionary perspective. The EDGE (Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered) metric combines phylogenetic singularity with extinction risk to identify taxa that represent irreplaceable evolutionary history under threat. In this study, we focus on the global conservation relevance of angiosperms native to a regional biodiversity hotspot, the Iberian Peninsula. Our aim was to identify areas with a high concentration of EDGE species and to evaluate how effectively the current protected area network encompasses them. Our findings reveal that threatened evolutionary history is primarily concentrated in mountainous and coastal regions. While several EDGE zones -areas containing unique and jeopardized evolutionary lineages- overlap with existing protected areas, particularly in mountains, others harbouring few but evolutionarily unique and highly threatened taxa remain largely unprotected. This study highlights the value of applying global conservation metrics such as EDGE at regional scales. Our results provide a foundation for integrating evolutionary history into conservation prioritization in the Iberian Peninsula and offer a replicable framework for implementing the EDGE approach in other biodiversity-rich regions."
"Understanding the genetic basis of complex traits remains a key challenge in crop improvement. This study aimed to develop a structured, multi-parental mapping population to enhance the resolution of quantitative trait dissection, based on the hypothesis that a Nested Association Mapping (NAM) design would enable the detection of minor-effect loci often overlooked by traditional biparental or diversity panel-based approaches. A lentil (Lens culinaris Medik.) NAM population was developed by crossing the Canadian cultivar CDC Redberry with 32 diverse genotypes sourced globally from three major lentil-growing macro-environments: Northern temperate, Mediterranean, and South Asia. The resulting recombinant inbred lines were phenotyped for key phenological traits, days to emergence (DTE), flowering (DTF), and maturity (DTM), under field conditions, and genotyped using exome capture sequencing. Genome-wide association studies for DTF identified 14 significant loci across six chromosomes, including the known FTb locus and novel associations near AP3a, HUB2a, and PIF6 genes. These results demonstrate the utility of the NAM design in detecting both major and minor-effect loci that underlie complex trait variation. To our knowledge, this is the first publicly available NAM population in lentil. It provides a high-resolution, globally representative platform for trait discovery, pre-breeding, and collaborative genetic improvement of this nutritionally and agronomically important legume."
"Introduction: Cellular senescence is associated with altered lipid metabolism, including increased cellular lipid uptake, upregulated lipid biosynthesis, and deregulated lipid breakdown. Previous studies have reported that carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT), the rate-limiting enzyme in fatty acid oxidation that catalyzes the conversion of acyl-CoA to acylcarnitine, is involved in various senescence-related diseases. Although solar lentigo (SL) is an age-related pigmentary disorder characterized by the accumulation of senescent cells, its role in metabolic dysregulation has rarely been investigated. Methods and Results: Integrated transcriptomic profiling of SL skin samples, combining mRNA sequencing, differential gene expression, pathway enrichment analyses, metabolic flux simulations, and protein-protein interaction analysis, was conducted to demonstrate the molecular alterations in SL compared to perilesional normal skin. We found transcriptomic alterations in mitochondrial energy metabolism-associated genes. Metabolic flux simulations revealed that carnitine-associated reactions involved in fatty acid oxidation were upregulated. Using a multi-omics approach, CPT1B was selected as a potential marker for SL, which was confirmed via its overexpression in immunohistochemical studies. Using a zebrafish model, CPT1B was implicated in melanogenesis. Discussion: CPT1B-mediated metabolic alteration is a key driver of SL pathogenesis. Targeting CPT1B and the associated lipid metabolism pathways is a novel therapeutic approach for managing SL and age-related pigmentation disorders."
"The use of 16S rRNA metabarcoding for functional prediction is limited by several biases. Shallow shotgun sequencing is a cost-effective and taxonomically high-resolution alternative to 16S rRNA metabarcoding, but the low sequencing depth limits functional inference. Our BioSIFTR tool maps shallow shotgun sequencing reads against single-biome databases and extrapolates into their precalculated functional profiles. We used three datasets from red junglefowl, mice, and human gut, containing matched deep shotgun metagenomic and 16S rRNA metabarcoding data for taxonomic and functional benchmarking. An additional human gut deep shotgun sequencing data set was subsampled to 1 M reads and analysed with BioSIFTR to replicate previously obtained results. BioSIFTR taxonomic and functional profiles closely agree with the results of the full deep sequencing data in all biomes. We also replicated differences in the human gut microbiome between high and low trimethylamine N-oxide producing participants, using only < 2 % of the original deep sequencing data. The BioSIFTR tool is a powerful approach which approximates the functional information of a deep-sequenced metagenome while using only a fraction of the data. Shallow shotgun sequencing combined with BioSIFTR could be a stand-in replacement for 16S rRNA metabarcoding with an increased taxonomic and functional resolution, and lower bias."
"The von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL) is a component of a ubiquitin ligase complex that normally controls cellular responses to hypoxia. Endogenous VHL is also utilized by proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) protein degraders, a promising class of anti-cancer agents. VHL is broadly essential for cell proliferation, yet it is a key tumor suppressor in renal cell carcinoma. To understand the functional consequences of VHL loss, and to identify targeted approaches for the elimination of VHL null cells, we have used genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screening in human renal epithelial cells. We find that, upon VHL loss, the HIF1A/ARNT complex is the central inhibitor of cellular fitness, suppressing mitochondrial respiration, and that VHL null cells show HIF1A-dependent molecular vulnerabilities that can be targeted pharmacologically. Combined VHL/HIF1A inactivation in breast and esophageal cancer cells can also provide resistance to ARV-771, a VHL-based bromodomain degrader that has anti-cancer activity. HIF1A stabilization can thus provide opportunities for early intervention in neoplastic VHL clones, and the VHL-HIF1A axis may be relevant for the development of resistance to the emerging class of PROTAC-based cancer therapies."
"Processing bodies (P-bodies) are dynamic, membraneless organelles that mediate mRNA storage, translational repression, and decay. While the roles of individual P-body proteins in transcript recruitment are well characterized, how the emergent biophysical properties of P-bodies contribute to selective mRNA regulation remains poorly understood. Here, we identify the RNA-binding protein Trailer Hitch (Tral) as a key regulator of P-body composition and physical state during Drosophila melanogaster oogenesis. Loss of Tral disrupts P-body structure, leading to elevated levels of Cup and reduced levels of Me31B. This compositional shift is driven by degradation of twinstar mRNA, which encodes an actin regulator, resulting in reduced nuclear actin levels and altered transcription of P-body components. Using super-resolution microscopy, RNAi-mediated knockdowns, and chemical treatments, we show that Tral is also essential for transcript-specific mRNA partitioning into P-bodies. We find that in Tral-depleted egg chambers, twinstar mRNA exhibits reduced and mislocalized P-body association, bicoid mRNA dissociates from P-bodies and is degraded, and nanos mRNA remains stably localized. This suggests that selective mRNA retention within P-bodies is governed by a network of molecular interactions, including electrostatic forces, hydrophobic contacts, and direct protein:RNA binding, which are tuned by Tral. Together, our findings position Tral as a central coordinator of P-body autoregulation, integrating transcript stability, nuclear actin dynamics, and condensate organization to govern selective mRNA partitioning."
"Secretory proteins are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and begin their transport from specialized domains on the ER called ER exit sites (ERES). We previously demonstrated that the interaction between TANGO1 and Sec16 is critical for ERES formation. In this study, we reveal that the phosphorylation of TANGO1 and Sec16 is regulated by a FAM83A/CK1-mediated negative feedback loop. Conversely, their dephosphorylation is regulated in a spatially distinct manner by different phosphatase complexes: PPP6R3/PPP6C for Sec16 and PPP1R15B/PPP1C for TANGO1. Excessive phosphorylation of either TANGO1 or Sec16 leads to ERES disassembly, while excessive dephosphorylation impairs secretion. Our findings demonstrate that maintaining a balanced phosphorylation state of TANGO1 and Sec16 through autoregulation by FAM83A/CK1 and the phosphatases PP1 and PP6 is essential for sustaining proper secretory activity at the ERES."
"The ubiquitin specific protease (USP) enzyme USP9X is amongst the best studied human deubiquitinases (DUBs), with a myriad of described targets and cellular roles. In cancer, USP9X has been touted as both an oncogene and a tumour suppressor in different contexts, which has confounded the field and questioned its viability as a cancer target. We here describe WEHI-092, a novel piperazine-based USP9X specific small molecule inhibitor and map its binding site to a unique region in the USP9X fingers subdomain, distinct from known DUB inhibitor binding sites. Using proteomics and ubiquitinomics, we show that USP9X has a distinct set of substrates compared to USP7 indicating remarkable DUB target specificity, yet the substrate profile of USP9X varies significantly across cancer cell lines. Interestingly, we reveal a core set of 17 proteins commonly regulated by USP9X in most or all cell lines, which we consider as proximal biomarkers for USP9X inhibition. Consistent with our proteomic analyses, we show that WEHI-092 treatment arrests cells in metaphase without inducing cell death, which may account for growth suppression seen in long-term clonogenic assays in most cancer cell lines, and positions USP9X inhibitors as a new potential class of selective mitotic poisons."
"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a tumor predisposition syndrome caused by loss of function of the neurofibromin protein. Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are a rare and deadly sarcoma with few therapeutic options that are the leading cause of death for patients with NF1. To date, no targeted therapies have been approved for MPNST treatment, highlighting the need for an understanding of adaptive signaling mechanisms that drive resistance. We developed a preclinical model of drug resistance using a cross-over drug holiday design, and evaluated patterns of response and resistance to MEK and AKT inhibitors, two pathways that are dysregulated after loss of neurofibromin. We show that the mTOR and YAP/TEAD pathways are activated by MEK inhibitor exposure, yet blockade of these pathways in resistant MPNST PDX models does not significantly reduce tumor growth, despite strong in vitro synergy between trametinib and the novel TEAD inhibitor, GNE-7883. Using spatial transcriptomics, we uncovered phenotypic inertia as a key mechanism of drug resistance in MPNST, in addition to signaling plasticity. Further, we found that resistance is mediated by sustained ERK, YAP, and MYC driven transcriptional programs. In the future, preclinical studies should focus on addressing intratumoral heterogeneity and how it evolves over time."
"Motivation: In recent years, computational methods have emerged that calculate enrichment of gene signatures within individual samples, rather than across pooled samples. These signatures offer critical insights into the coordinated activity of functionally related genes, proteins or metabolites, enabling identification of unique molecular profiles based on gene set and pathway activity in individual cells and patients. This strategy is pivotal for patient stratification and advancement of personalized medicine. However, the rise of large-scale datasets, including single-cell profiles and population biobanks, has exposed significant computational inefficiencies in existing methods. Current methods often demand excessive runtime and memory resources, becoming impractical for large datasets. Overcoming these limitations is a focus of current efforts by bioinformatics teams in academia and the pharmaceutical industry, as essential to support basic and clinical biomedical research. Results: To address this critical need, we developed PLAID (Pathway Level Average Intensity Detection), an ultrafast and memory optimized single sample gene set enrichment algorithm that utilizes sparse matrix computation. PLAID delivers highly accurate gene set scoring and surpasses the performance of current methods in single-cell and bulk transcriptomics, and proteomics data. A distinctive feature of PLAID is its integration of the most widely used gene set scoring algorithms, enabling researchers to apply multiple methods for cross-validation with outstanding runtime efficiency and minimal memory requirement. Availability and Implementation: PLAID is implemented in the R language for statistical computing. PLAID source code and installation instructions are available with no restrictions at https://github.com/bigomics/plaid"
"In bioinformatics, Sankey diagrams have been widely used to elucidate complex biological insights by visualizing gene expression patterns, microbial community dynamics, and cellular interactions. However, computational scalability remains a challenge for large-scale biological networks. In this work, we present OmicsSankey, a novel formulation of the layout optimization problem for Sankey Diagrams that employs eigen decomposition as a closed-form solution, addressing graph disconnection through a teleportation mechanism that enhances connectivity and stabilizes eigenvector solutions. Experimental results on synthetic datasets with varying layers and nodes validate the efficacy of OmicsSankey compared to state-of-the-art layout-optimizers. Improving the Sankey layouts for Cell Layers, BioSankey, and Sequence Flow further validates OmicsSankey in enhancing the interpretability of biological insights."
"Drug repurposing accelerates drug discovery by identifying new therapeutic uses for existing drugs, but validating computational predictions remains a challenge. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a potential solution by analyzing biomedical literature to assess drug-disease associations. This study evaluates four LLMs (GPT-4o, Claude-3, Gemini-2, and DeepSeek) using ten prompt strategies to validate repurposing hypotheses. The best-performing prompts and models were tested on 30 pathway-based cases and 10 benchmark cases. Results show that structured prompts enhance LLM accuracy, with GPT-4o and DeepSeek emerging as the most reliable models. Benchmark cases achieved significantly higher accuracy, precision, and F1-score (p < 0.001), while recall remained consistent across datasets. These findings highlight LLMs' potential in drug repurposing validation while emphasizing the need for structured prompts and human oversight."
"Musification, the process of converting data into music, has found applications in scientific research as a novel medium for data representation and communication. However, in biology, its application has largely been limited to DNA and protein sequences or structural data. Existing approaches that attempt to musify gene expression data often do so at the level of the entire gene set or its low-dimensional representations, lacking finer biological context. In our work, we bridge this gap by representing time-series gene expression data through clusters of genes that exhibit similar expression patterns across time points. We then embed contextual biological information onto these clusters to create layered sonifications: a foreground layer capturing expression dynamics across time points through pitch variations, and a background layer reflecting biologically meaningful context, such as Gene Ontology-derived semantic similarity, conveyed through smoothed audio modulated by intensity and echo effects. This musification approach offers an alternative way to analyze traditional visualizations like gene expression heatmaps and dendrograms, providing auditory insight into both temporal and functional trends. Preliminary user survey results indicate that 72.5% of participants were able to correctly interpret gene expression patterns from the foreground melody, and 88.9% perceived differences in background layers, highlighting the effectiveness of the layered musical representation in conveying biologically relevant information. This two-layered design is broadly applicable and can be extended to other forms of musification, allowing different types of information to be conveyed simultaneously through distinct musical components."
"Accurate prediction of drug-target interactions (DTIs) is crucial for computational drug discovery. Although pretrained language models offer richer molecular and protein representations, their increasing complexity does not always lead to better predictive performance. In many cases, the inclusion of redundant or irrelevant features may obscure biologically relevant patterns. In this study, we systematically evaluate the contribution of complex features in DTI prediction and demonstrate that only a portion of these features is truly informative. Based on this insight, we propose a Vector Quantization (VQ)-based module that functions as a plug-and-play feature selection layer within deep learning architectures. When combined with a simple fully connected classifier, this supervised VQ (SVQ) framework not only surpasses recent state-of-the-art DTI methods in performance, but also enhances interpretability through the learning of discriminative codewords. This work highlights the importance of input feature selection in deep learning and offers a new perspective for constructing robust and interpretable DTI prediction models."
"Neonatal self-scratching, often considered a harmless mechanical reflex, may play a more influential role in shaping early immune system development than previously recognized. We hypothesize that superficial cutaneous microtrauma caused by healthy newborn scratching may contribute to immune imprinting through localized inflammatory responses and antigen exposure. We developed a time-resolved stochastic model to simulate antigen encounter, microbial presence and antigen capture dynamics in the context of superficial skin injury, to evaluate the likelihood of immune activation resulting from epidermal disruption. By varying parameters such as injury depth, microbial density and antigen presentation probability, we quantified their respective impacts on cumulative immune priming outcomes across simulated conditions. Simulations show that even shallow skin injuries, when combined with microbial ingress and effective antigen presentation, can exceed activation thresholds necessary for initiating early immune priming. Results indicate that a cascade of innate immune events, including keratinocyte activation, cytokine release and engagement of antigen-presenting cells, could be initiated by the minor skin abrasions commonly observed during neonatal scratching. This model supports a plausible mechanism through which seemingly minor mechanical injuries may contribute to early immune training. By treating the skin not merely as a passive barrier but as an active immunological interface, our approach recontextualizes common neonatal behaviours within a meaningful immunological framework. If validated, our hypothesis suggests that controlled microtrauma or targeted skin exposure in newborns could serve as a strategy to support immune development in a safe manner. Still, population-level modeling may allow translation from individual simulations to public health insights."
"Enzymes present a sustainable alternative to traditional chemical industries, drug synthesis, and bioremediation applications. Because catalytic residues are the key amino acids that drive enzyme function, their accurate prediction facilitates enzyme function prediction. Sequence similarity-based approaches such as BLAST are fast but require previously annotated homologs. Machine learning approaches aim to overcome this limitation; however, current gold-standard machine learning (ML)-based methods require high-quality 3D structures limiting their application to large datasets. To address these challenges, we developed Squidly, a sequence-only tool that leverages contrastive representation learning with a biology-informed, rationally designed pairing scheme to distinguish catalytic from non-catalytic residues using per-token Protein Language Model embeddings. Squidly surpasses state-of-the-art ML annotation methods in catalytic residue prediction while remaining sufficiently fast to enable wide-scale screening of databases. We ensemble Squidly with BLAST to provide an efficient tool that annotates catalytic residues with high precision and recall for both in- and out-of-distribution sequences."
"Cyclic immunofluorescence (IF) techniques enable deep phenotyping of cells and help quantify tissue organization at high resolution. Due to its high dimensionality, workflows typically rely on unsupervised clustering, followed by cell type annotation at a cluster level for cell type assignment. Most of these methods use marker expression averages that lack a statistical evaluation of cell type annotations, which can result in misclassification. Here, we propose a strategy through an end-to-end pipeline using a semi-supervised, random forests approach to predict cell type annotations. Our method includes cluster-based sampling for training data, cell type prediction, and downstream visualization for interpretability of cell annotation that ultimately improves classification results. We show that our workflow can annotate cells more accurately with a training set <5% of the total number of cells tested. In addition, our pipeline outputs cell type annotation probabilities and model performance metrics for users to decide if it could boost their existing clustering-based workflow results for complex IF data."
"Approved by the FDA in 2006, varenicline became the first nicotinic-based therapeutic for smoking cessation and has since been used by tens of millions of smokers worldwide. Varenicline works by targeting the 4{beta}2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), the primary focus for nicotine addiction, where ligand recognition by the receptor triggers ion channel opening. While widely recognized that varenicline\'s development was rooted in the well-established pharmacology of cytisine, the two compounds display notably different profiles, not only at nAChRs, but also at key off-target sites such as the 5-HT3 serotonin receptor. Despite varenicline\'s widespread use and proven efficacy as a smoking cessation aid, our knowledge of the precise molecular mechanism underlying its action, particularly the specific receptor-ligand interactions that underpin its functional specificity, remains incomplete. Through a multidisciplinary approach that integrates complementary fields of research, this study reveals the critical receptor-ligand interactions that distinguish varenicline from related nAChR agonists, such as cytisine and nicotine. Our findings reveal previously unrecognized, critical hydrogen bonding interactions within the 4{beta}2 binding sites, specifically involving 4T139, 4T183, and {beta}2S133, that are uniquely and selectively engaged by varenicline. Of these, {beta}2S133 emerged as the pivotal determinant of varenicline\'s function, with substitution by valine significantly impairing the ligand efficacy. Furthermore, the design and synthesis of novel varenicline analogues shed new light into the functional importance of the ligand\'s quinoxaline moiety, revealing that not just the presence but also the precise positioning of this hydrogen bond acceptor are critical for receptor activation by varenicline. Together, these findings uncover a previously uncharacterized interaction network essential for varenicline\'s function at 4{beta}2, offering a deeper and more comprehensive framework for understanding its distinct pharmacological profile while expanding our broader understanding of how ligand binding is translated into function in these receptors."
